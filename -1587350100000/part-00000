There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category consists of armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed the first rapid communication between continents.   Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance. All the known effects of electricity\u2014such as [[electric spark|sparks]], [[electrostatic attraction]], [[chemical change]]s, [[electric shock]]s, and later [[electromagnetism]]\u2014were applied to the problems of detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances.<ref>{{Citation |last= Fahie |first= J.

Spon |year= 1884 |url= https://www.princeton.edu/ssp/joseph-henry-project/telegraph/A_history_of_electric_telegraphy_to_the.pdf}}</ref>\n\t\nIn 1753, an anonymous writer in the ''[[Scots Magazine]]'' suggested an electrostatic telegraph. Using one wire for each letter of the alphabet, a message could be transmitted by connecting the wire terminals in turn to an electrostatic machine, and observing the deflection of [[pith]] balls at the far end.<ref>E. A. Marland, ''Early Electrical Communication'', Abelard-Schuman Ltd, London 1964, no ISBN, Library of Congress 64-20875, pages 17-19;</ref> The writer has never been positively identified, but the letter was signed C.M. and posted from [[Renfrew]] leading to a Charles Marshall of Renfrew being suggested.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, p. 203</ref> Telegraphs employing electrostatic attraction were the basis of early experiments in electrical telegraphy in Europe, but were abandoned as being impractical and were never developed into a useful communication system.<ref>{{Citation | title = Electromagnetic Telegraph - Invented by Baron Pavel Schilling | url = http://www.edubilla.com/invention/electrical-telegraph/ }}</ref>\n\nIn 1774, [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] realised an early electric telegraph. The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus. He reduced the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals; finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university were too poor to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1938, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]].

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

With different codes, additional operators were required to translate and retransmit the message.

The US, however, continued to use [[American Morse code]] internally for some time, hence international messages required retransmission in both directions.<ref>Andrew L.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.  In that year the Foy-Breguet system was replaced with the Morse system.<ref>Holzmann & Pehrson, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nAs well as the rapid expansion of the use of the telegraphs along the railways, they soon spread into the field of mass communication with the instruments being installed in [[post office]]s.

Proce Wellcome V0025510.jpg|thumb|left|Wheatstone automated telegraph network equipment]]\nA continuing goal in telegraphy was to reduce the cost per message by reducing hand-work, or increasing the sending rate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} There were many experiments with moving pointers, and various electrical encodings. However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications. Mercer University Press, 1992. 67</ref>\n\n[[Royal Earl House]] developed and patented a letter-printing telegraph system in 1846 which employed an alphabetic keyboard for the transmitter and automatically printed the letters on paper at the receiver,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/14/letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-4464/|title=Royal Earl House Printing-Telegraph Patent #4464, 1846|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> and followed this up with a steam-powered version in 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.gatunka.com/2014/04/15/steam-powered-letter-printing-telegraph-us-patent-9505/|title=Royal Earl House Steam-Powered Printing-Telegraph Patent #9505, 1852|accessdate=2014-04-25}}</ref> Advocates of printing telegraphy said it would eliminate Morse operators' errors.

The system allowed for automatic recording on the receiving end. The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. It was tried on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 1849, [[C.V. Walker]], electrician to the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]], submerged a two-mile wire coated with gutta-percha off the coast from Folkestone, which was tested successfully.<ref name=Haigh26/>\n\n[[John Watkins Brett]], an engineer from [[Bristol]], sought and obtained permission from [[Louis-Philippe]] in 1847 to establish [[telegraph|telegraphic communication]] between France and England. The first undersea cable was laid in 1850, connecting the two countries and was followed by connections to Ireland and the Low Countries.\n\nThe [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. It was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], captained by [[Sir James Anderson]] after many mishaps along the away.<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

The 1857 cable only operated intermittently for a few days or weeks before it failed. The study of underwater telegraph cables accelerated interest in mathematical analysis of very long [[transmission line]]s. The telegraph lines from Britain to India were connected in 1870 (those several companies combined to form the ''Eastern Telegraph Company'' in 1872).\n\nAustralia was first linked to the rest of the world in October 1872 by a submarine telegraph cable at Darwin.<ref>Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter: \"A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet\", p110.

In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, the news reached [[London]] in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the government and led to Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister.{{sfn|Figes|2010|pp=304\u201311}}\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] the telegraph proved its value as a tactical, operational, and strategic communication medium and an important contributor to Union victory.<ref>{{Citation |last= Hochfelder |first= David |title= Essential Civil WAR Curriculum: The Telegraph |publisher= Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech |year= 2019 |url= https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-telegraph.html }}</ref> By contrast the Confederacy failed to make effective use of the South's much smaller telegraph network. Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of Government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the Government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of cable, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Even Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators didn't have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they didn't have to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} British access to transatlantic cables and its codebreaking expertise led to the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] incident that contributed to the US joining the war.<ref>{{cite news|title= The telegram that brought America into the First World War |url= http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/telegram-brought-america-first-world-war |work= BBC History Magazin e|date= 17 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[World War II]] revived the 'cable war' of 1914\u20131918.

The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: ''Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz'') that was used for enciphering telegrams between German High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics. Britain intercepted these signals, diagnosed how the encrypting machine worked, and [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|decrypted]] a large amount of teleprinter traffic.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|pp=1-6}}\n\n==End of the telegraph era==\n{{further|Telegraphy}}\nIn America, the end of the telegraph era can be associated with the fall of the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]]. Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.  AT&T bought Western Union's electronic mail and [[Telex]] businesses in 1990.\n\nAlthough commercial \"telegraph\" services are still available in [[Worldwide use of telegrams by country|many countries]], transmission is usually done by some form of [[data transmission]] other than traditional telegraphy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[92 Code]]\n* [[Aurora (astronomy)#Auroral events of historical significance|Aurora (astronomy)]]\n* [[Geomagnetically induced current]]\n* [[Great Northern Telegraph Company]]\n* [[Harrison Gray Dyar]], who supposedly erected the first telegraph line and dispatched the first telegram\n* [[Neutral direct-current telegraph system]]\n* [[Western Electric Company]]\n* [[Wireless telegraphy]]\n* [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T)\n* [[Bell Canada]]\n* [[Speedwell Ironworks]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Citation |last = Beauchamp |first = Ken |title = History Of Telegraphy |place = London |publisher = The Institution Of Electrical Engineers |year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-85296-792-8 }}\n*Bowers, Brian, ''Sir Charles Wheatstone: 1802\u20131875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0852961030}}.\n*{{Citation | last = Calvert | first = J.

There were many different electrical telegraph systems invented, but the ones that became widespread fit into two broad categories.  The first category consists of [[needle telegraph]]s in which a needle pointer is made to move electromagnetically with a pulse of [[electric current]] from a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[dynamo]] down the telegraph line.  Early systems used multiple needles requiring multiple wires.  The first commercial system, and the most widely used needle telegraph, was the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph]], invented in 1837.  Early equipment sets used five needles to point to the letter being transmitted, but the cost of installing wires was more economically significant than the cost of training operators so a single-needle system with a code that had to be learned became the norm.\n\nThe second category was armature systems in which the pulse activates a [[telegraph sounder]] which makes a click.  The archetype of this category was the Morse system, invented by [[Samuel Morse]] in 1838, using a single wire.  At the sending station, an operator would tap on a switch called a [[telegraph key]], spelling out text messages in [[Morse code]].  Originally, the armature was intended to make marks on paper tape, but operators learned to interpret the clicks and it was more efficient to write down the message directly.  In 1865, the Morse system became the standard for international communication with a modified code developed for German railways.  However, some countries continued to use established national systems internally for some time afterwards.\n\nIn the 1840s the electrical telegraph superseded [[optical telegraph]] systems (except in France), becoming the standard way to send urgent messages.  By the latter half of the century, most developed nations had created commercial telegraph networks with local [[telegraph office]]s in most cities and towns, allowing the public to send messages called [[telegram]]s addressed to any person in the country, for a fee.  Beginning in 1854 [[submarine telegraph cable]]s allowed the first rapid communication between continents.   Electrical telegraph networks permitted people and commerce to transmit messages across both continents and oceans almost instantly, with widespread social and economic impacts.<ref>{{Citation|last= Tancia |title= A History of Telegraphy |year= 2014 |url= https://www.pens.co.uk/pen2paper/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/A-History-of-Telegraphy.pdf }}</ref>  In the early 20th century the telegraph was slowly replaced by [[Teleprinter|teletype]] networks.\n\n== History ==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[List of basic communication topics]] -->\n\n===Early work===\n[[File:Soemmerring 1810 telegraph overview.jpg|thumb|S\u00f6mmering's electric telegraph in 1809]]\nFrom early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to [[communication]]s at a distance.

The telegraph had a separate wire for each of the 26 letters of the [[alphabet]] and its range was only between two rooms of his home.<ref>Prevost, 1805, pp. 176-178</ref>\n\nIn 1800, [[Alessandro Volta]] invented the [[voltaic pile]], allowing for a [[continuous current]] of [[electricity]] for experimentation. This became a source of a low-voltage current that could be used to produce more distinct effects, and which was far less limited than the momentary discharge of an [[electrostatic generator|electrostatic machine]], which with [[Leyden jar]]s were the only previously known man-made sources of electricity.\n\t \t\nAnother very early experiment in electrical telegraphy was an 'electrochemical telegraph' created by the [[Germans|German]] physician, anatomist and inventor [[Samuel Thomas von S\u00f6mmering]] in 1809, based on an earlier, less robust design of 1804 by Spanish [[polymath]] and scientist [[Francisco Salva Campillo]].{{sfn|Jones|1999}} Both their designs employed multiple wires (up to 35) to represent almost all Latin letters and numerals. Thus, messages could be conveyed electrically up to a few kilometers (in von S\u00f6mmering's design), with each of the telegraph receiver's wires immersed in a separate glass tube of acid. An electric current was sequentially applied by the sender through the various wires representing each letter of a message; at the recipient's end the currents electrolysed the acid in the tubes in sequence, releasing streams of hydrogen bubbles next to each associated letter or numeral. The telegraph receiver's operator would watch the bubbles and could then record the transmitted message.{{sfn|Jones|1999}} This is in contrast to later telegraphs that used a single wire (with ground return).\n\t \t\n[[Hans Christian \u00d8rsted]] discovered in 1820 that an electric current produces a magnetic field that will deflect a compass needle. In the same year [[Johann Schweigger]] invented the [[galvanometer]], with a coil of wire around a compass, which could be used as a sensitive indicator for an electric current.<ref>M.

The receiving instrument consisted of six [[galvanometer]]s with magnetic needles, suspended from [[silk]] [[Yarn|threads]]. Both stations of Schilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the [[galvanometer]]s, one served for the return current and one for a signal bell. When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions of black and white flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Schilling subsequently improved its apparatus. He reduced the number of connecting wires from eight to two.\n\t \t\nOn 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836, the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from [[Nicholas&nbsp;I of Russia]]. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]] and the naval base at [[Kronstadt]]. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837.{{sfn|Huurdeman|2003|p=54}} Schilling was also one of the first to put into practice the idea of the [[binary coding|binary]] system of signal transmission.\n\t\nIn 1833, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], together with the physics professor [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]] installed a {{convert|1200|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the [[Schweigger multiplier|Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator]] with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the [[galvanometer]]. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.\n\n[[File:Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G.png|thumb|left|Diagram of alphabet used in a 5 needle Cooke and Wheatstone Telegraph, indicating the letter G]]At first, Gauss and Weber used the telegraph to coordinate time, but soon they developed other signals; finally, their own alphabet. The alphabet was encoded in a binary code which was transmitted by positive or negative voltage pulses which were generated by means of moving an induction coil up and down over a permanent magnet and connecting the coil with the transmission wires by means of the commutator. The page of Gauss' laboratory notebook containing both his code and the first message transmitted, as well as a replica of the telegraph made in the 1850s under the instructions of Weber are kept in the faculty of physics at the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], in Germany.\n\nGauss was convinced that this communication would be a help to his kingdom's towns. Later in the same year, instead of a [[Voltaic pile]], Gauss used an [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] pulse, enabling him to transmit seven letters a minute instead of two. The inventors and university were too poor to develop the telegraph on their own, but they received funding from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. [[Carl August Steinheil]] in [[Munich]] was able to build a telegraph network within the city in 1835\u20131836. He installed a telegraph line along the first German railroad in 1835.  Steinheil built a telegraph along the [[Nuremberg - F\u00fcrth railway line]] in 1938, the first [[earth-return telegraph]] put into service.\n\nBy 1837, [[William Fothergill Cooke]] and [[Charles Wheatstone]] had co-developed a [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|telegraph system]] which used a number of needles on a board that could be moved to point to letters of the alphabet. Any number of needles could be used, depending on the number of characters it was required to code. In May 1837 they patented their system. The patent recommended five needles, which coded twenty of the alphabet's 26 letters.\n\n[[File:Wallace Study-Telegraph.jpg|thumb|Morse key and sounder]]\n[[Samuel Morse]] independently developed and patented a recording electric telegraph in 1837. Morse's assistant [[Alfred Vail]] developed an instrument that was called the register for recording the received messages. It embossed dots and dashes on a moving paper tape by a stylus which was operated by an electromagnet.{{sfn|Calvert|2008}} Morse and Vail developed the [[Morse code]] signalling [[alphabet]].

System, used mostly on private wires. This consisted of a \"communicator\" at the sending end and an \"indicator\" at the receiving end. The communicator consisted of a circular dial with a pointer and the 26 letters of the alphabet (and four punctuation marks) around its circumference. Against each letter was a key that could be pressed. A transmission would begin with the pointers on the dials at both ends set to the start position. The transmitting operator would then press down the key corresponding to the letter to be transmitted. In the base of the communicator was a [[magneto]] actuated by a handle on the front. This would be turned to apply an alternating voltage to the line. Each half cycle of the current would move the pointers at both ends on by one position. When the pointer reached the position of the depressed key, it would stop and the magneto would be disconnected from the line. The communicator's pointer was geared to the magneto mechanism. The indicator's pointer was moved by a polarised electromagnet whose [[Armature (electrical)|armature]] was coupled to it through an [[escapement]]. Thus the alternating line voltage moved the indicator's pointer on to the position of the depressed key on the communicator. Pressing another key would then release the pointer and the previous key, and re-connect the magneto to the line. These machines were very robust and simple to operate, and they stayed in use in Britain until well into the 20th century.<ref>{{Citation |last= Freebody |first= J.

They had an extensive [[optical telegraph]] system built during the [[Napoleonic era]].  There was also serious concern that an electrical telegraph could be quickly put out of action by enemy saboteurs, something that was much more difficult to do with optical telegraphs which had no exposed hardware between stations.  The [[Foy-Breguet telegraph]] was eventually adopted.  This was a two-needle system using two signal wires, but displayed in a uniquely different way to other needle telegraphs.  The needles made symbols similar to the Chappe optical system symbols, making it more familiar to the telegraph operators.  The optical system was decommissioned starting in 1846, but not completed until 1855.

However, most systems were too complicated and unreliable. A successful expedient to reduce the cost per message was the development of [[telegraphese]].\n\nThe first system that didn't require skilled technicians to operate, was Charles Wheatstone's ABC system in 1840 where the letters of the alphabet were arranged around a clock-face, and the signal caused a needle to indicate the letter. This early system required the receiver to be present in real time to record the message and it reached speeds of up to 15 words a minute.\n\nIn 1846, [[Alexander Bain (inventor)|Alexander Bain]] patented a chemical telegraph in Edinburgh. The signal current moved an iron pen across a moving paper tape soaked in a mixture of ammonium nitrate and potassium ferrocyanide, decomposing the chemical and producing readable blue marks in Morse code. The speed of the printing telegraph was 16 and a half words per minute, but messages still required translation into English by live copyists. Chemical telegraphy came to an end in the US in 1851, when the Morse group defeated the Bain patent in the US District Court.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications, Mercer University Press, 1992. 69.</ref>\n\nFor a brief period, starting with the New York\u2013Boston line in 1848, some telegraph networks began to employ sound operators, who were trained to understand Morse code aurally. Gradually, the use of sound operators eliminated the need for telegraph receivers to include register and tape. Instead, the receiving instrument was developed into a \"sounder\", an electromagnet that was energized by a current and attracted a small iron lever. When the sounding key was opened or closed, the sounder lever struck an anvil. The Morse operator distinguished a dot and a dash by the short or long interval between the two clicks. The message was then written out in long-hand.<ref>Oslin, George P. The Story of Telecommunications.

The system was very stable and accurate and became accepted around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|title=David Edward Hughes|accessdate=2010-09-29|date=14 April 2007|publisher=Clarkson University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422072443/http://people.clarkson.edu/~ekatz/scientists/hughes.html|archivedate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n\nThe next improvement was the [[Baudot code]] of 1874. French engineer [[\u00c9mile Baudot]] patented a printing telegraph in which the signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a five-bit code, mechanically interpreted from the state of five on/off switches. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual speed of operation was 30 words per minute.{{sfn|Beauchamp|2001|pp=394\u2013395}}\n\nBy this point reception had been automated, but the speed and accuracy of the transmission was still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in [[Morse code]]) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 words per minute.\n\n====Teleprinters====\n{{main|Teleprinter|Telex}}\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2020}}\n[[File:Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph.jpg|left|thumb|Phelps' Electro-motor Printing Telegraph from circa 1880, the last and most advanced telegraphy mechanism designed by [[George May Phelps]]]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2008-0516-500, Fernschreibmaschine mit Telefonanschluss.jpg|thumb|right|A Creed Model 7 teleprinter in 1930]]\n[[File:Teletype-IMG 7289.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Teletype Model 33]] ASR (Automatic Send and Receive)]]\nAn early successful [[teleprinter]] was invented by [[Frederick G. Creed]]. In [[Glasgow]] he created his first keyboard perforator, which used compressed air to punch the holes. He also created a reperforator (receiving perforator) and a printer. The reperforator punched incoming Morse signals on to paper tape and the printer decoded this tape to produce alphanumeric characters on plain paper. This was the origin of the Creed High Speed Automatic Printing System, which could run at an unprecedented 200 words per minute. His system was adopted by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' for daily transmission of the newspaper contents.\n\nWith the invention of the [[teletypewriter]], telegraphic encoding became fully automated. Early teletypewriters used the ITA-1 [[Baudot code]], a five-bit code. This yielded only thirty-two codes, so it was over-defined into two \"shifts\", \"letters\" and \"figures\". An explicit, unshared shift code prefaced each set of letters and figures. In 1901, Baudot's code was modified by [[Donald Murray (inventor)|Donald Murray]].\n\nIn the 1930s teleprinters were produced by [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] in the US, [[Creed & Company|Creed]] in Britain and [[Siemens]] in Germany.\n\nBy 1935, message routing was the last great barrier to full automation. Large telegraphy providers began to develop systems that used [[telephone exchange|telephone-like rotary dialling]] to connect teletypewriters. These resulting system was called \"Telex\" (TELegraph EXchange). Telex machines first performed rotary-telephone-style [[pulse dialling]] for [[circuit switching]], and then sent data by [[ITA2]]. This \"type A\" Telex routing functionally automated message routing.\n\nThe first wide-coverage Telex network was implemented in Germany during the 1930s{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} as a network used to communicate within the government.\n\nAt the rate of 45.45 (\u00b10.5%) [[baud]] \u2014 considered speedy at the time \u2014 up to 25 telex channels could share a single long-distance telephone channel by using ''[[voice frequency telegraphy]] [[frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]]'', making telex the least expensive method of reliable long-distance communication.\n\nAutomatic teleprinter exchange service was introduced into Canada by [[CPR Telegraphs]] and [[CN Telegraph]] in July 1957 and in 1958, [[Western Union]] started to build a Telex network in the United States.<ref>Phillip R. Easterlin, \"Telex in New York\", Western Union Technical Review, April 1959: 45</ref>\n\n====The harmonic telegraph====\n{{main|Invention of the telephone}}\n{{see also|Acoustic telegraphy}}\nThe most expensive aspect of a telegraph system was the installation \u2013 the laying of the wire, which was often very long. The costs would be better covered by finding a way to send more than one message at a time through the single wire, thus increasing revenue per wire. Early devices included the [[duplex (telegraph)|duplex]] and the [[Quadruplex telegraph|quadruplex]] which allowed, respectively, one or two telegraph transmissions in each direction.  However, an even greater number of channels was desired on the busiest lines.  In the latter half of the 1800s, several inventors worked towards creating a method for doing just that, including [[Charles Bourseul]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Elisha Gray]], and [[Alexander Graham Bell]].\n\nOne approach was to have resonators of several different frequencies act as carriers of a modulated on-off signal.  This was the harmonic telegraph, a form of [[Multiplexing#Frequency-division multiplexing|frequency-division multiplexing]]. These various frequencies, referred to as harmonics, could then be combined into one complex signal and sent down the single wire. On the receiving end, the frequencies would be separated with a matching set of resonators.\n\nWith a set of frequencies being carried down a single wire, it was realized that the human voice itself could be transmitted electrically through the wire. This effort led to the [[invention of the telephone]]. (While the work toward packing multiple telegraph signals onto one wire led to telephony, later advances would pack multiple voice signals onto one wire by increasing the bandwidth by modulating frequencies much higher than human hearing. Eventually the bandwidth was widened much further by using laser light signals sent through fiber optic cables. Fiber optic transmission can carry 25,000 telephone signals simultaneously down a single fiber.<ref>https://www.explainthatstuff.com/fiberoptics.html</ref>)\n\n===Oceanic telegraph cables===\n[[File:1891 Telegraph Lines.jpg|right|thumb|333px|Major telegraph lines in 1891.]]\n{{Main|Transatlantic telegraph cable||Submarine communications cable}}\nSoon after the first successful telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of [[submarine communications cable]]s was first proposed. One of the primary technical challenges was to sufficiently insulate the submarine cable to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon [[William Montgomerie]]<ref name=Haigh26>{{cite book|last=Haigh|first=K R|title=Cable Ships and Submarine Cables|year=1968|publisher=Adlard Coles Ltd|location=London|pages=26\u201327}}</ref> introduced [[gutta-percha]], the adhesive juice of the ''[[Palaquium gutta]]'' tree, to Europe. [[Michael Faraday]] and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of gutta-percha as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested that it should be employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]]. It was tried on a wire laid across the [[Rhine]] between [[Cologne-Deutz|Deutz]] and [[Cologne]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 1849, [[C.V. Walker]], electrician to the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]], submerged a two-mile wire coated with gutta-percha off the coast from Folkestone, which was tested successfully.<ref name=Haigh26/>\n\n[[John Watkins Brett]], an engineer from [[Bristol]], sought and obtained permission from [[Louis-Philippe]] in 1847 to establish [[telegraph|telegraphic communication]] between France and England. The first undersea cable was laid in 1850, connecting the two countries and was followed by connections to Ireland and the Low Countries.\n\nThe [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in [[London]] in 1856 to undertake to construct a commercial telegraph cable across the Atlantic Ocean. It was successfully completed on 18 July 1866 by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], captained by [[Sir James Anderson]] after many mishaps along the away.<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

Woodhead Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-85573-301-5}}.</ref> Earlier transatlantic [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] installations were attempted in 1857, 1858 and 1865. The 1857 cable only operated intermittently for a few days or weeks before it failed. The study of underwater telegraph cables accelerated interest in mathematical analysis of very long [[transmission line]]s. The telegraph lines from Britain to India were connected in 1870 (those several companies combined to form the ''Eastern Telegraph Company'' in 1872).\n\nAustralia was first linked to the rest of the world in October 1872 by a submarine telegraph cable at Darwin.<ref>Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter: \"A Social History of the Media: From Gutenberg to the Internet\", p110.

This was set out as a formal strategic goal, which became known as the [[All Red Line]].<ref name=\"kennedy197110\">{{cite journal | jstor=563928 | title=Imperial Cable Communications and Strategy, 1870-1914 | author=Kennedy, P.

Secret messages were encoded, so interception alone would not be sufficient for the opposing side to gain an advantage. There were geographical constraints on intercepting the telegraph cables, but once radio was used, interception could be much more widespread.\n\n===Crimean war===\nThe [[Crimean War]] was one of the first conflicts to use [[Telegraphy|telegraphs]] and was one of the first to be documented extensively. In 1854, the government in London created a military Telegraph Detachment for the Army commanded by an officer of the [[Royal Engineers]]. It was to comprise twenty-five men from the Royal Corps of Sappers & Miners trained by the Electric Telegraph Company to construct and work the first field electric telegraph.<ref>{{Citation |last= Roberts |first= Steven |title = Distant Writing A History of Telegraph Companies in Britain between 1838 and 1868: 16.

After the French extended the telegraph to the coast of the Black Sea in late 1854, the news reached [[London]] in two days. When the British laid an underwater cable to the Crimean peninsula in April 1855, news reached London in a few hours. The daily news reports energised public opinion, which brought down the government and led to Lord Palmerston becoming prime minister.{{sfn|Figes|2010|pp=304\u201311}}\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]] the telegraph proved its value as a tactical, operational, and strategic communication medium and an important contributor to Union victory.<ref>{{Citation |last= Hochfelder |first= David |title= Essential Civil WAR Curriculum: The Telegraph |publisher= Virginia Center for Civil War Studies at Virginia Tech |year= 2019 |url= https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-telegraph.html }}</ref> By contrast the Confederacy failed to make effective use of the South's much smaller telegraph network. Prior to the War the telegraph systems were primarily used in the commercial sector. Government buildings were not inter-connected with telegraph lines, but relied on runners to carry messages back and forth.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} Before the war the Government saw no need to connect lines within city limits, however, they did see the use in connections between cities. Washington D.C. being the hub of Government, it had the most connections, but there were only a few lines running north and south out of the city.{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}} It wasn't until the Civil War that the Government saw the true potential of the telegraph system. Soon after the shelling of [[Fort Sumter]], the South cut telegraph lines running into D.C., which put the city in a state of panic because they feared an immediate Southern invasion.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}{{sfn|Schwoch|2018}}\n\nWithin 6 months of the start of the war, the [[U.S. Military Telegraph Corps]] (USMT) had laid approximately 300 miles of line. By war's end they had laid approximately 15,000 miles of cable, 8,000 for military and 5,000 for commercial use, and had handled approximately 6.5 million messages. The telegraph was not only important for communication within the armed forces, but also in the civilian sector, helping political leaders to maintain control over their districts.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nEven before the war, the [[American Telegraph Company]] censored suspect messages informally to block aid to the secession movement. During the war, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Simon Cameron]], and later [[Edwin Stanton]], wanted control over the telegraph lines to maintain the flow of information. Early in the war, one of Stanton's first acts as Secretary of War was to move telegraph lines from ending at [[George B. McClellan|McClellan's]] headquarters to terminating at the War Department. Even Stanton himself said \"[telegraphy] is my right arm\". Telegraphy assisted Northern victories, including the [[Battle of Antietam]] (1862), the [[Battle of Chickamauga]] (1863), and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] (1865).{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nThe telegraph system still had its flaws. The USMT, while the main source of telegraphers and cable, was still a civilian agency. Most operators were first hired by the telegraph companies and then contracted out to the War Department. This created tension between Generals and their operators. One source of irritation was that USMT operators didn't have to follow military authority. Usually they performed without hesitation, but they didn't have to, so [[Albert J. Myer|Albert Myer]] created a [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] in February 1863. As the new head of the Signal Corps, Myer tried to get all telegraph and flag signaling under his command, and therefore subject to military discipline. After creating the Signal Corps, Myer pushed to further develop new telegraph systems. While the USMT relied primarily on civilian lines and operators, the Signal Corp's new field telegraph could be deployed and dismantled faster than USMT's system.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\n===First World War===\nDuring [[World War I]], Britain's telegraph communications were almost completely uninterrupted, while it was able to quickly cut Germany's cables worldwide.{{sfn|Kennedy|1971}} British access to transatlantic cables and its codebreaking expertise led to the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] incident that contributed to the US joining the war.<ref>{{cite news|title= The telegram that brought America into the First World War |url= http://www.historyextra.com/article/bbc-history-magazine/telegram-brought-america-first-world-war |work= BBC History Magazin e|date= 17 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\n[[World War II]] revived the 'cable war' of 1914\u20131918. In 1939, German-owned cables across the Atlantic were cut once again, and, in 1940, Italian cables to South America and Spain were cut in retaliation for Italian action against two of the five British cables linking Gibraltar and Malta.

The Germans developed a highly complex teleprinter attachment (German: ''Schl\u00fcssel-Zusatz'') that was used for enciphering telegrams between German High Command ([[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]]) and the army groups in the field. These contained situation reports, battle plans, and discussions of strategy and tactics. Britain intercepted these signals, diagnosed how the encrypting machine worked, and [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher|decrypted]] a large amount of teleprinter traffic.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|pp=1-6}}\n\n==End of the telegraph era==\n{{further|Telegraphy}}\nIn America, the end of the telegraph era can be associated with the fall of the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]]. Western Union was the leading telegraph provider for America and was seen as the best competition for the [[Bell Telephone Company|National Bell Telephone Company]]. Western Union and Bell were both invested in telegraphy and telephone technology. Western Union's decision to allow Bell to gain the advantage in telephone technology was the result of Western Union's upper management's failure to foresee the surpassing of the telephone over the, at the time, dominant telegraph system. Western Union soon lost the legal battle for the rights to their telephone copyrights. This led to Western Union agreeing to a lesser position in the telephone competition, which in turn led to the lessening of the telegraph.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}}\n\nWhile the telegraph was not the focus of the legal battles that occurred around 1878, the companies that were affected by the effects of the battle were the main powers of telegraphy at the time. Western Union thought that the agreement of 1878 would solidify telegraphy as the long-range communication of choice. However, due to the underestimates of telegraph's future{{explain|date=October 2019}} and poor contracts, Western Union found itself declining.{{sfn|Hochfelder|2012}} [[AT&T]] acquired working control of Western Union in 1909 but relinquished it in 1914 under threat of antitrust action.  AT&T bought Western Union's electronic mail and [[Telex]] businesses in 1990.\n\nAlthough commercial \"telegraph\" services are still available in [[Worldwide use of telegrams by country|many countries]], transmission is usually done by some form of [[data transmission]] other than traditional telegraphy.\n\n==See also==\n* [[92 Code]]\n* [[Aurora (astronomy)#Auroral events of historical significance|Aurora (astronomy)]]\n* [[Geomagnetically induced current]]\n* [[Great Northern Telegraph Company]]\n* [[Harrison Gray Dyar]], who supposedly erected the first telegraph line and dispatched the first telegram\n* [[Neutral direct-current telegraph system]]\n* [[Western Electric Company]]\n* [[Wireless telegraphy]]\n* [[American Telephone and Telegraph Company]] (AT&T)\n* [[Bell Canada]]\n* [[Speedwell Ironworks]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*{{Citation |last = Beauchamp |first = Ken |title = History Of Telegraphy |place = London |publisher = The Institution Of Electrical Engineers |year = 2001 |isbn = 978-0-85296-792-8 }}\n*Bowers, Brian, ''Sir Charles Wheatstone: 1802\u20131875'', IET, 2001 {{ISBN|0852961030}}.\n*{{Citation | last = Calvert | first = J.

Price was a follower of [[Henry George]]'s economics ([[Georgism]]). Price also co-founded [[Arden, Delaware]], a utopian [[single tax]] community based on Henry George's economic model. Nevertheless, the Georgist single-tax ideal was never implemented in Rose Valley. Crafts works soon foundered, leaving a legacy of impressive architecture, a preserved landscape, and a regional theatre, the [[Hedgerow Theatre]] (founded in 1923), as well as an artistic community that includes writers, painters, and architects. As a former mayor said, \"Rose Valley is an island of non-conformity.\"<ref>Peter Laird, ''History (Vol. I)'', p. vii</ref> The Rose Valley Historic District, covering essentially all of the borough, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2010.<ref name=\"arch\">{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks & National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = {{NRHP-PA|H144484_01H.pdf}}| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Rose Valley Historic District| accessdate = 2012-01-06| author = George E. Thomas| format = PDF| year= 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nNative Americans of the [[Lenape|Leni Lenape]] or Delaware tribe lived in the area when Europeans began arriving. A major trade route, the [[Great Minquas Path]], passed through the site of the present borough, along Long Point, a hairpin turn in Ridley Creek, and then across the creek and through the center of the borough. Furs were carried along the path from Native Americans on the [[Susquehanna River]] to European traders on the [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]] and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] rivers.\n\nSoon after [[William Penn]] received his charter for the [[Colony of Pennsylvania]], three brothers, Thomas, Robert, and Randall Vernon, received land grants from Penn to settle over {{convert|900|acre}} in the present borough of Rose Valley and [[Nether Providence Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Nether Providence Township]]. The brothers arrived in Pennsylvania in 1682 and began farming the area, about {{convert|4|mi|0}} north of [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], which was then the largest settlement in the colony. Though the brothers purchased their land in 1681 while still in [[London]], the land was not surveyed and patents were not granted for the land until years, perhaps decades, later. The Providence Great Road (now [[Pennsylvania Route 252|PA 252]]), just to the north of the borough, was laid out in the 1680s, and Brookhaven Road, on the borough's eastern boundary, was laid out in 1705.<ref name = arch/><ref name=ham>Peter Ham, ''History (Vol. I)''</ref>{{rp|1\u20136}}\n\nRandall Vernon's house was built before 1700, and still stands. Robert Vernon may have built the house known as the \"Bishop White House\" about 1695. The name of the house comes from its use by the family of Bishop [[William White (bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] during the [[yellow fever epidemic of 1793]] in Philadelphia. Though the bishop visited the house, he generally stayed in Philadelphia in 1793. Will Price modified this house after 1900, adding a stone porch and red tile roof. The Vernon families continued living in the area into the nineteenth century. The [[American Revolution]] split family members, who served as soldiers on both the American and British sides.\n\nMany veterans of the Revolution are buried in now unmarked graves in the cemetery of the Old Union Methodist Church, the only church in the borough. The roots of the church may go back to 1804, and it was officially organized in 1811. The current building dates to 1835.\n\nFollowing the Revolution, land in the southwest corner of the present borough was confiscated from a Vernon family member who had supported the British. The land was eventually sold to Jacob Benninghove, a Philadelphia [[tobacconist]], who built a large mansion there in 1787. About the same time, he built a dam on Ridley Creek and a water-powered [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] mill. Samuel Bankcroft bought the house in 1831 and named it Todmorden Mansion. He lost the house in bankruptcy in 1842, but bought it back in 1857 and lived there until 1889. He built tunnels and secret chambers in the house for use in the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref name=ham/>{{rp|1\u20136}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=130>\nFile:RVernon House RV PA.JPG|Randall Vernon House, built before 1700\nFile:Bishop White RV.JPG|[[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|Bishop White]] House, c. 1695\nFile:Todmorden RV PA.JPG|Todmorden Mansion, built 1787 of green serpentine stone\nFile:Union Methodist RV.JPG|Old Union Methodist Church\n</gallery>\n\n==Mills==\n[[File:Old Mill Rose Valley.JPG|thumb|upright=1|The Old Mill, renovated or rebuilt several times, now serves as town hall.]]\nAt least three mills operated in the area of Rose Valley. Little remains except a silted-in dam pond of what may have been the earliest mill, located on Vernon Run near the present Pool and Tennis Club. Near the Bishop White House, on [[Ridley Creek]], the remains of a dam and [[millrace]] can be seen leading up to the \"Old Mill\", which is now used as the town hall. Benninghove's snuff mill was likely built here c. 1789. Between 1826 and 1850 it was run as a paper mill. It was reconstructed as a [[textile mill]] in 1861 and burned down in 1885. After 1900 Will Price built a furniture mill or craft shop on the foundations and later it was used as a meeting hall. After extensive fire damage, it was reconstructed into today's town hall.\n\nHutton's mill, on Rose Valley Road by Vernon Run, was built about 1840 as a feed mill. In 1847 it became a [[turning]] mill. It was used to produce [[bobbin]]s for the nearby [[textile mill]] as well as serving as a warehouse. Later it produced [[sandpaper]]. Will Price also reconstructed this mill into a meeting house and theater. It also suffered fire damage, was again reconstructed, and now houses the [[Hedgerow Theatre]].<ref name=ham/>{{rp|4\u20138}}\n\n==Arts and crafts project==\nUnder the leadership of Will Price, the Rose Valley Association was formed in July 1901 to start an arts and crafts project and buy about {{convert|80|acre}} of land, an area that is the nucleus of today's borough. Investors contributed about $25,000 in capital, including $9,000 borrowed from nearby [[Swarthmore College]] to buy and improve the land. Price's vision may have been modelled on the utopian socialist society described in ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' by [[William Morris]].<ref name=Thomas>George E. Thomas, ''History (Vol. I)'', Ch. IX</ref>\n\nPrice's liberal views led to some misconceptions about the project, according to his niece Eleanore Price Mather: \"First, it was not a free love colony. Second it was not single tax .... And third, it was not communistic. Rose Valley was essentially an arts and crafts project.\"<ref>Eleanore Price Mather, ''History (Vol. I)'', p. 13</ref>\n\nPrice had led a discussion group, including [[Edward Bok]] and brothers Samuel and [[Joseph Fels]], and many in this group became investors or residents in Rose Valley. Other early residents included Hawley McLanahan, who became Price's architectural partner; McLanahan's father-in-law [[Pressed Steel Car Company|Charles T. Schoen]]; Price's employees at his architectural firm; and his relatives, including his brother Walter, also an architect. Feminist [[Anna Howard Shaw]] lived nearby. Administration of the project was in the form of a town meeting, called the \"Folk Mote\".\n\n[[File:Hedgerow Fall Rose Valley PA.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|The old bobbin mill now houses [[Hedgerow Theatre]].]]\nThe Rose Valley Association did not produce arts and crafts itself, but rather rented out working space to craftsmen, and provided them housing, generally designed or renovated by Price. The crafts were sold from Price's office at 1624 Walnut Street in Philadelphia. Furniture, as well as ceramics and book binding, were produced at the Old Mill until about 1907. A journal, ''The Artsman'', was published from 1903-1907. An art gallery was located in the old bobbin mill, then called \"Artsman's Hall\", and, starting in 1904, run by well-known artist [[Alice Barber Stephens]], who lived in the mill until a nearby barn was converted by Price into her house, [[Thunderbird Lodge (Rose Valley, Pennsylvania)|Thunderbird Lodge]]. Artsman's Hall was also used for theater, with the first play ''The Carpet Bagger's Revenge'' presented on New Year's Eve, 1904. Eventually the building became used solely by the [[Hedgerow Theatre]], which is still active.\n\nBy 1910, however, craft production had faded and the community had become essentially a [[commuter suburb]] of Philadelphia, using the nearby [[Moylan \u2013 Rose Valley (SEPTA station)|Moylan - Rose Valley Station]].<ref>Eleanore Price Mather, ''History (Vol. I)'', Ch. II-III, pp. 9-44</ref> The buildings designed or renovated by Price during this period may be Rose Valley's major achievement. According to George E. Thomas, \"Rose Valley is of exceptional importance, a major American architectural landmark.\"<ref name=Thomas/>{{rp|90}}\n\nAfter 1910 Schoen, McLanahan, and Price bought the remaining land from the Rose Valley Association, and Price designed the \"Rose Valley Improvement Company Houses\" near the old bobbin mill. As a group, these are the most important group of houses designed, rather than renovated, by Price in Rose Valley.<ref>Elizabeth Sippel, 1995</ref>\n\nIn 1926 a Pennsylvania State historic marker was installed on Rose Valley Road to the south of Thunderbird Lodge. It commemorates the [[Great Minquas Path]], a Native American trail that ran nearby.

Its area is {{convert|1.9|km2|order=flip}}, and the population was 913 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4266192| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Rose Valley borough, Pennsylvania| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=December 28, 2015| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213050136/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US4266192| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref> The area was settled by [[Quaker]] farmers in 1682, and later [[water mill]]s along [[Ridley Creek]] drove manufacturing in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn 1901 Rose Valley was founded as an [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] community by architect [[Will Price]], who bought {{convert|80|acre|m2}} of land around the former Rose Valley [[textile mill]]. Price was a follower of [[Henry George]]'s economics ([[Georgism]]). Price also co-founded [[Arden, Delaware]], a utopian [[single tax]] community based on Henry George's economic model. Nevertheless, the Georgist single-tax ideal was never implemented in Rose Valley. Crafts works soon foundered, leaving a legacy of impressive architecture, a preserved landscape, and a regional theatre, the [[Hedgerow Theatre]] (founded in 1923), as well as an artistic community that includes writers, painters, and architects. As a former mayor said, \"Rose Valley is an island of non-conformity.\"<ref>Peter Laird, ''History (Vol. I)'', p. vii</ref> The Rose Valley Historic District, covering essentially all of the borough, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2010.<ref name=\"arch\">{{cite web| url = https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp| title = National Historic Landmarks & National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania| publisher = CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System| format = Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web| url = {{NRHP-PA|H144484_01H.pdf}}| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Rose Valley Historic District| accessdate = 2012-01-06| author = George E. Thomas| format = PDF| year= 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nNative Americans of the [[Lenape|Leni Lenape]] or Delaware tribe lived in the area when Europeans began arriving. A major trade route, the [[Great Minquas Path]], passed through the site of the present borough, along Long Point, a hairpin turn in Ridley Creek, and then across the creek and through the center of the borough. Furs were carried along the path from Native Americans on the [[Susquehanna River]] to European traders on the [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]] and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] rivers.\n\nSoon after [[William Penn]] received his charter for the [[Colony of Pennsylvania]], three brothers, Thomas, Robert, and Randall Vernon, received land grants from Penn to settle over {{convert|900|acre}} in the present borough of Rose Valley and [[Nether Providence Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Nether Providence Township]]. The brothers arrived in Pennsylvania in 1682 and began farming the area, about {{convert|4|mi|0}} north of [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], which was then the largest settlement in the colony. Though the brothers purchased their land in 1681 while still in [[London]], the land was not surveyed and patents were not granted for the land until years, perhaps decades, later. The Providence Great Road (now [[Pennsylvania Route 252|PA 252]]), just to the north of the borough, was laid out in the 1680s, and Brookhaven Road, on the borough's eastern boundary, was laid out in 1705.<ref name = arch/><ref name=ham>Peter Ham, ''History (Vol. I)''</ref>{{rp|1\u20136}}\n\nRandall Vernon's house was built before 1700, and still stands. Robert Vernon may have built the house known as the \"Bishop White House\" about 1695. The name of the house comes from its use by the family of Bishop [[William White (bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]] during the [[yellow fever epidemic of 1793]] in Philadelphia. Though the bishop visited the house, he generally stayed in Philadelphia in 1793. Will Price modified this house after 1900, adding a stone porch and red tile roof. The Vernon families continued living in the area into the nineteenth century. The [[American Revolution]] split family members, who served as soldiers on both the American and British sides.\n\nMany veterans of the Revolution are buried in now unmarked graves in the cemetery of the Old Union Methodist Church, the only church in the borough. The roots of the church may go back to 1804, and it was officially organized in 1811. The current building dates to 1835.\n\nFollowing the Revolution, land in the southwest corner of the present borough was confiscated from a Vernon family member who had supported the British. The land was eventually sold to Jacob Benninghove, a Philadelphia [[tobacconist]], who built a large mansion there in 1787. About the same time, he built a dam on Ridley Creek and a water-powered [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] mill. Samuel Bankcroft bought the house in 1831 and named it Todmorden Mansion. He lost the house in bankruptcy in 1842, but bought it back in 1857 and lived there until 1889. He built tunnels and secret chambers in the house for use in the [[Underground Railroad]].<ref name=ham/>{{rp|1\u20136}}\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=130>\nFile:RVernon House RV PA.JPG|Randall Vernon House, built before 1700\nFile:Bishop White RV.JPG|[[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|Bishop White]] House, c. 1695\nFile:Todmorden RV PA.JPG|Todmorden Mansion, built 1787 of green serpentine stone\nFile:Union Methodist RV.JPG|Old Union Methodist Church\n</gallery>\n\n==Mills==\n[[File:Old Mill Rose Valley.JPG|thumb|upright=1|The Old Mill, renovated or rebuilt several times, now serves as town hall.]]\nAt least three mills operated in the area of Rose Valley. Little remains except a silted-in dam pond of what may have been the earliest mill, located on Vernon Run near the present Pool and Tennis Club. Near the Bishop White House, on [[Ridley Creek]], the remains of a dam and [[millrace]] can be seen leading up to the \"Old Mill\", which is now used as the town hall. Benninghove's snuff mill was likely built here c. 1789. Between 1826 and 1850 it was run as a paper mill. It was reconstructed as a [[textile mill]] in 1861 and burned down in 1885. After 1900 Will Price built a furniture mill or craft shop on the foundations and later it was used as a meeting hall. After extensive fire damage, it was reconstructed into today's town hall.\n\nHutton's mill, on Rose Valley Road by Vernon Run, was built about 1840 as a feed mill. In 1847 it became a [[turning]] mill. It was used to produce [[bobbin]]s for the nearby [[textile mill]] as well as serving as a warehouse. Later it produced [[sandpaper]]. Will Price also reconstructed this mill into a meeting house and theater. It also suffered fire damage, was again reconstructed, and now houses the [[Hedgerow Theatre]].<ref name=ham/>{{rp|4\u20138}}\n\n==Arts and crafts project==\nUnder the leadership of Will Price, the Rose Valley Association was formed in July 1901 to start an arts and crafts project and buy about {{convert|80|acre}} of land, an area that is the nucleus of today's borough. Investors contributed about $25,000 in capital, including $9,000 borrowed from nearby [[Swarthmore College]] to buy and improve the land. Price's vision may have been modelled on the utopian socialist society described in ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' by [[William Morris]].<ref name=Thomas>George E. Thomas, ''History (Vol. I)'', Ch. IX</ref>\n\nPrice's liberal views led to some misconceptions about the project, according to his niece Eleanore Price Mather: \"First, it was not a free love colony. Second it was not single tax .... And third, it was not communistic. Rose Valley was essentially an arts and crafts project.\"<ref>Eleanore Price Mather, ''History (Vol. I)'', p. 13</ref>\n\nPrice had led a discussion group, including [[Edward Bok]] and brothers Samuel and [[Joseph Fels]], and many in this group became investors or residents in Rose Valley. Other early residents included Hawley McLanahan, who became Price's architectural partner; McLanahan's father-in-law [[Pressed Steel Car Company|Charles T. Schoen]]; Price's employees at his architectural firm; and his relatives, including his brother Walter, also an architect. Feminist [[Anna Howard Shaw]] lived nearby. Administration of the project was in the form of a town meeting, called the \"Folk Mote\".\n\n[[File:Hedgerow Fall Rose Valley PA.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|The old bobbin mill now houses [[Hedgerow Theatre]].]]\nThe Rose Valley Association did not produce arts and crafts itself, but rather rented out working space to craftsmen, and provided them housing, generally designed or renovated by Price. The crafts were sold from Price's office at 1624 Walnut Street in Philadelphia. Furniture, as well as ceramics and book binding, were produced at the Old Mill until about 1907. A journal, ''The Artsman'', was published from 1903-1907. An art gallery was located in the old bobbin mill, then called \"Artsman's Hall\", and, starting in 1904, run by well-known artist [[Alice Barber Stephens]], who lived in the mill until a nearby barn was converted by Price into her house, [[Thunderbird Lodge (Rose Valley, Pennsylvania)|Thunderbird Lodge]]. Artsman's Hall was also used for theater, with the first play ''The Carpet Bagger's Revenge'' presented on New Year's Eve, 1904. Eventually the building became used solely by the [[Hedgerow Theatre]], which is still active.\n\nBy 1910, however, craft production had faded and the community had become essentially a [[commuter suburb]] of Philadelphia, using the nearby [[Moylan \u2013 Rose Valley (SEPTA station)|Moylan - Rose Valley Station]].<ref>Eleanore Price Mather, ''History (Vol. I)'', Ch. II-III, pp. 9-44</ref> The buildings designed or renovated by Price during this period may be Rose Valley's major achievement. According to George E. Thomas, \"Rose Valley is of exceptional importance, a major American architectural landmark.\"<ref name=Thomas/>{{rp|90}}\n\nAfter 1910 Schoen, McLanahan, and Price bought the remaining land from the Rose Valley Association, and Price designed the \"Rose Valley Improvement Company Houses\" near the old bobbin mill. As a group, these are the most important group of houses designed, rather than renovated, by Price in Rose Valley.<ref>Elizabeth Sippel, 1995</ref>\n\nIn 1926 a Pennsylvania State historic marker was installed on Rose Valley Road to the south of Thunderbird Lodge. It commemorates the [[Great Minquas Path]], a Native American trail that ran nearby.

St. Mark's was founded in 1865 as an all-boys school by [[Joseph Burnett (educator)|Joseph Burnett]], who developed and marketed  Burnett Vanilla Extract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southboroughhistory.org/History/Burnett%20Company/History_of_J_Burnett_Company.htm|title=SouthboroughHistory.org|author=|date=|website=SouthboroughHistory.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> Girls have attended since 1978.  St. Mark's is a member of the [[Independent School League (Boston Area)|Independent School League]], and one of  five prep schools known collectively as ''[[St. Grottlesex]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n\nSt. Mark's is one of the first [[New England]] schools founded on the [[British public school|British model]], as opposed to [[Academy|academies]] such as [[Phillips Academy]] and [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] or [[Independent school|entrepreneurial schools]] such as [[The Hill School (Pennsylvania)|The Hill School]].<ref>Preparing for Power: America's Elite Boarding Schools, Basic Books, 1985, Peter W. Clarkson and Caroline Hodges Persell, pg. 43</ref>\n\nThe school attracted many members of [[Boston Brahmin]] and [[Ward McAllister|New York Knickerbocker]] families.<ref>St. Mark's School, A Centennial History (Hall, Stinehour Press, Lunenberg, VT, 1967</ref>\n\n===Arrival of William Greenough Thayer===\nThe school faced initial challenges, including financial difficulties and the instability resulting from employing four different headmasters in its first seventeen years of existence, followed by the appointment of William E. Peck in 1882.  Peck was often in conflict with the trustees, until 1894, when he resigned and founded [[Pomfret School]], taking a number of students and teachers with him.  It wasn't until the appointment of Headmaster [[William Greenough Thayer]] (who had taught for five years at slightly younger athletic archrival [[Groton School]]) in 1894 that St. Mark's began to experience stability.  Thayer led the school until 1930. News of his pending retirement was reported by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' in 1929.<ref>Time Magazine, \"Twill\" December 2, 1929</ref>\n\nThayer's knack for attracting socially-well-connected families proved durable.  His admissions policy, modeled on that of English [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public Schools]], prioritized admissions on the basis of when one's parents had \u201cput one's name down\u201d.  In practice this led over time to a school dominated by sons of alumni. Girls were not admitted until 1978.\n\nSt. Mark's social standing did not pass unnoticed in wider America.  [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], in his 1920 novel \u201c[[This Side of Paradise]]\u201d, identified St. Mark's as a school which \u201c...recruited from Boston and the Knickerbocker families of New York.\u201d <ref>F. Scott Fitzgerald, This Side of Paradise, (New York, Scribners, 1920)</ref>\n\n[[Sports]] were emphasized.  In the early years masters played with boys on the same teams, and the traditional football rivalry with Groton was slowly expanded to include the English game of \u201c[[fives]]\u201d, [[baseball]], and other sports.\n\n===Parkman period===\nWith Thayer's retirement in 1930, Headmaster Francis Parkman was chosen to lead the school. Parkman brought the noted poet [[Richard Eberhart]] to the school as an English teacher from 1933 to 1941, and [[W. H. Auden]] for a brief appointment in 1939. Auden described St. Mark's to a friend as a school that \"sets out to be a sort of American [[Eton College|Eton]]\u201d. Auden was reportedly struck by the \u201cdimness of the boys and the reverence of America for the average.\u201d<ref>[http://www.audensociety.org ''The Newsletter of the W. H. Auden Society'', September 1993, Newsletter No 10-11]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audensociety.org|title=The W. H. Auden Society|first=Edward Mendelson, webmaster|last=audensociety.org|date=|website=www.AudenSociety.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> Eberhart briefly memorializes Auden's time at St. Mark's with his poem \u201cTo W. H. Auden on his Fiftieth Birthday\u201d, in which he mentions the school in passing.\n\nParkman left the school in 1942 \u2013 to enlist in the army \u2013 and never returned, although he remained active in independent school policy all his life, eventually rising to the presidency of the [[National Association of Independent Schools]] in Boston.\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] changed the campus.  In 1942 Parkman was replaced by William Brewster, an Episcopal clergyman who remained only until 1947. Brewster's democratizing tendencies were abetted by exigencies of the war effort.  The school was forced to cope with labor shortages that forced students to work in dormitories and in the dining hall. The maids and domestic help vanished with the war's labor shortage and never returned.\n\n===Twentieth-century elitism===\nHeadmaster Brewster disliked the [[List of traditional gentlemen's clubs in the United States|clubby]] atmosphere of the school, reforming admission policies during his brief tenure.  Famously hearing one alumnus describe St. Mark's as the best club he had ever joined, Brewster subsequently fought to make admissions merit-based, and expanded financial assistance.  His successors continued this battle. The school began to focus more on academic as opposed to social merits, and by the late fifties was admitting only about one applicant out of five.\n\nIn 1948, Headmaster William Wyatt Barber, Jr. assumed leadership of St. Mark's.  Teaching Ancient Greek and coaching hockey, Headmaster Barber emphasized character building.  Under Mr. Barber, the school offered scholarships to students from military or moderate income families.\n\n===Challenge of modernization===\nIn 1968, Edward T. \"Ned\" Hall became Headmaster. Beginning in the early 1970s, St. Mark's relaxed many traditional, formal requirements of school life.  St. Mark's reduced the number of required chapel services from six days per week to five.  St. Mark's reduced the number of sit down meals.  The School introduced a \"December Week\" of alternative course offerings, and experiments in co-education.  Headmaster Hall announced his resignation at the beginning of the 1973\u201374 school year, effective the following July.\n\nIn 1974, the trustees hired Rev. Robert R. \"Red\" Hansel, a former chaplain at [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]]. Hansel's four-year tenure was controversial. Changes under Rev. Hansel, like coeducation, were arduous.  In 1972 girls initially attended the newly established Southborough School, funded largely by St. Mark's. In 1977 the Southborough girls' school was dissolved. St. Mark's absorbed many of its students and faculty.\n\n==Academics==\n[[Image:St. Mark's from Street.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Age Quod Agis]]\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the most popular college destinations were Northeastern (12), Georgetown (11), Hamilton (11), Boston College (10), and Lehigh (10).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/college-counseling/college-matriculation/index.aspx|title=Matriculation List - St. Mark's School|author=|date=|website=www.StMarksSchool.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSt. Mark's has an average SAT score of 1360.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niche.com/k12/st-marks-school-southborough-ma/academics/|title=St. Mark's School Test Scores and Academics|author=|date=|website=www.niche.com|access-date=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref>. The revised curriculum eliminated Advanced Placement classes and installed Advanced classes, courses unique to St. Mark's which, depending on the course itself, may or may not align with the College Board's Advanced Placement classes.\n\n==Programs==\n\nSt. Mark's offers several unique programs to its students and others affiliated with the school.

Because of this, the school touts the \"school under one roof\" concept as a unique strength, though more recent buildings no longer fit that criterion.  \n\nThe school as it appeared in the early 1950s is portrayed under the name \"St. Bart's\" in the novel ''[[Pnin]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], whose son [[Dmitri Nabokov|Dmitri]] attended the school. Some interior shots of St. Mark's can be seen in the film ''[[School Ties]]'' (1992), which was filmed at [[Middlesex School]] and St. Mark's.\n\n==Athletics==\nSt. Mark's has historically been strong at ice hockey, and a number of its alumni have gone on to careers in the [[National Hockey League]].

St. Mark's is a member of the [[Independent School League (Boston Area)|Independent School League]], and one of  five prep schools known collectively as ''[[St. Grottlesex]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n\nSt. Mark's is one of the first [[New England]] schools founded on the [[British public school|British model]], as opposed to [[Academy|academies]] such as [[Phillips Academy]] and [[Phillips Exeter Academy]] or [[Independent school|entrepreneurial schools]] such as [[The Hill School (Pennsylvania)|The Hill School]].<ref>Preparing for Power: America's Elite Boarding Schools, Basic Books, 1985, Peter W. Clarkson and Caroline Hodges Persell, pg. 43</ref>\n\nThe school attracted many members of [[Boston Brahmin]] and [[Ward McAllister|New York Knickerbocker]] families.<ref>St. Mark's School, A Centennial History (Hall, Stinehour Press, Lunenberg, VT, 1967</ref>\n\n===Arrival of William Greenough Thayer===\nThe school faced initial challenges, including financial difficulties and the instability resulting from employing four different headmasters in its first seventeen years of existence, followed by the appointment of William E. Peck in 1882.  Peck was often in conflict with the trustees, until 1894, when he resigned and founded [[Pomfret School]], taking a number of students and teachers with him.  It wasn't until the appointment of Headmaster [[William Greenough Thayer]] (who had taught for five years at slightly younger athletic archrival [[Groton School]]) in 1894 that St. Mark's began to experience stability.  Thayer led the school until 1930. News of his pending retirement was reported by ''[[Time Magazine]]'' in 1929.<ref>Time Magazine, \"Twill\" December 2, 1929</ref>\n\nThayer's knack for attracting socially-well-connected families proved durable.  His admissions policy, modeled on that of English [[Public school (United Kingdom)|Public Schools]], prioritized admissions on the basis of when one's parents had \u201cput one's name down\u201d.  In practice this led over time to a school dominated by sons of alumni. Girls were not admitted until 1978.\n\nSt. Mark's social standing did not pass unnoticed in wider America.  [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], in his 1920 novel \u201c[[This Side of Paradise]]\u201d, identified St. Mark's as a school which \u201c...recruited from Boston and the Knickerbocker families of New York.\u201d <ref>F. Scott Fitzgerald, This Side of Paradise, (New York, Scribners, 1920)</ref>\n\n[[Sports]] were emphasized.  In the early years masters played with boys on the same teams, and the traditional football rivalry with Groton was slowly expanded to include the English game of \u201c[[fives]]\u201d, [[baseball]], and other sports.\n\n===Parkman period===\nWith Thayer's retirement in 1930, Headmaster Francis Parkman was chosen to lead the school. Parkman brought the noted poet [[Richard Eberhart]] to the school as an English teacher from 1933 to 1941, and [[W. H. Auden]] for a brief appointment in 1939. Auden described St. Mark's to a friend as a school that \"sets out to be a sort of American [[Eton College|Eton]]\u201d. Auden was reportedly struck by the \u201cdimness of the boys and the reverence of America for the average.\u201d<ref>[http://www.audensociety.org ''The Newsletter of the W. H. Auden Society'', September 1993, Newsletter No 10-11]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audensociety.org|title=The W. H. Auden Society|first=Edward Mendelson, webmaster|last=audensociety.org|date=|website=www.AudenSociety.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref> Eberhart briefly memorializes Auden's time at St. Mark's with his poem \u201cTo W. H. Auden on his Fiftieth Birthday\u201d, in which he mentions the school in passing.\n\nParkman left the school in 1942 \u2013 to enlist in the army \u2013 and never returned, although he remained active in independent school policy all his life, eventually rising to the presidency of the [[National Association of Independent Schools]] in Boston.\n\n===World War II===\n[[World War II]] changed the campus.  In 1942 Parkman was replaced by William Brewster, an Episcopal clergyman who remained only until 1947. Brewster's democratizing tendencies were abetted by exigencies of the war effort.  The school was forced to cope with labor shortages that forced students to work in dormitories and in the dining hall. The maids and domestic help vanished with the war's labor shortage and never returned.\n\n===Twentieth-century elitism===\nHeadmaster Brewster disliked the [[List of traditional gentlemen's clubs in the United States|clubby]] atmosphere of the school, reforming admission policies during his brief tenure.  Famously hearing one alumnus describe St. Mark's as the best club he had ever joined, Brewster subsequently fought to make admissions merit-based, and expanded financial assistance.  His successors continued this battle. The school began to focus more on academic as opposed to social merits, and by the late fifties was admitting only about one applicant out of five.\n\nIn 1948, Headmaster William Wyatt Barber, Jr. assumed leadership of St. Mark's.  Teaching Ancient Greek and coaching hockey, Headmaster Barber emphasized character building.  Under Mr. Barber, the school offered scholarships to students from military or moderate income families.\n\n===Challenge of modernization===\nIn 1968, Edward T. \"Ned\" Hall became Headmaster. Beginning in the early 1970s, St. Mark's relaxed many traditional, formal requirements of school life.  St. Mark's reduced the number of required chapel services from six days per week to five.  St. Mark's reduced the number of sit down meals.  The School introduced a \"December Week\" of alternative course offerings, and experiments in co-education.  Headmaster Hall announced his resignation at the beginning of the 1973\u201374 school year, effective the following July.\n\nIn 1974, the trustees hired Rev. Robert R. \"Red\" Hansel, a former chaplain at [[St. George's School, Newport|St. George's School]]. Hansel's four-year tenure was controversial. Changes under Rev. Hansel, like coeducation, were arduous.  In 1972 girls initially attended the newly established Southborough School, funded largely by St. Mark's. In 1977 the Southborough girls' school was dissolved. St. Mark's absorbed many of its students and faculty.\n\n==Academics==\n[[Image:St. Mark's from Street.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Age Quod Agis]]\n\nBetween 2010 and 2014, the most popular college destinations were Northeastern (12), Georgetown (11), Hamilton (11), Boston College (10), and Lehigh (10).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarksschool.org/academics/college-counseling/college-matriculation/index.aspx|title=Matriculation List - St. Mark's School|author=|date=|website=www.StMarksSchool.org|access-date=September 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSt. Mark's has an average SAT score of 1360.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.niche.com/k12/st-marks-school-southborough-ma/academics/|title=St. Mark's School Test Scores and Academics|author=|date=|website=www.niche.com|access-date=Jan 22, 2020}}</ref>. The revised curriculum eliminated Advanced Placement classes and installed Advanced classes, courses unique to St. Mark's which, depending on the course itself, may or may not align with the College Board's Advanced Placement classes.\n\n==Programs==\n\nSt. Mark's offers several unique programs to its students and others affiliated with the school.

Because of this, the school touts the \"school under one roof\" concept as a unique strength, though more recent buildings no longer fit that criterion.  \n\nThe school as it appeared in the early 1950s is portrayed under the name \"St. Bart's\" in the novel ''[[Pnin]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], whose son [[Dmitri Nabokov|Dmitri]] attended the school. Some interior shots of St. Mark's can be seen in the film ''[[School Ties]]'' (1992), which was filmed at [[Middlesex School]] and St. Mark's.\n\n==Athletics==\nSt. Mark's has historically been strong at ice hockey, and a number of its alumni have gone on to careers in the [[National Hockey League]].

Prematurely eliminated, [[Vittorio Pozzo]] lost his position as sole commissioner of the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] and [[Ferruccio Novo]] took his place.\n\nNew season began in mid-September with a Torino almost identical to that of the previous championships; there was only [[Franco Ossola]] permanently in place of [[Pietro Ferraris]], who, at age 36, had moved to [[Novara Calcio|Novara]]. The [[central midfielder|midfielder]] [[Rubens Fadini]] arrived from Gallarate, [[Dino Ballarin]], brother of the goalkeeper [[Aldo Ballarin|Aldo]] was signed from Chioggia; the Hungarian-Czechoslovakian [[J\u00falius Schubert]], a left-sided midfielder; and strikers [[Emile Bongiorni]] and [[Ruggero Grava]] arrived from [[Racing Club de France|Racing Parigi]] and [[CO Roubaix-Tourcoing|Roubaix-Tourcoing]] respectively.\nThe club began the season after a long tour in [[Brazil]] where the team met [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]], losing only once. During the season, reduced to 24 teams after three promotions and relegations, [[Ernest Erbstein]] was appointed as the team's technical director and the Englishman [[Leslie Lievesley]] became the coach.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chesterfield-fc.co.uk/page/PastPlayersDetail/0,,10435~979069,00.html | title = Past players |publisher=Chesterfield F.C. | accessdate = 2011-06-21}}</ref>\nThe campaign also saw injuries to [[Virgilio Maroso]], [[Eusebio Castigliano]], [[Romeo Menti]] and [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.torinofc.it/storia|title=La Storia del Torino Fc|publisher=Torino Football Club|language=Italian|accessdate=19 March 2015}}</ref>, plus the long suspension for [[Aldo Ballarin]]. The Granata, which debuted with a victory against [[Aurora Pro Patria 1919|Pro Patria]], suffered a defeat in the second round to [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]; the team recovered with five straight wins, including that of the [[Turin derby|derby]], but lost again, in [[Milan]], against the ''Rossoneri''.\nThe club would relinquish the lead in the standings<ref>{{Cite book|author=Ormezzano|title=Toro 49|p= 164}}.</ref>, then recapture it, finishing midway through the season on par with [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], from which a third defeat was suffered, losing 3\u20130. In the return leg of the derby Torino would defeat [[Juventus]] 3\u20130. \nTorino's advantage increased in the standings, gaining a maximum of six point on [[Inter Milan|Inter]] in second place<ref>{{cite book|author=Colombero,|title=Pacifico|p=120}}</ref>. However, a pair of draws (in [[Trieste]] and [[Bari]]) allowed Inter to close the gap within four points from Torino. On 30 April 1949, the two clubs met in Milan, ending 0\u20130, with Torino approaching their fifth consecutive title (the record would be equaled).\nThe team travelled to Portugal to play in a friendly against [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]. However, upon return Torino perished in the [[Superga air disaster]].\n\n=== Superga air disaster ===\n{{main|Superga air disaster}}\nThe airplane with the team crashed at [[Basilica di Superga]] nearby Torino. There were deaths of team chairmen and club workers, baggage men and three of the best journalists  in the country at the time: [[Renato Casalbore]] (founder of Tuttosport magazine); [[Renato Tosatti]] (from journal Gazzetta del Popolo) and [[Luigi Cavallero]] (from journal La Stampa). \nThe shocking corpse identification was made by former Italian National Team manager [[Vittorio Pozzo]]. The spezzino player [[Sauro Tom\u00e0]], injured, did not travel to Lisboa. The following persons in the Torino circle did not travel: second goalkeeper [[Renato Gandolfi]] (instead third  goalkeeper [[Dino Ballarin]] did), the radio anchor [[Nicol\u00f2 Carosio]] and former manager of Italian National Team also journalist Vittorio Pozzo (Torino preferred to give the seat to Cavallero).\n<ref>{{cite web |author=Patrick Jennings |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/46788983 |title=The plane crash that killed Serie A's champions and their English coach |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2019 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpWbGJPo1-c&source=video&vgc=rss&usg=AFQjCNFfzesVbEpVRJXx4KxoHr8LKgclPQ |title=TG-R \"Leonardo\": possibili cause della sciagura di Superga: l'ipotesi dell'altimetro guasto|publisher= Andrea Sinaglia YouTube }}</ref>\n\n====Legacy====\nThe impact of the tragedy in Italy was colossal.
