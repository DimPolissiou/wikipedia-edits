From the scarcity of surnames in that record no clear reference to the Ketts of East Anglia is forthcoming, but christian names similar to those of the earliest recorded members of the Kett family have been found. They have been abstracted from the Norfolk Domesday and closely analysed. It is worth noting that the association of one group of Godwins, Hughs, and Huberts indicates a probable derivation from Toka, a \" francigena \" or foreigner (another word is used for Frank or Frenchman).

In 1953, he co-authored with [[Francis Crick]] the academic paper proposing the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix structure]] of the [[DNA]] [[molecule]]. Watson, Crick and [[Maurice Wilkins]] were awarded the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of [[nucleic acid]]s and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\nWatson earned degrees at the [[University of Chicago]] ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]], 1947) and [[Indiana University]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the [[University of Copenhagen]] with [[Herman Kalckar]] and Ole Maal\u00f8e, Watson worked at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the [[Harvard University]] Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology. \n\nFrom 1968 Watson served as director of [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of [[cancer]], along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming a genetic link between [[intelligence and race]]. In 2019, following the broadcast of a documentary in which Watson reiterated his views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him.\n\nWatson has written many science books, including the textbook ''Molecular Biology of the Gene'' (1965) and his bestselling book ''[[The Double Helix]]'' (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the [[National Institutes of Health]], helping to establish the [[Human Genome Project]], which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003.\n\n<br />\n<!-- PER WP:LEADCITE, MATERIAL FOUND HERE IS CITED IN THE BODY OF THE ARTICLE -->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJames D.

For example, [[type 2 diabetes]] is usually thought to be caused by oxidation in the body that causes inflammation and kills off pancreatic cells. Watson thinks the root of that inflammation is different: \"a lack of biological oxidants, not an excess\", and discusses this in detail. One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that ''The Lancet'' published Watson's paper only because of his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/28/dna-pioneer-james-watson-theory-diseases|title=DNA pioneer James Watson sets out radical theory for range of diseases|author=Ian Sample|work=the Guardian|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Molenaar|first1=RJ|last2=van Noorden|first2=CJ|title=Type 2 diabetes and cancer as redox diseases?|journal=Lancet|date=September 6, 2014|volume=384|issue=9946|page=853|pmid=25209484|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61485-9}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Watson sold his Nobel prize medal to raise money;<ref>{{cite news |last=Crow |first=David |title=James Watson to sell Nobel Prize medal |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5fb47ebe-75bc-11e4-a1a9-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate=December 1, 2014 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=November 28, 2014 |quote='Because I was an \"unperson\" I was fired from the boards of companies, so I have no income, apart from my academic income,' he said.}}</ref> part of the funds raised by the sale went to support scientific research.<ref>{{cite web |title=DNA pioneer James Watson to sell Nobel Prize |last=Jones |first=Bryony |date=November 26, 2014 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/25/world/james-watson-to-sell-nobel-prize/ |website=CNN International World News |publisher=CNN |accessdate=November 30, 2014 |quote=Watson says he intends to use part of the money raised by the sale to fund projects at the universities and scientific research institutions he has worked at throughout his career.}}</ref> The medal sold at auction at [[Christie's]] in December 2014 for {{USD|4.1 million}}.

In 1953, he co-authored with [[Francis Crick]] the academic paper proposing the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix structure]] of the [[DNA]] [[molecule]]. Watson, Crick and [[Maurice Wilkins]] were awarded the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] \"for their discoveries concerning the molecular structure of [[nucleic acid]]s and its significance for information transfer in living material\".\n\nWatson earned degrees at the [[University of Chicago]] ([[Bachelor of Science|BS]], 1947) and [[Indiana University]] ([[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], 1950). Following a post-doctoral year at the [[University of Copenhagen]] with [[Herman Kalckar]] and Ole Maal\u00f8e, Watson worked at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in England, where he first met his future collaborator Francis Crick. From 1956 to 1976, Watson was on the faculty of the [[Harvard University]] Biology Department, promoting research in molecular biology. \n\nFrom 1968 Watson served as director of [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] (CSHL), greatly expanding its level of funding and research. At CSHL, he shifted his research emphasis to the study of [[cancer]], along with making it a world-leading research center in molecular biology. In 1994, he started as president and served for 10 years. He was then appointed chancellor, serving until he resigned in 2007 after making comments claiming a genetic link between [[intelligence and race]]. In 2019, following the broadcast of a documentary in which Watson reiterated his views on race and genetics, CSHL revoked his honorary titles and severed all ties with him.\n\nWatson has written many science books, including the textbook ''Molecular Biology of the Gene'' (1965) and his bestselling book ''[[The Double Helix]]'' (1968). Between 1988 and 1992, Watson was associated with the [[National Institutes of Health]], helping to establish the [[Human Genome Project]], which completed the task of mapping the human genome in 2003.\n\n<br />\n<!-- PER WP:LEADCITE, MATERIAL FOUND HERE IS CITED IN THE BODY OF THE ARTICLE -->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJames D.

One critical response was that the idea was neither new nor worthy of merit, and that ''The Lancet'' published Watson's paper only because of his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/28/dna-pioneer-james-watson-theory-diseases|title=DNA pioneer James Watson sets out radical theory for range of diseases|author=Ian Sample|work=the Guardian|accessdate=June 29, 2015}}</ref> Other scientists have expressed their support for his hypothesis and have proposed that it can also be expanded to why a lack of oxidants can result in cancer and its progression.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Molenaar|first1=RJ|last2=van Noorden|first2=CJ|title=Type 2 diabetes and cancer as redox diseases?|journal=Lancet|date=September 6, 2014|volume=384|issue=9946|page=853|pmid=25209484|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61485-9}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Watson sold his Nobel prize medal to raise money;<ref>{{cite news |last=Crow |first=David |title=James Watson to sell Nobel Prize medal |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5fb47ebe-75bc-11e4-a1a9-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate=December 1, 2014 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=November 28, 2014 |quote='Because I was an \"unperson\" I was fired from the boards of companies, so I have no income, apart from my academic income,' he said.}}</ref> part of the funds raised by the sale went to support scientific research.<ref>{{cite web |title=DNA pioneer James Watson to sell Nobel Prize |last=Jones |first=Bryony |date=November 26, 2014 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/25/world/james-watson-to-sell-nobel-prize/ |website=CNN International World News |publisher=CNN |accessdate=November 30, 2014 |quote=Watson says he intends to use part of the money raised by the sale to fund projects at the universities and scientific research institutions he has worked at throughout his career.}}</ref> The medal sold at auction at [[Christie's]] in December 2014 for {{USD|4.1 million}}.

It is also home to the [[Evert Tennis Academy]], owned by former professional tennis player [[Chris Evert]]. [[Town Center at Boca Raton|Boca Town Center]], an upscale shopping center in central Boca Raton, is the largest indoor mall in Palm Beach County. The downtown is centered around [[Mizner Park]].\n\nMany buildings in the area have a [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] or [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] architectural theme, initially inspired by [[Addison Mizner]], a resort architect who heavily influenced the city's early development. Still today, Boca Raton has a strict development code for the size and types of commercial buildings, building signs, and advertisements that may be erected within the city limits. No outdoor [[car dealership]]s are allowed in the municipality. No billboards are permitted; the city's only billboard was grandfathered in during annexation. The strict development code has led to several major thoroughfares without large signs or advertisements in the traveler's view. However, that regulation does not apply for West Boca Raton which lies outside of city limits. Palm Beach County laws have jurisdiction over that territory.\n\n==Etymology==\nBoca Raton is labeled in the first European maps of the area as \"Boca de Ratones\", and many people mistakenly translate the name in English as \"Rat's Mouth\". Although incorrect (''rat\u00f3n'' means \"mouse\" in Spanish; \"rat\" is ''rata''), this translation continues to be popularized by several residents and institutions in the city. For example, the [[tailgate party|tailgate]] area for football games at [[Florida Atlantic University]] is known as the \"Rat's Mouth\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Rat's Mouth Tailgate Procedures |url=http://www.fau.edu/campuslife/tailgate.php |website=Florida Atlantic University Homepage |accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"Boca\", meaning ''mouth'' in Spanish, was a common term to describe an [[inlet]] on maps by sailors. The true meaning of the word \"ratones\" for the area is more uncertain. Some claim that the word \"ratones\" appears in old Spanish maritime dictionaries referring to \"rugged rocks or stony ground on the bottom of some ports and coastal outlets, where the cables rub against.\"<ref>The Spanish Maritime Dictionary of 1831</ref> Thus, one possible translation of \"Boca Raton\" is \"rugged inlet\".<ref>{{Citation| last1 = Ruiz | first1 = Humberto E. | last2 = Cobia | first2 = Manley F.| title = Boca de Ratones: An Etymological Reassessment| url =http://www.bocahistory.org/eGallery/upload/Boca%20Raton%20Historical%20Society/Boca%20Raton%20Historical%20Society/Files/bocaderatones_origin.pdf| access-date = March 23, 2018}}</ref> Still other people claim that \"ratones\" referred to thieves who hid out in the area, and thus the name could translate to \"thieves' inlet\".\n\n===Pronunciation===\nResidents of the city have kept the pronunciation of Boca Raton similar to its Spanish origins. In particular, the \"Raton\" in \"Boca Raton\" is pronounced as {{IPAc-en||r|\u0259|\u02c8|t|o\u028a|n}} instead of {{IPAc-en|r|\u0259|\u02c8|t|\u0252|n}}.

In 1965, well before the extension of [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] into Southern Florida, IBM, working in secret with the Arvida corporation, quietly purchased several hundred acres of real estate west of the [[CSX]] rail line and northwest of [[Florida Atlantic University]]. Originally situated in unincorporated Palm Beach County, the site was controversially annexed into Boca Raton almost a year following its dedication in 1970.<ref>Janie Gold, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DYAyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PLcFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5266,4338414&dq=university+park+boca+raton&hl=en \"Archer calls on Boca Raton to de-annex University Park\"], ''The Palm Beach Post'', July 12, 1972, C1&ndash;C2.</ref>\n\n[[File:T-Rex Technology Center Fountain (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|The Boca Corporate Center & Campus was originally one of IBM's research labs where the IBM PC was created.]]\nConstruction of IBM's main complex began in 1967, designed by [[Marcel Breuer]],<ref name=\"porter198311\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8fwTt09_MEC&lpg=RA1-PA696&dq=pc%20magazine%20%22november%201983%22&pg=RA1-PA162#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=The Talk of Boca | work=PC Magazine | date=November 1983 | accessdate=October 22, 2013 | author=Porter, Martin | page=162}}</ref> and the manufacturing and office complex was dedicated in March 1970. The campus was designed with self-sufficiency in mind and sported its own [[electrical substation]], [[water pumping]] station, and rail spur.\n\nBy 1984 IBM was Palm Beach County's largest corporate employer, with 8,500 Boca Raton employees.<ref name=\"bulman19841105\">{{Cite news |url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/31277231/fort_lauderdale_news/ |title=Big time: IBM skillfully revives lackluster sales of PCjr |last=Bulman |first=Philip |date=1984-11-05 |work=Fort Lauderdale News |access-date=2019-05-05 |page=47 |language=en}}</ref> Among other noteworthy IT accomplishments, such as the mass production of the [[System/360]] and development of the [[IBM Series/1|Series/1]] mainframe computers, IBM's main complex was the birthplace of the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], which later evolved into the IBM [[Personal System/2]], developed in nearby [[Delray Beach, Florida|Delray Beach]]. Starting in 1987, IBM relocated its manufacturing for what became the IBM PC division to [[Research Triangle Park]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and converted the cavernous manufacturing facilities into offices and laboratories, later producing products such as the [[OS/2]] operating system and VoiceType Dictation, later known as [[ViaVoice]] voice-recognition [[software]].\n\nIBM maintained its facilities in the South Florida area until 1996, when the facility was closed and sold to Blue Lake Real Estate. The site was sold to T-REX Management Consortium, then to the Blackstone Group in 2005, who renamed it the Boca Corporate Center and Campus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/business/new-owner-gives-new-life-former-home-ibm-boca/VWruh7ueJs3zCOZnMj1x9N/|title=New owner gives new life to former home of IBM in Boca|last=Clough|first=Alexandra|date=September 23, 2016|work=The Palm Beach Post|access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref>  The site was later renamed the Boca Raton Innovation Campus (BRiC).

It is named after [[Don Estridge]], whose team was responsible for developing the [[IBM PC]]. IBM returned in July 2001, opening the software development laboratory at Beacon Square off Congress Avenue.\n\nIt is noteworthy that still left standing inside the old IBM complex is the office and conference table where [[Bill Gates]] signed his historic deal to supply IBM with the [[Microsoft]] [[MS-DOS]] operating system for its personal computer line.\n\n====Suburban expansion====\nIn the 1980s, because of an explosion of development to the west of the historical center of the city, some eastern areas began to decay, including the downtown corridor. For instance, the old Boca Raton Mall, a [[shopping mall]] in the downtown area, was beginning to experience higher vacancy, and occupancy by marginal tenants, owing to the opening of [[Town Center at Boca Raton]] west of the city in 1980.\n[[File:Palmetto Park Rd and Mizner Blvd 2.jpg|thumb|right|Palmetto Park Road and Mizner Boulevard intersection.]]\n\nIn 1991, the new downtown outdoor shopping and dining center, [[Mizner Park]], was completed over the site of the old Boca Raton Mall. It has since become a cultural center for southern Palm Beach County. Featuring a landscaped central park between the two main roads (collectively called Plaza Real) with stores only on the outside of the roads, Mizner Park resembles a Mediterranean suburban \"town center\" with a more contemporary look. It features many restaurants and is home to the [[Boca Raton Museum of Art]], which moved to the new facility in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |title = Boca Raton Museum of Art | url=http://www.bocamuseum.org/index.php?submenu=about_us&src=gendocs&link=AboutUs&category=About%20Us |postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> In 2002, a new [[amphitheater]] was built, replacing a smaller one and providing a large-capacity outdoor venue where concerts and other performances are held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miznerparkamp.com/ |title=miznerparkamp.com |accessdate=June 30, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801203604/http://miznerparkamp.com/ |archivedate=August 1, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMizner Park has significantly aided downtown revitalization. Many new eight- to ten-story mixed-use buildings have been constructed, are under construction, or are proposed for the downtown area. The surrounding areas to the downtown have benefited from the downtown redevelopment.\n\nThe [[National Cartoon Museum]] built a {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility on the southwest edge of Mizner Park in 1996. Open for six years, the museum relocated to its original home in [[New York City]] in 2002. Building renovations for public uses, including the local public TV station, and private uses, such as a locally owned and operated bookstore, were completed in 2008. In addition to the Mizner Park Cultural Arts Association's theater and space, the building is home to the Schmidt Family Foundation.\n\nAs development continued to focus to the west of the city in the 1980s and 1990s, the mall area known as [[Town Center at Boca Raton]] became the geographic center of what is referred to as West Boca Raton, though this mall was not annexed into the city until 2004. This area, including the unincorporated area west of the city (discussed below), is now almost entirely built out.\n{{wide image|BocaSkyline2 (cropped)2.jpg|1000px|alt=Panoramic view of a portion of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] in downtown Boca Raton|Panoramic view of a portion of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]] in downtown Boca Raton}}\n\nToday, Boca Raton is said to be the Beverly Hills of Florida with well-developed beach resorts, luxury country clubs, and five-star shopping and restaurants.

Henderson University School (ADHUS) and [[Florida Atlantic University High School|FAU High School]] (FAUHS). Both are on the Florida Atlantic University campus and are organized as a unique and separate school district; they are not part of the Palm Beach County School System. Henderson School is recognized as Florida Atlantic University School District #72, under the College of Education's administrative oversight.\n\nUniversity schools in Florida are authorized to provide instruction for grades K-12 and university students, support university research efforts, and test educational reforms for Florida schools. Both ADHUS and FAUHS are public schools and thus do not charge tuition. And they are open to children who reside in Palm Beach County or [[Broward County]]. ADHUS admission is by lottery, while FAUHS admission is determined by academic ability. Student characteristics of gender, race, family income and student ability are used to match the student population profile to that of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adhus.fau.edu|title=Alexander D.

As a business center, the city experiences significant daytime population increases.

It is also home to the [[Evert Tennis Academy]], owned by former professional tennis player [[Chris Evert]]. [[Town Center at Boca Raton|Boca Town Center]], an upscale shopping center in central Boca Raton, is the largest indoor mall in Palm Beach County. The downtown is centered around [[Mizner Park]].\n\nMany buildings in the area have a [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] or [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] architectural theme, initially inspired by [[Addison Mizner]], a resort architect who heavily influenced the city's early development. Still today, Boca Raton has a strict development code for the size and types of commercial buildings, building signs, and advertisements that may be erected within the city limits. No outdoor [[car dealership]]s are allowed in the municipality. No billboards are permitted; the city's only billboard was grandfathered in during annexation. The strict development code has led to several major thoroughfares without large signs or advertisements in the traveler's view. However, that regulation does not apply for West Boca Raton which lies outside of city limits. Palm Beach County laws have jurisdiction over that territory.\n\n==Etymology==\nBoca Raton is labeled in the first European maps of the area as \"Boca de Ratones\", and many people mistakenly translate the name in English as \"Rat's Mouth\". Although incorrect (''rat\u00f3n'' means \"mouse\" in Spanish; \"rat\" is ''rata''), this translation continues to be popularized by several residents and institutions in the city. For example, the [[tailgate party|tailgate]] area for football games at [[Florida Atlantic University]] is known as the \"Rat's Mouth\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Rat's Mouth Tailgate Procedures |url=http://www.fau.edu/campuslife/tailgate.php |website=Florida Atlantic University Homepage |accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"Boca\", meaning ''mouth'' in Spanish, was a common term to describe an [[inlet]] on maps by sailors. The true meaning of the word \"ratones\" for the area is more uncertain. Some claim that the word \"ratones\" appears in old Spanish maritime dictionaries referring to \"rugged rocks or stony ground on the bottom of some ports and coastal outlets, where the cables rub against.\"<ref>The Spanish Maritime Dictionary of 1831</ref> Thus, one possible translation of \"Boca Raton\" is \"rugged inlet\".<ref>{{Citation| last1 = Ruiz | first1 = Humberto E. | last2 = Cobia | first2 = Manley F.| title = Boca de Ratones: An Etymological Reassessment| url =http://www.bocahistory.org/eGallery/upload/Boca%20Raton%20Historical%20Society/Boca%20Raton%20Historical%20Society/Files/bocaderatones_origin.pdf| access-date = March 23, 2018}}</ref> Still other people claim that \"ratones\" referred to thieves who hid out in the area, and thus the name could translate to \"thieves' inlet\".\n\n===Pronunciation===\nResidents of the city have kept the pronunciation of Boca Raton similar to its Spanish origins. In particular, the \"Raton\" in \"Boca Raton\" is pronounced as {{IPAc-en||r|\u0259|\u02c8|t|o\u028a|n}} instead of {{IPAc-en|r|\u0259|\u02c8|t|\u0252|n}}.

Much of the [[Boca Raton Army Airfield]] was later donated to Palm Beach County and became the grounds of [[Florida Atlantic University]]. Many of FAU's parking lots are former runways of the airbase. When viewed from above, the site's layout for its previous use as an airfield is plainly evident.

In 1965, well before the extension of [[Interstate 95 in Florida|I-95]] into Southern Florida, IBM, working in secret with the Arvida corporation, quietly purchased several hundred acres of real estate west of the [[CSX]] rail line and northwest of [[Florida Atlantic University]].

Starting in 1987, IBM relocated its manufacturing for what became the IBM PC division to [[Research Triangle Park]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and converted the cavernous manufacturing facilities into offices and laboratories, later producing products such as the [[OS/2]] operating system and VoiceType Dictation, later known as [[ViaVoice]] voice-recognition [[software]].\n\nIBM maintained its facilities in the South Florida area until 1996, when the facility was closed and sold to Blue Lake Real Estate. The site was sold to T-REX Management Consortium, then to the Blackstone Group in 2005, who renamed it the Boca Corporate Center and Campus.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.palmbeachpost.com/business/new-owner-gives-new-life-former-home-ibm-boca/VWruh7ueJs3zCOZnMj1x9N/|title=New owner gives new life to former home of IBM in Boca|last=Clough|first=Alexandra|date=September 23, 2016|work=The Palm Beach Post|access-date=February 18, 2019}}</ref>  The site was later renamed the Boca Raton Innovation Campus (BRiC).

It is named after [[Don Estridge]], whose team was responsible for developing the [[IBM PC]]. IBM returned in July 2001, opening the software development laboratory at Beacon Square off Congress Avenue.\n\nIt is noteworthy that still left standing inside the old IBM complex is the office and conference table where [[Bill Gates]] signed his historic deal to supply IBM with the [[Microsoft]] [[MS-DOS]] operating system for its personal computer line.\n\n====Suburban expansion====\nIn the 1980s, because of an explosion of development to the west of the historical center of the city, some eastern areas began to decay, including the downtown corridor. For instance, the old Boca Raton Mall, a [[shopping mall]] in the downtown area, was beginning to experience higher vacancy, and occupancy by marginal tenants, owing to the opening of [[Town Center at Boca Raton]] west of the city in 1980.\n[[File:Palmetto Park Rd and Mizner Blvd 2.jpg|thumb|right|Palmetto Park Road and Mizner Boulevard intersection.]]\n\nIn 1991, the new downtown outdoor shopping and dining center, [[Mizner Park]], was completed over the site of the old Boca Raton Mall. It has since become a cultural center for southern Palm Beach County. Featuring a landscaped central park between the two main roads (collectively called Plaza Real) with stores only on the outside of the roads, Mizner Park resembles a Mediterranean suburban \"town center\" with a more contemporary look. It features many restaurants and is home to the [[Boca Raton Museum of Art]], which moved to the new facility in 2001.<ref>{{cite web |title = Boca Raton Museum of Art | url=http://www.bocamuseum.org/index.php?submenu=about_us&src=gendocs&link=AboutUs&category=About%20Us |postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> In 2002, a new [[amphitheater]] was built, replacing a smaller one and providing a large-capacity outdoor venue where concerts and other performances are held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miznerparkamp.com/ |title=miznerparkamp.com |accessdate=June 30, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801203604/http://miznerparkamp.com/ |archivedate=August 1, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMizner Park has significantly aided downtown revitalization. Many new eight- to ten-story mixed-use buildings have been constructed, are under construction, or are proposed for the downtown area. The surrounding areas to the downtown have benefited from the downtown redevelopment.\n\nThe [[National Cartoon Museum]] built a {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility on the southwest edge of Mizner Park in 1996. Open for six years, the museum relocated to its original home in [[New York City]] in 2002. Building renovations for public uses, including the local public TV station, and private uses, such as a locally owned and operated bookstore, were completed in 2008.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there.

FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel. Emil Junker was the new club chairman and it was his second period as chairman, after his short period in 1927. Junker toll over as club president from Franz Rinderer.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Heinz K\u00f6rner]] was appointed as new team manager. He followed [[Alwin Riemke]] who moved to Germany to manage [[SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth]]. K\u00f6rner had been manager of [[FC Aarau|Aarau]] the previous season. He was the tenth professional team manager/trainer in Basel's history, their tenth foreign trainer. How long K\u00f6rner stayed with the club is not clearly stated, but he left during the season, and afterwards [[Fernand Jaccard]] took over as player-manager. Jaccard was the club's first professional Swiss trainer. Basel played a total of 40 matches in their 1936\u201337 season. 26 of these matches were in the [[Swiss Super League|Nationalliga]], one in the [[Swiss Cup]] and 13 were friendly matches. Of these 13 friendlies eight were played at home in the [[Landhof]], three others in Switzerland and one each as visitors to [[RC Strasbourg Alsace|RC Strasbourg]] and to [[SC Freiburg]].<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Bilanz Saison 1936/37\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1936/37 | title = Bilanz Saison 1936/37 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nFurther league reforms took place before the season started. The number of teams in the [[1936\u201337 Nationalliga]] was reduced by one team, thus contested by 13 teams and played as round-robin. Two teams were to be relegated and only one promoted to reduce the number of teams to 12 the following year. Basel played a very poor and un-consistent season. Only thanks to four consecutive victories towards the end of the camopain lifted the team to finish in joint second last position in the league table. Because [[FC La Chaux-de-Fonds|La Chaux-de-Fonds]] and Basel both had 20 points, they had to have a play-off against relegation. This ended in a draw and so a replay was required. The replay was played in the [[Stadion Neufeld]] in [[Bern]] on 20 June 1937 and ended in a 1\u20130 victory for Basel and so they prevented relegation at the last possible moment.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-play off fcb-lcdf 1936/37\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=28212 | title = FC Basel - FC La Chaux-de-Fonds 1:0 (1:0) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1st principal round of the [[Swiss Cup]] Basel were drawn at home in the [[Landhof]] against lower tier [[FC Concordia Basel|Concordia Basel]] and were defeated and knocked out of the competition.

FC Basel played their home games in the [[Landhof]] in the district Wettstein in Kleinbasel. Emil Junker was the new club chairman and it was his second period as chairman, after his short period in 1927. Junker toll over as club president from Franz Rinderer.\n\n== Overview ==\n[[Heinz K\u00f6rner]] was appointed as new team manager. He followed [[Alwin Riemke]] who moved to Germany to manage [[SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth]]. K\u00f6rner had been manager of [[FC Aarau|Aarau]] the previous season. He was the tenth professional team manager/trainer in Basel's history, their tenth foreign trainer. How long K\u00f6rner stayed with the club is not clearly stated, but he left during the season, and afterwards [[Fernand Jaccard]] took over as player-manager. Jaccard was the club's first professional Swiss trainer. Basel played a total of 40 matches in their 1936\u201337 season. 26 of these matches were in the [[Swiss Super League|Nationalliga]], one in the [[Swiss Cup]] and 13 were friendly matches. Of these 13 friendlies eight were played at home in the [[Landhof]], three others in Switzerland and one each as visitors to [[RC Strasbourg Alsace|RC Strasbourg]] and to [[SC Freiburg]].<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-Bilanz Saison 1936/37\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/bilanz?saison=1936/37 | title = Bilanz Saison 1936/37 | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nFurther league reforms took place before the season started. The number of teams in the [[1936\u201337 Nationalliga]] was reduced by one team, thus contested by 13 teams and played as round-robin. Two teams were to be relegated and only one promoted to reduce the number of teams to 12 the following year. Basel played a very poor and un-consistent season. Only thanks to four consecutive victories towards the end of the camopain lifted the team to finish in joint second last position in the league table. Because [[FC La Chaux-de-Fonds|La Chaux-de-Fonds]] and Basel both had 20 points, they had to have a play-off against relegation. This ended in a draw and so a replay was required. The replay was played in the [[Stadion Neufeld]] in [[Bern]] on 20 June 1937 and ended in a 1\u20130 victory for Basel and so they prevented relegation at the last possible moment.<ref name=\"fcb-achiv-play off fcb-lcdf 1936/37\">{{cite web | first = | last = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = https://www.fcb-archiv.ch/saison/spiele?command=detail&id=28212 | title = FC Basel - FC La Chaux-de-Fonds 1:0 (1:0) | format = | work = | publisher = Verein \"Basler Fussballarchiv\u201d | accessdate = 2019-11-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1st principal round of the [[Swiss Cup]] Basel were drawn at home in the [[Landhof]] against lower tier [[FC Concordia Basel|Concordia Basel]] and were defeated and knocked out of the competition.
