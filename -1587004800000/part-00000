The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

Corsair originally developed [[CPU cache|level 2 cache modules]], called [[cache on a stick]] (COASt) modules, for OEMs.  After Intel incorporated the L2 cache in the processor with the release of its [[Pentium Pro]] processor family, Corsair changed its focus to [[DRAM]] modules, primarily in the server market.  In 2002, Corsair began shipping DRAM modules that were designed to appeal to computer enthusiasts, who were using them for [[overclocking]].  Since then, Corsair has continued to produce memory modules for PCs, and has added other PC components as well.\n\nCorsair expanded its DRAM memory module production into the high end market for overclocking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/1148 | publisher=AnandTech | title=Corsair TwinX1024-4000 PRO: Improving DDR500 Performance | date=15 September 2003 | accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref> This expansion allows for high power platforms and the ability to get more performance out of the CPU and RAM.

Corsair originally developed [[CPU cache|level 2 cache modules]], called [[cache on a stick]] (COASt) modules, for OEMs.  After Intel incorporated the L2 cache in the processor with the release of its [[Pentium Pro]] processor family, Corsair changed its focus to [[DRAM]] modules, primarily in the server market.  In 2002, Corsair began shipping DRAM modules that were designed to appeal to computer enthusiasts, who were using them for [[overclocking]].  Since then, Corsair has continued to produce memory modules for PCs, and has added other PC components as well.\n\nCorsair expanded its DRAM memory module production into the high end market for overclocking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/1148 | publisher=AnandTech | title=Corsair TwinX1024-4000 PRO: Improving DDR500 Performance | date=15 September 2003 | accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref> This expansion allows for high power platforms and the ability to get more performance out of the CPU and RAM.
