The first person to report the existence of the Badut temple was Maureen Brecher, a Dutch controller who worked in Malang. The Badut Temple was restored in 1925-1926 under the supervision of B.

The group employs more than 21,000 people and has operations in 75 nations.<ref>[https://kapital.no/people-index/cecilie-paus Cecilie Paus] in [[Kapital (magazine)|Kapital]]</ref> The Wilhelmsen group operates the largest maritime network in the world, with over 2200 locations worldwide.<ref>[https://www.maritime-executive.com/magazine/shaping-the-maritime-industry Shaping the Maritime Industry]</ref> They deliver products and services to over half of the world's merchant fleet, along with crew and technical management to the biggest vessels at sea. The company has recently explored opportunities within renewable energy, alternative fuels as well as offshore and technology industries.\n\nThe WW group had an operating profit of 339 million [[United States dollars]] according to figures published in February 2015 and is listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]]. It was founded on 1 October 1861 in [[T\u00f8nsberg]]. Though the company's first vessel was the ''Mathilde'' in 1886, they started making profits only after the vessel ''Talabot'' in 1887. Thence, all their ships have been named, started with the letter \"T\", often leading to the same name given repeatedly to different ships over time. For example, there have been at least four ships named ''Talabot'' ranging from tankers to [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro vessels]].\n\nSince 1978 the main owners have been the siblings [[Cecilie Paus]] and Helen Juell, and their now deceased brothers [[Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (born 1937)|Wilhelm Wilhelmsen]] and Finn Wilhelmsen.<ref>''[[Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv]]'', 17 September 2009</ref> Their children, the fifth generation of the Wilhelmsen family, includes CEO [[Thomas Wilhelmsen]], his sisters Monica Wilhelmsen and Julie Wilhelmsen, and his cousins [[Olympia Paus]], [[Pontine Paus]], Cathrine Loevenskiold Wilhelmsen, Hedvig Juell, Maren Juell, Hannah Wilhelmsen.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Wilhelmsen Lines Car Carrier Dublin.jpg|thumb|NOSAC tonnage]]\nIn 1861, the company was founded by [[Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (1839\u20131910)|(Morten) Wilhelm Wilhelmsen]] in the town of [[T\u00f8nsberg, Norway]]. During the next two decades, Wilhelmsen's fleet increased with an average of one ship per year and by 1886 Wilhelmsen was T\u00f8nsberg's largest shipowner.\n\nIn 1886, Wilhelmsen's eldest son, [[Halfdan Wilhelmsen]] joined the firm and was instrumental in the company's move from sail ships to its first steamship. In late 1887, the company acquired the 1,800-ton freighter, ''Talabot''. The steamship was a profitable investment for the Wilhelmsens and the letter \"T\" became synonymous with the company's naming tradition for its vessels.\n\nIn 1890, Halfdan Wilhelmsen laid the basis of the company's core business - liner trades. In 1911 NAAL (The Norwegian Africa and Australia Line) was established.\n\nA turning point in the expansion of the [[Roll-on/roll-off]] operations was the full acquisition in November 1995 of NAL ([[Norwegian America Line]]) and its 7 Car Carriers.\nNAL also owned a 70% stake in NOSAC (Norwegian Specialised Autocarcarriers), already in partnership with Wilh. Wilhelmsen Line, that was owning the remaining 30% share. \nAt that time, NAL was facing a cargo volume downturn and an overall profits reduction, that made register lower than expected financial results in 1994-1995.\nHowever the NOSAC takeover was fundamental not only to increase the fleet of nearly further 20 Car Carrier vessels, but also to fully step into the Korean market, where the company was previously awarded [[Kia Motors]] contract to ship cars from [[South Korea]] to [[United States]], from 1996 to 1998.<ref>https://www.marinemoneyoffshore.com/node/6287</ref>\n\n===Wilhelmsen family===\nThe company's owners, the Wilhelmsen family, are descended from Wilhelm Zachariassen Holst (ca. 1732\u20131807), who worked at [[Vall\u00f8 saltverk]]. His great-grandson was shipping magnate [[Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (1839\u20131910)|(Morten) Wilhelm Wilhelmsen]] (1839\u20131910), the founder of Wilh. Wilhelmsen. He was the father of ship-owner Halfdan Wilhelmsen (1864\u20131923), factory owner Finn Wilhelmsen (1867\u20131951), ship-owner Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (1872\u20131955) and businessman Axel Wilhelmsen (1881\u20131957).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://snl.no/Wilhelmsen |title=Wilhelmsen \u2013 Store norske leksikon |work=snl.no |year=2012 |accessdate=28 August 2012|language=no}}</ref>\n\nHalfdan Wilhelmsen was the father of [[Mistress of the Robes]] Else Werring (1905\u201389), married to ship-owner Niels Roth Heyerdahl Werring (1897\u20131990). Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (1872) was the father of ship-owner Tom Wilhelmsen (1911\u201378), who was the father of the owners of the Wilh. Wilhelmsen company: Morten Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (1937-2020), [[Cecilie Paus]] (born 1943) and Helen Juell (born 1947). Cecilie Paus is the mother of fashion designer [[Pontine Paus]] and of Olympia Paus, wife of [[Alexander Nix]].<ref>[https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/alexander-nix-norske-kone-er-rederarving-og-star-midt-i-facebook-skandalen/69689638 Alexander Nix' norske kone er rederarving], ''[[Dagbladet]]''</ref>\n\n==Current operations==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2009}}\n\n=== Shipping ===\n[[File:Tortugas IMO 9319765 photo-1.jpg|thumb|MV ''Tortugas'' at the [[Port of Rotterdam]], the Netherlands, 2008|alt=MV Tortugas at the Port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 2008]]\nWW conducts shipping activities and specialises in roll-on roll off cargo, especially for large project and awkward cargoes like train coaches, small aircraft and large industrial machinery. This is aided by the fact that their Ro-ro vessels have large ramps that can support up to 420 tonnes cargo weight at a time. Together with its partners ([[EUKOR]] and [[Wallenius Lines]]), the group controls some 160 car and [[roll-on/roll-off]] carriers operating in a global network of trades. Its customers include manufacturers of cars{{which|date=April 2013}} as well as construction and [[agricultural machinery]].{{which|date=April 2013}} In the [[car carrier]] market, they are the third largest carrier tonnage wise after [[Mitsui O.S.K. Lines|MOL]] and [[Nippon Yusen|NYK Line]]. On an annual basis, WW's shipping companies transport 5 million cars and 12 million cubic metres of high and heavy and non-containerised cargoes.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe group both owns and charters vessels, which are deployed in the fleets operated by subsidiaries [[Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics]], [[American Roll-on Roll-off Carrier]], [[United European Car Carriers]] and [[EUKOR]] Car Carriers. This last, corresponding to the former [[Roll-on/roll-off]] division of [[Hyundai Merchant Marine]], was jointly acquired for an 80% by Wilhelmsen and Wallenius Line in November 2002, once the European Commission officially cleared the purchase and consequent re-branding.<ref>http://www.mondaq.com/content/pr_article.asp?pr_id=558</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, Wilh. Wilhelmsen acquired the {{Ship|MV|T\u00f8nsberg}}, first of a [[ship class|class]] of \"Mark V\" roro ships built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries; they are the largest roro ships in the world.<ref name=Motorship>{{cite news|title=Wilhelmsen new ro-ro is biggest ever|url=http://www.motorship.com/features101/ships-and-shipyards/wilhelmsen-new-ro-ro-is-biggest-ever|accessdate=1 July 2012|newspaper=The Motorship|date=28 May 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Logistics services ===\nIn association with maritime transport, WW offers various types of [[logistics]] service on land \u2013 terminal and technical services, procurement of inland transport and [[supply chain management]] for vehicles. In addition to logistical services offered through WWL, the WW group has interests in [[South Korea]]'s [[Glovis]], [[Australia]]'s Kaplan and the two US companies American Auto Logistics and American Logistics Network.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n=== Maritime services ===\nWW's wholly owned Wilhelmsen Maritime Services (WMS) subsidiary offers services like agencies in many ports. These earlier were marketed under the name \"BARWIL\" (named after Barber - Wilhelmsen) and is one of the world's largest providers of third-party ship management services.<ref>[http://www.edumaritime.com/shipping-logistics-career/wilh-wilhelmsen-group Careers at Wilhelmsen]</ref>\n\nWilhelmsen Ship Management, the WMS crewing and management company, at one time managed roughly 290 vessels and has a pool of 10 000 seagoing personnel.\n\n=== Accidents and casualties ===\nDuring the early hours of 14 December 2002, [[MV Tricolor]] (ex Nosac Sun, built in 1987) was sailing from Zeebrugge, Belgium to Southampton, U.K., with a load of nearly 2871 brand new [[BMW]], [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] and [[Saab AB|SAAB]] automobiles. \nShe collided in the English Channel with mv Kariba, a 1982 Bahamian-flagged container ship. Kariba was able to continue on, but Tricolor sank and required salvage by wreck cutting. No casualties occurred.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20110913164335/http://www.wilhelmsen.com/about/press/newsandpress/Pages/Tricolorwreckremovalcontractsignedtoday.aspx</ref>\n\nIn between end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, at least two operated vessels (''MV Thalatta'' and ''MV Morning Composer'') heading towards Australian ports, were stopped by the Australian authorities being suspected to carry cargo contaminated by the presence of the [[Brown marmorated stink bug]]. The vessels faced serious delays, and were asked to leave [[Australia]] [[territorial waters]] after a long wait at anchorage,<ref>https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/hot-port-news-from-gac-795/</ref> being finally denied to enter any port until new [[fumigation]] performed on all cargo.\n\n== List of current Wilhelmsen Lines ships ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n|+List of ships as of January 2011\n|-\n!

It was founded on 1 October 1861 in [[T\u00f8nsberg]]. Though the company's first vessel was the ''Mathilde'' in 1886, they started making profits only after the vessel ''Talabot'' in 1887. Thence, all their ships have been named, started with the letter \"T\", often leading to the same name given repeatedly to different ships over time. For example, there have been at least four ships named ''Talabot'' ranging from tankers to [[Roll-on/roll-off|ro-ro vessels]].\n\nSince 1978 the main owners have been the siblings [[Cecilie Paus]] and Helen Juell, and their now deceased brothers [[Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (born 1937)|Wilhelm Wilhelmsen]] and Finn Wilhelmsen.<ref>''[[Dagens N\u00e6ringsliv]]'', 17 September 2009</ref> Their children, the fifth generation of the Wilhelmsen family, includes [[Thomas Wilhelmsen]] and his cousins [[Olympia Paus]] and [[Pontine Paus]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Wilhelmsen Lines Car Carrier Dublin.jpg|thumb|NOSAC tonnage]]\nIn 1861, the company was founded by [[Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (1839\u20131910)|(Morten) Wilhelm Wilhelmsen]] in the town of [[T\u00f8nsberg, Norway]]. During the next two decades, Wilhelmsen's fleet increased with an average of one ship per year and by 1886 Wilhelmsen was T\u00f8nsberg's largest shipowner.\n\nIn 1886, Wilhelmsen's eldest son, [[Halfdan Wilhelmsen]] joined the firm and was instrumental in the company's move from sail ships to its first steamship. In late 1887, the company acquired the 1,800-ton freighter, ''Talabot''. The steamship was a profitable investment for the Wilhelmsens and the letter \"T\" became synonymous with the company's naming tradition for its vessels.\n\nIn 1890, Halfdan Wilhelmsen laid the basis of the company's core business - liner trades. In 1911 NAAL (The Norwegian Africa and Australia Line) was established.\n\nA turning point in the expansion of the [[Roll-on/roll-off]] operations was the full acquisition in November 1995 of NAL ([[Norwegian America Line]]) and its 7 Car Carriers.\nNAL also owned a 70% stake in NOSAC (Norwegian Specialised Autocarcarriers), already in partnership with Wilh. Wilhelmsen Line, that was owning the remaining 30% share. \nAt that time, NAL was facing a cargo volume downturn and an overall profits reduction, that made register lower than expected financial results in 1994-1995.\nHowever the NOSAC takeover was fundamental not only to increase the fleet of nearly further 20 Car Carrier vessels, but also to fully step into the Korean market, where the company was previously awarded [[Kia Motors]] contract to ship cars from [[South Korea]] to [[United States]], from 1996 to 1998.<ref>https://www.marinemoneyoffshore.com/node/6287</ref>\n\n===Wilhelmsen family===\nThe company's owners, the Wilhelmsen family, are descended from Wilhelm Zachariassen Holst (ca. 1732\u20131807), probably of [[Holstein]] origin, who worked at [[Vall\u00f8 saltverk]]. His great-grandson was shipping magnate [[Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (1839\u20131910)|(Morten) Wilhelm Wilhelmsen]] (1839\u20131910), the founder of Wilh. Wilhelmsen. He was the father of ship-owner Halfdan Wilhelmsen (1864\u20131923), factory owner Finn Wilhelmsen (1867\u20131951), ship-owner Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (1872\u20131955) and businessman Axel Wilhelmsen (1881\u20131957).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://snl.no/Wilhelmsen |title=Wilhelmsen \u2013 Store norske leksikon |work=snl.no |year=2012 |accessdate=28 August 2012|language=no}}</ref>\n\nHalfdan Wilhelmsen was the father of [[Mistress of the Robes]] Else Werring (1905\u201389), married to ship-owner Niels Roth Heyerdahl Werring (1897\u20131990). Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (1872) was the father of ship-owner Tom Wilhelmsen (1911\u201378), who was the father of the current owners of the Wilh. Wilhelmsen company: Morten Wilhelm Wilhelmsen (born 1937), [[Cecilie Paus]] (born 1943) and Helen Juell (born 1947). Cecilie Paus is the mother of fashion designer [[Pontine Paus]] and of Olympia Paus, wife of [[Alexander Nix]].<ref>[https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/alexander-nix-norske-kone-er-rederarving-og-star-midt-i-facebook-skandalen/69689638 Alexander Nix' norske kone er rederarving], ''[[Dagbladet]]''</ref>\n\n==Current operations==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2009}}\n\n=== Shipping ===\n[[File:Tortugas IMO 9319765 photo-1.jpg|thumb|MV ''Tortugas'' at the [[Port of Rotterdam]], the Netherlands, 2008|alt=MV Tortugas at the Port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, 2008]]\nWW conducts shipping activities and specialises in roll-on roll off cargo, especially for large project and awkward cargoes like train coaches, small aircraft and large industrial machinery. This is aided by the fact that their Ro-ro vessels have large ramps that can support up to 420 tonnes cargo weight at a time. Together with its partners ([[EUKOR]] and [[Wallenius Lines]]), the group controls some 160 car and [[roll-on/roll-off]] carriers operating in a global network of trades. Its customers include manufacturers of cars{{which|date=April 2013}} as well as construction and [[agricultural machinery]].{{which|date=April 2013}} In the [[car carrier]] market, they are the third largest carrier tonnage wise after [[Mitsui O.S.K.

On an annual basis, WW's shipping companies transport 5 million cars and 12 million cubic metres of high and heavy and non-containerised cargoes.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe group both owns and charters vessels, which are deployed in the fleets operated by subsidiaries [[Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics]], [[American Roll-on Roll-off Carrier]], [[United European Car Carriers]] and [[EUKOR]] Car Carriers. This last, corresponding to the former [[Roll-on/roll-off]] division of [[Hyundai Merchant Marine]], was jointly acquired for an 80% by Wilhelmsen and Wallenius Line in November 2002, once the European Commission officially cleared the purchase and consequent re-branding.<ref>http://www.mondaq.com/content/pr_article.asp?pr_id=558</ref>\n\nIn June 2011, Wilh.

The vessels faced serious delays, and were asked to leave [[Australia]] [[territorial waters]] after a long wait at anchorage,<ref>https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/hot-port-news-from-gac-795/</ref> being finally denied to enter any port until new [[fumigation]] performed on all cargo.\n\n== List of current Wilhelmsen Lines ships ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n|+List of ships as of January 2011\n|-\n!

It was founded by lead singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]].  Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the best known being [[Dave Grohl]], who joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|death of Cobain]], their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern [[rock and roll]] culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle [[grunge]] scene, releasing its first album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', for the independent record label [[Sub Pop]] in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label [[DGC Records]] in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", the first single from their landmark second album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/nevermind-at-25-how-nirvanas-1991-album-changed-the-cultural-lan/|title=Nevermind at 25: how Nirvana's 1991 album changed the cultural landscape|last=Hall|first=James|date=September 24, 2016|work=The Telegraph|access-date=December 2, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Nirvana's sudden success popularized [[alternative rock]], and Cobain found himself described as the \"spokesman of a generation\" and Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of [[Generation X]].<ref>Azerrad, Michael.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109140249/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nirvana/articles/story/5937982/inside_the_heart_and_mind_of_nirvana \"Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana\"].

Its abrasive, less mainstream sound challenged the band's audience, and though less successful than ''Nevermind'', it was a commercial success. Nirvana disbanded following the death of Cobain in 1994. Various posthumous releases have been  overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow [[Courtney Love]]. The posthumous live album ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]'' (1994) won the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 1996.\n\nDuring their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana was awarded an [[American Music Awards|American Music Award]], [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]], [[Grammy Award]], seven [[MTV Video Music Award]]s and two [[NME Awards]].

Nirvana utilized dynamic contrasts in its music, present in this song in the form of a sparse two-note guitar verse guitar melody and choruses of strummed [[power chord]]s.<ref name=\"Chappel\">Chappell, Jon. \"Nirvana's music\". ''Guitar''.

The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 103\u20134</ref> Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between \"spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals\".<ref>Kanter, L.A. \"Kurt Cobain's Well-Tempered Tantrums\". ''Guitar Player''. February 1992.</ref> Near the end of his life, Cobain said the band had become bored of the \"limited\" formula, but expressed doubt that they were skilled enough to try other dynamics.<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" />\n\nCobain's rhythm guitar style, which relied on [[power chord]]s, low-note riffs, and a loose left-handed technique, featured the key components to the band's songs. Cobain would often initially play a song's verse riff in a clean tone, then double it with distorted guitars when he repeated the part. In some songs the guitar would be absent from the verses entirely to allow the drums and bass guitar to support the vocals, or it would only play sparse melodies like the two-note pattern used in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Cobain rarely played standard guitar solos, opting to play variations of the song's melody as single note lines. Cobain's solos were mostly blues-based and discordant, which music writer Jon Chappell described as \"almost an iconoclastic parody of the traditional instrumental break\", a quality typified by the note-for-note replication of the lead melody in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and the atonal solo for \"Breed\".<ref name=\"Chappel\" /> The band had no formal musical training; Cobain said: \"I have no concept of knowing how to be a musician at all what-so-ever... I couldn't even pass Guitar 101\".<ref>Nirvana Rare Full Interview 1993 [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rhotCKLwcQ&t=1m57s] Seattle,  August 10, 1993.

I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all\".<ref>Robb, John. \"White Heat\". ''Sounds''. October 21, 1989.</ref> Cobain told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 1993 that he \"didn't give a flying fuck\" what the lyrics on ''Bleach'' were about, figuring \"Let's just scream some negative lyrics and as long as they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay\", while the lyrics to ''Nevermind'' were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from.

''Spin''. October 1993.</ref> Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, \"I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [.. The songs are] like a mixture of both of them.

It was founded by lead singer and guitarist [[Kurt Cobain]] and bassist [[Krist Novoselic]].  Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the best known being [[Dave Grohl]], who joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the [[Suicide of Kurt Cobain|death of Cobain]], their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern [[rock and roll]] culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle [[grunge]] scene, releasing its first album, ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', for the independent record label [[Sub Pop]] in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label [[DGC Records]] in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]\", the first single from their landmark second album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, the album went on to be certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/nevermind-at-25-how-nirvanas-1991-album-changed-the-cultural-lan/|title=Nevermind at 25: how Nirvana's 1991 album changed the cultural landscape|last=Hall|first=James|date=September 24, 2016|work=The Telegraph|access-date=December 2, 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Nirvana's sudden success popularized [[alternative rock]], and Cobain found himself described as the \"spokesman of a generation\" and Nirvana the \"flagship band\" of [[Generation X]].<ref>Azerrad, Michael.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080109140249/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nirvana/articles/story/5937982/inside_the_heart_and_mind_of_nirvana \"Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana\"].

Its abrasive, less mainstream sound challenged the band's audience, and though less successful than ''Nevermind'', it was a commercial success. Nirvana disbanded following the death of Cobain in 1994. Various posthumous releases have been  overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow [[Courtney Love]]. The posthumous live album ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]'' (1994) won the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]] in 1996.\n\nDuring their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana was awarded an [[American Music Awards|American Music Award]], [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]], [[Grammy Award]], seven [[MTV Video Music Award]]s and two [[NME Awards]].

Nirvana utilized dynamic contrasts in its music, present in this song in the form of a sparse two-note guitar verse guitar melody and choruses of strummed [[power chord]]s.<ref name=\"Chappel\">Chappell, Jon. \"Nirvana's music\". ''Guitar''. June 1993.</ref>}}\nCobain described Nirvana's initial sound as \"a [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and [[Scratch Acid]] ripoff\".<ref name=\"Azerrad, 1994. p. 294\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 294</ref> When Nirvana recorded ''Bleach'', Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the Sub Pop grunge sound to build a fanbase, and suppressed his arty and pop songwriting in favor of a more rock sound.<ref name=\"Az 102\">Azerrad, 1994. p. 102</ref> Nirvana biographer [[Michael Azerrad]] argued, \"Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound that helped the band find its musical identity.\" Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that they had grown up listening to [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Aerosmith]], they had been able to move on from their derivative early sound.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 103</ref>\n\nNirvana used dynamic shifts that went from quiet to loud.<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" /> Cobain sought to mix heavy and pop musical sounds, saying, \"I wanted to be totally [[Led Zeppelin]] in a way and then be totally extreme punk rock and then do real wimpy pop songs.\" When Cobain heard the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]' 1988 album ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' after recording ''Bleach'', he felt it had the sound he wanted to achieve but had been too intimidated to try. The Pixies' subsequent popularity encouraged Cobain to follow his instincts as a songwriter.<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 103\u20134</ref> Like the Pixies, Nirvana moved between \"spare bass-and-drum grooves and shrill bursts of screaming guitar and vocals\".<ref>Kanter, L.A. \"Kurt Cobain's Well-Tempered Tantrums\". ''Guitar Player''. February 1992.</ref> Near the end of his life, Cobain said the band had become bored of the \"limited\" formula, but expressed doubt that they were skilled enough to try other dynamics.<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" />\n\nCobain's rhythm guitar style, which relied on [[power chord]]s, low-note riffs, and a loose left-handed technique, featured the key components to the band's songs. Cobain would often initially play a song's verse riff in a clean tone, then double it with distorted guitars when he repeated the part. In some songs the guitar would be absent from the verses entirely to allow the drums and bass guitar to support the vocals, or it would only play sparse melodies like the two-note pattern used in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Cobain rarely played standard guitar solos, opting to play variations of the song's melody as single note lines. Cobain's solos were mostly blues-based and discordant, which music writer Jon Chappell described as \"almost an iconoclastic parody of the traditional instrumental break\", a quality typified by the note-for-note replication of the lead melody in \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and the atonal solo for \"Breed\".<ref name=\"Chappel\" /> The band had no formal musical training; Cobain said: \"I have no concept of knowing how to be a musician at all what-so-ever... I couldn't even pass Guitar 101\".<ref>Nirvana Rare Full Interview 1993 [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rhotCKLwcQ&t=1m57s] Seattle,  August 10, 1993.

''[[Melody Maker]]''. March 18, 1989.</ref> Cobain came up with the basic components of each song (usually writing them on an acoustic guitar), as well as the singing style and the lyrics. He emphasized that Novoselic and Grohl \"have a big part in deciding on how long a song should be and how many parts it should have. So I don't like to be considered the sole songwriter\".<ref name=\"making Nevermind\">di Perna, Alan. \"The Making of ''Nevermind''\". ''Guitar World''.

I guess I start with the verse and then go into the chorus\".<ref name=\"FrickeRS1994\" />\n\nCobain usually wrote lyrics for songs minutes before recording them.<ref name=\"making Nevermind\" /> Cobain said, \"When I write a song the lyrics are the least important subject. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all\".<ref>Robb, John. \"White Heat\". ''Sounds''. October 21, 1989.</ref> Cobain told ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' in 1993 that he \"didn't give a flying fuck\" what the lyrics on ''Bleach'' were about, figuring \"Let's just scream some negative lyrics and as long as they're not sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay\", while the lyrics to ''Nevermind'' were taken from two years of poetry he had accumulated, which he cut up and chose lines he preferred from. In comparison, Cobain stated that the lyrics to ''In Utero'' were \"more focused, they're almost built on themes\".<ref name=\"smashing\">Steinke, Darcey. \"Smashing Their Heads on That Punk Rock\". ''Spin''. October 1993.</ref> Cobain didn't write necessarily in a linear fashion, instead relying on juxtapositions of contradictory images to convey emotions and ideas. Often in his lyrics, Cobain would present an idea then reject it; the songwriter explained, \"I'm such a nihilistic jerk half the time and other times I'm so vulnerable and sincere [.. The songs are] like a mixture of both of them. That's how most people my age are\".<ref>Azerrad, 1994. p. 210\u201311</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{See also|Alternative rock#Popularization in the 1990s|label 1=Alternative rock: Popularization in the 1990s}}\n[[File:EMP Museum - Nirvana (15632245508).jpg|left|thumb|240x240px|Nirvana memorabilia at [[EMP Museum]] in [[Seattle]], Washington]]\nNirvana is one of [[list of best-selling music artists|the best-selling bands]] of all time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">[http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/03/21/nirvana-vinyl-releases.html \"Nirvana catalogue to be released on vinyl\"].

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who become close while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe. The film is grounded in recent technological and theoretical advances, and attracted the attention of astronomers. The film received divided or mixed reviews from critics, and out of a handful of nominations from various bodies, won an award from the [[Austin Film Festival]], \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who become close while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe. The film is grounded in recent technological and theoretical advances, and attracted the attention of astronomers. The film received divided or mixed reviews from critics, and out of a handful of nominations from various bodies, won an award from the [[Austin Film Festival]], \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together.

It was released on February 11, 1994 by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn a rainy night, convicted bank robber Carl Quigley escapes from prison, and heads to a warehouse to recover a hidden safe box containing $1 million, which he hid there sometime before his arrest.\n\nThe film cuts to unhappy 6th grade boy Preston Waters, whose father works as an investor and is very [[frugal]] with money. When invited to classmate Butch's birthday party at an amusement park, Preston is not excited because Butch acts like a bully, and Preston can only afford the cheap rides. Preston also feels his parents favor his older brothers over him. His brothers got jobs and learned how to save. Preston got a birthday check, it is blank but his father filled it out for 11.00.  \n\nQuigley visits bank president Edward Biderman in his office to discuss his plan. As the stolen money was [[Marked bill|consecutive and traceable]], Biderman is to [[money laundering|exchange the marked bills for unmarked]]. Quigley explains that his assistant, Juice,  will be stopping by Biderman's office with a check to be cashed for $1 million the next day. Preston tries to deposit 11.00 in the bank account, but he needs 200.00 dollars to deposit. His nemesis Butch stole his 11.00 check and chases after him trying to get it back After the meeting, Quigley accidentally runs over Preston's bicycle while Preston was riding out of the bank's parking lot. Panicking as he sees a police car patrolling the area, Quigley gives Preston a signed blank check and tells him to give it to his dad so they can buy him a new bike.\n\nThat night, his parents are upset with him not looking after his bike and Preston was punished by his father being grounded for talking back at him. Preston fills out the check for $1 million by printing it on his computer. He goes to the bank the next day and is directed to Biderman's office by a teller. Mistaken that Juice has arrived, Biderman burns the check and gives Preston the money. As Preston is leaving the bank, the real Juice enters Biderman's office with a check for $1 million. Realizing that Biderman mistook Preston for Juice, the trio begins a frantic search for Preston.\n\nPreston embarks on an extreme shopping spree, buying a castle-style house (by outbidding Quigley using the voice box on his computer over the phone) along with many other expensive items. He covers himself by saying he is making purchases for a millionaire known as \"Macintosh\" (named after [[Macintosh Performa|the brand of his computer]]). He also makes friends with his limo driver, Henry, and uses the situation to get back at Butch and his brothers.\n\nDuring this time, Preston is being investigated by FBI agent Shay Stanley (working undercover as a teller at Biderman's bank and Preston's crush) for money laundering, as the bills he was using to make his purchases were Biderman's watermarked ones.\n\nA week later, Preston throws an elaborate birthday party for himself under the guise of Macintosh. His father shows up and asks Preston to come home; however, he does not know that Macintosh is his son. He confides in \"Macintosh\" that he is too hard on Preston, which moves Preston to tears. The party is shut down after Preston realizes he cannot pay for it, as he only has $332.17 remaining. Quigley, Juice and Biderman show up (after forcing Butch to give up Preston's contact information). They capture him and demand to know what happened with the money; Preston admits Macintosh is a false name, to which Biderman suggests that Quigley can use Preston's purchases and the Macintosh name to give himself a new identity. When the FBI show up, Quigley claims to be Macintosh, leading to the arrest of all three. Shay kisses Preston before parting ways, and Preston and Henry say their farewells.\n\nAfter Preston returns home, his family throws him a birthday party. When asked to make a wish, Preston thinks he already has everything he wished for, until he sees Shay's flyer from the bank and decides to make a wish about her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Brian Bonsall]] as Preston Waters\n*[[Karen Duffy]] as Shay Stanley\n*[[Miguel Ferrer]] as Carl Quigley aka Mr. Macintosh\n*[[Tone Loc]] as Juice\n*[[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Edward Biderman\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as Fred Waters\n*[[Jayne Atkinson]] as Sandra Waters\n*Michael Faustino as Ralph Waters\n*[[Chris Demetral]] as Damien Waters\n*[[Rick Ducommun]] as Henry\n*Maxwell Strachan as Quincy Carmichael\n*Alex Zuckerman as Butch\n*Alex Morris as Riggs\n*[[Debbie Allen]] as Yvonne\n*Mary Chris Wall as Betty Jay \n*[[Angee Hughes]] as Woman in Parking Lot\n*Frank Williamson as Preston's computer (Macintosh)\n\n==Production==\n''Blank Check'' was filmed in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[San Antonio]], and [[Dallas]]. The castle house that Preston buys was filmed at the Pemberton Castle (Fisher-Gideon House) at 1415 Wooldridge Drive in Austin, a Texas Historical Landmark, which is now owned by filmmaker [[Robert Rodriguez]]. The [[theme park]] in the beginning of the movie was [[Six Flags Fiesta Texas]]; several of the park's attractions, including [[The Rattler (roller coaster)|The Rattler]] and [[Power Surge (water ride)|Power Surge]], were filmed in this movie.\n\nThe bank featured in the movie is in the historic Alamo National Bank building. The bank lobby was featured and it has a 23 story office tower above it. The building opened in 1929, and today houses the Drury Plaza Hotel.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received poor reviews, with Peter Rainer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stating that what was \"missing from this film is any trace of the joy in simple pleasures.

It was released on February 11, 1994 by [[Walt Disney Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\nOn a rainy night, convicted bank robber Carl Quigley escapes from prison, and heads to a warehouse to recover a hidden safe box containing $1 million, which he hid there sometime before his arrest.\n\nThe film cuts to unhappy 6th grader boy Preston Waters, whose father works as an investor and is very [[frugal]] with money. When invited to classmate Butch's birthday party at an amusement park, Preston is not excited because Butch acts like a bully, and Preston can only afford the cheap rides. Preston also feels his parents favor his older brothers over him. His brothers got jobs and learned how to save. Preston got a birthday check, it is blank but his father filled it out for 11.00.  \n\nQuigley visits bank president Edward Biderman in his office to discuss his plan. As the stolen money was [[Marked bill|consecutive and traceable]], Biderman is to [[money laundering|exchange the marked bills for unmarked]]. Quigley explains that his assistant, Juice,  will be stopping by Biderman's office with a check to be cashed for $1 million the next day. Preston tries to deposit 11.00 in the bank account, but he needs 200.00 dollars to deposit. His nemesis Butch stole his 11.00 check and chases after him trying to get it back After the meeting, Quigley accidentally runs over Preston's bicycle while Preston was riding out of the bank's parking lot. Panicking as he sees a police car patrolling the area, Quigley gives Preston a signed blank check and tells him to give it to his dad so they can buy him a new bike.\n\nThat night, his parents are upset with him not looking after his bike and Preston was punished by his father being grounded for talking back at him. Preston fills out the check for $1 million by printing it on his computer. He goes to the bank the next day and is directed to Biderman's office by a teller. Mistaken that Juice has arrived, Biderman burns the check and gives Preston the money. As Preston is leaving the bank, the real Juice enters Biderman's office with a check for $1 million. Realizing that Biderman mistook Preston for Juice, the trio begins a frantic search for Preston.\n\nPreston embarks on an extreme shopping spree, buying a castle-style house (by outbidding Quigley using the voice box on his computer over the phone) along with many other expensive items. He covers himself by saying he is making purchases for a millionaire known as \"Macintosh\" (named after [[Macintosh Performa|the brand of his computer]]). He also makes friends with his limo driver, Henry, and uses the situation to get back at Butch and his brothers.\n\nDuring this time, Preston is being investigated by FBI agent Shay Stanley (working undercover as a teller at Biderman's bank and Preston's crush) for money laundering, as the bills he was using to make his purchases were Biderman's watermarked ones.\n\nA week later, Preston throws an elaborate birthday party for himself under the guise of Macintosh. His father shows up and asks Preston to come home; however, he does not know that Macintosh is his son. He confides in \"Macintosh\" that he is too hard on Preston, which moves Preston to tears. The party is shut down after Preston realizes he cannot pay for it, as he only has $332.17 remaining. Quigley, Juice and Biderman show up (after forcing Butch to give up Preston's contact information). They capture him and demand to know what happened with the money; Preston admits Macintosh is a false name, to which Biderman suggests that Quigley can use Preston's purchases and the Macintosh name to give himself a new identity. When the FBI show up, Quigley claims to be Macintosh, leading to the arrest of all three. Shay kisses Preston before parting ways, and Preston and Henry say their farewells.\n\nAfter Preston returns home, his family throws him a birthday party. When asked to make a wish, Preston thinks he already has everything he wished for, until he sees Shay's flyer from the bank and decides to make a wish about her.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Brian Bonsall]] as Preston Waters\n*[[Karen Duffy]] as Shay Stanley\n*[[Miguel Ferrer]] as Carl Quigley aka Mr. Macintosh\n*[[Tone Loc]] as Juice\n*[[Michael Lerner (actor)|Michael Lerner]] as Edward Biderman\n*[[James Rebhorn]] as Fred Waters\n*[[Jayne Atkinson]] as Sandra Waters\n*Michael Faustino as Ralph Waters\n*[[Chris Demetral]] as Damien Waters\n*[[Rick Ducommun]] as Henry\n*Maxwell Strachan as Quincy Carmichael\n*Alex Zuckerman as Butch\n*Alex Morris as Riggs\n*[[Debbie Allen]] as Yvonne\n*Mary Chris Wall as Betty Jay \n*[[Angee Hughes]] as Woman in Parking Lot\n*Frank Williamson as Preston's computer (Macintosh)\n\n==Production==\n''Blank Check'' was filmed in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[San Antonio]], and [[Dallas]]. The castle house that Preston buys was filmed at the Pemberton Castle (Fisher-Gideon House) at 1415 Wooldridge Drive in Austin, a Texas Historical Landmark, which is now owned by filmmaker [[Robert Rodriguez]]. The [[theme park]] in the beginning of the movie was [[Six Flags Fiesta Texas]]; several of the park's attractions, including [[The Rattler (roller coaster)|The Rattler]] and [[Power Surge (water ride)|Power Surge]], were filmed in this movie.\n\nThe bank featured in the movie is in the historic Alamo National Bank building. The bank lobby was featured and it has a 23 story office tower above it. The building opened in 1929, and today houses the Drury Plaza Hotel.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nThe film received poor reviews, with Peter Rainer of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stating that what was \"missing from this film is any trace of the joy in simple pleasures. Preston isn't a very imaginative child; he's a goodies gatherer.\"<ref>{{cite news|title= MOVIE REVIEW : 'Blank Check' Fantasy Buys Into Materialism|last=Rainer|first=Peter|newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1994-02-11|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-02-11/entertainment/ca-21523_1_blank-check-fantasy|accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that it \"looks like the best bet for family audiences in a season short on kiddie oriented entertainment.
