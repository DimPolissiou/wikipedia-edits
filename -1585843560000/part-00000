Together, the women created a dynamic and unexpected force, which existed in opposition to traditional constraints on women in [[Latin America]]. These mothers came together to push for information on their own children and this highlighted the human rights violations and the scale of the protest drew press attention, raising awareness on a local and global scale. Their persistence to publicly remember and try to find their children, the sustained group organisation, the use of symbols and slogans, and the silent weekly protests attracted reactive measures from those in power.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe military government considered these women to be politically subversive; the founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, [[Azucena Villaflor]] De Vincenti, who placed the names of 'the missing' in a newspaper in December 1977 (on International Human Rights Day) was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped,]] [[torture]]d and [[murder]]ed (later found to have been killed on a 'death flight' and her body disposed of in the sea),<ref name=\":0\" /> along with French nuns [[Alice Domon]] and [[L\u00e9onie Duquet]] who also supported the movement.

Eventually, the military has admitted that over 9,000 of those abducted are still unaccounted for, but the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo say that the number of missing is closer to 30,000. Most are presumed dead. Many of these prisoners were high school students, young professionals, and union workers who were suspected of having opposed the government.

In 1985, it began prosecution of men indicted for crimes, beginning with the [[Juicio a las Juntas|Trial of the Juntas]], in which several high-ranking military officers were convicted and sentenced.\n\nThe military threatened a coup to prevent a widening of prosecutions.

During the Kirchner's administration, prosecution of war crimes were re-opened. Former high-ranking military and security officers have been convicted and sentenced in new cases. Among the charges is the stealing of babies of the disappeared. The first major figure, [[Miguel Etchecolatz]], was convicted and sentenced in 2006.

[[Hebe de Bonafini]] continued to lead a more radical faction under the name Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Association. These mothers felt responsible for carrying on their children's political work and assumed the agenda that originally led to the disappearance of the dissidents.

Together, the women created a dynamic and unexpected force, which existed in opposition to traditional constraints on women in [[Latin America]]. These mothers came together to push for information on their own children and this highlighted the human rights violations and the scale of the protest drew press attention, raising awareness on a local and global scale. Their persistence to publicly remember and try to find their children, the sustained group organisation, the use of symbols and slogans, and the silent weekly protests attracted reactive measures from those in power.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe military government considered these women to be politically subversive; the founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, [[Azucena Villaflor]] De Vincenti, who placed the names of 'the missing' in a newspaper in December 1977 (on International Human Rights Day) was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped,]] [[torture]]d and [[murder]]ed (later found to have been killed on a 'death flight' and her body disposed of in the sea),<ref name=\":0\" /> along with French nuns [[Alice Domon]] and [[L\u00e9onie Duquet]] who also supported the movement. This was done at the command of [[Alfredo Astiz]] and [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] (who was a senior commander in the [[Argentine Army]] and dictator of [[Argentina]] from 1976 to 1981), both of whom were later sentenced to [[life imprisonment|life in prison]] for their roles in the repression of dissidents during the [[Dirty War]].<ref name=\":1\">[https://www.du.edu/korbel/criic/humanitarianbriefs/rachelkoepsel.pdf].

Eventually, the military has admitted that over 9,000 of those abducted are still unaccounted for, but the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo say that the number of missing is closer to 30,000. Most are presumed dead. Many of these prisoners were high school students, young professionals, and union workers who were suspected of having opposed the government. Those 'taken' were generally below the age of 35, as were the members of the regime who tortured and murdered them. There were a disproportionate number of Jewish \"disappeared\" as the military was anti-Semitic, as documented in ''Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number''.

One group, called the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo-Founding Line]], focused on [[legislation]], the recovery of the remains of their children, and bringing ex-officials to justice. [[Hebe de Bonafini]] continued to lead a more radical faction under the name Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Association. These mothers felt responsible for carrying on their children's political work and assumed the agenda that originally led to the disappearance of the dissidents. Unlike the Founding Line, the Association refused government help or compensation. They pledged not to recognize the deaths of their children until the government would admit its fault.<ref>[http://www.yachana.org/research/plazamayo.pdf]. \"[[The Oxford International Encyclopedia of Peace]]\", Volume 2, \"Early Christianity and Antimilitarism - Mass Violence and Trends\", 2010.

But when Copperpot tries to steal it, the four children; Ring, Zip, Stella, and Sun, must stop him with the magical power from their wands.\n\n== Characters ==\n=== Main ===\n* Ring (voiced by [[Eleanor Noble]]) \u2013 The talented leader of the group. He is a generous and kind friend, but can also be a little self-confident and vain. He is good at cooking and is the one in the group who selects the ingredients for each recipe. His wand is a fork and also a magnet, which is able to attract objects. He has brown hair, dark eyes, dressed in red.\n* Zip (voiced by [[Sonja Ball]]) \u2013 The sportsman of the group. He is nice and funny, but sometimes he proves to be moody and impatient. He deals with mincing, blending, and cutting the ingredients selected by Ring. His wand is a kitchen whisk. He has orange hair and green eyes and dressed in blue.\n* Stella (voiced by [[Sonja Ball]]) \u2013 The most vaporous of the group. Although at many times she is quite inattentive, distracted, careless, childish, and naive, she can be good-natured, kind, sensitive, polite, and sweet. She is talented in decorating, as shown by her ability to decorate the dishes. Her wand is a spatula that she uses to decorate the food made by her and her friends. She has brown hair, brown eyes, dressed in yellow.\n* Sun (voiced by [[Holly Gauthier-Frankel]]) \u2013 The first of the group's class. She is very determined, intelligent, and brilliant, but can be touchy and stubborn. She takes care of cooking the dishes in the group. Her wand is a spoon, which she uses to control temperatures. She has blonde hair and blue eyes and is dressed in pink.\n* Miss Frisella - Owner of the Trulli Kingdom bakery and keeper of the Magic Cookbook\n* Trulli Grandma - Creator of the Magic Cookbook and would guide the kids through riddles that would help them solve any of their problems.\n\n=== Villains ===\n* Copperpot (voiced by [[Richard Dumont]]) \u2013 The main villain who always tries to steal the Wizard Chefs' cookbook.\n* Athenina (voiced by Jennifer Seguin) \u2013 Copperpot's employee and pet owl.\n* Rick (voiced By [[Chris Savino]]) \u2013 Copperpot and Athenina's new employee who wants to help at Copperpot to steal the Wizard Chefs' cookbook.\n* Tyler (voiced by [[Sam Register]]) -

The most basic version starts with a single-variable function {{math|''f''}} defined for a [[real number|real variable]] {{math|''x''}}, the function's [[derivative]] {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''}}, and an initial guess {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} for a [[Zero of a function|root]] of {{math|''f''}}. If the function satisfies sufficient assumptions and the initial guess is close, then\n\n:<math>x_{1} = x_0 - \\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} \\,.</math>\n\nis a better approximation of the root than {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}. Geometrically, {{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, 0)}} is the intersection of the {{math|''x''}}-axis and the [[tangent]] of the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|(''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''&thinsp;(''x''<sub>0</sub>))}}: that is, the improved guess is the unique root of the [[linear approximation]] at the initial point. The process is repeated as\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\,</math>\n\nuntil a sufficiently precise value is reached. This algorithm is first in the class of [[Householder's method]]s, succeeded by [[Halley's method]]. The method can also be extended to [[Complex-valued function|complex functions]] and to [[systems of equations]].\n\n==Description==\n<!-- [[Image:newton iteration.svg|alt=Illustration of Newton's method|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of one iteration of Newton's method (the function {{mvar|f}} is shown in blue and the tangent line is in red). We see that {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} is a better approximation than {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} for the root {{math|''x''}} of the function {{math|''f''}}.]] -->\n[[Image:NewtonIteration Ani.gif|alt=Illustration of Newton's method|thumb|right|300px|The function {{mvar|f}} is shown in blue and the tangent line is in red. We see that {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} is a better approximation than {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} for the root {{mvar|x}} of the function {{mvar|f}}.]]\n\nThe idea is to start with an initial guess which is reasonably close to the true root, then to approximate the function by its [[tangent line]] using [[calculus]], and finally to compute the {{mvar|x}}-intercept of this tangent line by [[elementary algebra]]. This {{mvar|x}}-intercept will typically be a better approximation to the original function's root than the first guess, and the method can be [[iterative method|iterated]].\n\nMore formally, suppose {{math|''f'' : (''a'', ''b'') \u2192 \u211d}} is a [[derivative|differentiable]] function defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} with values in the [[real number]]s&nbsp;{{math|\u211d}}, and we have some current approximation {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. Then we can derive the formula for a better approximation, {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} by referring to the diagram on the right. The equation of the [[tangent line]] to the curve {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is\n\n:<math>y = f'(x_n) \\, (x-x_n) + f(x_n),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|f\u2032}} denotes the [[derivative]]. The {{mvar|x}}-intercept of this line (the value of {{mvar|x}} which makes {{math|''y'' {{=}} 0}}) is taken as the next approximation, {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}}, to the root, so that the equation of the tangent line is satisfied when <math>(x, y) = (x_{n + 1}, 0 )</math>: \n\n:<math>0 = f'(x_n) \\, (x_{n+1}-x_n) + f(x_n).</math>\n\nSolving for {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} gives\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}. </math>\n\nWe start the process with some arbitrary initial value {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}. (The closer to the zero, the better. But, in the absence of any intuition about where the zero might lie, a \"guess and check\" method might narrow the possibilities to a reasonably small interval by appealing to the [[intermediate value theorem]].) The method will usually converge, provided this initial guess is close enough to the unknown zero, and that {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) \u2260 0}}. Furthermore, for a zero of [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]&nbsp;1, the convergence is at least quadratic (see [[rate of convergence]]) in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of the zero, which intuitively means that the number of correct digits roughly doubles in every step. More details can be found in the [[#Analysis|analysis section]] below.\n\n[[Householder's method]]s are similar but have higher order for even faster convergence. However, the extra computations required for each step can slow down the overall performance relative to Newton's method, particularly if {{mvar|f}} or its derivatives are computationally expensive to evaluate.\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Newton's method\" is derived from [[Isaac Newton]]'s description of a special case of the method in ''[[De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas]]'' (written in 1669, published in 1711 by [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]]) and in ''De metodis fluxionum et serierum infinitarum'' (written in 1671, translated and published as ''[[Method of Fluxions]]'' in 1736 by [[John Colson]]). However, his method differs substantially from the modern method given above: Newton applies the method only to polynomials. He does not compute the successive approximations {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}}, but computes a sequence of polynomials, and only at the end arrives at an approximation for the root {{mvar|x}}. Finally, Newton views the method as purely algebraic and makes no mention of the connection with calculus. Newton may have derived his method from a similar but less precise method by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. The essence of Vieta's method can be found in the work of the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Persian mathematician]] [[Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi]], while his successor [[Jamsh\u012bd al-K\u0101sh\u012b]] used a form of Newton's method to solve {{math|''x<sup>P</sup>'' \u2212 ''N'' {{=}} 0}} to find roots of {{mvar|N}} (Ypma 1995). A special case of Newton's method for calculating square roots was known since ancient times and is often called the [[Babylonian method]].\n\nNewton's method was used by 17th-century Japanese mathematician [[Seki K\u014dwa]] to solve single-variable equations, though the connection with calculus was missing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter 2.

Finally, in 1740, [[Thomas Simpson]] described Newton's method as an iterative method for solving general nonlinear equations using calculus, essentially giving the description above. In the same publication, Simpson also gives the generalization to systems of two equations and notes that Newton's method can be used for solving optimization problems by setting the gradient to zero.\n\n[[Arthur Cayley]] in 1879 in ''The Newton\u2013Fourier imaginary problem'' was the first to notice the difficulties in generalizing Newton's method to complex roots of polynomials with degree greater than 2 and complex initial values. This opened the way to the study of the [[Julia set|theory of iterations]] of rational functions.\n\n==Practical considerations==\nNewton's method is an extremely powerful technique\u2014in general the [[rate of convergence|convergence]] is quadratic: as the method converges on the root, the difference between the root and the approximation is squared (the number of accurate digits roughly doubles) at each step. However, there are some difficulties with the method.\n\n===Difficulty in calculating derivative of a function===\nNewton's method requires that the derivative can be calculated directly. An analytical expression for the derivative may not be easily obtainable or could be expensive to evaluate. In these situations, it may be appropriate to approximate the derivative by using the slope of a line through two nearby points on the function. Using this approximation would result in something like the [[secant method]] whose convergence is slower than that of Newton's method.\n\n===Failure of the method to converge to the root===\nIt is important to review the [[#Proof of quadratic convergence for Newton's iterative method|proof of quadratic convergence]] of Newton's method before implementing it. Specifically, one should review the assumptions made in the proof. For [[#Failure analysis|situations where the method fails to converge]], it is because the assumptions made in this proof are not met.\n\n====Overshoot====\nIf the first derivative is not well behaved in the neighborhood of a particular root, the method may overshoot, and diverge from that root. An example of a function with one root, for which the derivative is not well behaved in the neighborhood of the root, is\n\n:<math>f(x)=|x|^a,\\quad 0 < a < \\tfrac{1}{2}</math>\n\nfor which the root will be overshot and the sequence of {{mvar|x}} will diverge. For {{math|{{var|a}} {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, the root will still be overshot, but the sequence will oscillate between two values. For {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}} < {{var|a}} < 1}}, the root will still be overshot but the sequence will converge, and for {{math|{{var|a}} \u2265 1}} the root will not be overshot at all.\n\nIn some cases, Newton's method can be stabilized by using [[successive over-relaxation#Other applications of the method|successive over-relaxation]], or the speed of convergence can be increased by using the same method.\n\n====Stationary point====\nIf a [[stationary point]] of the function is encountered, the derivative is zero and the method will terminate due to [[division by zero]].\n\n====Poor initial estimate====\nA large error in the initial estimate can contribute to non-convergence of the algorithm. To overcome this problem one can often linearise the function that is being optimized using calculus, logs, differentials, or even using evolutionary algorithms, such as the [[stochastic funnel algorithm]]. Good initial estimates lie close to the final globally optimal parameter estimate. In nonlinear regression, the sum of squared errors (SSE) is only \"close to\" parabolic in the region of the final parameter estimates. Initial estimates found here will allow the Newton\u2013Raphson method to quickly converge. It is only here that the [[Hessian matrix]] of the SSE is positive and the first derivative of the SSE is close to zero.\n\n====Mitigation of non-convergence====\nIn a robust implementation of Newton's method, it is common to place limits on the number of iterations, bound the solution to an interval known to contain the root, and combine the method with a more robust root finding method.\n\n===Slow convergence for roots of multiplicity greater than 1===\nIf the root being sought has [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiplicity]] greater than one, the convergence rate is merely linear (errors reduced by a constant factor at each step) unless special steps are taken. When there are two or more roots that are close together then it may take many iterations before the iterates get close enough to one of them for the quadratic convergence to be apparent. However, if the multiplicity <math>m</math> of the root is known, the following modified algorithm preserves the quadratic convergence rate:<ref>{{cite web|title=Accelerated and Modified Newton Methods|url=http://mathfaculty.fullerton.edu/mathews/n2003/newtonacceleratemod.html}}</ref>\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - m\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}. </math>\n\nThis is equivalent to using [[successive over-relaxation#Other applications of the method|successive over-relaxation]]. On the other hand, if the multiplicity {{mvar|m}} of the root is not known, it is possible to estimate <math>m</math> after carrying out one or two iterations, and then use that value to increase the rate of convergence.\n\n==Analysis==\nSuppose that the function {{mvar|f}} has a zero at {{mvar|\u03b1}}, i.e., {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''\u03b1'') {{=}} 0}}, and {{mvar|f}} is differentiable in a [[topological neighborhood|neighborhood]] of {{mvar|\u03b1}}.\n\nIf {{mvar|f}} is continuously differentiable and its derivative is nonzero at&nbsp;{{mvar|\u03b1}}, then there exists a [[topological neighborhood|neighborhood]] of {{mvar|\u03b1}} such that for all starting values {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} in that neighborhood, the [[sequence]] {{math|{''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}|}} will [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to {{mvar|\u03b1}}.<ref>{{citation|title=A Theoretical Introduction to Numerical Analysis|first1=Victor S.|last1=Ryaben'kii|first2=Semyon V.|last2=Tsynkov|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|isbn=9781584886075|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8gWP031-hEC&pg=PA243}}.</ref>\n\nIf the function is continuously differentiable and its derivative is not 0 at {{mvar|\u03b1}} and it has a [[second derivative]] at {{mvar|\u03b1}} then the convergence is quadratic or faster. If the second derivative is not 0 at {{mvar|\u03b1}} then the convergence is merely quadratic. If the third derivative exists and is bounded in a neighborhood of {{mvar|\u03b1}}, then:\n:<math>\\Delta x_{i+1} = \\frac{f'' (\\alpha)}{2 f' (\\alpha)} (\\Delta x_{i})^2 + O(\\Delta x_{i})^3 \\,,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\Delta x_i \\triangleq x_i - \\alpha \\,.</math>\n\nIf the derivative is 0 at {{mvar|\u03b1}}, then the convergence is usually only linear. Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} is twice continuously differentiable, {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''\u03b1'') {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2033''(''\u03b1'') \u2260 0}}, then there exists a neighborhood of {{mvar|\u03b1}} such that for all starting values {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} in that neighborhood, the sequence of iterates converges linearly, with [[rate of convergence|rate]] 1/2<ref>{{harvnb|S\u00fcli|Mayers|2003|loc=Exercise 1.6}}</ref> Alternatively if {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''\u03b1'') {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'') \u2260 0}} for {{math|''x'' \u2260 ''\u03b1''}}, {{mvar|x}}&nbsp;in a [[topological neighborhood|neighborhood]] {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|\u03b1}}, {{mvar|\u03b1}} being a zero of [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] {{mvar|r}}, and if {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''C''<sup>''r''</sup>(''U'')}} then there exists a neighborhood of {{mvar|\u03b1}} such that for all starting values {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} in that neighborhood, the sequence of iterates converges linearly.\n\nHowever, even linear convergence is not guaranteed in pathological situations.\n\nIn practice these results are local, and the neighborhood of convergence is not known in advance. But there are also some results on global convergence: for instance, given a right neighborhood {{math|''U''<sub>+</sub>}} of {{mvar|\u03b1}}, if {{mvar|f}} is twice differentiable in {{math|''U''<sub>+</sub>}} and if {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032'' \u2260 0}}, {{math|''f'' \u00b7 ''f&thinsp;\u2033'' > 0}} in {{math|''U''<sub>+</sub>}}, then, for each {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{math|''U''<sub>+</sub>}} the sequence {{math|''x<sub>k</sub>''}} is monotonically decreasing to {{mvar|\u03b1}}.\n\n===Proof of quadratic convergence for Newton's iterative method===\nAccording to [[Taylor's theorem]], any function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} which has a continuous second derivative can be represented by an expansion about a point that is close to a root of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}. Suppose this root is {{mvar|\u03b1}}. Then the expansion of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''\u03b1'')}} about {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>f(\\alpha) = f(x_n) + f'(x_n)(\\alpha - x_n) + R_1 \\,</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere the [[Lagrange remainder|Lagrange form of the Taylor series expansion remainder]] is\n:<math>R_1 = \\frac{1}{2!}f''(\\xi_n)(\\alpha - x_n)^{2} \\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03be''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is in between {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} and {{mvar|\u03b1}}.\n\nSince {{mvar|\u03b1}} is the root, ({{EquationNote|1}}) becomes:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>0 = f(\\alpha) = f(x_n) + f'(x_n)(\\alpha - x_n) + \\tfrac12f''(\\xi_n)(\\alpha - x_n)^2 \\,</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nDividing equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) by {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x<sub>n</sub>'')}} and rearranging gives\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\frac {f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}+\\left(\\alpha-x_n\\right) = \\frac {- f'' (\\xi_n)}{2 f'(x_n)}\\left(\\alpha-x_n\\right)^2 </math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nRemembering that {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} is defined by\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \\frac {f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\,,</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\none finds that\n:<math> \\underbrace{\\alpha - x_{n+1}}_{\\varepsilon_{n+1}} = \\frac {- f'' (\\xi_n)}{2 f'(x_n)} (\\,\\underbrace{\\alpha - x_n}_{\\varepsilon_{n}}\\,)^2 \\,.</math>\n\nThat is,\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\varepsilon_{n+1} = \\frac {- f'' (\\xi_n)}{2 f'(x_n)} \\cdot {\\varepsilon_n}^2 \\,.</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nTaking absolute value of both sides gives\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\left| {\\varepsilon_{n+1}}\\right| = \\frac {\\left| f'' (\\xi_n) \\right| }{2 \\left| f'(x_n) \\right|} \\cdot {\\varepsilon_n}^2 \\,. </math> |{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nEquation ({{EquationNote|6}}) shows that the [[rate of convergence]] is at least quadratic if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n# {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'') \u2260 0}}; for all {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''I''}}, where {{mvar|I}} is the interval {{math|[''\u03b1'' \u2212 ''r'', ''\u03b1'' + ''r'']}} for some {{math|''r'' \u2265 {{abs|''\u03b1'' \u2212 ''x''<sub>0</sub>}}}};\n# {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2033''(''x'')}} is continuous, for all {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''I''}};\n# {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} ''sufficiently'' close to the root {{mvar|\u03b1}}.\n\nThe term ''sufficiently'' close in this context means the following:\n{{numbered list|list_style_type=lower-alpha\n|Taylor approximation is accurate enough such that we can ignore higher order terms;\n|<math>\\frac12 \\left |{\\frac {f'' (x_n)}{f'(x_n)}}\\right |<C\\left |{\\frac {f''(\\alpha)}{f'(\\alpha)}}\\right |,</math> for some {{math|''C'' < \u221e}};\n|<math>C \\left |{\\frac {f''(\\alpha)}{f'(\\alpha)}}\\right |\\varepsilon_n<1,</math> for {{math|''n'' \u2208 '''\u2124''', ''n'' \u2265 0}} and {{mvar|C}} satisfying condition b.}}\n\nFinally, ({{EquationNote|6}}) can be expressed in the following way:\n:<math> \\left | {\\varepsilon_{n+1}}\\right | \\le M{\\varepsilon_n}^2 \\, </math>\nwhere {{mvar|M}} is the [[w:supremum|supremum]] of the variable coefficient of {{math|''\u03b5<sub>n</sub>''<sup>2</sup>}} on the interval {{mvar|I}} defined in condition 1, that is:\n\n: <math>M = \\sup_{x \\in I} \\frac12 \\left |\\frac {f'' (x)}{f'(x)}\\right |. \\,</math>\n\nThe initial point {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} has to be chosen such that conditions 1 to 3 are satisfied, where the third condition requires that {{math|''M'' {{abs|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}} < 1}}.\n\n===Basins of attraction===\nThe disjoint subsets of the [[basin of attraction|basins of attraction]]\u2014the regions of the real number line such that within each region iteration from any point leads to one particular root\u2014can be infinite in number and arbitrarily small.

If the assumptions made in the proof of quadratic convergence are met, the method will converge. For the following subsections, failure of the method to converge indicates that the assumptions made in the proof were not met.\n\n===Bad starting points===\nIn some cases the conditions on the function that are necessary for convergence are satisfied, but the point chosen as the initial point is not in the interval where the method converges. This can happen, for example, if the function whose root is sought approaches zero asymptotically as {{mvar|x}} goes to {{math|\u221e}} or {{math|\u2212\u221e}}. In such cases a different method, such as [[Bisection method|bisection]], should be used to obtain a better estimate for the zero to use as an initial point.\n\n====Iteration point is stationary====\nConsider the function:\n\n:<math>f(x) = 1-x^2.</math>\n\nIt has a maximum at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and solutions of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} 0}} at {{math|''x'' {{=}} \u00b11}}. If we start iterating from the [[stationary point]] {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}} (where the derivative is zero), {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} will be undefined, since the tangent at (0,1) is parallel to the {{mvar|x}}-axis:\n\n:<math>x_1 = x_0 - \\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = 0 - \\frac{1}{0}.</math>\n\nThe same issue occurs if, instead of the starting point, any iteration point is stationary. Even if the derivative is small but not zero, the next iteration will be a far worse approximation.\n\n====Starting point enters a cycle====\n[[Image:NewtonsMethodConvergenceFailure.svg|thumb|300px|The tangent lines of {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 2''x'' + 2}} at 0 and 1 intersect the {{mvar|x}}-axis at 1 and 0 respectively, illustrating why Newton's method oscillates between these values for some starting points.]]\nFor some functions, some starting points may enter an infinite cycle, preventing convergence. Let\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 2 \\!</math>\n\nand take 0 as the starting point. The first iteration produces 1 and the second iteration returns to 0 so the sequence will alternate between the two without converging to a root. In fact, this 2-cycle is stable: there are neighborhoods around 0 and around 1 from which all points iterate asymptotically to the 2-cycle (and hence not to the root of the function). In general, the behavior of the sequence can be very complex (see [[Newton fractal]]). The real solution of this equation is {{val|\u22121.76929235}}\u2026.\n\n===Derivative issues===\nIf the function is not continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of the root then it is possible that Newton's method will always diverge and fail, unless the solution is guessed on the first try.\n\n====Derivative does not exist at root====\nA simple example of a function where Newton's method diverges is trying to find the cube root of zero. The cube root is continuous and infinitely differentiable, except for {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, where its derivative is undefined:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}.</math>\n\nFor any iteration point {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}}, the next iteration point will be:\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} = x_n - \\frac{{x_n}^\\frac13}{\\frac13{x_n}^{\\frac13-1}} = x_n - 3x_n = -2x_n.</math>\n\nThe algorithm overshoots the solution and lands on the other side of the {{mvar|y}}-axis, farther away than it initially was; applying Newton's method actually doubles the distances from the solution at each iteration.\n\nIn fact, the iterations diverge to infinity for every {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} {{abs|''x''}}<sup>''\u03b1''</sup>}}, where {{math|0 < ''\u03b1'' < {{sfrac|1|2}}}}. In the limiting case of {{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} (square root), the iterations will alternate indefinitely between points {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|\u2212''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, so they do not converge in this case either.\n\n====Discontinuous derivative====\nIf the derivative is not continuous at the root, then convergence may fail to occur in any neighborhood of the root. Consider the function\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } x = 0,\\\\\nx + x^2\\sin \\frac{2}{x} & \\text{if } x \\neq 0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nIts derivative is:\n:<math>f'(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } x = 0,\\\\\n1 + 2x\\sin \\frac{2}{x} - 2\\cos \\frac{2}{x} & \\text{if } x \\neq 0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nWithin any neighborhood of the root, this derivative keeps changing sign as {{math|''x''}} approaches 0 from the right (or from the left) while {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') \u2265 ''x'' \u2212 ''x''<sup>2</sup> > 0}} for {{math|0 < ''x'' < 1}}.\n\nSo {{math|{{sfrac|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'')}}}} is unbounded near the root, and Newton's method will diverge almost everywhere in any neighborhood of it, even though:\n*the function is differentiable (and thus continuous) everywhere;\n*the derivative at the root is nonzero;\n*{{mvar|f}} is infinitely differentiable except at the root; and\n*the derivative is bounded in a neighborhood of the root (unlike {{math|{{sfrac|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'')}}}}).\n\n===Non-quadratic convergence===\nIn some cases the iterates converge but do not converge as quickly as promised. In these cases simpler methods converge just as quickly as Newton's method.\n\n====Zero derivative====\nIf the first derivative is zero at the root, then convergence will not be quadratic. Let\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^2 \\!</math>\n\nthen {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} and consequently\n\n:<math>x - \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} = \\frac{x}{2} .</math>\n\nSo convergence is not quadratic, even though the function is infinitely differentiable everywhere.\n\nSimilar problems occur even when the root is only \"nearly\" double. For example, let\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^2(x-1000)+1.</math>\n\nThen the first few iterations starting at {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 1}} are\n:{{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} = 1\n:{{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} = {{val|0.500250376}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} = {{val|0.251062828}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>3</sub>}} = {{val|0.127507934}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>4</sub>}} = {{val|0.067671976}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>5</sub>}} = {{val|0.041224176}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>6</sub>}} = {{val|0.032741218}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>7</sub>}} = {{val|0.031642362}}\u2026\nit takes six iterations to reach a point where the convergence appears to be quadratic.\n\n====No second derivative====\nIf there is no second derivative at the root, then convergence may fail to be quadratic. Let\n:<math>f(x) = x + x^\\frac43.</math>\nThen\n:<math>f'(x) = 1 + \\tfrac43 x^\\frac13.</math>\nAnd\n:<math>f''(x) = \\tfrac49 x^{-\\frac23} </math>\nexcept when {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} where it is undefined. Given {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}},\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f '(x_n)} = \\frac{\\frac13{x_n}^\\frac43}{1 + \\tfrac43{x_n}^\\frac13} </math>\n\nwhich has approximately {{sfrac|4|3}} times as many bits of precision as {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}} has. This is less than the 2 times as many which would be required for quadratic convergence. So the convergence of Newton's method (in this case) is not quadratic, even though: the function is continuously differentiable everywhere; the derivative is not zero at the root; and {{mvar|f}} is infinitely differentiable except at the desired root.\n\n==Generalizations==\n===Complex functions===\n[[Image:newtroot 1 0 0 0 0 m1.png|thumb|Basins of attraction for {{math|''x''<sup>5</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0}}; darker means more iterations to converge.]]\n{{main|Newton fractal}}\nWhen dealing with [[complex analysis|complex functions]], Newton's method can be directly applied to find their zeroes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=[[Peter Henrici (mathematician)|Henrici]] |first=Peter |title= Applied and Computational Complex Analysis |volume=1 |date=1974}}</ref> Each zero has a [[basin of attraction]] in the complex plane, the set of all starting values that cause the method to converge to that particular zero.

Because of the more stable behavior of addition and multiplication in the {{math|''p''}}-adic numbers compared to the real numbers (specifically, the unit ball in the {{math|''p''}}-adics is a ring), convergence in Hensel's lemma can be guaranteed under much simpler hypotheses than in the classical Newton's method on the real line.\n\n===Newton\u2013Fourier method===\n\nThe Newton\u2013Fourier method is [[Joseph Fourier]]'s extension of Newton's method to provide bounds on the absolute error of the root approximation, while still providing quadratic convergence.\n\nAssume that {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is twice continuously differentiable on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and that {{mvar|f}} contains a root in this interval. Assume that {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x''), ''f&thinsp;\u2033''(x) \u2260 0}} on this interval (this is the case for instance if {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''a'') < 0}}, {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''b'') > 0}}, and {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'') > 0}}, and {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2033''(''x'') > 0}} on this interval). This guarantees that there is a unique root on this interval, call it {{mvar|\u03b1}}. If it is concave down instead of concave up then replace {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} by {{math|\u2212''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} since they have the same roots.\n\nLet {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''b''}} be the right endpoint of the interval and let {{math|''z''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''a''}} be the left endpoint of the interval. Given {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}}, define\n\n:<math>x_{n + 1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)},</math>\n\nwhich is just Newton's method as before.

This provides a stopping criterion that is more reliable than the usual ones (which are a small value of the function or a small variation of the variable between consecutive iterations). Also, this may detect cases where Newton's method converges theoretically but diverges numerically because of an insufficient [[floating-point arithmetic|floating-point precision]] (this is typically the case for polynomials of large degree, where a very small change of the variable may change dramatically the value of the function; see [[Wilkinson's polynomial]]).<ref>Moore, R. E. (1979). ''Methods and applications of interval analysis'' (Vol. 2). Siam.</ref><ref>Hansen, E. (1978). Interval forms of Newtons method. ''Computing'', 20(2), 153-163.</ref>\n\nConsider <math>f \\in \\mathcal{C}^1(X)</math>, where <math>X</math> is a real interval, and suppose that we have an interval extension <math>F'</math> of <math>f'</math>, meaning that <math>F'</math> takes as input an interval <math>Y \\subseteq X</math> and outputs an interval <math>F'(Y)</math> such that:\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    F'([y,y]) &= \\{f'(y)\\}\\\\[5pt]\n    F'(Y) &\\supseteq \\{f'(y)\\mid y \\in Y\\}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nWe also assume that <math>0 \\notin F'(X)</math>, so in particular <math>f</math> has at most one root in <math>X</math>.\nWe then define the interval Newton operator by:\n\n: <math>N(Y) = m - \\frac{f(m)}{F'(Y)} = \\left\\{\\left.m - \\frac{f(m)}{z} ~\\right|~ z \\in F'(Y)\\right\\}</math>\n\nwhere <math>m \\in Y</math>. Note that the hypothesis on <math>F'</math> implies that <math>N(Y)</math> is well defined and is an interval (see [[interval arithmetic]] for further details on interval operations). This naturally leads to the following sequence:\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nX_0 &= X\\\\\nX_{k+1} &= N(X_k) \\cap X_k.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe [[mean value theorem]] ensures that if there is a root of <math>f</math> in <math>X_k</math>, then it is also in <math>X_{k+1}</math>. Moreover, the hypothesis on <math>F'</math> ensures that <math>X_{k+1}</math> is at most half the size of <math>X_k</math> when <math>m</math> is the midpoint of <math>Y</math>, so this sequence converges towards <math>[x^*, x^*]</math>, where <math>x^*</math> is the root of <math>f</math> in <math>X</math>.\n\nIf <math>F'(X)</math> strictly contains <math>0</math>, the use of extended interval division produces a union of two intervals for <math>N(X)</math> ; multiple roots are therefore automatically separated and bounded.\n\n==Applications==\n===Minimization and maximization problems===\n{{main|Newton's method in optimization}}\nNewton's method can be used to find a minimum or maximum of a function <math>f(x)</math>. The derivative is zero at a minimum or maximum, so local minima and maxima can be found by applying Newton's method to the derivative. The iteration becomes:\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f'(x_n)}{f''(x_n)}. </math>\n\n===Multiplicative inverses of numbers and power series===\nAn important application is [[Division algorithm#Newton\u2013Raphson division|Newton\u2013Raphson division]], which can be used to quickly find the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of a number {{math|''a''}}, using only multiplication and subtraction, that is to say the number {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|1={{sfrac|1|''x''}} = ''a''}}. We can rephrase that as finding the zero of {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = {{sfrac|1|''x''}} \u2212 ''a''}}. We have {{math|1=''f''\u2032(''x'') = \u2212{{sfrac|1|''x''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.\n\nNewton's iteration is\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n-\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} = x_n+\\frac{\\frac{1}{x_n}-a}{\\frac{1}{x_n^2}} = x_n(2-ax_n).\n</math>\nTherefore, Newton's iteration needs only two multiplications and one subtraction.\n\nThis method is also very efficient to compute the multiplicative inverse of a [[power series]].\n\n===Solving transcendental equations===\nMany [[transcendental equation]]s can be solved using Newton's method. Given the equation\n:<math>g(x) = h(x), </math>\nwith {{math|''g''(''x'')}} and/or {{math|''h''(''x'')}} a [[transcendental function]], one writes\n:<math>f(x) = g(x) - h(x). </math>\nThe values of {{mvar|x}} that solve the original equation are then the roots of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}, which may be found via Newton's method.\n\n===Obtaining zeros of special functions===\nNewton's method is applied to the ratio of Bessel functions in order to obtain its root.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gil|Segura|Temme|2007}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Numerical verification for solutions of nonlinear equations===\nA numerical verification for solutions of nonlinear equations has been established by using Newton's method multiple times and forming a set of solution candidates.<ref>{{harvs|txt|authorlink=William Kahan|last=Kahan|year=1968}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Krawczyk|1969}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2019}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n===Square root of a number===\nConsider the problem of finding the square root of a number ''a'', that is to say the positive number {{math|''x''}} such that {{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> = ''a''}}. Newton's method is one of many [[methods of computing square roots#Babylonian method|methods of computing square roots]]. We can rephrase that as finding the zero of {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''a''}}. We have {{math|1=''f''\u2032(''x'') = 2''x''}}.\n\nFor example, for finding the square root of 612 with an initial guess {{math|1=''x''<sub>0</sub> = 10}}, the sequence given by Newton's method is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{matrix}\n x_1 & = & x_0 - \\dfrac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} & = & 10 - \\dfrac{10^2 - 612}{2 \\times 10} & = & 35.6\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\quad\\;\\,{} \\\\\n x_2 & = & x_1 - \\dfrac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} & = & 35.6 - \\dfrac{35.6^2 - 612}{2 \\times 35.6} & = & \\underline{2}6.395\\,505\\,617\\,978\\dots \\\\\n x_3 & = & \\vdots & = & \\vdots & = & \\underline{24.7}90\\,635\\,492\\,455\\dots \\\\\n x_4 & = & \\vdots & = & \\vdots & = & \\underline{24.738\\,6}88\\,294\\,075\\dots \\\\\n x_5 & = & \\vdots & = & \\vdots & = & \\underline{24.738\\,633\\,753\\,7}67\\dots\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\nwhere the correct digits are underlined.

We can rephrase that as finding the zero of {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = cos(''x'') \u2212 ''x''<sup>3</sup>}}. We have {{math|1=''f''\u2032(''x'') = \u2212sin(''x'') \u2212 3''x''<sup>2</sup>}}. Since {{math|cos(''x'') \u2264 1}} for all {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> > 1}} for {{math|''x'' > 1}}, we know that our solution lies between 0 and 1.\n\nFor example, with an initial guess {{math|1=''x''<sub>0</sub> = 0.5}}, the sequence given by Newton's method is (note that a starting value of 0 will lead to an undefined result, showing the importance of using a starting point that is close to the solution):\n\n:<math>\\begin{matrix}\n x_1 & = & x_0 - \\dfrac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} & = & 0.5 - \\dfrac{\\cos 0.5 - 0.5^3}{-\\sin 0.5 - 3 \\times 0.5^2} & = & 1.112\\,141\\,637\\,097\\dots \\\\\n x_2 & = & x_1 - \\dfrac{f(x_1)}{f'(x_1)} & = & \\vdots & = & \\underline{0.}909\\,672\\,693\\,736\\dots \\\\\n x_3 & = & \\vdots & = & \\vdots & = & \\underline{0.86}7\\,263\\,818\\,209\\dots \\\\\n x_4 & = & \\vdots & = & \\vdots & = & \\underline{0.865\\,47}7\\,135\\,298\\dots \\\\\n x_5 & = & \\vdots & = & \\vdots & = & \\underline{0.865\\,474\\,033\\,1}11\\dots \\\\\n x_6 & = & \\vdots & = & \\vdots & = & \\underline{0.865\\,474\\,033\\,102}\\dots\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\nThe correct digits are underlined in the above example. In particular, {{math|''x''<sub>6</sub>}} is correct to 12 decimal places.

Geometrically, {{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, 0)}} is the intersection of the {{math|''x''}}-axis and the [[tangent]] of the [[graph of a function|graph]] of {{math|''f''}} at {{math|(''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''f''&thinsp;(''x''<sub>0</sub>))}}: that is, the improved guess is the unique root of the [[linear approximation]] at the initial point. The process is repeated as\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\,</math>\n\nuntil a sufficiently precise value is reached. This algorithm is first in the class of [[Householder's method]]s, succeeded by [[Halley's method]]. The method can also be extended to [[Complex-valued function|complex functions]] and to [[systems of equations]].\n\n==Description==\n<!-- [[Image:newton iteration.svg|alt=Illustration of Newton's method|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of one iteration of Newton's method (the function {{mvar|f}} is shown in blue and the tangent line is in red). We see that {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} is a better approximation than {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} for the root {{math|''x''}} of the function {{math|''f''}}.]] -->\n[[Image:NewtonIteration Ani.gif|alt=Illustration of Newton's method|thumb|right|300px|The function {{mvar|f}} is shown in blue and the tangent line is in red. We see that {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} is a better approximation than {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} for the root {{mvar|x}} of the function {{mvar|f}}.]]\n\nThe idea is to start with an initial guess which is reasonably close to the true root, then to approximate the function by its [[tangent line]] using [[calculus]], and finally to compute the {{mvar|x}}-intercept of this tangent line by [[elementary algebra]]. This {{mvar|x}}-intercept will typically be a better approximation to the original function's root than the first guess, and the method can be [[iterative method|iterated]].\n\nMore formally, suppose {{math|''f'' : (''a'', ''b'') \u2192 \u211d}} is a [[derivative|differentiable]] function defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} with values in the [[real number]]s&nbsp;{{math|\u211d}}, and we have some current approximation {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}}. Then we can derive the formula for a better approximation, {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} by referring to the diagram on the right. The equation of the [[tangent line]] to the curve {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} at {{math|''x'' {{=}} ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is\n\n:<math>y = f'(x_n) \\, (x-x_n) + f(x_n),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|f\u2032}} denotes the [[derivative]]. The {{mvar|x}}-intercept of this line (the value of {{mvar|x}} which makes {{math|''y'' {{=}} 0}}) is taken as the next approximation, {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}}, to the root, so that the equation of the tangent line is satisfied when <math>(x, y) = (x_{n + 1}, 0 )</math>: \n\n:<math>0 = f'(x_n) \\, (x_{n+1}-x_n) + f(x_n).</math>\n\nSolving for {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} gives\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}. </math>\n\nWe start the process with some arbitrary initial value {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}. (The closer to the zero, the better. But, in the absence of any intuition about where the zero might lie, a \"guess and check\" method might narrow the possibilities to a reasonably small interval by appealing to the [[intermediate value theorem]].) The method will usually converge, provided this initial guess is close enough to the unknown zero, and that {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x''<sub>0</sub>) \u2260 0}}. Furthermore, for a zero of [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]&nbsp;1, the convergence is at least quadratic (see [[rate of convergence]]) in a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of the zero, which intuitively means that the number of correct digits roughly doubles in every step. More details can be found in the [[#Analysis|analysis section]] below.\n\n[[Householder's method]]s are similar but have higher order for even faster convergence. However, the extra computations required for each step can slow down the overall performance relative to Newton's method, particularly if {{mvar|f}} or its derivatives are computationally expensive to evaluate.\n\n==History==\nThe name \"Newton's method\" is derived from [[Isaac Newton]]'s description of a special case of the method in ''[[De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas]]'' (written in 1669, published in 1711 by [[William Jones (mathematician)|William Jones]]) and in ''De metodis fluxionum et serierum infinitarum'' (written in 1671, translated and published as ''[[Method of Fluxions]]'' in 1736 by [[John Colson]]). However, his method differs substantially from the modern method given above: Newton applies the method only to polynomials. He does not compute the successive approximations {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}}, but computes a sequence of polynomials, and only at the end arrives at an approximation for the root {{mvar|x}}. Finally, Newton views the method as purely algebraic and makes no mention of the connection with calculus. Newton may have derived his method from a similar but less precise method by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. The essence of Vieta's method can be found in the work of the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Persian mathematician]] [[Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi]], while his successor [[Jamsh\u012bd al-K\u0101sh\u012b]] used a form of Newton's method to solve {{math|''x<sup>P</sup>'' \u2212 ''N'' {{=}} 0}} to find roots of {{mvar|N}} (Ypma 1995). A special case of Newton's method for calculating square roots was known since ancient times and is often called the [[Babylonian method]].\n\nNewton's method was used by 17th-century Japanese mathematician [[Seki K\u014dwa]] to solve single-variable equations, though the connection with calculus was missing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter 2.

Finally, in 1740, [[Thomas Simpson]] described Newton's method as an iterative method for solving general nonlinear equations using calculus, essentially giving the description above. In the same publication, Simpson also gives the generalization to systems of two equations and notes that Newton's method can be used for solving optimization problems by setting the gradient to zero.\n\n[[Arthur Cayley]] in 1879 in ''The Newton\u2013Fourier imaginary problem'' was the first to notice the difficulties in generalizing Newton's method to complex roots of polynomials with degree greater than 2 and complex initial values. This opened the way to the study of the [[Julia set|theory of iterations]] of rational functions.\n\n==Practical considerations==\nNewton's method is an extremely powerful technique\u2014in general the [[rate of convergence|convergence]] is quadratic: as the method converges on the root, the difference between the root and the approximation is squared (the number of accurate digits roughly doubles) at each step. However, there are some difficulties with the method.\n\n===Difficulty in calculating derivative of a function===\nNewton's method requires that the derivative can be calculated directly. An analytical expression for the derivative may not be easily obtainable or could be expensive to evaluate. In these situations, it may be appropriate to approximate the derivative by using the slope of a line through two nearby points on the function. Using this approximation would result in something like the [[secant method]] whose convergence is slower than that of Newton's method.\n\n===Failure of the method to converge to the root===\nIt is important to review the [[#Proof of quadratic convergence for Newton's iterative method|proof of quadratic convergence]] of Newton's method before implementing it. Specifically, one should review the assumptions made in the proof. For [[#Failure analysis|situations where the method fails to converge]], it is because the assumptions made in this proof are not met.\n\n====Overshoot====\nIf the first derivative is not well behaved in the neighborhood of a particular root, the method may overshoot, and diverge from that root. An example of a function with one root, for which the derivative is not well behaved in the neighborhood of the root, is\n\n:<math>f(x)=|x|^a,\\quad 0 < a < \\tfrac{1}{2}</math>\n\nfor which the root will be overshot and the sequence of {{mvar|x}} will diverge. For {{math|{{var|a}} {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}, the root will still be overshot, but the sequence will oscillate between two values. For {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}} < {{var|a}} < 1}}, the root will still be overshot but the sequence will converge, and for {{math|{{var|a}} \u2265 1}} the root will not be overshot at all.\n\nIn some cases, Newton's method can be stabilized by using [[successive over-relaxation#Other applications of the method|successive over-relaxation]], or the speed of convergence can be increased by using the same method.\n\n====Stationary point====\nIf a [[stationary point]] of the function is encountered, the derivative is zero and the method will terminate due to [[division by zero]].\n\n====Poor initial estimate====\nA large error in the initial estimate can contribute to non-convergence of the algorithm. To overcome this problem one can often linearise the function that is being optimized using calculus, logs, differentials, or even using evolutionary algorithms, such as the [[stochastic funnel algorithm]]. Good initial estimates lie close to the final globally optimal parameter estimate. In nonlinear regression, the sum of squared errors (SSE) is only \"close to\" parabolic in the region of the final parameter estimates. Initial estimates found here will allow the Newton\u2013Raphson method to quickly converge. It is only here that the [[Hessian matrix]] of the SSE is positive and the first derivative of the SSE is close to zero.\n\n====Mitigation of non-convergence====\nIn a robust implementation of Newton's method, it is common to place limits on the number of iterations, bound the solution to an interval known to contain the root, and combine the method with a more robust root finding method.\n\n===Slow convergence for roots of multiplicity greater than 1===\nIf the root being sought has [[Multiplicity (mathematics)#Multiplicity of a root of a polynomial|multiplicity]] greater than one, the convergence rate is merely linear (errors reduced by a constant factor at each step) unless special steps are taken. When there are two or more roots that are close together then it may take many iterations before the iterates get close enough to one of them for the quadratic convergence to be apparent. However, if the multiplicity <math>m</math> of the root is known, the following modified algorithm preserves the quadratic convergence rate:<ref>{{cite web|title=Accelerated and Modified Newton Methods|url=http://mathfaculty.fullerton.edu/mathews/n2003/newtonacceleratemod.html}}</ref>\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - m\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}. </math>\n\nThis is equivalent to using [[successive over-relaxation#Other applications of the method|successive over-relaxation]]. On the other hand, if the multiplicity {{mvar|m}} of the root is not known, it is possible to estimate <math>m</math> after carrying out one or two iterations, and then use that value to increase the rate of convergence.\n\n==Analysis==\nSuppose that the function {{mvar|f}} has a zero at {{mvar|\u03b1}}, i.e., {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''\u03b1'') {{=}} 0}}, and {{mvar|f}} is differentiable in a [[topological neighborhood|neighborhood]] of {{mvar|\u03b1}}.\n\nIf {{mvar|f}} is continuously differentiable and its derivative is nonzero at&nbsp;{{mvar|\u03b1}}, then there exists a [[topological neighborhood|neighborhood]] of {{mvar|\u03b1}} such that for all starting values {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} in that neighborhood, the [[sequence]] {{math|{''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}|}} will [[limit of a sequence|converge]] to {{mvar|\u03b1}}.<ref>{{citation|title=A Theoretical Introduction to Numerical Analysis|first1=Victor S.|last1=Ryaben'kii|first2=Semyon V.|last2=Tsynkov|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|isbn=9781584886075|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8gWP031-hEC&pg=PA243}}.</ref>\n\nIf the function is continuously differentiable and its derivative is not 0 at {{mvar|\u03b1}} and it has a [[second derivative]] at {{mvar|\u03b1}} then the convergence is quadratic or faster. If the second derivative is not 0 at {{mvar|\u03b1}} then the convergence is merely quadratic. If the third derivative exists and is bounded in a neighborhood of {{mvar|\u03b1}}, then:\n:<math>\\Delta x_{i+1} = \\frac{f'' (\\alpha)}{2 f' (\\alpha)} (\\Delta x_{i})^2 + O(\\Delta x_{i})^3 \\,,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\Delta x_i \\triangleq x_i - \\alpha \\,.</math>\n\nIf the derivative is 0 at {{mvar|\u03b1}}, then the convergence is usually only linear. Specifically, if {{mvar|f}} is twice continuously differentiable, {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''\u03b1'') {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2033''(''\u03b1'') \u2260 0}}, then there exists a neighborhood of {{mvar|\u03b1}} such that for all starting values {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} in that neighborhood, the sequence of iterates converges linearly, with [[rate of convergence|rate]] 1/2<ref>{{harvnb|S\u00fcli|Mayers|2003|loc=Exercise 1.6}}</ref> Alternatively if {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''\u03b1'') {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'') \u2260 0}} for {{math|''x'' \u2260 ''\u03b1''}}, {{mvar|x}}&nbsp;in a [[topological neighborhood|neighborhood]] {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|\u03b1}}, {{mvar|\u03b1}} being a zero of [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] {{mvar|r}}, and if {{math|''f'' \u2208 ''C''<sup>''r''</sup>(''U'')}} then there exists a neighborhood of {{mvar|\u03b1}} such that for all starting values {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} in that neighborhood, the sequence of iterates converges linearly.\n\nHowever, even linear convergence is not guaranteed in pathological situations.\n\nIn practice these results are local, and the neighborhood of convergence is not known in advance. But there are also some results on global convergence: for instance, given a right neighborhood {{math|''U''<sub>+</sub>}} of {{mvar|\u03b1}}, if {{mvar|f}} is twice differentiable in {{math|''U''<sub>+</sub>}} and if {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032'' \u2260 0}}, {{math|''f'' \u00b7 ''f&thinsp;\u2033'' > 0}} in {{math|''U''<sub>+</sub>}}, then, for each {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{math|''U''<sub>+</sub>}} the sequence {{math|''x<sub>k</sub>''}} is monotonically decreasing to {{mvar|\u03b1}}.\n\n===Proof of quadratic convergence for Newton's iterative method===\nAccording to [[Taylor's theorem]], any function {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} which has a continuous second derivative can be represented by an expansion about a point that is close to a root of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}}. Suppose this root is {{mvar|\u03b1}}. Then the expansion of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''\u03b1'')}} about {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>f(\\alpha) = f(x_n) + f'(x_n)(\\alpha - x_n) + R_1 \\,</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere the [[Lagrange remainder|Lagrange form of the Taylor series expansion remainder]] is\n:<math>R_1 = \\frac{1}{2!}f''(\\xi_n)(\\alpha - x_n)^{2} \\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03be''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is in between {{math|''x''<sub>''n''</sub>}} and {{mvar|\u03b1}}.\n\nSince {{mvar|\u03b1}} is the root, ({{EquationNote|1}}) becomes:\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>0 = f(\\alpha) = f(x_n) + f'(x_n)(\\alpha - x_n) + \\tfrac12f''(\\xi_n)(\\alpha - x_n)^2 \\,</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nDividing equation ({{EquationNote|2}}) by {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x<sub>n</sub>'')}} and rearranging gives\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\frac {f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}+\\left(\\alpha-x_n\\right) = \\frac {- f'' (\\xi_n)}{2 f'(x_n)}\\left(\\alpha-x_n\\right)^2 </math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nRemembering that {{math|''x''<sub>''n'' + 1</sub>}} is defined by\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> x_{n+1} = x_{n} - \\frac {f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} \\,,</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\none finds that\n:<math> \\underbrace{\\alpha - x_{n+1}}_{\\varepsilon_{n+1}} = \\frac {- f'' (\\xi_n)}{2 f'(x_n)} (\\,\\underbrace{\\alpha - x_n}_{\\varepsilon_{n}}\\,)^2 \\,.</math>\n\nThat is,\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\varepsilon_{n+1} = \\frac {- f'' (\\xi_n)}{2 f'(x_n)} \\cdot {\\varepsilon_n}^2 \\,.</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nTaking absolute value of both sides gives\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> \\left| {\\varepsilon_{n+1}}\\right| = \\frac {\\left| f'' (\\xi_n) \\right| }{2 \\left| f'(x_n) \\right|} \\cdot {\\varepsilon_n}^2 \\,. </math> |{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nEquation ({{EquationNote|6}}) shows that the [[rate of convergence]] is at least quadratic if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n# {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'') \u2260 0}}; for all {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''I''}}, where {{mvar|I}} is the interval {{math|[''\u03b1'' \u2212 ''r'', ''\u03b1'' + ''r'']}} for some {{math|''r'' \u2265 {{abs|''\u03b1'' \u2212 ''x''<sub>0</sub>}}}};\n# {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2033''(''x'')}} is continuous, for all {{math|''x'' \u2208 ''I''}};\n# {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} ''sufficiently'' close to the root {{mvar|\u03b1}}.\n\nThe term ''sufficiently'' close in this context means the following:\n{{numbered list|list_style_type=lower-alpha\n|Taylor approximation is accurate enough such that we can ignore higher order terms;\n|<math>\\frac12 \\left |{\\frac {f'' (x_n)}{f'(x_n)}}\\right |<C\\left |{\\frac {f''(\\alpha)}{f'(\\alpha)}}\\right |,</math> for some {{math|''C'' < \u221e}};\n|<math>C \\left |{\\frac {f''(\\alpha)}{f'(\\alpha)}}\\right |\\varepsilon_n<1,</math> for {{math|''n'' \u2208 '''\u2124''', ''n'' \u2265 0}} and {{mvar|C}} satisfying condition b.}}\n\nFinally, ({{EquationNote|6}}) can be expressed in the following way:\n:<math> \\left | {\\varepsilon_{n+1}}\\right | \\le M{\\varepsilon_n}^2 \\, </math>\nwhere {{mvar|M}} is the [[w:supremum|supremum]] of the variable coefficient of {{math|''\u03b5<sub>n</sub>''<sup>2</sup>}} on the interval {{mvar|I}} defined in condition 1, that is:\n\n: <math>M = \\sup_{x \\in I} \\frac12 \\left |\\frac {f'' (x)}{f'(x)}\\right |. \\,</math>\n\nThe initial point {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} has to be chosen such that conditions 1 to 3 are satisfied, where the third condition requires that {{math|''M'' {{abs|''\u03b5''<sub>0</sub>}} < 1}}.\n\n===Basins of attraction===\nThe disjoint subsets of the [[basin of attraction|basins of attraction]]\u2014the regions of the real number line such that within each region iteration from any point leads to one particular root\u2014can be infinite in number and arbitrarily small.

If the assumptions made in the proof of quadratic convergence are met, the method will converge. For the following subsections, failure of the method to converge indicates that the assumptions made in the proof were not met.\n\n===Bad starting points===\nIn some cases the conditions on the function that are necessary for convergence are satisfied, but the point chosen as the initial point is not in the interval where the method converges. This can happen, for example, if the function whose root is sought approaches zero asymptotically as {{mvar|x}} goes to {{math|\u221e}} or {{math|\u2212\u221e}}. In such cases a different method, such as [[Bisection method|bisection]], should be used to obtain a better estimate for the zero to use as an initial point.\n\n====Iteration point is stationary====\nConsider the function:\n\n:<math>f(x) = 1-x^2.</math>\n\nIt has a maximum at {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and solutions of {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} 0}} at {{math|''x'' {{=}} \u00b11}}. If we start iterating from the [[stationary point]] {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 0}} (where the derivative is zero), {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} will be undefined, since the tangent at (0,1) is parallel to the {{mvar|x}}-axis:\n\n:<math>x_1 = x_0 - \\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} = 0 - \\frac{1}{0}.</math>\n\nThe same issue occurs if, instead of the starting point, any iteration point is stationary. Even if the derivative is small but not zero, the next iteration will be a far worse approximation.\n\n====Starting point enters a cycle====\n[[Image:NewtonsMethodConvergenceFailure.svg|thumb|300px|The tangent lines of {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 2''x'' + 2}} at 0 and 1 intersect the {{mvar|x}}-axis at 1 and 0 respectively, illustrating why Newton's method oscillates between these values for some starting points.]]\nFor some functions, some starting points may enter an infinite cycle, preventing convergence. Let\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^3 - 2x + 2 \\!</math>\n\nand take 0 as the starting point. The first iteration produces 1 and the second iteration returns to 0 so the sequence will alternate between the two without converging to a root. In fact, this 2-cycle is stable: there are neighborhoods around 0 and around 1 from which all points iterate asymptotically to the 2-cycle (and hence not to the root of the function). In general, the behavior of the sequence can be very complex (see [[Newton fractal]]). The real solution of this equation is {{val|\u22121.76929235}}\u2026.\n\n===Derivative issues===\nIf the function is not continuously differentiable in a neighborhood of the root then it is possible that Newton's method will always diverge and fail, unless the solution is guessed on the first try.\n\n====Derivative does not exist at root====\nA simple example of a function where Newton's method diverges is trying to find the cube root of zero. The cube root is continuous and infinitely differentiable, except for {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}}, where its derivative is undefined:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}.</math>\n\nFor any iteration point {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}}, the next iteration point will be:\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)} = x_n - \\frac{{x_n}^\\frac13}{\\frac13{x_n}^{\\frac13-1}} = x_n - 3x_n = -2x_n.</math>\n\nThe algorithm overshoots the solution and lands on the other side of the {{mvar|y}}-axis, farther away than it initially was; applying Newton's method actually doubles the distances from the solution at each iteration.\n\nIn fact, the iterations diverge to infinity for every {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') {{=}} {{abs|''x''}}<sup>''\u03b1''</sup>}}, where {{math|0 < ''\u03b1'' < {{sfrac|1|2}}}}. In the limiting case of {{math|''\u03b1'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}} (square root), the iterations will alternate indefinitely between points {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and {{math|\u2212''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, so they do not converge in this case either.\n\n====Discontinuous derivative====\nIf the derivative is not continuous at the root, then convergence may fail to occur in any neighborhood of the root. Consider the function\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } x = 0,\\\\\nx + x^2\\sin \\frac{2}{x} & \\text{if } x \\neq 0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nIts derivative is:\n:<math>f'(x) = \\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } x = 0,\\\\\n1 + 2x\\sin \\frac{2}{x} - 2\\cos \\frac{2}{x} & \\text{if } x \\neq 0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nWithin any neighborhood of the root, this derivative keeps changing sign as {{math|''x''}} approaches 0 from the right (or from the left) while {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'') \u2265 ''x'' \u2212 ''x''<sup>2</sup> > 0}} for {{math|0 < ''x'' < 1}}.\n\nSo {{math|{{sfrac|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'')}}}} is unbounded near the root, and Newton's method will diverge almost everywhere in any neighborhood of it, even though:\n*the function is differentiable (and thus continuous) everywhere;\n*the derivative at the root is nonzero;\n*{{mvar|f}} is infinitely differentiable except at the root; and\n*the derivative is bounded in a neighborhood of the root (unlike {{math|{{sfrac|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'')}}}}).\n\n===Non-quadratic convergence===\nIn some cases the iterates converge but do not converge as quickly as promised. In these cases simpler methods converge just as quickly as Newton's method.\n\n====Zero derivative====\nIf the first derivative is zero at the root, then convergence will not be quadratic. Let\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^2 \\!</math>\n\nthen {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'') {{=}} 2''x''}} and consequently\n\n:<math>x - \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} = \\frac{x}{2} .</math>\n\nSo convergence is not quadratic, even though the function is infinitely differentiable everywhere.\n\nSimilar problems occur even when the root is only \"nearly\" double. For example, let\n\n:<math>f(x) = x^2(x-1000)+1.</math>\n\nThen the first few iterations starting at {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 1}} are\n:{{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} = 1\n:{{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>}} = {{val|0.500250376}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>2</sub>}} = {{val|0.251062828}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>3</sub>}} = {{val|0.127507934}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>4</sub>}} = {{val|0.067671976}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>5</sub>}} = {{val|0.041224176}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>6</sub>}} = {{val|0.032741218}}\u2026\n:{{math|''x''<sub>7</sub>}} = {{val|0.031642362}}\u2026\nit takes six iterations to reach a point where the convergence appears to be quadratic.\n\n====No second derivative====\nIf there is no second derivative at the root, then convergence may fail to be quadratic. Let\n:<math>f(x) = x + x^\\frac43.</math>\nThen\n:<math>f'(x) = 1 + \\tfrac43 x^\\frac13.</math>\nAnd\n:<math>f''(x) = \\tfrac49 x^{-\\frac23} </math>\nexcept when {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} where it is undefined. Given {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}},\n\n:<math>x_{n+1} = x_n - \\frac{f(x_n)}{f '(x_n)} = \\frac{\\frac13{x_n}^\\frac43}{1 + \\tfrac43{x_n}^\\frac13} </math>\n\nwhich has approximately {{sfrac|4|3}} times as many bits of precision as {{math|''x<sub>n</sub>''}} has. This is less than the 2 times as many which would be required for quadratic convergence. So the convergence of Newton's method (in this case) is not quadratic, even though: the function is continuously differentiable everywhere; the derivative is not zero at the root; and {{mvar|f}} is infinitely differentiable except at the desired root.\n\n==Generalizations==\n===Complex functions===\n[[Image:newtroot 1 0 0 0 0 m1.png|thumb|Basins of attraction for {{math|''x''<sup>5</sup> \u2212 1 {{=}} 0}}; darker means more iterations to converge.]]\n{{main|Newton fractal}}\nWhen dealing with [[complex analysis|complex functions]], Newton's method can be directly applied to find their zeroes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=[[Peter Henrici (mathematician)|Henrici]] |first=Peter |title= Applied and Computational Complex Analysis |volume=1 |date=1974}}</ref> Each zero has a [[basin of attraction]] in the complex plane, the set of all starting values that cause the method to converge to that particular zero.

See [[Gauss\u2013Newton algorithm]] for more information.\n\n===Nonlinear equations in a Banach space===\nAnother generalization is Newton's method to find a root of a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]] {{mvar|F}} defined in a [[Banach space]].

Because of the more stable behavior of addition and multiplication in the {{math|''p''}}-adic numbers compared to the real numbers (specifically, the unit ball in the {{math|''p''}}-adics is a ring), convergence in Hensel's lemma can be guaranteed under much simpler hypotheses than in the classical Newton's method on the real line.\n\n===Newton\u2013Fourier method===\n\nThe Newton\u2013Fourier method is [[Joseph Fourier]]'s extension of Newton's method to provide bounds on the absolute error of the root approximation, while still providing quadratic convergence.\n\nAssume that {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} is twice continuously differentiable on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} and that {{mvar|f}} contains a root in this interval. Assume that {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x''), ''f&thinsp;\u2033''(x) \u2260 0}} on this interval (this is the case for instance if {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''a'') < 0}}, {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''b'') > 0}}, and {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2032''(''x'') > 0}}, and {{math|''f&thinsp;\u2033''(''x'') > 0}} on this interval). This guarantees that there is a unique root on this interval, call it {{mvar|\u03b1}}. If it is concave down instead of concave up then replace {{math|''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} by {{math|\u2212''f''&thinsp;(''x'')}} since they have the same roots.\n\nLet {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''b''}} be the right endpoint of the interval and let {{math|''z''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''a''}} be the left endpoint of the interval.

This provides a stopping criterion that is more reliable than the usual ones (which are a small value of the function or a small variation of the variable between consecutive iterations). Also, this may detect cases where Newton's method converges theoretically but diverges numerically because of an insufficient [[floating-point arithmetic|floating-point precision]] (this is typically the case for polynomials of large degree, where a very small change of the variable may change dramatically the value of the function; see [[Wilkinson's polynomial]]).<ref>Moore, R. E. (1979). ''Methods and applications of interval analysis'' (Vol. 2). Siam.</ref><ref>Hansen, E. (1978). Interval forms of Newtons method. ''Computing'', 20(2), 153-163.</ref>\n\nConsider <math>f \\in \\mathcal{C}^1(X)</math>, where <math>X</math> is a real interval, and suppose that we have an interval extension <math>F'</math> of <math>f'</math>, meaning that <math>F'</math> takes as input an interval <math>Y \\subseteq X</math> and outputs an interval <math>F'(Y)</math> such that:\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n    F'([y,y]) &= \\{f'(y)\\}\\\\[5pt]\n    F'(Y) &\\supseteq \\{f'(y)\\mid y \\in Y\\}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nWe also assume that <math>0 \\notin F'(X)</math>, so in particular <math>f</math> has at most one root in <math>X</math>.\nWe then define the interval Newton operator by:\n\n: <math>N(Y) = m - \\frac{f(m)}{F'(Y)} = \\left\\{\\left.m - \\frac{f(m)}{z} ~\\right|~ z \\in F'(Y)\\right\\}</math>\n\nwhere <math>m \\in Y</math>. Note that the hypothesis on <math>F'</math> implies that <math>N(Y)</math> is well defined and is an interval (see [[interval arithmetic]] for further details on interval operations). This naturally leads to the following sequence:\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nX_0 &= X\\\\\nX_{k+1} &= N(X_k) \\cap X_k.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe [[mean value theorem]] ensures that if there is a root of <math>f</math> in <math>X_k</math>, then it is also in <math>X_{k+1}</math>. Moreover, the hypothesis on <math>F'</math> ensures that <math>X_{k+1}</math> is at most half the size of <math>X_k</math> when <math>m</math> is the midpoint of <math>Y</math>, so this sequence converges towards <math>[x^*, x^*]</math>, where <math>x^*</math> is the root of <math>f</math> in <math>X</math>.\n\nIf <math>F'(X)</math> strictly contains <math>0</math>, the use of extended interval division produces a union of two intervals for <math>N(X)</math> ; multiple roots are therefore automatically separated and bounded.\n\n==Applications==\n===Minimization and maximization problems===\n{{main|Newton's method in optimization}}\nNewton's method can be used to find a minimum or maximum of a function <math>f(x)</math>. The derivative is zero at a minimum or maximum, so local minima and maxima can be found by applying Newton's method to the derivative.

We will check during the computation whether the denominator (<code>yprime</code>) becomes too small (smaller than <code>epsilon</code>), which would be the case if {{math|''f''\u2032(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2248 0}}, since otherwise a large amount of error could be introduced.\n\n<source lang=\"julia\">\nx0 = 1  # The initial guess\nf(x) = x^2 - 2  # The function whose root we are trying to find\nfprime(x) = 2 * x  # The derivative of the function\ntolerance = 10^(-7)  # 7 digit accuracy is desired\nepsilon = 10^(-14)  # Do not divide by a number smaller than this\nmaxIterations = 20  # Do not allow the iterations to continue indefinitely\nsolutionFound = false  # Have not converged to a solution yet\n\nfor i = 1:maxIterations\n  y = f(x0)\n  yprime = fprime(x0)\n \n  if abs(yprime) < epsilon  # Stop if the denominator is too small\n    break\n  end\n \n  global x1 = x0 - y/yprime  # Do Newton's computation\n \n  if abs(x1 - x0) <= tolerance  # Stop when the result is within the desired tolerance\n    global solutionFound = true\n    break\n  end\n \n  global x0 = x1  # Update x0 to start the process again\nend\n\nif solutionFound\n  println(\"Solution: \", x1)  # x1 is a solution within tolerance and maximum number of iterations\nelse\n  println(\"Did not converge\")  # Newton's method did not converge\nend\n</source>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Aitken's delta-squared process]]\n* [[Bisection method]]\n* [[Euler method]]\n* [[Fast inverse square root]]\n* [[Scoring algorithm#Fisher scoring|Fisher scoring]]\n* [[Gradient descent]]\n* [[Integer square root]]\n* [[Kantorovich theorem]]\n* [[Laguerre's method]]\n* [[Methods of computing square roots]]\n* [[Newton's method in optimization]]\n* [[Richardson extrapolation]]\n* [[Root-finding algorithm]]\n* [[Secant method]]\n* [[Steffensen's method]]\n* [[Subgradient method]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last1=Gil |first1=A. |last2=Segura |first2=J. |last3=Temme |first3=N.

H. Smith & Son''') is a British retailer, headquartered in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]], which operates a chain of [[high street]], railway station, airport, port, hospital and motorway service station shops selling books, stationery, magazines, newspapers, entertainment products and confectionery.\n\nThe company was formed by [[Henry Walton Smith]] and his wife Anna in 1792 as a news vendor in London. It remained under the ownership of the Smith family for many years and saw large-scale expansion during the 1970s as the company began to diversify into other markets. Following a rejected private equity takeover in 2004, the company began to focus on its core retail business. It was the first [[retail chain]] in the world, and was responsible for the creation of the [[ISBN]] book identifier.\n\nWHSmith is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 250 Index]].

These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government.

They could have established a parliamentary system like the \"historical nationalities\", or they could have not assumed any legislative powers and simply established mechanisms for the administration of the competences they were granted.<ref name=perez/><ref name=clavero/>\n\nOnce the autonomous communities were created, Article 145 prohibits the \"federation of autonomous communities\".

While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an \"equalization\" of all communities, differences still remain.\n\n===The Statute of Autonomy===\n{{Main|Statute of Autonomy}}\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an \"Organic Law\", requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].\n\nFor communities that acceded to autonomy through the \"fast route\", a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.\n\nThe constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the state\u2014the central government\u2014in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the state.<ref name=\"article143\" /> In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.<ref name=article143/> In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].\n\n===Institutional organization===\nAll autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:\n* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented\n* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is \"president\",{{efn|name=lehendakari|In the Basque Country, the head of government is officially known as ''[[lehendakari]]'' in Basque, or by the Spanish rendering of the title, ''lendakari''.}}{{efn-lr|\"Autonomic president\", \"regional president\", or simply \"president\" (in Spanish: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente regional'', or simply ''presidente''; in Catalan/Valencian: ''president auton\u00f2mic'', ''president regional'', or simply ''president''; in Galician: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente rexional'', or simply ''presidente'').

Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four-year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities except for the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia elections are held the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.<ref name=carreras>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonom\u00edas en Espa\u00f1a|work=Descentralizaci\u00f3n en Perspectiva Comparada: Espa\u00f1a, Colombia y Brasil|publisher=Plural Editores|year=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=978-9990563573}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown\u2014like the Generalitat of Catalonia\u2014while others are entirely new creations.\n\nIn some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. A specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, ''junta'' may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three \"historical nationalities\", have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Valencian Community]].\n\n{{Anchor|Autonomous cities}}The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.\n\n===Legal powers===\nThe autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers (competences) devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an \"asymmetrical homogeneity\".<ref name=perez/> In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of August 5, 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their \"homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences.

These communities would assume limited competences during a provisional period of 5 years, after which they could assume further competences, upon negotiation with the central government.

While the autonomic agreements and other laws have allowed for an \"equalization\" of all communities, differences still remain.\n\n===The Statute of Autonomy===\n{{Main|Statute of Autonomy}}\n\nThe Statute of Autonomy is the basic institutional law of the autonomous community or city, recognized by the Spanish constitution in article 147. It is approved by a parliamentary assembly representing the community, and then approved by the [[Cortes Generales]], the Spanish Parliament, through an \"Organic Law\", requiring the favourable vote of the absolute majority of the [[Congress of Deputies (Spain)|Congress of Deputies]].\n\nFor communities that acceded to autonomy through the \"fast route\", a [[referendum]] is required before it can be sanctioned by the Parliament. The Statutes of Autonomy must contain, at least, the name of the community, its territorial limits, the names, organization and seat of the institutions of government, the competences they assume and the principles for their bilingual policy, if applicable.\n\nThe constitution establishes that all competences not explicitly assumed by the state\u2014the central government\u2014in the constitution, can be assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy; but also, all competences not explicitly assumed by the autonomous community in their Statutes of Autonomy are automatically assumed by the state.<ref name=\"article143\" /> In case of conflict, the constitution prevails.<ref name=article143/> In case of disagreement, any administration can bring the case before the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]].\n\n===Institutional organization===\nAll autonomous communities have a parliamentary system based on a division of powers comprising:\n* A Legislative Assembly, whose members are elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[proportional representation]], in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented\n* A Council of Government, with executive and administrative powers, headed by a prime minister, whose official title is \"president\",{{efn|name=lehendakari|In the Basque Country, the head of government is officially known as ''[[lehendakari]]'' in Basque, or by the Spanish rendering of the title, ''lendakari''.}}{{efn-lr|\"Autonomic president\", \"regional president\", or simply \"president\" (in Spanish: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente regional'', or simply ''presidente''; in Catalan/Valencian: ''president auton\u00f2mic'', ''president regional'', or simply ''president''; in Galician: ''presidente auton\u00f3mico'', ''presidente rexional'', or simply ''presidente'').

Despite minor differences, all communities use [[proportional representation]] following [[D'Hondt method]]; all members of regional parliaments are elected for four-year terms, but the president of the community has the faculty to dissolve the legislature and call for early elections. Nonetheless in all communities except for the Basque Country, Catalonia, Galicia, and Andalusia elections are held the last Sunday of May every four years, concurrent with municipal elections in all Spain.<ref name=carreras>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Descentralizaci%C3%B3n_en_Perspectiva_Compar.html?id=zkclm60b_yoC|first=Francesc|last=de Carreras Serra|title=El Estado de las Autonom\u00edas en Espa\u00f1a|work=Descentralizaci\u00f3n en Perspectiva Comparada: Espa\u00f1a, Colombia y Brasil|publisher=Plural Editores|year=2005|accessdate=12 October 2012|isbn=978-9990563573}}</ref>\n\nThe names of the Council of Government and the Legislative Assembly vary between communities. In some autonomous communities, these institutions are restored historical bodies of government or representation of the previous kingdoms or regional entities within the Spanish Crown\u2014like the Generalitat of Catalonia\u2014while others are entirely new creations.\n\nIn some, both the executive and the legislature, though constituting two separate institutions, are collectively identified with a single specific name. A specific denomination may not refer to the same branch of government in all communities; for example, ''junta'' may refer to the executive office in some communities, to the legislature in others, or to the collective name of all branches of government in others.\n\nGiven the ambiguity in the constitution that did not specify which territories were nationalities and which were regions, other territories, besides the implicit three \"historical nationalities\", have also chosen to identify themselves as nationalities, in accordance with their historical regional identity, such as Andalusia, Aragon, the [[Balearic Islands]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Valencian Community]].\n\n{{Anchor|Autonomous cities}}The two autonomous cities have more limited competences than autonomous communities, but more than other municipalities. The executive is exercised by a president, who is also the mayor of the city. In the same way, limited legislative power is vested in a local assembly in which the deputies are also the city councillors.\n\n===Legal powers===\nThe autonomic agreements of 1982 and 1992 tried to equalize powers (competences) devolved to the 17 autonomous communities, within the limits of the constitution and the differences guaranteed by it. This has led to an \"asymmetrical homogeneity\".<ref name=perez/> In the words of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]] in its ruling of August 5, 1983, the autonomous communities are characterized by their \"homogeneity and diversity...equal in their subordination to the constitutional order, in the principles of their representation in the Senate, in their legitimation before the Constitutional Court, and in that the differences between the distinct Statutes [of Autonomy] cannot imply economic or social privileges; however, they can be unequal with respect to the process to accede to autonomy and the concrete determination of the autonomic content of their Statute, and therefore, in their scope of competences.
