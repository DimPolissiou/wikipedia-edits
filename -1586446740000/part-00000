Suborders within Codonophora include Physonectae (consisting of the clades Calycophorae and Euphysonectae), Pyrostephidae, and Apolemiidae.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n*Suborder [[Calycophorae]]\n**[[Abylidae]] <small>Agassiz, 1862</small>\n**[[Clausophyidae]] <small>Totton, 1965</small>\n**[[Diphyidae]] <small>Quoy & Gaimard, 1827</small>\n**[[Hippopodiidae]] <small>K\u00f6lliker, 1853</small>\n**[[Prayidae]] <small>K\u00f6lliker, 1853</small>\n**[[Sphaeronectidae]] <small>Huxley, 1859</small>\n**[[Tottonophyidae]] <small>Pugh, Dunn & Haddock, 2018</small>\n*Suborder [[Cystonectae]]\n**[[Physaliidae]] <small>Brandt, 1835</small>\n**[[Rhizophysidae]] <small>Brandt, 1835</small>\n*Suborder [[Physonectae]]\n**[[Agalmatidae]] <small>Brandt, 1834</small>\n**[[Apolemiidae]] <small>Huxley, 1859</small>\n**[[Cordagalmatidae]] <small>Pugh, 2016</small>\n**[[Erennidae]] <small>Pugh, 2001</small>\n**[[Forskaliidae]] <small>Haeckel, 1888</small>\n**[[Physophoridae]] <small>Eschscholtz, 1829</small>\n**[[Pyrostephidae]] <small>Moser, 1925</small>\n**[[Resomiidae]] <small>Pugh, 2006</small>\n**[[Rhodaliidae]] <small>Haeckel, 1888</small>\n**[[Stephanomiidae]] <small>Huxley, 1859</small>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Differential-Gene-Expression-in-the-Siphonophore-Nanomia-bijuga-(Cnidaria)-Assessed-with-Multiple-pone.0022953.s013.ogv|thumb|right|{{center|Video taken at a depth of 612 metres of the siphonophore ''[[Nanomia bijuga]]''}}]]\n\n=== Discovery ===\n[[Carl Linnaeus]] discovered and described the first siphonophore, the [[Portuguese man o' war]], in 1758.<ref name=\":6\" /> The discovery rate of siphonophore species was slow in the 18th century, as only four additional species were found.<ref name=\":6\" /> During the 19th century, 56 new species were observed due to research voyages conducted by European powers.<ref name=\":6\" /> The majority of new species found during this time period were collected in coastal, surface waters.<ref name=\":6\" /> During the [[Challenger expedition|HMS ''Challenger'' expedition]], various species of siphonophores were collected. [[Ernst Haeckel]] attempted to conduct a write up of all of the species of siphonophores collected on this expedition. He introduced 46 \"new species\"; however, his work was heavily critiqued because some of the species that he identified were eventually found not to be siphonophores.<ref name=\":6\" /> Nonetheless, some of his descriptions and figures (pictured below) are considered useful by modern biologists.

The remaining members reformed in 2017 for a reunion performance at the Homegrown Festival in Dallas, following which they played a number of concerts in Texas during 2017 and 2019.\n\n==History==\n===First album===\nAfter playing local gigs, the band released their first single, \"Lost and Found\", which received moderate airplay on local radio station [[KDGE]]. The band incorporated a light show similar to [[The Joshua Light Show]] at the [[Fillmore East]]. It used effects such as hand made slide shows with multi layered 16&nbsp;mm projections along with oil and water. This visual attention was present in their very first show and was the beginning of many multimedia attractions to come.\n\nThe band soon began recording what would become their first full-length album, ''[[Bill (Tripping Daisy album)|Bill]]'', released on the independent label Dragon Street Records. The album was a favorite on Dallas radio. The sound on ''Bill'' is characterized by the heavy use of vocal effects and unconventional riffs, both of which lend to a [[neo-psychedelia|neo-psychedelic]] sound. ''Bill'' was re-released on major label [[Island Records]], with a different mix and mastering from the Dragon Street version. It also excludes the cover song \"Green Tamborine\".\n\nIn 1992 Bryan Wakeland replaced Jeff Bouck as the band's drummer. The band released a live album in 1994 titled ''Get It On''. The album closes with a cover of the [[Bad Religion]] song \"[[We're Only Gonna Die]]\". DeLaughter has been noted as saying in 1990s era interviews that the record label pushed the live album out to capitalize on the popularity of ''Bill'', and it is not one of his favorite albums.\n\n===Commercial breakthrough===\nAfter signing a deal with [[Island Records]], which re-released Bill (minus the cover song \"Green Tamborine\"), the band recorded their first major-label release, ''[[I Am an Elastic Firecracker]]''. The [[music video]] for the song \"[[I Got a Girl (Tripping Daisy song)|I Got a Girl]]\" received extended airplay on [[MTV]]. A segment of the video was used in a ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' episode, a show known to lampoon popular music videos of the time. Wakeland remained in the band until after the tour for ''I Am an Elastic Firecracker'' when he chose to leave, and was replaced by Mitch Marine and Cory Lemons. Phil Karnats joined the band on lead guitar soon after Wakeland's departure, allowing DeLaughter more freedom to focus on lead vocal duty.\n\n===Later albums===\nThe band's third album, ''[[Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb]]'', was a mix of both creativity and experimentalism. DeLaughter has been quoted as saying that the album \"is the band at their best\". The album has a fragmented style: from one vignette to another. Marine toured with the band until he was replaced by [[Benjamin Curtis (musician)|Ben Curtis]], who drummed on ''Jesus Hit Like the Atom Bomb'' and their fourth album, the self-titled ''Tripping Daisy''. Other releases during this period include ''Time Capsule'' (a mix of old demos, b-sides, and one new song \u2013 the only officially released studio recording to feature drummer Mitch Marine) and ''The Tops Off Our Heads'' (an impromptu \"jam\" EP recording that marked the band's first post-major label release).\n\n===Death of Wes Berggren and split===\n[[Wes Berggren]] was found dead of a [[drug overdose]] in his apartment on October 27, 1999. The Dallas County Medical Examiner's office found traces of [[cocaine]], [[propoxyphene]], and [[benzodiazepine]] in his body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1999-11-25/music/tripping-falling/ |title=Tripping, Falling |accessdate=December 20, 2008 | publisher=Dallas Observer|date=1999-11-25 }}</ref> With Berggren's death, the band cancelled its upcoming tour dates and finished some minor recording sessions for the final album. The self-titled album was released posthumously, with Berggren's father Don playing a [[Fender Rhodes]] electric piano on the unfinished song \"Soothing Jubilee\". The album included a re-recording of \"One Through Four\", a song originally featured on ''Bill''. Tripping Daisy officially disbanded on December 14, 1999.\n\nAfter the band disbanded, Tim DeLaughter, Mark Pirro, Bryan Wakeland and Jeff Bouck formed the [[chamber pop]] group [[The Polyphonic Spree]]. Ben Curtis went on to join brother Brandon Curtis in the progressive [[space rock]] trio called [[The Secret Machines]] and later, the [[dream pop]] trio [[School of Seven Bells]]. Curtis died on December 29, 2013, from complications of lymphoma.\n\n===Reunion===\nOn January 5, 2017, the band's official [[Facebook]] page teased a possible reunion event. News later confirmed the remaining members would perform at the Homegrown Festival in Dallas on May 13, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2017/01/tripping-daisy-returning-for-homegrown-festival/|title=Tripping Daisy Returning for Homegrown Festival - D Magazine|date=2017-01-06|work=D Magazine|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}</ref> On March 9, 2017, they announced four additional Texas dates, making it the first Tripping Daisy tour in nearly twenty years.

The remaining members reformed in 2017 for a reunion performance at the Homegrown Festival in Dallas, following which they played a number of concerts in Texas during 2017 and 2019.\n\n==History==\n===First album===\nAfter playing local gigs, the band released their first single, \"Lost and Found\", which received moderate airplay on local radio station [[KDGE]]. The band incorporated a light show similar to [[The Joshua Light Show]] at the [[Fillmore East]]. It used effects such as hand made slide shows with multi layered 16&nbsp;mm projections along with oil and water. This visual attention was present in their very first show and was the beginning of many multimedia attractions to come.\n\nThe band soon began recording what would become their first full-length album, ''[[Bill (Tripping Daisy album)|Bill]]'', released on the independent label Dragon Street Records. The album was a favorite on Dallas radio. The sound on ''Bill'' is characterized by the heavy use of vocal effects and unconventional riffs, both of which lend to a [[neo-psychedelia|neo-psychedelic]] sound. ''Bill'' was re-released on major label [[Island Records]], with a different mix and mastering from the Dragon Street version. It also excludes the cover song \"Green Tamborine\".\n\nIn 1992 Bryan Wakeland replaced Jeff Bouck as the band's drummer. The band released a live album in 1994 titled ''Get It On''. The album closes with a cover of the [[Bad Religion]] song \"[[We're Only Gonna Die]]\". DeLaughter has been noted as saying in 1990s era interviews that the record label pushed the live album out to capitalize on the popularity of ''Bill'', and it is not one of his favorite albums.\n\n===Commercial breakthrough===\nAfter signing a deal with [[Island Records]], which re-released Bill (minus the cover song \"Green Tamborine\"), the band recorded their first major-label release, ''[[I Am an Elastic Firecracker]]''. The [[music video]] for the song \"[[I Got a Girl (Tripping Daisy song)|I Got a Girl]]\" received extended airplay on [[MTV]]. A segment of the video was used in a [[Beavis and Butt-Head|Beavis and Butthead]] episode, a show known to lampoon popular music videos of the time. Wakeland remained in the band until after the tour for ''I Am an Elastic Firecracker'' when he chose to leave, and was replaced by Mitch Marine and Cory Lemons. Phil Karnats joined the band on lead guitar soon after Wakeland's departure, allowing DeLaughter more freedom to focus on lead vocal duty.\n\n===Later albums===\nThe band's third album, ''[[Jesus Hits Like the Atom Bomb]]'', was a mix of both creativity and experimentalism. DeLaughter has been quoted as saying that the album \"is the band at their best\". The album has a fragmented style: from one vignette to another. Marine toured with the band until he was replaced by [[Benjamin Curtis (musician)|Ben Curtis]], who drummed on ''Jesus Hit Like the Atom Bomb'' and their fourth album, the self-titled ''Tripping Daisy''. Other releases during this period include ''Time Capsule'' (a mix of old demos, b-sides, and one new song \u2013 the only officially released studio recording to feature drummer Mitch Marine) and ''The Tops Off Our Heads'' (an impromptu \"jam\" EP recording that marked the band's first post-major label release).\n\n===Death of Wes Berggren and split===\n[[Wes Berggren]] was found dead of a [[drug overdose]] in his apartment on October 27, 1999. The Dallas County Medical Examiner's office found traces of [[cocaine]], [[propoxyphene]], and [[benzodiazepine]] in his body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/1999-11-25/music/tripping-falling/ |title=Tripping, Falling |accessdate=December 20, 2008 | publisher=Dallas Observer|date=1999-11-25 }}</ref> With Berggren's death, the band cancelled its upcoming tour dates and finished some minor recording sessions for the final album. The self-titled album was released posthumously, with Berggren's father Don playing a [[Fender Rhodes]] electric piano on the unfinished song \"Soothing Jubilee\". The album included a re-recording of \"One Through Four\", a song originally featured on ''Bill''. Tripping Daisy officially disbanded on December 14, 1999.\n\nAfter the band disbanded, Tim DeLaughter, Mark Pirro, Bryan Wakeland and Jeff Bouck formed the [[chamber pop]] group [[The Polyphonic Spree]]. Ben Curtis went on to join brother Brandon Curtis in the progressive [[space rock]] trio called [[The Secret Machines]] and later, the [[dream pop]] trio [[School of Seven Bells]]. Curtis died on December 29, 2013, from complications of lymphoma.\n\n===Reunion===\nOn January 5, 2017, the band's official [[Facebook]] page teased a possible reunion event. News later confirmed the remaining members would perform at the Homegrown Festival in Dallas on May 13, 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dmagazine.com/arts-entertainment/2017/01/tripping-daisy-returning-for-homegrown-festival/|title=Tripping Daisy Returning for Homegrown Festival - D Magazine|date=2017-01-06|work=D Magazine|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}</ref> On March 9, 2017, they announced four additional Texas dates, making it the first Tripping Daisy tour in nearly twenty years.
