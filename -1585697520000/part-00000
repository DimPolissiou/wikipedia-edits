Platonic psychology with its divisions of reason, spirit and appetite, also bears resemblance to the three ''[[gunas]]'' in the Indian philosophy of [[Samkhya]].{{sfn|Chousalkar|1986|pp=130-134}}{{sfn|Wadia|1956|p=64-65}}{{refn|group=note|For instances of Platonic [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]] in the early Upanishads see Randall.{{sfn|Collins|2000|pp=197\u2013198}}}}\n\nVarious mechanisms for such a transmission of knowledge have been conjectured including Pythagoras traveling as far as India; Indian philosophers visiting Athens and meeting [[Socrates]]; Plato encountering the ideas when in exile in Syracuse; or, intermediated through Persia.{{sfn|Chousalkar|1986|pp=130-134}}{{sfn|Urwick|1920}}\n\nHowever, other scholars, such as [[Arthur Berriedale Keith]], [[John Burnet (classicist)|J.

They note that there is no historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in the stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in ''this'' life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state.{{sfn|Wadia|1956|p=64-65}} In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's [[moksha]] (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).{{sfn|Keith|2007|pp=602-603}}<ref name=wdstrappini/><ref>RC Mishra (2013), Moksha and the Hindu Worldview, Psychology & Developing Societies, Vol. 25, No. 1, pages 21-42; Chousalkar, Ashok (1986), Social and Political Implications of Concepts Of Justice And Dharma, pages 130-134</ref>\n\n==Translations==\nThe Upanishads have been translated into various languages including [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Urdu]], [[French language|French]], [[Latin]], [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].{{sfn|Sharma|1985|p=20}} The [[Moghul]] Emperor [[Akbar]]'s reign (1556\u20131586) saw the first translations of the Upanishads into Persian.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1900|p=lvii}}{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1899|p=204}} His great-grandson, Sultan Mohammed [[Dara Shikoh]], produced a collection called ''Oupanekhat'' in 1656, wherein 50 Upanishads were translated from Sanskrit into [[Persian language|Persian]].{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=558-59}}\n\n[[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil Duperron]], a French Orientalist received a manuscript of the ''Oupanekhat'' and translated the Persian version into French and Latin, publishing the Latin translation in two volumes in 1801\u20131802 as ''Oupneck'hat''.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=558-59}}{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1900|p=lvii}} The French translation was never published.{{sfn|M\u00fcller|1900|p=lviii}} The Latin version was the initial introduction of Upanishadic thought to Western scholars.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=558-559}} However, according to Deussen, the Persian translators took great liberties in translating the text and at times changed the meaning.{{Sfn|Deussen| Bedekar | Palsule (tr.)|1997|pp=915-916}}\n\nThe first Sanskrit to English translation of the [[Aitareya Upanishad]] was made by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|Colebrooke]],<ref name=colebrook1858>See Henry Thomas Colebrooke (1858), ''[https://archive.org/details/essaysonreligio01colegoog/page/n38 <!-- pg=26 --> Essays on the religion and philosophy of the Hindus]''.

The region is bounded on the west by the upper Indus valley, on the east by lower Ganges region, on the north by the Himalayan foothills, and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range.<ref name=olivelleintro/> Scholars are reasonably sure that the early Upanishads were produced at the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, comprising the regions of [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru]]-[[Panchala]] and [[Kosala]]-[[Videha]] together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxvii}} This region covers modern [[Bihar]], [[Nepal]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Haryana]], eastern [[Rajasthan]], and northern [[Madhya Pradesh]].<ref name=olivelleintro/>\n\nWhile significant attempts have been made recently to identify the exact locations of the individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxviii}} The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.{{sfn|Olivelle|1998|p=xxxix}}\n\nCompared to the Principal Upanishads, the new Upanishads recorded in the {{IAST|Muktik\u0101}} belong to an entirely different region, probably southern India, and are considerably relatively recent.{{sfn|Deussen|1908|pp=35\u201336}} In the fourth chapter of the Kaushitaki Upanishad, a location named Kashi (modern [[Varanasi]]) is mentioned.<ref name=olivelleintro/>\n\n==Classification==\n===Muktika canon: major and minor Upanishads===\nThere are more than 200 known ''Upanishads'', one of which, the ''{{IAST|[[Muktik\u0101]]}}'' Upanishad, predates 1656 CE{{sfn|Tripathy|2010|p=84}} and contains a list of 108 canonical Upanishads,{{sfn|Sen|1937|p=19}} including itself as the last.

On occasions, the Upanishads extend the task of the Aranyakas by making the ritual allegorical and giving it a philosophical meaning. For example, the Brihadaranyaka interprets the practice of horse-sacrifice or ''[[ashvamedha]]'' allegorically. It states that the over-lordship of the earth may be acquired by sacrificing a horse.

The Upanishads insisted on oneness of soul, excluded all plurality, and therefore, all proximity in space, all succession in time, all interdependence as cause and effect, and all opposition as subject and object.<ref name=pauldeussenreview>Paul Deussen, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyoftheupa00deusuoft#page/n167/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads] University of Kiel, T&T Clark, pages 150-179</ref> Max M\u00fcller, in his review of the Upanishads, summarizes the lack of systematic philosophy and the central theme in the Upanishads as follows,\n\n{{quote|\nThere is not what could be called a philosophical system in these Upanishads. They are, in the true sense of the word, guesses at truth, frequently contradicting each other, yet all tending in one direction. The key-note of the old Upanishads is \"know thyself,\" but with a much deeper meaning than that of the ''\u03b3\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd'' of the [[Know thyself|Delphic Oracle]].

[[ALPL|Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase]] (TNSALP) deficiency in [[osteoblasts]] and [[chondrocytes]] impairs bone mineralization, leading to [[rickets]] or osteomalacia. The [[pathognomonic]] finding is subnormal serum activity of the TNSALP enzyme, which is caused by one of 200 genetic mutations identified to date, in the gene encoding TNSALP. Genetic inheritance is autosomal recessive for the perinatal and infantile forms but either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant in the milder forms.

Although several clinical sub-types of the disease have been characterized, based on the age at which skeletal lesions are discovered, the disease is best understood as a single continuous spectrum of severity.\n\n=== Perinatal hypophosphatasia ===\n\nPerinatal hypophosphatasia is the most lethal form. Profound hypomineralization results in caput membranaceum (a soft [[calvarium]]), deformed or shortened limbs during gestation and at birth, and rapid death due to respiratory failure.<ref name=Thai-Journal>{{cite journal|last1=Jaruratanasirikul|first1=S|last2=Chanvitan|first2=P|title=Hypophosphatasia: the importance of alkaline phosphatase in bone mineralization|journal=Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand|volume=82|issue=12|date=December 1999|pages=1268\u201372|pmid=10659574}}</ref> [[Stillbirth]] is not uncommon and long-term survival is rare. [[Neonates]] who manage to survive suffer increasing respiratory compromise due to softening of the bones ([[osteomalacia]]) and underdeveloped lungs ([[hypoplastic]]).

Some stillborn skeletons show almost no [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]]; others have marked undermineralization and severe osteomalacia. Occasionally, there can be a complete absence of [[ossification]] in one or more vertebrae. In the skull, individual bones may calcify only at their centers. Another unusual radiographic feature is bony spurs that protrude laterally from the shafts of the [[ulna]]e and [[fibula]]e. Despite the considerable patient-to-patient variability and the diversity of radiographic findings, the X-ray can be considered diagnostic.\n\n=== Infantile hypophosphatasia ===\n\nInfantile hypophosphatasia presents in the first 6 months of life, with the onset of poor feeding and inadequate weight gain. Clinical manifestations of [[rickets]] often appear at this time. Although cranial sutures appear to be wide, this reflects hypomineralization of the skull, and there is often \u201cfunctional\u201d [[craniosynostosis]]. If the patient survives infancy, these sutures can permanently fuse. Defects in the chest, such as [[flail chest]] resulting from rib fractures, lead to respiratory compromise and [[pneumonia]]. Elevated calcium in the blood ([[Hypercalcaemia|hypercalcemia]]) and urine ([[Hypercalciuria|hypercalcenuria]]) are also common, and may explain the renal problems and recurrent vomiting seen is this disease.<ref name=\"Signs\">{{cite web|title=Hypophosphatasia Signs and Symptoms|url=http://hypophosphatasia.com/what-hypophosphatasia/signs-and-symptoms|website=Hypophosphatasia.com|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nRadiographic features in infants are generally less severe than those seen in perinatal hypophosphatasia. In the long bones, there is an abrupt change from a normal appearance in the shaft ([[diaphysis]]) to uncalcified regions near the ends ([[metaphysis]]), which suggests the occurrence of an abrupt metabolic change. In addition, serial radiography studies suggest that defects in skeletal mineralization (i.e. rickets) persist and become more generalized. Mortality is estimated to be 50% in the first year of life.\n\n=== Childhood hypophosphatasia ===\n\nHypophosphatasia in childhood has variable clinical expression. As a result of defects in the development of the dental [[cementum]], the [[deciduous teeth]] (baby teeth) are often lost before the age of 5. Frequently, the incisors are lost first; occasionally all of the teeth are lost prematurely. Dental radiographs can show the enlarged [[Pulp (tooth)|pulp]] chambers and root canals that are characteristic of rickets.\n\nPatients may experience delayed walking, a characteristic waddling gait, stiffness and pain, and muscle weakness (especially in the thighs) consistent with nonprogressive [[myopathy]]. Typically, radiographs show defects in calcification and characteristic bony defects near the ends of major long bones. Growth retardation, frequent fractures, and low bone density ([[osteopenia]]) are common. In severely-affected infants and young children, cranial bones can fuse prematurely, despite the appearance of open [[Fontanelle|fontanels]] on radiographic studies. The illusion of open fontanels results from hypomineralization of large areas of the calvarium. Premature bony fusion of the cranial sutures may elevate intracranial pressure.\n\n=== Adult hypophosphatasia ===\n\nAdult hypophosphatasia can be associated with rickets, premature loss of deciduous teeth, or early loss of adult dentation followed by relatively good health. Osteomalacia results in painful feet due to poor healing of metatarsal stress fractures. Discomfort in the thighs or hips due to femoral pseudofractures can be distinguished from other types of osteomalacia by their location in the lateral cortices of the femora.\n\nSome patients suffer from [[Chondrocalcinosis|calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal depositions]] with occasional attacks of arthritis ([[Chondrocalcinosis|pseudogout]]), which appears to be the result of elevated endogenous inorganic [[pyrophosphate]] (PPi) levels. These patients may also suffer [[Articular cartilage damage|articular cartilage degeneration]] and pyrophosphate [[arthropathy]]. Radiographs reveal pseudofractures in the lateral cortices of the proximal femora and stress fractures, and patients may experience osteopenia, chondrocalcinosis, features of pyrophosphate arthropathy, and [[Calcific tendinitis|calcific periarthritis]].\n\nOdontohypophosphatasia is present when dental disease is the only clinical abnormality, and radiographic and/or histologic studies reveal no evidence of rickets or osteomalacia. Although hereditary leukocyte abnormalities and other disorders usually account for this condition, odontohypophosphatasia may explain some \u201cearly-onset periodontitis\u201d cases.\n\n== Causes ==\nHypophosphatasia is associated with a molecular defect in the gene encoding [[ALPL|tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase]] (TNSALP). TNSALP is an enzyme that is tethered to the outer surface of [[osteoblasts]] and [[chondrocyte]]s. TNSALP [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] several substances, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and [[pyridoxal phosphate|pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate]] (PLP), a major form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.\n\nWhen TSNALP is low, inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) accumulates outside of cells, and inhibits formation of [[hydroxyapatite]], one of the main components of bone, causing rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia (soft bones) in adults. PLP is the principal form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and must be [[dephosphorylation|dephosphorylated]] by TNSALP before it can cross the cell membrane. Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency in the brain impairs synthesis of [[neurotransmitters]], which can cause seizures. In some cases, a build-up of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the joint can cause pseudogout.\n== Genetics==\n\nPerinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia are inherited as [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal recessive]] traits with [[Zygosity|homozygosity]] or [[compound heterozygosity]] for two defective TNSALP [[alleles]]. The mode of inheritance for childhood, adult, and odonto forms of hypophosphatasia can be either [[Genetic disorder|autosomal dominant or recessive]]. Autosomal transmission accounts for the fact that the disease affects males and females with equal frequency. Genetic counseling is complicated by the disease\u2019s variable inheritance pattern, and by incomplete penetration of the trait.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Simon-Bouy B, Taillandier A, Fauvert D, etal |title=Hypophosphatasia: molecular testing of 19 prenatal cases and discussion about genetic counseling |journal=Prenat.

The highest incidence of hypophosphatasia has been reported in the [[Mennonite]] population in [[Manitoba]], Canada where one in every 25 individuals are considered carriers and one in every 2,500 newborns exhibits severe disease.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenberg CR, Taylor CL, Haworth JC, etal |title=A homoallelic Gly317-->Asp mutation in ALPL causes the perinatal (lethal) form of hypophosphatasia in Canadian mennonites |journal=Genomics |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=215\u20137 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8406453 |doi=10.1006/geno.1993.1305 }}</ref> Hypophosphatasia is considered particularly rare in people of [[African Americans|African ancestry]] in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Whyte MP, Essmyer K, Geimer M, Mumm S |title=Homozygosity for TNSALP mutation 1348c>T (Arg433Cys) causes infantile hypophosphatasia manifesting transient disease correction and variably lethal outcome in a kindred of black ancestry |journal=J.

Researchers have recently documented a positive correlation between dental abnormalities and clinical phenotype. Poor dentition is also noted in adults.<ref name=Reibel09/>\n\n=== Laboratory testing ===\nThe symptom that best characterizes hypophosphatasia is low serum activity of alkaline phosphatase enzyme (ALP). In general, lower levels of enzyme activity correlate with more severe symptoms. The decrease in ALP activity leads to an increase in pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) in the blood, and correlates with disease severity. Urinary inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels are elevated in most hypophosphatasia patients and, although it remains only a research technique, this increase has been reported to accurately detect carriers of the disease. In addition, most patients have an increased level of urinary [[phosphoethanolamine]] (PEA). Tests for serum ALP levels are part of the standard [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP) that is used in routine exams.\n\n=== Radiography ===\nDespite patient-to-patient variability and the diversity of radiographic findings, the X-ray is diagnostic in infantile hypophosphatasia.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02026677 |vauthors=Shohat M, Rimoin DL, Gruber HE, Lachman RS |title=Perinatal lethal hypophosphatasia; clinical, radiologic and morphologic findings |journal=Pediatr Radiol |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=421\u20137 |year=1991 |pmid=1749675 }}</ref> Skeletal defects are found in nearly all patients and include hypomineralization, rachitic changes, incomplete vertebrate ossification and, occasionally, lateral bony spurs on the ulnae and fibulae.\n\nIn newborns, X-rays readily distinguish hypophosphatasia from osteogenesis imperfecta and congenital dwarfism. Some stillborn skeletons show almost no mineralization; others have marked undermineralization and severe rachitic changes. Occasionally there can be peculiar complete or partial absence of ossification in one or more vertebrae. In the skull, individual membranous bones may calcify only at their centers, making it appear that areas of the unossified calvarium have cranial sutures that are widely separated when, in fact, they are functionally closed. Small protrusions (or \"tongues\") of radiolucency often extend from the metaphyses into the bone shaft.\n\nIn infants, radiographic features of hypophosphatasia are striking, though generally less severe than those found in perinatal hypophosphatasia. In some newly diagnosed patients, there is an abrupt transition from relatively normal-appearing diaphyses to uncalcified metaphases, suggesting an abrupt metabolic change has occurred. Serial radiography studies can reveal the persistence of impaired skeletal mineralization (i.e. rickets), instances of sclerosis, and gradual generalized demineralization.\n\nIn adults, X-rays may reveal bilateral femoral pseudofractures in the lateral {{linktext|subtrochanteric}} diaphysis. These pseudofractures may remain for years, but they may not heal until they break completely or the patient receives [[Intramedullary rod|intramedullary fixation]]. These patients may also experience recurrent metatarsal fractures.\n\n=== Genetic analysis ===\nAll clinical sub-types of hypophosphatasia have been traced to genetic mutations in the gene encoding TNSALP, which is localized on chromosome 1p36.1-34 in humans ([[ALPL]]; OMIM#171760). Approximately 204 distinct mutations have been described in the TNSALP gene. An up-to-date list of mutations is available online at [http://www.sesep.uvsq.fr/database_hypo/Mutation.html The Tissue Nonspecific Alkaline Phosphatase Gene Mutations Database]. About 80% of the mutations are [[missense mutations]]. The number and diversity of mutations results in highly variable phenotypic expression, and there appears to be a correlation between genotype and phenotype in hypophosphatasia\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/hmg/8.6.1039 |vauthors=Zurutuza L, Muller F, Gibrat JF, etal |title=Correlations of genotype and phenotype in hypophosphatasia |journal=Hum.

Some stillborn skeletons show almost no [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]]; others have marked undermineralization and severe osteomalacia. Occasionally, there can be a complete absence of [[ossification]] in one or more vertebrae. In the skull, individual bones may calcify only at their centers. Another unusual radiographic feature is bony spurs that protrude laterally from the shafts of the [[ulna]]e and [[fibula]]e. Despite the considerable patient-to-patient variability and the diversity of radiographic findings, the X-ray can be considered diagnostic.\n\n=== Infantile hypophosphatasia ===\n\nInfantile hypophosphatasia presents in the first 6 months of life, with the onset of poor feeding and inadequate weight gain. Clinical manifestations of [[rickets]] often appear at this time. Although cranial sutures appear to be wide, this reflects hypomineralization of the skull, and there is often \u201cfunctional\u201d [[craniosynostosis]]. If the patient survives infancy, these sutures can permanently fuse. Defects in the chest, such as [[flail chest]] resulting from rib fractures, lead to respiratory compromise and [[pneumonia]]. Elevated calcium in the blood ([[Hypercalcaemia|hypercalcemia]]) and urine ([[Hypercalciuria|hypercalcenuria]]) are also common, and may explain the renal problems and recurrent vomiting seen is this disease.<ref name=\"Signs\">{{cite web|title=Hypophosphatasia Signs and Symptoms|url=http://hypophosphatasia.com/what-hypophosphatasia/signs-and-symptoms|website=Hypophosphatasia.com|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nRadiographic features in infants are generally less severe than those seen in perinatal hypophosphatasia. In the long bones, there is an abrupt change from a normal appearance in the shaft ([[diaphysis]]) to uncalcified regions near the ends ([[metaphysis]]), which suggests the occurrence of an abrupt metabolic change. In addition, serial radiography studies suggest that defects in skeletal mineralization (i.e. rickets) persist and become more generalized. Mortality is estimated to be 50% in the first year of life.\n\n=== Childhood hypophosphatasia ===\n\nHypophosphatasia in childhood has variable clinical expression. As a result of defects in the development of the dental [[cementum]], the [[deciduous teeth]] (baby teeth) are often lost before the age of 5. Frequently, the incisors are lost first; occasionally all of the teeth are lost prematurely. Dental radiographs can show the enlarged [[Pulp (tooth)|pulp]] chambers and root canals that are characteristic of rickets.\n\nPatients may experience delayed walking, a characteristic waddling gait, stiffness and pain, and muscle weakness (especially in the thighs) consistent with nonprogressive [[myopathy]]. Typically, radiographs show defects in calcification and characteristic bony defects near the ends of major long bones. Growth retardation, frequent fractures, and low bone density ([[osteopenia]]) are common. In severely-affected infants and young children, cranial bones can fuse prematurely, despite the appearance of open [[Fontanelle|fontanels]] on radiographic studies. The illusion of open fontanels results from hypomineralization of large areas of the calvarium. Premature bony fusion of the cranial sutures may elevate intracranial pressure.\n\n=== Adult hypophosphatasia ===\n\nAdult hypophosphatasia can be associated with rickets, premature loss of deciduous teeth, or early loss of adult dentation followed by relatively good health. Osteomalacia results in painful feet due to poor healing of metatarsal stress fractures. Discomfort in the thighs or hips due to femoral pseudofractures can be distinguished from other types of osteomalacia by their location in the lateral cortices of the femora.\n\nSome patients suffer from [[Chondrocalcinosis|calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal depositions]] with occasional attacks of arthritis ([[Chondrocalcinosis|pseudogout]]), which appears to be the result of elevated endogenous inorganic [[pyrophosphate]] (PPi) levels. These patients may also suffer [[Articular cartilage damage|articular cartilage degeneration]] and pyrophosphate [[arthropathy]]. Radiographs reveal pseudofractures in the lateral cortices of the proximal femora and stress fractures, and patients may experience osteopenia, chondrocalcinosis, features of pyrophosphate arthropathy, and [[Calcific tendinitis|calcific periarthritis]].\n\nOdontohypophosphatasia is present when dental disease is the only clinical abnormality, and radiographic and/or histologic studies reveal no evidence of rickets or osteomalacia. Although hereditary leukocyte abnormalities and other disorders usually account for this condition, odontohypophosphatasia may explain some \u201cearly-onset periodontitis\u201d cases.\n\n== Causes ==\nHypophosphatasia is associated with a molecular defect in the gene encoding [[ALPL|tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase]] (TNSALP). TNSALP is an enzyme that is tethered to the outer surface of [[osteoblasts]] and [[chondrocyte]]s. TNSALP [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] several substances, including inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) and [[pyridoxal phosphate|pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate]] (PLP), a major form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>.\n\nWhen TSNALP is low, inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) accumulates outside of cells, and inhibits formation of [[hydroxyapatite]], one of the main components of bone, causing rickets in infants and children and osteomalacia (soft bones) in adults. PLP is the principal form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub> and must be [[dephosphorylation|dephosphorylated]] by TNSALP before it can cross the cell membrane. Vitamin B<sub>6</sub> deficiency in the brain impairs synthesis of [[neurotransmitters]], which can cause seizures. In some cases, a build-up of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals in the joint can cause pseudogout.\n== Genetics==\n\nPerinatal and infantile hypophosphatasia are inherited as [[Dominance (genetics)|autosomal recessive]] traits with [[Zygosity|homozygosity]] or [[compound heterozygosity]] for two defective TNSALP [[alleles]]. The mode of inheritance for childhood, adult, and odonto forms of hypophosphatasia can be either [[Genetic disorder|autosomal dominant or recessive]]. Autosomal transmission accounts for the fact that the disease affects males and females with equal frequency. Genetic counseling is complicated by the disease\u2019s variable inheritance pattern, and by incomplete penetration of the trait.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Simon-Bouy B, Taillandier A, Fauvert D, etal |title=Hypophosphatasia: molecular testing of 19 prenatal cases and discussion about genetic counseling |journal=Prenat.

The frequency of mild hypophosphatasia is more challenging to assess because the symptoms may escape notice or be misdiagnosed. The highest incidence of hypophosphatasia has been reported in the [[Mennonite]] population in [[Manitoba]], Canada where one in every 25 individuals are considered carriers and one in every 2,500 newborns exhibits severe disease.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Greenberg CR, Taylor CL, Haworth JC, etal |title=A homoallelic Gly317-->Asp mutation in ALPL causes the perinatal (lethal) form of hypophosphatasia in Canadian mennonites |journal=Genomics |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=215\u20137 |date=July 1993 |pmid=8406453 |doi=10.1006/geno.1993.1305 }}</ref> Hypophosphatasia is considered particularly rare in people of [[African Americans|African ancestry]] in the U.S.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Whyte MP, Essmyer K, Geimer M, Mumm S |title=Homozygosity for TNSALP mutation 1348c>T (Arg433Cys) causes infantile hypophosphatasia manifesting transient disease correction and variably lethal outcome in a kindred of black ancestry |journal=J.

Researchers have recently documented a positive correlation between dental abnormalities and clinical phenotype. Poor dentition is also noted in adults.<ref name=Reibel09/>\n\n=== Laboratory testing ===\nThe symptom that best characterizes hypophosphatasia is low serum activity of alkaline phosphatase enzyme (ALP). In general, lower levels of enzyme activity correlate with more severe symptoms. The decrease in ALP activity leads to an increase in pyridoxal 5\u2019-phosphate (PLP) in the blood, and correlates with disease severity. Urinary inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels are elevated in most hypophosphatasia patients and, although it remains only a research technique, this increase has been reported to accurately detect carriers of the disease. In addition, most patients have an increased level of urinary [[phosphoethanolamine]] (PEA). Tests for serum ALP levels are part of the standard [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP) that is used in routine exams.\n\n=== Radiography ===\nDespite patient-to-patient variability and the diversity of radiographic findings, the X-ray is diagnostic in infantile hypophosphatasia.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02026677 |vauthors=Shohat M, Rimoin DL, Gruber HE, Lachman RS |title=Perinatal lethal hypophosphatasia; clinical, radiologic and morphologic findings |journal=Pediatr Radiol |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=421\u20137 |year=1991 |pmid=1749675 }}</ref> Skeletal defects are found in nearly all patients and include hypomineralization, rachitic changes, incomplete vertebrate ossification and, occasionally, lateral bony spurs on the ulnae and fibulae.\n\nIn newborns, X-rays readily distinguish hypophosphatasia from osteogenesis imperfecta and congenital dwarfism. Some stillborn skeletons show almost no mineralization; others have marked undermineralization and severe rachitic changes. Occasionally there can be peculiar complete or partial absence of ossification in one or more vertebrae. In the skull, individual membranous bones may calcify only at their centers, making it appear that areas of the unossified calvarium have cranial sutures that are widely separated when, in fact, they are functionally closed. Small protrusions (or \"tongues\") of radiolucency often extend from the metaphyses into the bone shaft.\n\nIn infants, radiographic features of hypophosphatasia are striking, though generally less severe than those found in perinatal hypophosphatasia. In some newly diagnosed patients, there is an abrupt transition from relatively normal-appearing diaphyses to uncalcified metaphases, suggesting an abrupt metabolic change has occurred. Serial radiography studies can reveal the persistence of impaired skeletal mineralization (i.e. rickets), instances of sclerosis, and gradual generalized demineralization.\n\nIn adults, X-rays may reveal bilateral femoral pseudofractures in the lateral {{linktext|subtrochanteric}} diaphysis. These pseudofractures may remain for years, but they may not heal until they break completely or the patient receives [[Intramedullary rod|intramedullary fixation]]. These patients may also experience recurrent metatarsal fractures.\n\n=== Genetic analysis ===\nAll clinical sub-types of hypophosphatasia have been traced to genetic mutations in the gene encoding TNSALP, which is localized on chromosome 1p36.1-34 in humans ([[ALPL]]; OMIM#171760). Approximately 204 distinct mutations have been described in the TNSALP gene. An up-to-date list of mutations is available online at [http://www.sesep.uvsq.fr/database_hypo/Mutation.html The Tissue Nonspecific Alkaline Phosphatase Gene Mutations Database]. About 80% of the mutations are [[missense mutations]]. The number and diversity of mutations results in highly variable phenotypic expression, and there appears to be a correlation between genotype and phenotype in hypophosphatasia\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/hmg/8.6.1039 |vauthors=Zurutuza L, Muller F, Gibrat JF, etal |title=Correlations of genotype and phenotype in hypophosphatasia |journal=Hum.

Players must successfully manage their hunger, thirst, and health, or risk dying. Despite the looming threat of [[American black bears|bears]] and [[wolf|wolves]], the primary menace is other players due to the game being solely multiplayer. Combat is accomplished through [[firearm]]s and primitive weapons, such as [[Bow and arrow|bow]]s. In addition, vehicles controlled by [[non-player character]]s will occasionally roam, attacking heavily-armed players. These can be defeated with persistence. ''Rust'' features crafting, though initially limited until the discovery of specific items in the game's [[open world]]. To stay protected, players must build [[Military base|base]]s or join [[Clan (computer gaming)|clan]]s to improve their chance of survival. [[Raid (gaming)|Raiding]] is a major aspect of ''Rust'' and is done more frequently by large clans. \n\n''Rust'' was first released in December 2013 to the [[Steam Early Access]] program; this early access state is now known as Rust Legacy. Further into its development, the gameplay was changed significantly. Dangerous wildlife replaced zombies as the primary environmental threat and several fundamental revisions to the crafting system were released. 2014 saw the game ported to the [[Unity 5]] [[game engine]], providing substantial graphical changes. Around this time, ''Rust'' introduced immutable, predetermined [[Race (human categorization)|skin colour]] and [[biological sex]] tied to players' [[Steam (website)|Steam]] account details. Despite being fully released, the game continues to receive updates.\n\nThroughout ''Rust''{{'}}s alpha release, critical reviews were mixed, with many comparisons made to other survival games. ''Rust'' was commonly explained as being a mixture of ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Minecraft]]''. During this period, reviewers frequently noted the game's unfinished nature. During its pre-release phase, critics praised the concept and gameplay and by March 2017, ''Rust'' had sold over five million copies. After leaving Early Access, it received mixed reviews from critics. The [[player vs player]] combat and survival aspects were highlighted by those who enjoyed the game, though reviewers were critical of the constant need to [[Grinding (gaming)|grind]] for materials, along with the harsh beginner experience.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Collecting wood in Rust.jpeg|right|thumb|280px|A player using the starting rock to gather wood]]\nAs a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]-only video game,<ref name=\"5MC\">{{cite web|title = 5 Video Games to Play if You Like \u2018Minecraft\u2019|url = http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/5-video-games-to-play-if-you-like-minecraft.html/4/|accessdate = 1 July 2015|website = CheatSheet|first = Chris|date = 30 June 2015|last = Reed|page = 4|url-status = live|archivedate = 21 September 2016|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160921085950/http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/5-video-games-to-play-if-you-like-minecraft.html/4/|df = dmy-all}}</ref> ''Rust'' puts players against each other in a harsh, [[open world]] environment with the sole goal of survival.

Critics praised the PvP combat, difficulty, and survival aspects, while grinding and the experience had by new players came under some criticism.<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/><ref name=\"RPS-review\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/02/12/rust-review|title=Wot I Think: Rust|first=Matt|last=Cox|date=12 February 2018|accessdate=13 February

Shotgun]]}}</ref><ref name=\"PCG-review\"/>\n\nMany critics held the opinion that while starting anew was frustrating, the combat was rewarding. For instance, Luke Winkie of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' summarised the game saying, \"Wake up naked, run for your life, do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative, or [[mythos]], or win condition.\"<ref name=\"PCG-review\"/> He described the beginner experience as \"quite prickly\" but continued on to praise the combat, joking that \"connecting [a] hatchet with an idiot's head feels great\". Gloria Manderfeld, a writer for the German magazine ''[[GameStar]]'', echoed these opinions, adding there was little end-game besides PvP. However, she opined the PvP itself was effective.<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/> Ray Porreca of ''[[Destructoid]]'' described the combat as the \"meat\" of the game. However, he wrote that the experience would vary depending on their desire to fight. \"If you can look past a community that tends to be [[Glossary_of_video_game_terms#toxicity|toxic]], ''Rust''{{'}}s sprawling plains and toppled landmarks are an excellent backdrop for player-driven storytelling and pitched, dramatic moments.\"<ref name=\"Destructoid-review\"/> In a negative review ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s Alessandro Barbosa said the whole experience felt unfulfilling. He described the game as lacking certain creative features, like the ability to easily redesign bases.<ref name=\"GS-review\"/>\n\nThe disdain towards the experience as a new player was noted in conjunction with the necessity of grinding, and how repetitive that became. ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s review described the game as expecting the player to spend all their gaming time on it, fearing that failing to do so will result in being raided and needing to begin again.<ref name=\"IGN-review\"/> ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Javy Gwaltney reiterated this, explaining it felt demotivating when they died solely because they came in contact with someone more experienced.<ref name=\"GI-review\"/> Agreeing with Manderfeld's description,<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/> in an updated review Cox said his patience wore thin after a while. He said that while maintaining [[health (gaming)|health bars]] may have once been enjoyable, he balked at the prospect in 2018.<ref name=\"RPS-review\"/>\n\nNonetheless, some critics praised the game's difficulty, mentioning the satisfaction they felt after managing to survive successfully. Porreca recommended the game to those willing to dedicate time, saying the game offers \"a social sandbox and a deep, functioning crafting system\".<ref name=\"Destructoid-review\"/> Winkie expressed interest in the necessity of managing hunger, thirst, and health while learning more and discovering better items. He also expressed a sense of appreciation for those dedicated to the game, mentioning the YouTube videos of large, multi-clan raids. He closed the review saying everyone should try ''Rust'' due to its difference from other games.<ref name=\"PCG-review\"/> Cox agreed noting the game's brutality only added to the gratification a player felt when they managed to eventually succeed.<ref name=\"RPS-review\"/>\n\nThe reception towards the graphics were mixed. Critics praised the environment, but denounced the animations and character models.<ref name=\"GI-review\"/> Barbosa described the animations as \"stiff and unnatural\" and the models \"ugly and dull\".<ref name=\n\"GS-review\"/> Additionally, the way ''Rust'' uses sound was commended by Gwaltney, who explained it as being compelling due to the way players must listen for others in order to survive.<ref name=\"GI-review\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{portal|Video games}}\n* {{Official website|rust.facepunch.com}}\n\n[[Category:2018 video games]]\n[[Category:Early access video games]]\n[[Category:Indie video games]]\n[[Category:Linux games]]\n[[Category:MacOS games]]\n[[Category:Open world video games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 games]]\n[[Category:Role-playing video games]]\n[[Category:Steam Workshop games]]\n[[Category:Survival video games]]\n[[Category:Unity (game engine) games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games that support Vulkan]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Xbox One games]]\n", "text_old": "{{good article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2016}}\n{{short description|Survival video game}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title = Rust\n| image = File:Rust vector logo.svg\n| developer = [[Facepunch Studios]]\n| publisher = Facepunch Studios\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = [[macOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]]\n| released = 8 February 2018\n| genre = [[Action-adventure game|Action-adventure]], [[Survival game|survival]]\n| modes = [[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]]\n| director = \n| producer = \n| designer = \n| programmer = \n| artist = \n| composer = \n}}\n\n'''''Rust''''' is a [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]-only [[Survival game|survival]] [[video game]] developed by [[Facepunch Studios|Facepunch Studios.]] Rust was first released in early access in December 2013 and received its full release in February 2018. ''Rust'' is available on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]]. Console versions for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] have been announced for release in 2020.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/14/20965525/rust-ps4-xbox-one-release-dates-2020|title=Rust comes to PS4 and Xbox One next year|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=14 November 2019|work=Polygon|accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref> ''Rust'' was initially created as a [[Video game clone|clone]] of ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'', a popular [[Mod (video gaming)|mod]] for ''[[ARMA 2]]'', with [[Glossary of video game terms#Crafting|crafting]] elements akin to those in ''[[Minecraft]]''. \n\nThe objective of ''Rust'' is to survive in the wilderness using gathered or stolen materials. Players must successfully manage their hunger, thirst, and health, or risk dying. Despite the looming threat of [[American black bears|bears]] and [[wolf|wolves]], the primary menace is other players due to the game being solely multiplayer. Combat is accomplished through [[firearm]]s and primitive weapons, such as [[Bow and arrow|bow]]s. In addition, vehicles controlled by [[non-player character]]s will occasionally roam, attacking heavily-armed players. These can be defeated with persistence. ''Rust'' features crafting, though initially limited until the discovery of specific items in the game's [[open world]]. To stay protected, players must build [[Military base|base]]s or join [[Clan (computer gaming)|clan]]s to improve their chance of survival. [[Raid (gaming)|Raiding]] is a major aspect of ''Rust'' and is done more frequently by large clans. \n\n''Rust'' was first released in December 2013 to the [[Steam Early Access]] program; this early access state is now known as Rust Legacy. Further into its development, the gameplay was changed significantly. Dangerous wildlife replaced zombies as the primary environmental threat and several fundamental revisions to the crafting system were released. 2014 saw the game ported to the [[Unity 5]] [[game engine]], providing substantial graphical changes. Around this time, ''Rust'' introduced immutable, predetermined [[Race (human categorization)|skin colour]] and [[biological sex]] tied to players' [[Steam (website)|Steam]] account details. Despite being fully released, the game continues to receive updates.\n\nThroughout ''Rust''{{'}}s alpha release, critical reviews were mixed, with many comparisons made to other survival games. ''Rust'' was commonly explained as being a mixture of ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Minecraft]]''. During this period, reviewers frequently noted the game's unfinished nature. During its pre-release phase, critics praised the concept and gameplay and by March 2017, ''Rust'' had sold over five million copies. After leaving Early Access, it received mixed reviews from critics. The [[player vs player]] combat and survival aspects were highlighted by those who enjoyed the game, though reviewers were critical of the constant need to [[Grinding (gaming)|grind]] for materials, along with the harsh beginner experience.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Collecting wood in Rust.jpeg|right|thumb|280px|A player using the starting rock to gather wood]]\nAs a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]]-only video game,<ref name=\"5MC\">{{cite web|title = 5 Video Games to Play if You Like \u2018Minecraft\u2019|url = http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/5-video-games-to-play-if-you-like-minecraft.html/4/|accessdate = 1 July 2015|website = CheatSheet|first = Chris|date = 30 June 2015|last = Reed|page = 4|url-status = live|archivedate = 21 September 2016|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160921085950/http://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/5-video-games-to-play-if-you-like-minecraft.html/4/|df = dmy-all}}</ref> ''Rust'' puts players against each other in a harsh, [[open world]] environment with the sole goal of survival.

Critics praised the PvP combat, difficulty, and survival aspects, while grinding and the experience had by new players came under some criticism.<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/><ref

Shotgun]]}}</ref><ref name=\"PCG-review\"/>\n\nMany critics held the opinion that while starting anew was frustrating, the combat was rewarding. For instance, Luke Winkie of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' summarised the game saying, \"Wake up naked, run for your life, do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative, or [[mythos]], or win condition.\"<ref name=\"PCG-review\"/> He described the beginner experience as \"quite prickly\" but continued on to praise the combat, joking that \"connecting [a] hatchet with an idiot's head feels great\". Gloria Manderfeld, a writer for the German magazine ''[[GameStar]]'', echoed these opinions, adding there was little end-game besides PvP. However, she opined the PvP itself was effective.<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/> Ray Porreca of ''[[Destructoid]]'' described the combat as the \"meat\" of the game. However, he wrote that the experience would vary depending on their desire to fight. \"If you can look past a community that tends to be [[Glossary_of_video_game_terms#toxicity|toxic]], ''Rust''{{'}}s sprawling plains and toppled landmarks are an excellent backdrop for player-driven storytelling and pitched, dramatic moments.\"<ref name=\"Destructoid-review\"/> In a negative review ''[[GameSpot]]''{{'}}s Alessandro Barbosa said the whole experience felt unfulfilling. He described the game as lacking certain creative features, like the ability to easily redesign bases.<ref name=\"GS-review\"/>\n\nThe disdain towards the experience as a new player was noted in conjunction with the necessity of grinding, and how repetitive that became. ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s review described the game as expecting the player to spend all their gaming time on it, fearing that failing to do so will result in being raided and needing to begin again.<ref name=\"IGN-review\"/> ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Javy Gwaltney reiterated this, explaining it felt demotivating when they died solely because they came in contact with someone more experienced.<ref name=\"GI-review\"/> Agreeing with Manderfeld's description,<ref name=\"GameStar-review\"/> in an updated review Cox said his patience wore thin after a while. He said that while maintaining [[health (gaming)|health bars]] may have once been enjoyable, he balked at the prospect in 2018.<ref name=\"RPS-review\"/>\n\nNonetheless, some critics praised the game's difficulty, mentioning the satisfaction they felt after managing to survive successfully.

Polysomnographic monitoring demonstrates normal sleep latency, a normal number of arousals and awakenings, and normal sleep duration with or without a multiple sleep latency test that demonstrates a mean sleep latency of greater than 10 minutes. No medical or mental disorder produces the complaint. Other sleep disorders producing insomnia are not present to a degree that would explain the patient\u2019s complaint.\n\n===Detection and difficulties===\nDetecting sleep state misperception by [[Objectivity (philosophy)#The scientific virtues|objective]] means has been elusive.<ref name=minecan2008/><ref name=kushida2008/>\n\nA 2011 study published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine has shown that sleep misperception (i.e., underestimation of sleep duration) is prevalent among chronic insomniacs who sleep objectively more than 6 hours in the sleep lab. The psychological profile of these chronic insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration is characterized by depressive, anxious-ruminative traits and poor coping resources. Thus, it appears that not all chronic insomniacs underestimate their sleep duration, and that sleep misperception is a clinical characteristic of chronic insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration. Furthermore, [[rumination (psychology)|rumination]] and poor coping resources may play a significant role in sleep misperception.<ref>Fernandez-Mendoza J, Calhoun S, Bixler E, Karataraki M, Liao D, Vela-Bueno A, Ramos-Platon M, Sauder K, Basta M, Vgontzas A. \"Sleep Misperception and Chronic Insomnia in the General Population: The Role of Objective Sleep Duration and Psychological Profiles.\" Psychosomatic Medicine, 2011; 73(1): 88-97. doi:10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181fe365a.</ref>\n\n===Spectral analysis===\n\nAccording to a May 2014 article published in [[New Scientist]], [[Singular spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]] may help clinicians find objective evidence for sleep state misperception:\n{{quote|[...] it uncovered [...] subtle differences in the EEGs of sleeping insomniacs: alpha waves \u2013 signatures of wakefulness that are supposed to show up only in early sleep \u2013 were intruding into deep sleep. [...] [psychologist and sleep researcher Michael] Perlis. But Andrew Krystal of [[Duke University]] in Durham, North Carolina, used spectral analysis to quantify just how much they were intruding.  Krystal's non-sleepers not only had a greater proportion of these alpha disturbances, but the alpha waves were bigger and the delta waves were correspondingly smaller.  That wasn't all. When Perlis and other researchers applied spectral analysis algorithms to the EEGs of their sleeping insomniacs, they found different patterns, fast waves known as beta and gamma (Sleep, vol 24, p 110). Normally, these are indicators of consciousness, alertness and even anxiety [...] Like alpha waves, Perlis calls these beta and gamma waves \"intrusions\" into normal sleep: \"It's as if somebody is playing with the switch \u2013 boop, boop \u2013 flipping at a mad rate between wake and sleep,\" <ref name=Finkbeiner>{{Citation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909170531/http://postbiota.org/pipermail/tt/2014-May/015444.html|archivedate=2014-09-09|journal=New Scientist|year=2014|issue=2969|page=34|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229690.400-awake-asleep-insomniac-brains-that-cant-switch-off.html|title=Awake asleep: Insomniac brains that can't switch off|author=Finkbeiner, Ann}}</ref>}}\n\n===Distinction from insomnia===\nWhat is considered objective [[insomnia]], unlike SSM, can easily be confirmed [[empirical]]ly through clinical testing, such as by polysomnogram.<ref name=littner2003/> Those who experience SSM may believe that they have not slept for extended periods of time, when they in fact do sleep but without perceiving it.

The few that have been recorded have predominantly been ascribed to a rare incurable genetic disorder called [[fatal familial insomnia]], which patients rarely survive for more than 26 months after the onset of illness\u2014often much less.<ref>Schenkein, Joyce ''[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/542963_2 Fatal Familial Insomnia.

Otherwise, patients appear healthy, both [[Psychiatry|psychiatrically]] and [[Medicine|medically]].<ref name=minecan2008/> (That this condition is often [[asymptomatic]] could explain why it is relatively unreported.)\n\nHowever, upon clinical observation, it is found that patients may severely overestimate [[Sleep onset latency|the time they took to fall asleep]]\u2014often reporting having slept half the amount of time indicated by [[polysomnogram]] or [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), which may record normal sleep.<ref name=healthcom /> Observing such discrepancy between subjective and objective reports, clinicians may conclude that the perception of poor sleep is primarily [[illusion]]ary.\n\nAlternatively, some people may report [[excessive daytime sleepiness]] or chronic disabling sleepiness, while no [[sleep disorder]] has been found to exist.<ref name=minecan2008/> Methods of diagnosing sleepiness objectively, such as the [[Multiple Sleep Latency Test]] do not confirm the symptom{{--}}\"true\" sleepiness is not observed despite the complaint.<ref name=conroy2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.medlink.com/web_content/index/MLT002QS.asp|author1=Conroy, Deirdre A |author2=Culebras, Antonio | title=Paradoxical insomnia | year=2013}}</ref> (It may be speculated that such reports of daytime sleepiness may be a result of the [[nocebo]] response{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} \u2014the reverse of the [[placebo]] effect\u2014due to patient expectations of adverse effects from their subjective perception of poor sleep.)\n\nFinally, on the opposite end of the spectrum, other patients may report feeling that they have slept much longer than is observed.<ref name=conroy2013/> It has been proposed that this experience be subclassified under sleep state misperception as \"positive sleep state misperception\", \"reverse sleep state misperception\", and \"negative sleep state misperception\".\n\n===Diagnostic criteria===\nThe patient has a complaint of insomnia while sleep quality and duration are normal. Polysomnographic monitoring demonstrates normal sleep latency, a normal number of arousals and awakenings, and normal sleep duration with or without a multiple sleep latency test that demonstrates a mean sleep latency of greater than 10 minutes. No medical or mental disorder produces the complaint. Other sleep disorders producing insomnia are not present to a degree that would explain the patient\u2019s complaint.\n\n===Detection and difficulties===\nDetecting sleep state misperception by [[Objectivity (philosophy)#The scientific virtues|objective]] means has been elusive.<ref name=minecan2008/><ref name=kushida2008/>\n\nA 2011 study published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine has shown that sleep misperception (i.e., underestimation of sleep duration) is prevalent among chronic insomniacs who sleep objectively more than 6 hours in the sleep lab. The psychological profile of these chronic insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration is characterized by depressive, anxious-ruminative traits and poor coping resources. Thus, it appears that not all chronic insomniacs underestimate their sleep duration, and that sleep misperception is a clinical characteristic of chronic insomniacs with objective normal sleep duration. Furthermore, [[rumination (psychology)|rumination]] and poor coping resources may play a significant role in sleep misperception.<ref>Fernandez-Mendoza J, Calhoun S, Bixler E, Karataraki M, Liao D, Vela-Bueno A, Ramos-Platon M, Sauder K, Basta M, Vgontzas A. \"Sleep Misperception and Chronic Insomnia in the General Population: The Role of Objective Sleep Duration and Psychological Profiles.\" Psychosomatic Medicine, 2011; 73(1): 88-97. doi:10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181fe365a.</ref>\n\n===Spectral analysis===\n\nAccording to a May 2014 article published in [[New Scientist]], [[Singular spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]] may help clinicians find objective evidence for sleep state misperception:\n{{quote|[...] it uncovered [...] subtle differences in the EEGs of sleeping insomniacs: alpha waves \u2013 signatures of wakefulness that are supposed to show up only in early sleep \u2013 were intruding into deep sleep. [...] [psychologist and sleep researcher Michael] Perlis. But Andrew Krystal of [[Duke University]] in Durham, North Carolina, used spectral analysis to quantify just how much they were intruding.  Krystal's non-sleepers not only had a greater proportion of these alpha disturbances, but the alpha waves were bigger and the delta waves were correspondingly smaller.  That wasn't all. When Perlis and other researchers applied spectral analysis algorithms to the EEGs of their sleeping insomniacs, they found different patterns, fast waves known as beta and gamma (Sleep, vol 24, p 110). Normally, these are indicators of consciousness, alertness and even anxiety [...] Like alpha waves, Perlis calls these beta and gamma waves \"intrusions\" into normal sleep: \"It's as if somebody is playing with the switch \u2013 boop, boop \u2013 flipping at a mad rate between wake and sleep,\" <ref name=Finkbeiner>{{Citation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909170531/http://postbiota.org/pipermail/tt/2014-May/015444.html|archivedate=2014-09-09|journal=New Scientist|year=2014|issue=2969|page=34|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229690.400-awake-asleep-insomniac-brains-that-cant-switch-off.html|title=Awake asleep: Insomniac brains that can't switch off|author=Finkbeiner, Ann}}</ref>}}\n\n===Distinction from insomnia===\nWhat is considered objective [[insomnia]], unlike SSM, can easily be confirmed [[empirical]]ly through clinical testing, such as by polysomnogram.<ref name=littner2003/> Those who experience SSM may believe that they have not slept for extended periods of time, when they in fact do sleep but without perceiving it. For example, while patients who claim little or no sleep may usually acknowledge impaired job performance and daytime drowsiness, sleep state misperceivers often do not.<ref>[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sleepless-in-america/201206/paradoxical-insomnia Paradoxical Insomnia]</ref>\n\nCases of objective total insomnia are extremely rare. The few that have been recorded have predominantly been ascribed to a rare incurable genetic disorder called [[fatal familial insomnia]], which patients rarely survive for more than 26 months after the onset of illness\u2014often much less.<ref>Schenkein, Joyce ''[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/542963_2 Fatal Familial Insomnia.

The [[Medical prescription|prescription]] of [[hypnotic]]s or [[stimulant]]s may lead to [[Physical dependence|drug dependency]] as a complication.<ref name=minecan2008/>\n\nNonetheless, chronic SSM may increase risk for [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], anxiety, and [[substance abuse]].<ref name=kushida2008/> It has also been noted that patients with this condition may sometimes opt to take medications over other treatments \"for the wrong reasons (e.g. because of euphoriant properties).\"<ref name=littner2003>{{cite journal |last1=Littner |first1=M |last2=Hirshkowitz |first2=M |last3=Kramer |first3=M |last4=Kapen |first4=S |last5=Anderson |first5=WM |last6=Bailey |first6=D |last7=Berry |first7=RB |last8=Davila |first8=D |last9=Johnson |first9=S |last10=Kushida |first10=C |last11=Loube |first11=D.

It is part of the [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]] [[Idaho Falls metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 1,803 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nIona was homesteaded by [[Mormon pioneers]] in 1884. [[Sagebrush]], as tall as a man sitting on a horse, covered the now famous potato fields. The short growing season made it difficult to grow crops and the early settlers were discouraged and many wanted to go back south to [[Utah]]. However, when Mormon apostle [[Wilford Woodruff]] spoke to a small congregation in the Iona area on June 17, 1884, he said:\n<blockquote>\nThe Spirit of the Lord rests mightily upon me and I feel to bless you in the name of Jesus Christ. I promise you that the climate will be moderated for your good. I can see these great sagebrush prairies, as far as the eye can reach, turned into fertile fields. I bless the land that it shall yield forth in its strength. Flowers and trees and fine homes shall grace this great valley from one end to the other. Schools and colleges of higher learning shall be built to serve you that you may learn the mysteries of God\u2019s great universe. I see churches and meetinghouses dotting the landscape, where the God of Israel may be worshiped in spirit and in truth. Yes, and as I look into the future of this great valley I can see temples\u2014I can see beautiful temples erected to the name of the living God where holy labors may be carried on in his name through generations to come.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe settlers were persuaded to stay in the valley and one, [[Thomas Edwin Ricks|Thomas E. Ricks]], went on to found the city of [[Rexburg]] and Ricks College which later became [[Brigham Young University-Idaho]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2004_01_20_Orme.htm\n|title=Vision, Faith and Work:  From Wagonbox to University\n|author=Orme, Michael R.\n|publisher=[[Brigham Young University-Idaho]]\n|date=2004-01-20\n|accessdate=2007-11-12\n}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nIona is located at {{coord|43|31|35|N|111|55|43|W|type:city}} (43.526319, -111.928478).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.10|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 353\n|1920= 630\n|1930= 386\n|1940= 518\n|1950= 502\n|1960= 702\n|1970= 890\n|1980= 1072\n|1990= 1049\n|2000= 1201\n|2010= 1803\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2351\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,803 people, 578 households, and 481 families residing in the city.

It is part of the [[Idaho Falls, Idaho]] [[Idaho Falls metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The population was 1,803 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\nIona was homesteaded by [[Mormon pioneers]] in 1884. [[Sagebrush]], as tall as a man sitting on a horse, covered the now famous potato fields. The short growing season made it difficult to grow crops and the early settlers were discouraged and many wanted to go back south to [[Utah]]. However, when Mormon apostle [[Wilford Woodruff]] spoke to a small congregation in the Iona area on June 17, 1884, he said:\n<blockquote>\nThe Spirit of the Lord rests mightily upon me and I feel to bless you in the name of Jesus Christ. I promise you that the climate will be moderated for your good. I can see these great sagebrush prairies, as far as the eye can reach, turned into fertile fields. I bless the land that it shall yield forth in its strength. Flowers and trees and fine homes shall grace this great valley from one end to the other. Schools and colleges of higher learning shall be built to serve you that you may learn the mysteries of God\u2019s great universe. I see churches and meetinghouses dotting the landscape, where the God of Israel may be worshiped in spirit and in truth. Yes, and as I look into the future of this great valley I can see temples\u2014I can see beautiful temples erected to the name of the living God where holy labors may be carried on in his name through generations to come.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe settlers were persuaded to stay in the valley and one, [[Thomas Edwin Ricks|Thomas E. Ricks]], went on to found the city of [[Rexburg]] and Ricks College which later became [[Brigham Young University-Idaho]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.byui.edu/Presentations/Transcripts/Devotionals/2004_01_20_Orme.htm\n|title=Vision, Faith and Work:  From Wagonbox to University\n|author=Orme, Michael R.\n|publisher=[[Brigham Young University-Idaho]]\n|date=2004-01-20\n|accessdate=2007-11-12\n}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nIona is located at {{coord|43|31|35|N|111|55|43|W|type:city}} (43.526319, -111.928478).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.10|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-12-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 353\n|1920= 630\n|1930= 386\n|1940= 518\n|1950= 502\n|1960= 702\n|1970= 890\n|1980= 1072\n|1990= 1049\n|2000= 1201\n|2010= 1803\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=2351\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> of 2010, there were 1,803 people, 578 households, and 481 families residing in the city.

Management typically involves observation and [[bed rest]]. Red blood cells may decrease the outflow of aqueous humor, therefore the eye pressure should be kept low by giving oral [[acetazolamide]] (a diuretic given to reduce intraoccular pressure).
