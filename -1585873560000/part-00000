Marinelli also announced that he would seek permanent residence in Russia.{{sfn|Miller|2017}} Still, [[BBC News]] reported in November 2017 that it found evidence that social media accounts with ties to Russia had pushed a huge Twitter trend in favor of an independent California on election night 2016.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-41853131 | title='Russian trolls' promoted California independence | date=November 4, 2017 | accessdate=February 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Analysis of the initial proposed proposition==\n===By the California Legislative Analyst's Office===\nAs per the [[California ballot proposition]] process, the [[California Legislative Analyst's Office]] filed a report on the proposed initiative's estimated fiscal effects. This report noted that the proposed initiative could be challenged in California courts on grounds that it would be \"an unconstitutional revision of California's basic governmental framework\". Under the California Constitution, such proposals that would make \"far reaching changes in the nature of [California's] basic governmental plan\" or \"substantially alter the basic governmental framework set forth in the [California] Constitution\" can only be placed before voters by either the [[California Legislature]] or a state constitutional convention, and not via a voter initiative.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}} For example, a California court could consider whether the repealing of Article III, Section 1, stating that California is \"an inseparable part\" of the U.S., would be such a major revision. Yes California argues that this not a major revision, based on the California Supreme Court's test in ''Legislature v. Eu'' that a revision \"must necessarily or inevitably appear from the face of the challenged provision that the measure will substantially alter [California's] basic governmental framework\".<ref>{{cite web | publisher=Yes California | title=The Calexit ballot measure is an amendment to, not revision of, the California Constitution | url=http://www.yescalifornia.org/calexit_amendment_not_revision_california_constitution | date=December 26, 2016 | accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Legislative Analyst's report also noted the tens of millions of dollars that would have to be spent by state and local governments to hold an additional statewide election in March 2019.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}}\n\nWere California to actually become its own separate nation, the major economic and budgetary impacts for both the current state and local governments are unknown. Among these would be the \"sorting out of the liabilities, property holdings, border arrangements, military infrastructure, and other details\" relevant to not only a relationship with the U.S., but also dealing with the military, trade, customs, and other relationships with other countries.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}}\n\nFurthermore, even if the Governor of California were to apply for California to join the United Nations, the Legislative Analyst's report cites\n[[Chapter II of the United Nations Charter]]: new member applications must go through the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], and that the United States, as a permanent member, has [[United Nations Security Council veto power|the ability to block]] such applications.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}}\n\n===By supporters===\nCalifornia has the fifth largest economy in the world and a population larger than that of [[Poland]].{{sfn|Nevett|2016}}  The Yes California campaign argues that the state suffers under federal overregulation, that the state contributes more federal tax than it receives in federal funding, that the state feels isolated from political power in [[Washington, D.C.]],{{sfn|Lee|2016}} and that there is a wide gap between the political and cultural differences of California and the rest of the country.{{sfn|Robinson|2016}} For example, California disagrees with much of the rest of the country on immigration and environmental policies.{{sfn|Zezima|2017}}\n\nIn an op-ed piece published by the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', Marcus Ruiz Evans of Yes California wrote that, \"No one is going to pull money out of California if it secedes, no one is going to invade, no one is going to stop trading&nbsp;\u2013 there is too much money invested here, too many deals already going on. The world will not let the California economy be disrupted.\"{{sfn|Evans|2017}}\n\nAt a forum held by the campaign in Los Angeles on February 13, 2017, led by Evans and Marinelli, they argued that California annually loses about $70 billion by subsidizing other states and military overseas, which could instead be used elsewhere. Marinelli also stated that taxes could be lowered enough so that \"we may not need to have a state income tax anymore\".{{sfn|Edwards|2017}}\n\nHowever, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported on February 18 that the Yes California campaign does not have exact policy positions, nor do they exactly know how a new independent California government would be set up: \"The group's goal is to first have the state secede and then figure out how it should run\".{{sfn|Zezima|2017}}\n\nIn a January 2017 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', businessman, philanthropist, and PayPal cofounder [[Peter Thiel]] endorsed Calexit, saying, \"I think it would be good for California, good for the rest of the country.

[that] reflects a defeatist attitude \u2014 that instead of fighting to shape this country\u2019s future, we should just quit. It also reflects a willingness to give up on America\".{{sfn|San Diego U-T Editorial Board|2017}}\n\nLos Angeles Mayor [[Eric Garcetti]] has stated that he opposes Calexit, saying, \"I want to be a part of an America that continues to stand up for all of us, not bail on all our friends across the country.\"{{sfn|Edwards|2017}}\n\nBefore the Yes California campaign withdrew their initial proposal, former Secretary of Defense [[Leon Panetta]] had warned [[KGO-TV]] about Russia's connections to Marinelli: \"We're a big state.

This report noted that the proposed initiative could be challenged in California courts on grounds that it would be \"an unconstitutional revision of California's basic governmental framework\". Under the California Constitution, such proposals that would make \"far reaching changes in the nature of [California's] basic governmental plan\" or \"substantially alter the basic governmental framework set forth in the [California] Constitution\" can only be placed before voters by either the [[California Legislature]] or a state constitutional convention, and not via a voter initiative.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}} For example, a California court could consider whether the repealing of Article III, Section 1, stating that California is \"an inseparable part\" of the U.S., would be such a major revision. Yes California argues that this not a major revision, based on the California Supreme Court's test in ''Legislature v. Eu'' that a revision \"must necessarily or inevitably appear from the face of the challenged provision that the measure will substantially alter [California's] basic governmental framework\".<ref>{{cite web | publisher=Yes California | title=The Calexit ballot measure is an amendment to, not revision of, the California Constitution | url=http://www.yescalifornia.org/calexit_amendment_not_revision_california_constitution | date=December 26, 2016 | accessdate=January 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Legislative Analyst's report also noted the tens of millions of dollars that would have to be spent by state and local governments to hold an additional statewide election in March 2019.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}}\n\nWere California to actually become its own separate nation, the major economic and budgetary impacts for both the current state and local governments are unknown. Among these would be the \"sorting out of the liabilities, property holdings, border arrangements, military infrastructure, and other details\" relevant to not only a relationship with the U.S., but also dealing with the military, trade, customs, and other relationships with other countries.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}}\n\nFurthermore, even if the Governor of California were to apply for California to join the United Nations, the Legislative Analyst's report cites\n[[Chapter II of the United Nations Charter]]: new member applications must go through the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], and that the United States, as a permanent member, has [[United Nations Security Council veto power|the ability to block]] such applications.{{sfn|CA Legislative Analyst's Office|2017}}\n\n===By supporters===\nCalifornia has the fifth largest economy in the world and a population larger than that of [[Poland]].{{sfn|Nevett|2016}}  The Yes California campaign argues that the state suffers under federal overregulation, that the state contributes more federal tax than it receives in federal funding, that the state feels isolated from political power in [[Washington, D.C.]],{{sfn|Lee|2016}} and that there is a wide gap between the political and cultural differences of California and the rest of the country.{{sfn|Robinson|2016}} For example, California disagrees with much of the rest of the country on immigration and environmental policies.{{sfn|Zezima|2017}}\n\nIn an op-ed piece published by the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', Marcus Ruiz Evans of Yes California wrote that, \"No one is going to pull money out of California if it secedes, no one is going to invade, no one is going to stop trading&nbsp;\u2013 there is too much money invested here, too many deals already going on. The world will not let the California economy be disrupted.\"{{sfn|Evans|2017}}\n\nAt a forum held by the campaign in Los Angeles on February 13, 2017, led by Evans and Marinelli, they argued that California annually loses about $70 billion by subsidizing other states and military overseas, which could instead be used elsewhere. Marinelli also stated that taxes could be lowered enough so that \"we may not need to have a state income tax anymore\".{{sfn|Edwards|2017}}\n\nHowever, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported on February 18 that the Yes California campaign does not have exact policy positions, nor do they exactly know how a new independent California government would be set up: \"The group's goal is to first have the state secede and then figure out how it should run\".{{sfn|Zezima|2017}}\n\nIn a January 2017 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', businessman, philanthropist, and PayPal cofounder [[Peter Thiel]] endorsed Calexit, saying, \"I think it would be good for California, good for the rest of the country.

[that] will start us down a costly, intellectually draining, dead-end path into a world of overwhelming unknowns\".{{sfn|Mercury News Editorial Board|2017}} The editorial board of ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' wrote that it is \"a waste of time ...
