It was notoriously slow, appearing at the very bottom of the list of microcomputer BASICs in the original version of David Ahl's [[Creative Computing benchmark]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1983-11/Creative_Computing_v09_n11_1983_November#page/n271/mode/2up |title= Benchmark comparison test |magazine=Creative Computing |date=November 1983 |page=260 |first=David |last=Ahl}}</ref>\n\nThe poor performance of the official Atari BASIC led to a market for 3rd party BASICs with better performance or more commands. Among them was an official port of [[Microsoft BASIC]] sold by Atari, several improved versions released by [[Optimized Systems Software]], who had written the original Atari BASIC under contract, and many others. There were also several Atari BASIC compilers from a variety of vendors.\n\nTurbo-Basic XL was a late entry to this list, first published in December 1985 as [[type-in program]]. It was unique in that it came in both interpreter and compiler versions. It included code to take advantage of the expanded memory available on the XL series machines, and later XE series. This meant that it could not run on the original 400/800 systems, which led Ostrowski to make a port known as Frost BASIC (short for \"Frank Ostrowski\") that was tied to [[Atari DOS]] 2.0.\n\nThe internal disk-related commands were tied to particular versions of DOS.  A number of ports to different versions of DOS became available.\n\n==Speed improvements==\nThe most notable feature of Turbo-Basic was its dramatically improved speed; an unmodified Atari BASIC program loaded into Turbo-Basic would normally run three to five times faster, and this would improve as the program size grew. This was due largely to a series of improvements on well-known problems in the original Atari BASIC code.\n\nIn most BASICs, GOTO was handled by reading the associated line number and then searching through the program for that line of code. In MS-derived BASICs the line numbers were stored as 16-bit integers and numeric constants in the code in their original ASCII format. When a line like {{code|GOTO 1000}} was encountered, the interpreter would use special code to convert the \"1000\" into 16-bit format and then search for it. Atari BASIC worked differently, converting all numeric constants to a 6-byte floating-point format. This meant the \"1000\" was no longer in ASCII format and had to be converted from floating-point to integer format. The code for doing so was not well optimized and could take up to 3500&nbsp;ms.\n\n[[for next loop|FOR...NEXT loops]] are another common construct in BASIC programs. In most BASICs, when the FOR portion was encountered at runtime, its memory location in the source code was pushed onto a [[call stack]] so it could easily return to that location when the associated NEXT was encountered. For unknown reasons, Atari BASIC pushed the line number of the FOR onto the stack and then looked through the entire code for that line when it encountered the NEXT. For programs that did significant looping, which is often the case in BASIC, this could cause a dramatic performance hit.\n\nTurbo-Basic implemented its FOR loops using the address, as was the case in MS BASIC, and thus ran loops with roughly the same performance as MS. It then went further and greatly improved GOTO performance as well. Line numbers were sent into a [[hash function]] that broke them into 256-line chunks. As the program was entered, the address of the first of each of these chunks was stored in a 128-value table. At runtime, when a line number lookup was needed, it would first pick the nearest-but-lower value in the table, retrieve the address, and then begin scanning for the line from that point. The improvement was most notable in larger programs where the scanning time was increasingly expensive, which is why Turbo-Basic could hit a 5-times increase in larger programs.\n\nThe other major source of poor performance in Atari BASIC was its very slow [[binary coded decimal]] (BCD) [[floating point]] code. The library, contained in a separate 2k ROM and considered part of the [[operating system]] as opposed to BASIC itself, had been written in a hurry and never optimized. Some of the routines, notably the multiply and exponents functions, were far slower than they could be.\n\nTurbo-Basic fixed this by including its own complete floating-point library, which not only fixed many of these issues but also further optimized the code by unrolling small loops. For programs that used math extensively, the new library resulted in dramatic performance improvements, sending the Atari from near the bottom of the Ahl benchmark lists to near the top, beating a number of machines that were much faster in hardware.\n\n==New features==\n\nAmong the extra features of Turbo-Basic XL, added to ATARI BASIC, are the following:\n*enhanced [[ANTIC|sound and graphics]] commands\n*more flexible [[input/output|I/O]] commands, including [[floppy disk|disk]] access\n*[[structured programming]] constructs\n*simple [[debugging]] facilities\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |url=http://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/collections/Atari%20books/Turbo-BASIC%20XL%20-%20Expanded%20Documentation.pdf |first= Ron |last=Fetzer |title=Expanded Turbo-BASIC XL Documentation |date=1985}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tmeyer.de/atari/index.html Atari 8-bit pages] &ndash; Scans of the ''Turbo-Basic XL'' listing and ''Turbo-Basic XL compiler'' listing from [[Happy Computer]] Magazine.

{"title_page": "Exaptation", "text_new": "{{short description|A shift in the function of a trait during evolution}}\n'''Exaptation''' and the related term [[Co-option (biology)|co-option]] describe a shift in the function of a trait during [[evolution]]. For example, a trait can evolve because it served one particular function, but subsequently it may come to serve another. Exaptations are common in both anatomy and behaviour. Bird feathers are a classic example: initially they may have evolved for temperature regulation, but later were adapted for flight. Note here that when feathers were initially used to aid in flight they were doing so exaptively; however, since they have since been shaped by natural selection to improve flight, in their current state they are now best regarded as adaptations for flight. So it is with many structures that initially took on a function as exaptations, once molded for that new function they become adapted for that function. Interest in exaptation relates to both the process and products of evolution: the process that creates [[complex traits]] and the products (functions, anatomical structures, biochemicals, etc.) that may be imperfectly developed.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.2307/2405873 | author=Bock, W.J. | title=Preadaptation and multiple evolutionary pathways | journal=Evolution | year=1959 | volume=13 | issue=2 | pages=194\u2013211 | jstor=2405873 | ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hayden |first1=Eric J. |last2=Ferrada |first2=Evandro |last3=Wagner |first3=Andreas |title=Cryptic genetic variation promotes rapid evolutionary adaptation in an RNA enzyme |journal=Nature |date=2 June 2011 |volume=474 |issue=7349 |pages=92\u201395 |doi=10.1038/nature10083 |pmid=21637259 |ref=harv|url=https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/59818/1/Hayden_Ferrada_Wagner_cryptic_Nature_revised.pdf }}</ref> Exaptation was proposed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Elisabeth Vrba]] as a replacement for what they considered to be a [[teleology in biology|teleologically]] loaded term 'pre-adaptation'.{{sfn|Gould|Vrba|1982}}\n\n==History and definitions==\n[[File:Charles Darwin seated crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Charles Darwin]]\nThe idea that the function of a trait might shift during its evolutionary history originated with [[Charles Darwin]] ({{harvnb|Darwin|1859}}).

However, this definition had two categories with different implications for the role of adaptation.\n\n<blockquote>\n(1) A character, previously shaped by natural selection for a particular function (an adaptation), is coopted for a new use\u2014cooptation.\n(2) A character whose origin cannot be ascribed to the direct action of natural selection (a nonaptation), is coopted for a current use\u2014cooptation. (Gould and Vrba 1982, Table 1)\n</blockquote>\n\nThe definitions are silent as to whether exaptations had been shaped by natural selection after cooption, although Gould and Vrba cite examples (e.g., feathers) of traits shaped after cooption. Note that the selection pressure upon a trait is likely to change if it is (especially, primarily or solely) used for a new purpose, potentially initiating a different evolutionary trajectory.\n\nTo avoid these ambiguities, [[David Buss|Buss]] et al. (1998) suggested the term \"co-opted adaptation\", which is limited to traits that evolved after cooption. However, the commonly used terms of \"exaptation\" and \"cooption\" are ambiguous in this regard.\n\n==Preadaptation ==\n\nIn some circumstances, the \"pre-\" in preadaptation can be interpreted as applying, for non-teleological reasons, prior to the adaptation itself, creating a meaning for the term that is distinct from exaptation.<ref name=\"Eshel98\">{{Cite journal | author=Eshel, I.

In other words, the beginning of developing a particular trait starts out with a primary adaptation toward a fit or specific role, followed by a primary exaptation (a new role is derived using the existing feature but may not be perfect for it), which in turn leads to the development of a secondary adaptation (the feature is improved by natural selection for better performance), promoting further development of an exaptation, and so forth.\n\nOnce again, feathers are an important example, in that they may have first been adapted for thermoregulation and with time became useful for catching insects, and therefore served as a new feature for another benefit. For instance, large contour feathers with specific arrangements arose as an adaptation for catching insects more successfully, which eventually led to flight, since the larger feathers served better for that purpose.\n\n==Implications==\n\n=== Evolution of complex traits===\nOne of the challenges to Darwin's theory of evolution was explaining how complex structures could evolve gradually,<ref>The development of complex structures (i.e., evolution of novelties) occur either by intensification of an existing function or by a switch in functions.</ref> given that their incipient forms may have been inadequate to serve any function. As [[George Jackson Mivart]] (a critic of Darwin) pointed out, 5 percent of a bird wing would not be functional. The incipient form of complex traits would not have survived long enough to evolve to a useful form.\n\nAs Darwin elaborated in the last edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species|The Origin of Species]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1872}}</ref> many complex traits evolved from earlier traits that had served different functions. By trapping air, primitive wings would have enabled birds to efficiently regulate their temperature, in part, by lifting up their feathers when too warm. Individual animals with more of this functionality would more successfully survive and reproduce, resulting in the proliferation and intensification of the trait.\n\nEventually, feathers became sufficiently large to enable some individuals to glide. These individuals would in turn more successfully survive and reproduce, resulting in the spread of this trait because it served a second and still more beneficial function: that of locomotion. Hence, the evolution of bird wings can be explained by a shifting in function from the regulation of temperature to flight.\n\n===Jury-rigged design===\nDarwin explained how the traits of living organisms are well-designed for their environment, but he also recognized that many traits are imperfectly designed. They appear to have been made from available material, that is, [[jury-rigged]].{{efn|Jacob (1977)<ref name=Jacob1977/> sees much of evolution as \"tinkering,\" that is, working with available traits. \"Tinkering\" includes (but is not limited to) shifts in function.}} Understanding exaptations may suggest hypotheses regarding subtleties in the adaptation. For instance, that feathers evolved initially for thermal regulation may help to explain some of their features unrelated to flight (Buss et al., 1998). However, this is readily explained by the fact that they serve a dual purpose.\n\nSome of the chemical pathways for physical pain and pain from social exclusion overlap.<ref>MacDonald and Leary, 2005</ref> The physical pain system may have been co-opted to motivate social animals to respond to threats to their inclusion in the group.\n\n===Evolution of technology===\nExaptation has received increasing attention in innovation and management studies inspired by evolutionary dynamics, where it has been proposed as a mechanism that drives the serendipitous expansion of technologies and products in new domains.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Exaptation as source of creativity, innovation, and diversity: Introduction to the Special Section|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|volume=25|pages=115\u2013131|doi=10.1093/icc/dtv053|year=2016|last1=Andriani|first1=Pierpaolo|last2=Cattani|first2=Gino}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/exaptation2018/home-page|title=Exaptation 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Atavism]]\n* [[Ecological fitting]]\n* [[Repurposing]]\n* [[Spandrel (biology)]]\n* [[Vestigiality]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n* Buss, David M., Martie G.

However, this definition had two categories with different implications for the role of adaptation.\n\n<blockquote>\n(1) A character, previously shaped by natural selection for a particular function (an adaptation), is coopted for a new use\u2014cooptation.\n(2) A character whose origin cannot be ascribed to the direct action of natural selection (a nonaptation), is coopted for a current use\u2014cooptation. (Gould and Vrba 1982, Table 1)\n</blockquote>\n\nThe definitions are silent as to whether exaptations had been shaped by natural selection after cooption, although Gould and Vrba cite examples (e.g., feathers) of traits shaped after cooption. Note that the selection pressure upon a trait is likely to change if it is (especially, primarily or solely) used for a new purpose, potentially initiating a different evolutionary trajectory.\n\nTo avoid these ambiguities, [[David Buss|Buss]] et al. (1998) suggested the term \"co-opted adaptation\", which is limited to traits that evolved after cooption. However, the commonly used terms of \"exaptation\" and \"cooption\" are ambiguous in this regard.\n\n==Preadaptation ==\n\nIn some circumstances, the \"pre-\" in preadaptation can be interpreted as applying, for non-teleological reasons, prior to the adaptation itself, creating a meaning for the term that is distinct from exaptation.<ref name=\"Eshel98\">{{Cite journal | author=Eshel, I.

In other words, the beginning of developing a particular trait starts out with a primary adaptation toward a fit or specific role, followed by a primary exaptation (a new role is derived using the existing feature but may not be perfect for it), which in turn leads to the development of a secondary adaptation (the feature is improved by natural selection for better performance), promoting further development of an exaptation, and so forth.\n\nOnce again, feathers are an important example, in that they may have first been adapted for thermoregulation and with time became useful for catching insects, and therefore served as a new feature for another benefit. For instance, large contour feathers with specific arrangements arose as an adaptation for catching insects more successfully, which eventually led to flight, since the larger feathers served better for that purpose.\n\n==Implications==\n\n=== Evolution of complex traits===\nOne of the challenges to Darwin's theory of evolution was explaining how complex structures could evolve gradually,<ref>The development of complex structures (i.e., evolution of novelties) occur either by intensification of an existing function or by a switch in functions.</ref> given that their incipient forms may have been inadequate to serve any function. As [[George Jackson Mivart]] (a critic of Darwin) pointed out, 5 percent of a bird wing would not be functional. The incipient form of complex traits would not have survived long enough to evolve to a useful form.\n\nAs Darwin elaborated in the last edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species|The Origin of Species]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1872}}</ref> many complex traits evolved from earlier traits that had served different functions. By trapping air, primitive wings would have enabled birds to efficiently regulate their temperature, in part, by lifting up their feathers when too warm. Individual animals with more of this functionality would more successfully survive and reproduce, resulting in the proliferation and intensification of the trait.\n\nEventually, feathers became sufficiently large to enable some individuals to glide. These individuals would in turn more successfully survive and reproduce, resulting in the spread of this trait because it served a second and still more beneficial function: that of locomotion. Hence, the evolution of bird wings can be explained by a shifting in function from the regulation of temperature to flight.\n\n===Jury-rigged design===\nDarwin explained how the traits of living organisms are well-designed for their environment, but he also recognized that many traits are imperfectly designed. They appear to have been made from available material, that is, [[jury-rigged]].{{efn|Jacob (1977)<ref name=Jacob1977/> sees much of evolution as \"tinkering,\" that is, working with available traits. \"Tinkering\" includes (but is not limited to) shifts in function.}} Understanding exaptations may suggest hypotheses regarding subtleties in the adaptation. For instance, that feathers evolved initially for thermal regulation may help to explain some of their features unrelated to flight (Buss et al., 1998). However, this is readily explained by the fact that they serve a dual purpose.\n\nSome of the chemical pathways for physical pain and pain from social exclusion overlap.<ref>MacDonald and Leary, 2005</ref> The physical pain system may have been co-opted to motivate social animals to respond to threats to their inclusion in the group.\n\n===Evolution of technology===\nExaptation has received increasing attention in innovation and management studies inspired by evolutionary dynamics, where it has been proposed as a mechanism that drives the serendipitous expansion of technologies and products in new domains.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Exaptation as source of creativity, innovation, and diversity: Introduction to the Special Section|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|volume=25|pages=115\u2013131|doi=10.1093/icc/dtv053|year=2016|last1=Andriani|first1=Pierpaolo|last2=Cattani|first2=Gino}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/exaptation2018/home-page|title=Exaptation 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Atavism]]\n* [[Ecological fitting]]\n* [[Repurposing]]\n* [[Spandrel (biology)]]\n* [[Vestigiality]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n* Buss, David M., Martie G.

Rockefeller]]'s partners in the formation of the [[Standard Oil Company]] (now Exxon), Charles Pratt & Company in New York and [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn. \n\nRegister graduated from the [[Lawrenceville School]] in New Jersey and the [[University of California]] at Berkeley.  He later studied at the [[California School of Fine Arts]] in San Francisco. After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, with B.A. in Literature in 1961, he met his wife Catherine Richards in a photography class at The Pasadena Art Center where he was studying commercial art. \n\nIn 1964 the two moved to New York, where Register studied design and television at the [[Pratt Institute]] (founded by his great-grandfather).<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/> They married on February 6, 1964 and together had three children Peter, Kate and David. During this period Register pursued a career in advertising at McCaffrey and McCall. In 1972, just after his 33rd birthday,<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/> Register left an important client meeting saying he had a dental appointment and never returning.  He subsequently became a full-time painter, moving is family to California. \n\nRegister was born with a genetic kidney disease and nearly died numerous times.<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/>  He had suffered kidney failure 15 years before his death &mdash; ultimately from cancer from kidney transplant rejection drugs.<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/> In September 1994, he was told he had four to six weeks to live. He lived instead for 18 months, battling cancer until his death in 1996 at the age of 57, in Malibu, California.<ref name=\"obitsfgate\">{{cite web\n |title        = OBITUARY -- John Register\n |publisher    = SFGate\n |author       = Carl Nolte\n |date         = April 11, 1996\n |url          = https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/OBITUARY-John-Register-2986924.php}}</ref> \n\nAt the time of his death, he was survived by his mother, Dorothy Pratt Barrett (then remarried) of Hillsborough, California; his sister, Barbara Pratt Register of Rolling Hills, California; his brother, Eliot Steven Barrett of St. Helena, California; and his three children, Peter, David and Katie; and one grandson.<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/>\n\n==Work==\nRegister said \"I look for offbeat beauty. I don't know what I'm looking for until I find it. There are things so ugly that I can't paint them. Sometimes I get depressed by that city, and by other cities I visit. But I like the patina of things that have been battered by life\".\nJohn Register's vision of isolated streets, empty coffee shops, long shadows, old hotels, and bus stations \"represent a haunting stillness tinged with regret and hope\", wrote Barnaby Conrad in John Register Persistent Observer.\n\nHe was honored with a retrospective of his career in 1999.\n\nRegister studied with the portrait painter Raymond Kinstler and landscape painter [[Lennart Anderson]].<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/> He had his first show in Los Angeles in 1975 and received the Francis J. Greenburger Foundation Award from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]].<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/>\n\nHe has shown almost exclusively at the Modernism Gallery in San Francisco. A show of drawings by Mr. Register and [[Edward Hopper]] took place in 1996. The [[San Jose Museum of Art]] hosted a major retrospective show of Mr. Register's work in the fall of 1997.<ref name=\"obitsfgate\"/> \n \nRegister's work was used, and credited, as the inspiration for the video for \"[[Turn My Head]]\" by the band [[Live (band)|Live]] in 1997.

In Sons of Anarchy, he is President of Oakland chapter of the Mayans, a Mexican-American motorcycle club. In between when Sons of Anarchy ends and [[Mayans M.C.]] begins, he is promoted to El Padrino, which is Spanish for The Godfather and is the leader of all Mayans\u2019 chapters. At the end of season 1 of Mayans M.C., he resigns as El Padrino and becomes Miguel Galendo\u2019s head of security.\n\n==Biography==\n\u00c1lvarez, who is of [[Mexican American|Mexican descent]], is the President of the [[Mayans Motorcycle Club's [[Oakland, California]] chapter and seems to be their national president. His son, [[List of characters from Sons of Anarchy#Esai \u00c1lvarez|Esai]], was also a member of the club but had a hit placed on him by Marcus in 2008 as punishment for failing his mission. Most of his, and his gang's, income is made through dealing [[heroin]] and [[methamphetamine]], and [[prostitution]]. For some time, he was a [[Incarceration|prisoner]] in [[California Institution for Men|Chino]], but was released some time before the beginning of Season One.\n\nOn his [[gang colors|colors]], he wears patches reading \"Los Asesinos de Dios\" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"God's Assassins\") and \"Mayans Oakland\". However, his \"President\" patch is later changed to \"El Padrino\". He also has the [[Mayan Calendar]] tattooed on his chest.\n\n===Sons of Anarchy===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 1)}}\nAt the beginning of the first series, Marcus \u00c1lvarez and other members of the Mayans MC, broke into the Sons of Anarchy's weapons warehouse. The Mayans stole the guns; then they torched the warehouse. The Sons of Anarchy eventually got revenge, however, by stealing the guns back and destroying a Mayans narcotics storage facility.\n\n[[Ernest Darby]], leader of the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#Nordics|Nordics]] (after being supplied with a dossier containing all the details required to take over SAMCRO'S gun business, by a rogue ATF agent), calls a meeting with \u00c1lvarez. During their meeting, Darby proposes the Nords & Mayans further their present alliance. Darby's deal requires the Mayans first assassinate SAMCRO's President, followed by the rest of its members, with the spoils to be divided as follows: Darby's Nords get Charming (freeing them to expand their meth trade into the city). \u00c1lvarez and the Mayans (using the ATF dossier to be supplied by Darby, post-assassination) get to take over SAMCRO's lucrative gun business, utilize their newfound control of the gun trade to expand their heroin business & eliminate a longtime rival MC. \u00c1lvarez, recognizing an opportunity, reluctantly agrees in principle, but demurs on the Mayans eliminating SAMCRO requirement, instead suggesting a more joint effort, with the Mayans increasing their current security & support of the Nords power plays. Darby, sensing \u00c1lvarez knows the deal is too good to pass up, reiterates his initial demands, and exits the meeting - his \"take it or leave it\" ball placed squarely in \u00c1lvarez's court. With Darby now out of earshot, \u00c1lvarez immediately gives two orders: kill SAMCRO's President, and double-cross Darby by murdering him & taking the ATF dossier for themselves. \u00c1lvarez's son requests he & his crew be tasked with carrying out both orders - a request \u00c1lvarez grants.\n\nLater, the Mayans carry out simultaneous hits on both Darby & the SAMCRO President. However, both hits go sideways for the Mayans. The Mayans hit Darby at his home, killing 2 women & 1 Nord henchman, but missing Darby. Although they fail to kill Darby, they do manage to steal the ATF dossier. During the hit on SAMCRO President, Clay Morrow, the Mayans  find themselves outnumbered, as Clay & Tig are making a deal with the IRA at a bar - all of whom fight off & kill the Mayans, while suffering only one wounded in the process.\n\nThe failed hit generates two reactions. First, Clay orders the #1 & #2 members of every SOA charter between Charming to Tacoma to report to Charming ASAP. Second, Charming PD bring Clay in for questioning about the shootings. At his questioning, Clay asks his associate and corrupt Charming Police Chief [[Wayne Unser]] to allow him to have a \"little chat\" with Darby (who is already in Charming PD lockup) & to bring \u00c1lvarez in under similar pretenses, also holding him in Charming lockup, so they can hold a summit of sorts, to potentially curtail any further SOA-Mayan violence. Also during Clay's questioning a large group of SOA members (every charter's #1 & #2 from as far away as Tacoma) roars past Charming PD headquarters, in full view of both Clay & Unser. This show of gunboat diplomacy, sways Unser to acquiesce to Clay's summit request.\n\nGiven the green light by Unser, Clay first chats with Darby in his jail cell. Essentially imposing his will upon Darby via several powerful punches to the head, Clay forces Darby to submit.\n\nNext, \u00c1lvarez is brought in & locked up in a cell with Clay. Clay outlines an agreement where SAMCRO will sell weapons to the Mayans, in exchange for settling all SOA-Mayan disputes, across all charters, in favour of SOA, regardless of the cost to the Mayans - including the failed Mayan hit on Clay himself. \u00c1lvarez agrees to all terms, including recompense for the botched hit.\n\nClay then takes this tentative agreement to the club for a vote. All members vote unanimously to ratify the agreement charter-wide. MC members further decide justice for the hit on Clay should be carried out by Happy, as he is a member of a non-SAMCRO SOA charter.\n\nLater, during an idyllic looking, sunny California Sunday afternoon, \u00c1lvarez & his son Esai, share what briefly presents as a warm, sage-like, father-son moment in the park: Esai seeks reassurance for his shortcomings from his father. \u00c1lvarez cryptically reassures his son - and then leads him right over to the churro vendor (actually Happy in disguise), who expertly inserts a blade into the back of Esai's brain, killing him instantly, as \u00c1lvarez upholds his end of the bargain with a shocking demonstration of MC sobre sangre.\n\n \nWhen the Mayans eventually set up a deal with the Sons in Oakland, it was attacked by the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#One-Niners|One-Niners]]. A shoot-out ensued, and gang members from the One-Niners and Mayans were killed, but the Sons of Anarchy escaped. \u00c1lvarez was also shot in the leg and wounded. The deal was, in fact, a set-up organized by the Niners and SOA. The Niners were supposed to attack the Mayans after the Sons had left and would keep the weapons as payment. However, they tried to take out the SOA as well.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/The+Sleep+of+Babies/episode/1235305/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header The Sleep of Babies - Recap]</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 2)}}\nAt the beginning of Season 2, Clay had Opie murder a member of the Mayans, who Clay had framed as the guy who murdered Donna.  After Opie murdered the Mayan, he carved the Anarchy symbol in his chest as a message to the Mayans. [[Jax Teller]] dropped off the body in Mayan Territory in Oakland after shooting the gang member multiple times in the body to destroy the symbol.  He then arranged the Mayan's hands to hold up 9 fingers to implicate the One-Niners as the culprits.  Alvarez later found the body and gave Clay a call asking to buy weapons.  Clay turned Alvarez down on the weapons transaction, telling him that the club was still under suspicion of the ATF; Clay then told Tig to call Laroy of the One-Niners to arrange a meeting to supply Niners with weapons so that they could defend themselves when the Mayans attacked.  During the weapons transaction between SAMCRO and the Niners, the Mayans ambushed the deal and stole all the Niner's AKs, and Bobby Elvis was shot in the shoulder during the ambush.  After the ambush, Alvarez was seen making a phone call to Ethan Zobelle of LOAN telling him his intel was correct and that he owed him.  Zobelle responded, \"Yes, you do,\" and then told AJ Weston that it was his friend from church on the phone.  Clay blamed the whole ambush and Bobby getting shot in the shoulder on Jax, as Jax changed the plan and set the Niners up for the hit instead of leaving Anarchy symbol on the dead Mayan's chest.\n\nIn the episode \"Service\", Zobelle met with Marcus Alvarez offering the Mayans the exclusive business of having their heroin distributed to all the local prisons.  Alvarez is hesitant about the deal because Zobelle wants to keep 50% of the profits, but has no choice when Zobelle tells him that he won't supply the Mayans with any more weapons if they don't go along with the new arrangement.\n\nIn the second-season finale, Marcus and the Mayans provided protection to Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's daughter who were attempting to flee Charming.  Marcus was eventually able to convince Zobelle to leave his cigar shop, but the Mayan convoy they attempted to escape in was ambushed by SAMCRO.  Marcus survived the attack uninjured and Clay spared his life.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 3)}}\nDuring the season Alvarez hired a low ranked MC, the Calaveras, to help guard his shipment of heroin, with the promise to patch them over, but after SAMCRO stole them he decided not to patch them over and then returned Juice's [[kutte]]. At the advice of Clay, Alvarez decided to drop the war between them and in return the Grim Bastards MC, a friendly club to SAMCRO, would protect Alvarez's drug shipments.  As a favor to the Mayans, Tig and Kozik killed the Calaveras member who was caught during the drive-by at Half-Sack's wake.\n\nWhen a member of the Grim Bastards MC is found murdered and evidence points to the Calaveras, SAMCRO and the Bastards' President T.O. Cross go to Marcus Alvarez for help.  The Mayans and SAMCRO confront the Calaveras members in a park restroom and give the president of the Calaveras, Hector Salazar, the option of telling them which of his lieutenants killed the Bastards member or to die himself.  He gives up his Sgt-At-Arms, who is then promptly shot in the head by the enraged T.O.  A disgusted Alvarez strips Salazar of his position and kutte and then kicks him out of the Calaveras. He then appoints Salazar's V.P as president and advises him to keep a tighter hold on his men then Salazar did.\n\nWhen Tara Knowles and Margaret Murphy are taken hostage by Hector Salazar, Salazar demands that SAMCRO kill Alvarez and retrieve $250,000 worth of Mayans MC money.  Tig, Kozik, and Piney are able to convince Alvarez to play dead for 24 hours so that they can come up with a plan to get the women back.  Marcus tells the Sons that the $250,000 does not exist.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 4)}}\nHe is seen at Opie's wedding talking with Clay and thanking him for protection during their sentence. He says he was just \"looking out for my investments.\" Unlike previous seasons \u00c1lvarez now has a President's patch on his cut. He is also seen throughout the season forming an alliance between SOA and the Mayans in light of the Galindo Cartel who has connections to the Mayans. Alvarez helped set up a deal between the SOA and Galindo to mule their cocaine while the Mayans distribute and sell. He is also shown giving Mayans to help guard the cocaine in the Son's warehouse. When one of the bricks is stolen, he assures Jax and Clay his man was not responsible. He is later injured in a shootout with rival cartel Lobos Sonoras. He is brought to the clubhouse and treated by Tara.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 5)}}\nAlvarez was last seen in a street meeting with Jax, Henry Lin, and the Oakland One-Niner's leader Tyler to discuss allowing the Galindo Cartel's cocaine to move through their territory. Alvarez agrees as long as they \"keep black (the Niners) in line\". It is later stated the Mayans will take over the [[mule (smuggling)|muling]] as well, as SAMCRO wants out of the de al ardilla preciosa\n\n====Season 6====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 6)}}\nAlvarez and the Mayans only appear at the end of the sixth season (\"You Are My Sunshine\" and \"A Mother's Work\"), expressing their unhappiness with SAMCRO's decision to hand over the IRA gun business to August Marks. He also informs Jax of the Mayans' intention of setting up a charter in Stockton. Alvarez is also shown to be a friend of Nero Padilla; having served time in Chino together. Alvarez tells Nero that soon it might end up being \"brown and yellow against black and white\". When he arrives at the gun deal with the Sons, Nero, and the Niners. Alvarez is disappointed that August Marks wasn't present during the transaction. When SAMCRO and Tyler departs, Alvarez and his men gun down the Niners and steal the guns.\n\n====Season 7====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 7)}}\nAt the beginning of the seventh season, the Mayans have set up their Stockton charter with Oscar El Oso Ramos as president. Alvarez and the Mayans seem to be on the same side as Henry Lin and the Lin Triad against SAMCRO and the Niners. However, Alvarez joins SAMCRO's side when they believe the Triads are to blame for Tara's death and they help both SAMCRO and the One-Niners deal with both the Triads and August Marks. Alvarez is shown to be fully on SAMCRO's side when Juice approaches him offering information on SAMCRO in exchange for passage to Mexico. Alvarez hands Juice over to SAMCRO, saying he would never make a deal with a rat. When it is revealed that it was Gemma who killed Tara and not the Triads, Alvarez sympathizes with Jax and helps him clean up the mess with the Chinese. Later, the Mayans, One-Niners, SAMCRO and the Byz Lats discuss territories and business. One of Jax's final acts as president of SAMCRO is to set the Mayans up with Connor Malone as their new gun source, finally giving Alvarez the gun business he wanted.\n\n===Mayans M.C.===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C. (season 1)}}\nAlvarez now wearing an \"El Padrino\" patch which in English translates to \"the Godfather\". Goes down to Santo Padre Charter with members of the Mayans Motorcycle Club's Oakland, California charter to help the Santo Padre charter deal with the Galindo Cartel. It is revealed that he and Jos\u00e9 Galindo; the founder of the Galindo Cartel, had a mutual respect for one another. Alvarez later suspects that a mule in the Santo Padre charter is working with Los Olividados (\"The Forgotten Ones\"). In the season Finale Alvarez steps down as Padrino to work with the Galindo Cartel directly as Miguel's newly appointed [[consigliere|advisor]].\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C.

First, Clay orders the #1 & #2 members of every SOA charter between Charming to Tacoma to report to Charming ASAP. Second, Charming PD bring Clay in for questioning about the shootings. At his questioning, Clay asks his associate and corrupt Charming Police Chief [[Wayne Unser]] to allow him to have a \"little chat\" with Darby (who is already in Charming PD lockup) & to bring \u00c1lvarez in under similar pretenses, also holding him in Charming lockup, so they can hold a summit of sorts, to potentially curtail any further SOA-Mayan violence. Also during Clay's questioning a large group of SOA members (every charter's #1 & #2 from as far away as Tacoma) roars past Charming PD headquarters, in full view of both Clay & Unser. This show of gunboat diplomacy, sways Unser to acquiesce to Clay's summit request.\n\nGiven the green light by Unser, Clay first chats with Darby in his jail cell. Essentially imposing his will upon Darby via several powerful punches to the head, Clay forces Darby to submit.\n\nNext, \u00c1lvarez is brought in & locked up in a cell with Clay. Clay outlines an agreement where SAMCRO will sell weapons to the Mayans, in exchange for settling all SOA-Mayan disputes, across all charters, in favour of SOA, regardless of the cost to the Mayans - including the failed Mayan hit on Clay himself. \u00c1lvarez agrees to all terms, including recompense for the botched hit.\n\nClay then takes this tentative agreement to the club for a vote. All members vote unanimously to ratify the agreement charter-wide. MC members further decide justice for the hit on Clay should be carried out by Happy, as he is a member of a non-SAMCRO SOA charter.\n\nLater, during an idyllic looking, sunny California Sunday afternoon, \u00c1lvarez & his son Esai, share what briefly presents as a warm, sage-like, father-son moment in the park: Esai seeks reassurance for his shortcomings from his father. \u00c1lvarez cryptically reassures his son - and then leads him right over to the churro vendor (actually Happy in disguise), who expertly inserts a blade into the back of Esai's brain, killing him instantly, as \u00c1lvarez upholds his end of the bargain with a shocking demonstration of MC sobre sangre.\n\n \nWhen the Mayans eventually set up a deal with the Sons in Oakland, it was attacked by the [[List of gangs from Sons of Anarchy#One-Niners|One-Niners]]. A shoot-out ensued, and gang members from the One-Niners and Mayans were killed, but the Sons of Anarchy escaped. \u00c1lvarez was also shot in the leg and wounded. The deal was, in fact, a set-up organized by the Niners and SOA. The Niners were supposed to attack the Mayans after the Sons had left and would keep the weapons as payment. However, they tried to take out the SOA as well.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/Sons+of+Anarchy/The+Sleep+of+Babies/episode/1235305/recap.html?tag=content_wrap;episode_header The Sleep of Babies - Recap]</ref>\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 2)}}\nAt the beginning of Season 2, Clay had Opie murder a member of the Mayans, who Clay had framed as the guy who murdered Donna.  After Opie murdered the Mayan, he carved the Anarchy symbol in his chest as a message to the Mayans. [[Jax Teller]] dropped off the body in Mayan Territory in Oakland after shooting the gang member multiple times in the body to destroy the symbol.  He then arranged the Mayan's hands to hold up 9 fingers to implicate the One-Niners as the culprits.  Alvarez later found the body and gave Clay a call asking to buy weapons.  Clay turned Alvarez down on the weapons transaction, telling him that the club was still under suspicion of the ATF; Clay then told Tig to call Laroy of the One-Niners to arrange a meeting to supply Niners with weapons so that they could defend themselves when the Mayans attacked.  During the weapons transaction between SAMCRO and the Niners, the Mayans ambushed the deal and stole all the Niner's AKs, and Bobby Elvis was shot in the shoulder during the ambush.  After the ambush, Alvarez was seen making a phone call to Ethan Zobelle of LOAN telling him his intel was correct and that he owed him.  Zobelle responded, \"Yes, you do,\" and then told AJ Weston that it was his friend from church on the phone.  Clay blamed the whole ambush and Bobby getting shot in the shoulder on Jax, as Jax changed the plan and set the Niners up for the hit instead of leaving Anarchy symbol on the dead Mayan's chest.\n\nIn the episode \"Service\", Zobelle met with Marcus Alvarez offering the Mayans the exclusive business of having their heroin distributed to all the local prisons.  Alvarez is hesitant about the deal because Zobelle wants to keep 50% of the profits, but has no choice when Zobelle tells him that he won't supply the Mayans with any more weapons if they don't go along with the new arrangement.\n\nIn the second-season finale, Marcus and the Mayans provided protection to Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle's daughter who were attempting to flee Charming.  Marcus was eventually able to convince Zobelle to leave his cigar shop, but the Mayan convoy they attempted to escape in was ambushed by SAMCRO.  Marcus survived the attack uninjured and Clay spared his life.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 3)}}\nDuring the season Alvarez hired a low ranked MC, the Calaveras, to help guard his shipment of heroin, with the promise to patch them over, but after SAMCRO stole them he decided not to patch them over and then returned Juice's [[kutte]]. At the advice of Clay, Alvarez decided to drop the war between them and in return the Grim Bastards MC, a friendly club to SAMCRO, would protect Alvarez's drug shipments.  As a favor to the Mayans, Tig and Kozik killed the Calaveras member who was caught during the drive-by at Half-Sack's wake.\n\nWhen a member of the Grim Bastards MC is found murdered and evidence points to the Calaveras, SAMCRO and the Bastards' President T.O. Cross go to Marcus Alvarez for help.  The Mayans and SAMCRO confront the Calaveras members in a park restroom and give the president of the Calaveras, Hector Salazar, the option of telling them which of his lieutenants killed the Bastards member or to die himself.  He gives up his Sgt-At-Arms, who is then promptly shot in the head by the enraged T.O.  A disgusted Alvarez strips Salazar of his position and kutte and then kicks him out of the Calaveras. He then appoints Salazar's V.P as president and advises him to keep a tighter hold on his men then Salazar did.\n\nWhen Tara Knowles and Margaret Murphy are taken hostage by Hector Salazar, Salazar demands that SAMCRO kill Alvarez and retrieve $250,000 worth of Mayans MC money.  Tig, Kozik, and Piney are able to convince Alvarez to play dead for 24 hours so that they can come up with a plan to get the women back.  Marcus tells the Sons that the $250,000 does not exist.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 4)}}\nHe is seen at Opie's wedding talking with Clay and thanking him for protection during their sentence. He says he was just \"looking out for my investments.\" Unlike previous seasons \u00c1lvarez now has a President's patch on his cut. He is also seen throughout the season forming an alliance between SOA and the Mayans in light of the Galindo Cartel who has connections to the Mayans. Alvarez helped set up a deal between the SOA and Galindo to mule their cocaine while the Mayans distribute and sell. He is also shown giving Mayans to help guard the cocaine in the Son's warehouse. When one of the bricks is stolen, he assures Jax and Clay his man was not responsible. He is later injured in a shootout with rival cartel Lobos Sonoras. He is brought to the clubhouse and treated by Tara.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 5)}}\nAlvarez was last seen in a street meeting with Jax, Henry Lin, and the Oakland One-Niner's leader Tyler to discuss allowing the Galindo Cartel's cocaine to move through their territory. Alvarez agrees as long as they \"keep black (the Niners) in line\". It is later stated the Mayans will take over the [[mule (smuggling)|muling]] as well, as SAMCRO wants out of the de al ardilla preciosa\n\n====Season 6====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 6)}}\nAlvarez and the Mayans only appear at the end of the sixth season (\"You Are My Sunshine\" and \"A Mother's Work\"), expressing their unhappiness with SAMCRO's decision to hand over the IRA gun business to August Marks. He also informs Jax of the Mayans' intention of setting up a charter in Stockton. Alvarez is also shown to be a friend of Nero Padilla; having served time in Chino together. Alvarez tells Nero that soon it might end up being \"brown and yellow against black and white\". When he arrives at the gun deal with the Sons, Nero, and the Niners. Alvarez is disappointed that August Marks wasn't present during the transaction. When SAMCRO and Tyler departs, Alvarez and his men gun down the Niners and steal the guns.\n\n====Season 7====\n{{see also|Sons of Anarchy (season 7)}}\nAt the beginning of the seventh season, the Mayans have set up their Stockton charter with Oscar El Oso Ramos as president. Alvarez and the Mayans seem to be on the same side as Henry Lin and the Lin Triad against SAMCRO and the Niners. However, Alvarez joins SAMCRO's side when they believe the Triads are to blame for Tara's death and they help both SAMCRO and the One-Niners deal with both the Triads and August Marks. Alvarez is shown to be fully on SAMCRO's side when Juice approaches him offering information on SAMCRO in exchange for passage to Mexico. Alvarez hands Juice over to SAMCRO, saying he would never make a deal with a rat. When it is revealed that it was Gemma who killed Tara and not the Triads, Alvarez sympathizes with Jax and helps him clean up the mess with the Chinese. Later, the Mayans, One-Niners, SAMCRO and the Byz Lats discuss territories and business. One of Jax's final acts as president of SAMCRO is to set the Mayans up with Connor Malone as their new gun source, finally giving Alvarez the gun business he wanted.\n\n===Mayans M.C.===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C. (season 1)}}\nAlvarez now wearing an \"El Padrino\" patch which in English translates to \"the Godfather\". Goes down to Santo Padre Charter with members of the Mayans Motorcycle Club's Oakland, California charter to help the Santo Padre charter deal with the Galindo Cartel. It is revealed that he and Jos\u00e9 Galindo; the founder of the Galindo Cartel, had a mutual respect for one another. Alvarez later suspects that a mule in the Santo Padre charter is working with Los Olividados (\"The Forgotten Ones\"). In the season Finale Alvarez steps down as Padrino to work with the Galindo Cartel directly as Miguel's newly appointed [[consigliere|advisor]].\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Mayans M.C.

Beatrice, niece of Leonato, a governor of Messina, asks the messenger about Benedick and makes sarcastic remarks about his ineptitude as a soldier. Leonato explains that \"There is a kind of merry war betwixt Signor Benedick and her.\"<ref name=\"shakespeare-navigators.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/ado/AdoText11.html#61|title=Much Ado About Nothing: Act 1, Scene 1|work=shakespeare-navigators.com|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nUpon the soldiers' arrival, Leonato welcomes Don Pedro and invites him to stay for a month, Benedick and Beatrice resume their \"merry war\", and Pedro's illegitimate brother Don John is introduced. Claudio's feelings for Hero, Leonato's only daughter, are rekindled upon seeing her, and Claudio soon announces to Benedick his intention to court her. Benedick, who openly despises marriage, tries to dissuade his friend, but Don Pedro encourages the marriage. Benedick swears that he will never get married. Don Pedro laughs at him and tells him that when he has found the right person he shall get married.\n\nA [[masquerade ball]] is planned in celebration of the end of the war, giving a disguised Don Pedro the opportunity to [[Courtship|woo]] Hero on Claudio's behalf. Don John uses this situation to get revenge on him by telling Claudio that Don Pedro is wooing Hero for himself. A furious Claudio confronts Don Pedro, but the misunderstanding is quickly resolved and Claudio wins Hero's hand in marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, Benedick disguises himself and dances with Beatrice, who proceeds to tell this \"mystery man\" that Benedick is \"the prince's jester, a very dull fool.\" Enraged by her words, Benedick swears he will have revenge. Don Pedro and his men, bored at the prospect of waiting a week for the wedding, concoct a plan to match-make between Benedick and Beatrice. They arrange for the former to overhear a conversation in which they declare that the latter is madly in love with him, but is too afraid to tell him as their pride is the main impediment to their courtship. Meanwhile, Hero and her maid, Ursula, ensure Beatrice overhears them discuss Benedick's undying love for her. The tricks have the desired effect: both Benedick and Beatrice are delighted to think they are the object of [[unrequited love]], and both accordingly resolve to mend their faults and reconcile.\n\nMeanwhile, Don John, the \"bastard prince\", plots to stop the wedding, embarrass his brother, and wreak misery on Leonato and Claudio. He informs Don Pedro and Claudio that Hero is unfaithful, and arranges for them to see his associate, Borachio, enter her bedchamber and engage in an amorous liaison with her (though in reality it was Margaret, Hero's chambermaid). Claudio and Don Pedro are taken in, and the former vows to publicly humiliate Hero.\n\n[[File:Much Ado About Nothing by Alfred Elmore 1846.jpg|thumbnail|left|Swooning of Hero in the Church scene by [[Alfred Elmore]]]]\n\nAt the wedding the next day, Claudio denounces Hero before the stunned guests and storms off with Don Pedro, causing Hero to faint. A humiliated Leonato expresses his wish for her to die. The presiding friar intervenes, believing Hero to be innocent. He suggests the family must fake Hero's death in order to extract the truth and Claudio's remorse. Prompted by the day's stressful events, Benedick and Beatrice confess their love for each other. Beatrice then asks Benedick to kill Claudio as proof of his devotion, since he has slandered her kinswoman. Benedick is disgusted and at first denies her request. Leonato and his brother Antonio blame Claudio for Hero's apparent death and challenge him to a duel. Benedick then does the same, following Beatrice's commands as he is one of the few who believe Hero. Luckily, on the night of Don John's treachery, the local Watch apprehended Borachio and his ally, Conrade. Despite the comic ineptness of the Watch (headed by constable [[Dogberry]], a master of [[malapropism]]s), they have overheard the duo discussing their evil plans. The Watch arrest the villains and eventually obtain a confession, informing Leonato of Hero's innocence. Though Don John has fled the city, a force is sent to capture him. Claudio, stricken with remorse at Hero's supposed death, agrees to her father's demand that he marry Antonio's daughter, \"almost the copy of my child that's dead\"<ref name=\"shakespeare-navigators.com\"/> and carry on the family name.\n\nAt the wedding, the bride is revealed to be a still living Hero. Claudio is overjoyed. Beatrice and Benedick, prompted by their friends' interference, finally and publicly confess their love for each other. As the play draws to a close, a messenger arrives with news of Don John's capture, but Benedick proposes to postpone deciding Don John's punishment until tomorrow so the couples can enjoy their newfound happiness. Don Pedro expresses his loneliness since he hasn't found love, to which Benedick responds, \"Get thee a wife.\"\n\n==Sources==\nStories of lovers deceived into believing each other false were common currency in northern Italy in the sixteenth century.

W. Norton & Company]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-393-97087-6}}) p.&nbsp;1387</ref> The earliest recorded performances are two that were given at Court in the winter of 1612\u20131613, during the festivities preceding the marriage of Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] with [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] (14 February 1613). The play was published in [[book size|quarto]] in 1600 by the stationers [[Andrew Wise]] and [[William Aspley]]. This was the only edition prior to the [[First Folio]] in 1623.\n\n==Analysis and criticism==\n\n===Style===\nThe play is predominantly written in prose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/much_ado/full.html |title=Much Ado About Nothing: Entire Play |publisher=Shakespeare.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> The substantial verse sections achieve a sense of decorum and provide energy to its audience.<ref name=arden>{{cite book|editor=A. R. Hunphreys| title=Much Ado About Nothing| publisher=Arden Edition| year=1981}}</ref>\n\n===Setting===\n''Much Ado About Nothing'' is set in [[Messina]], a port on the island of [[Sicily]], which is next to the toe of [[Italy]]. Sicily was [[History of Sicily#Spanish period|ruled by Aragon]] at the time the play was set.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bate|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age: the Life, Mind and World of William Shakespeare|publisher=Viking|location=London|year=2008|page=305|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}</ref> The action of the play takes place mainly at the home and on the grounds of Leonato's Estate.\n\n===Themes and motifs===\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[File:Kill Claudio.jpg|thumb|Drawing of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as Benedick and [[Winifred Emery]] as Beatrice in a 1905 production. Act II, Scene v: \"Kill Claudio\".]]\nBenedick and Beatrice quickly became the main interest of the play, to the point where they are today considered the leading roles, even though their relationship is given equal or lesser weight in the script than Claudio and Hero's situation.  [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] even wrote 'Benedick and Beatrice' beside the title of the play in his copy of the [[Second Folio]].<ref>G. Blakemore Evans, ''The Riverside Shakespeare'', Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p.&nbsp;327.</ref> The provocative treatment of gender is central to the play and should be considered in its [[Renaissance]] context. While this was reflected and emphasized in certain plays of the period, it was also challenged.<ref name=\"McEachern\">McEachern, ''Much Ado About Nothing'', Arden; 3rd edition, 2005.</ref> Amussen<ref>Amussen, ''Ordered Society'', Columbia University Press (15 April 1994).</ref> notes that the undoing of traditional gender clich\u00e9s appears to have inflamed anxieties about the erosion of social order. It seems that comic drama could be a means of calming such anxieties. Ironically, we can see through the play's popularity that this only increased people's interest in such behavior. Benedick wittily gives voice to male anxieties about women's \"sharp tongues and proneness to sexual lightness\".<ref name=\"McEachern\" /> In the patriarchal society of the play, the men's loyalties were governed by conventional codes of honour and camaraderie and a sense of superiority to women.<ref name=\"McEachern\" /> Assumptions that women are by nature prone to inconstancy are shown in the repeated jokes on [[cuckold]]ry and partly explain Claudio's readiness to believe the slur against Hero. This stereotype is turned on its head in Balthazar's song \"Sigh No More,\" which presents men as the deceitful and inconstant sex that women must suffer.\n\n====Infidelity====\nA [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in Shakespeare is cuckoldry or the infidelity of a wife. Several of the characters seem to be obsessed by the idea that a man has no way to know if his wife is faithful and therefore women can take full advantage of that fact. Don John plays upon Claudio's pride and fear of cuckoldry, which leads to the disastrous first wedding. Many of the males easily believe that Hero is impure and even her father readily condemns her with very little proof. This [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] runs through the play, often in references to horns, a symbol of cuckoldry.\n\nIn contrast, Balthasar's song \"[[Sigh No More (Much Ado About Nothing)|Sigh No More]]\" tells women to accept men's infidelity and continue to live joyfully. Some interpretations say that Balthasar sings poorly, undercutting the message. This is supported by Benedick's cynical comments about the song, where he compares it to a howling dog. However, in the 1993 Branagh film Balthasar sings beautifully, the song is also given a prominent role in both the opening and finale and the message appears to be embraced by the women in the film.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Deleyto|first1= Celestino|year= 1997|title= Men in Leather: Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado about Nothing and Romantic Comedy|journal= Cinema Journal|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 91\u2013105|publisher= University of Texas Press |doi= 10.2307/1225677|jstor= 1225677}}</ref>\n\n====Deception====\nIn ''Much Ado About Nothing'', there are many examples of deception and self-deception. The games and tricks played on people often have the best intentions{{snd}}to make people fall in love, to help someone get what they want, or to lead someone to realize their mistake. However, not all are meant well, such as when Don John convinces Claudio that Don Pedro wants Hero for himself, or when Borachio meets 'Hero' (who is actually Margaret, pretending to be Hero) in Hero's bedroom window. These modes of deceit play into a complementary theme of emotional manipulation and the ease with which the characters' sentiments are redirected and their propensities exploited as a means to an end. The characters' feelings for each other are played as vehicles to reach an ultimate goal of engagement rather than seen as an end in themselves.\n\n====Masks and mistaken identity====\nPeople are constantly pretending to be others or being mistaken for other people. An example of this is Margaret who is mistaken for Hero, which leads to Hero's public disgrace at her wedding with Claudio. However, during a masked ball in which everyone must wear a mask, Beatrice rants about Benedick to a masked man who turns out to be Benedick himself but she acts unaware of this at the time. During the same celebration, Don Pedro, masked, pretends to be Claudio and courts Hero for him. After Hero is announced \"dead,\" Leonato orders Claudio to marry his \"niece,\" who is actually Hero in disguise.\n\n====Noting====\n[[File:Beatrice overhears Hero and Ursula.jpg|thumb|A watercolor by [[John Sutcliffe (artist)|John Sutcliffe]]: Beatrice overhears Hero and Ursula.]]\n\nAnother motif is the play on the words ''nothing'' and ''noting'', which in Shakespeare's day were near-[[homophone]]s.<ref>See Stephen Greenblatt's introduction to ''Much Ado about Nothing'' in ''The Norton Shakespeare'' ([[W. W.

The title could also be understood as ''Much Ado About Noting''. Much of the action centers around interest in and critique of others, written messages, [[Espionage|spying]], and [[eavesdropping]]. This attention on others is directly mentioned several times, particularly concerning \"seeming,\" \"fashion,\" and outward impressions.\n\n''Nothing'' is also a [[double entendre]]; \"an O-thing\" (or \"n othing\" or \"no thing\") was Elizabethan slang for \"[[vagina]]\", evidently derived from the pun of a woman having \"nothing\" between her legs.<ref name=\"RasmussenShakespeare2007\" /><ref>See Gordon Williams ''A Glossary of Shakespeare's Sexual Language'' (Althone Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-485-12130-1}}) at p.&nbsp;219: \"As Shakespeare's title ironically acknowledges, vagina and virginity are a nothing causing Much Ado.\"</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gary | last=Dexter | title=Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name | date=13 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nExamples of noting as noticing occur in the following instances: (1.1.131\u2013132)\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signor Leonato?<br />\n'''Benedick:''' I noted her not, but I looked on her.}}\nand (4.1.154\u2013157).\n{{quote|'''Friar:''' Hear me a little,<br />\nFor I have only been silent so long<br />\nAnd given way unto this course of fortune<br />\nBy noting of the lady.}}\n\nAt (3.3.102\u2013104), Borachio indicates that a man's clothing doesn't indicate his character:\n{{quote|'''Borachio:''' Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak is nothing to a man.}}\n\nA triple play on words in which noting signifies noticing, musical notes and nothing occurs at (2.3.47\u201352):\n{{quote|'''Don Pedro:''' Nay pray thee, come;<br />\nOr if thou wilt hold longer argument,<br />\nDo it in notes.<br />\n'''Balthasar:''' Note this before my notes:<br />\nThere's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.<br />\n'''Don Pedro:''' Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks \u2013<br />\nNote notes, forsooth, and nothing!}}\n\nDon Pedro's last line can be understood to mean, \"Pay attention to your music and nothing else!\" The complex layers of meaning include a pun on \"crotchets,\" which can mean both \"[[quarter note]]s\" (in music) and whimsical notions.\n\nThe following are [[pun]]s on notes as messages: (2.1.174\u2013176),\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' I pray you leave me.<br />\n'''Benedick:''' Ho, now you strike like the blind man \u2013 'twas the boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.}}\nin which Benedick plays on the word ''post'' as a pole and as mail delivery in a joke reminiscent of Shakespeare's earlier advice \"[[Shooting the messenger|Don't shoot the messenger]]\"; and (2.3.138\u2013142)\n\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a [[wikt:pretty|pretty]] jest your daughter told us of.<br />\n'''Leonato:''' O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?}}\nin which Leonato makes a sexual innuendo concerning ''sheet'' as a sheet of paper (on which Beatrice's love note to Benedick is to have been written) and a bedsheet.\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:Garrick as Benedick.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Benedick, by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Louis Fesch|fr}}, 1770]]\n\nThe play was very popular in its early decades, and continues to be a standard wherever Shakespeare is performed. In a poem published in 1640, [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]] wrote, \"[\u2026] let but Beatrice&nbsp;/ And Benedick be seen, lo in a trice&nbsp;/ The [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] galleries, boxes, all are full.\"\n\n[[File:Gielgud and Leighton in Much Ado 1959.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[John Gielgud]] and [[Margaret Leighton]] in the 1959 Broadway production of ''Much Ado About Nothing''.]]\n\nAfter the theatres re-opened during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Sir [[William Davenant]] staged ''The Law Against Lovers'' (1662), which inserted Beatrice and Benedick into an adaptation of ''[[Measure for Measure]]''. Another adaptation, ''The Universal Passion'', combined ''Much Ado'' with a play by [[Moli\u00e8re]] (1737). Shakespeare's text had been revived by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] (1721). [[David Garrick]] first played Benedick in 1748 and continued to play him until 1776.<ref>[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564\u20131964.'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964, pp.&nbsp;326 f.</ref>\n\nThe great nineteenth-century stage team [[Henry Irving]] and [[Ellen Terry]] counted Benedick and Beatrice as their greatest triumph and [[Charles Kemble]] also had a great success as Benedick. [[John Gielgud]] made Benedick one of his signature roles between 1931 and 1959, playing the part opposite the Beatrice of [[Diana Wynyard]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]], and [[Margaret Leighton]]. The longest running Broadway production is [[A. J. Antoon]]'s 1972 staging starring [[Sam Waterston]], [[Kathleen Widdoes]], and [[Barnard Hughes]], and [[Derek Jacobi]] won a [[Tony Award]] for playing Benedick in 1984. Jacobi had also played Benedick in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s highly praised 1982 production. Director [[Terry Hands]] produced the play on a stage-length mirror, against an unchanging backdrop of painted trees. [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] played Beatrice. In 2013 [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]] (then already in their seventies and eighties, respectively) played Benedick and Beatrice on stage at [[The Old Vic]], London.\n{{-}}\n\n===

Claudio's feelings for Hero, Leonato's only daughter, are rekindled upon seeing her, and Claudio soon announces to Benedick his intention to court her. Benedick, who openly despises marriage, tries to dissuade his friend, but Don Pedro encourages the marriage. Benedick swears that he will never get married. Don Pedro laughs at him and tells him that when he has found the right person he shall get married.\n\nA [[masquerade ball]] is planned in celebration of the end of the war, giving a disguised Don Pedro the opportunity to [[Courtship|woo]] Hero on Claudio's behalf. Don John uses this situation to get revenge on him by telling Claudio that Don Pedro is wooing Hero for himself. A furious Claudio confronts Don Pedro, but the misunderstanding is quickly resolved and Claudio wins Hero's hand in marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, Benedick disguises himself and dances with Beatrice, who proceeds to tell this \"mystery man\" that Benedick is \"the prince's jester, a very dull fool.\" Enraged by her words, Benedick swears he will have revenge. Don Pedro and his men, bored at the prospect of waiting a week for the wedding, concoct a plan to match-make between Benedick and Beatrice. They arrange for the former to overhear a conversation in which they declare that the latter is madly in love with him, but is too afraid to tell him as their pride is the main impediment to their courtship. Meanwhile, Hero and her maid, Ursula, ensure Beatrice overhears them discuss Benedick's undying love for her. The tricks have the desired effect: both Benedick and Beatrice are delighted to think they are the object of [[unrequited love]], and both accordingly resolve to mend their faults and reconcile.\n\nMeanwhile, Don John, the \"bastard prince\", plots to stop the wedding, embarrass his brother, and wreak misery on Leonato and Claudio. He informs Don Pedro and Claudio that Hero is unfaithful, and arranges for them to see his associate, Borachio, enter her bedchamber and engage in an amorous liaison with her (though in reality it was Margaret, Hero's chambermaid). Claudio and Don Pedro are taken in, and the former vows to publicly humiliate Hero.\n\n[[File:Much Ado About Nothing by Alfred Elmore 1846.jpg|thumbnail|left|Swooning of Hero in the Church scene by [[Alfred Elmore]]]]\n\nAt the wedding the next day, Claudio denounces Hero before the stunned guests and storms off with Don Pedro, causing Hero to faint. A humiliated Leonato expresses his wish for her to die. The presiding friar intervenes, believing Hero to be innocent. He suggests the family must fake Hero's death in order to extract the truth and Claudio's remorse. Prompted by the day's stressful events, Benedick and Beatrice confess their love for each other. Beatrice then asks Benedick to kill Claudio as proof of his devotion, since he has slandered her kinswoman. Benedick is disgusted and at first denies her request. Leonato and his brother Antonio blame Claudio for Hero's apparent death and challenge him to a duel. Benedick then does the same, following Beatrice's commands as he is one of the few who believe Hero. Luckily, on the night of Don John's treachery, the local Watch apprehended Borachio and his ally, Conrade. Despite the comic ineptness of the Watch (headed by constable [[Dogberry]], a master of [[malapropism]]s), they have overheard the duo discussing their evil plans. The Watch arrest the villains and eventually obtain a confession, informing Leonato of Hero's innocence. Though Don John has fled the city, a force is sent to capture him. Claudio, stricken with remorse at Hero's supposed death, agrees to her father's demand that he marry Antonio's daughter, \"almost the copy of my child that's dead\"<ref name=\"shakespeare-navigators.com\"/> and carry on the family name.\n\nAt the wedding, the bride is revealed to be a still living Hero. Claudio is overjoyed. Beatrice and Benedick, prompted by their friends' interference, finally and publicly confess their love for each other. As the play draws to a close, a messenger arrives with news of Don John's capture, but Benedick proposes to postpone deciding Don John's punishment until tomorrow so the couples can enjoy their newfound happiness. Don Pedro expresses his loneliness since he hasn't found love, to which Benedick responds, \"Get thee a wife.\"\n\n==Sources==\nStories of lovers deceived into believing each other false were common currency in northern Italy in the sixteenth century. Shakespeare's immediate source could have been one of the ''Novelle'' (\"Tales\") by [[Matteo Bandello]] of [[Mantua]], dealing with the tribulations of Sir Timbreo and his betrothed Fenicia Lionata in Messina after [[Peter III of Aragon|King Piero's]] defeat of [[Charles of Anjou]], perhaps through the translation into French by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Belleforest]].<ref name=\"RasmussenShakespeare2007\">{{cite book|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Eric|authorlink1=|last2=Bate|first2=Jonathan|authorlink2=Jonathan Bate|title=The RSC Shakespeare: the complete works|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-00350-7|page=257|chapter=Much Ado About Nothing}}</ref> Another version featuring lovers Ariodante and Ginevra, with the servant Dalinda impersonating Ginevra on the balcony, appears in Book V of ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' by [[Ludovico Ariosto]], published in an English translation in 1591.<ref name=\"Shakespeare1997\">{{cite book|last=Evans|first=G.

W. Norton & Company]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-393-97087-6}}) p.&nbsp;1387</ref> The earliest recorded performances are two that were given at Court in the winter of 1612\u20131613, during the festivities preceding the marriage of Princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth]] with [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]] (14 February 1613). The play was published in [[book size|quarto]] in 1600 by the stationers [[Andrew Wise]] and [[William Aspley]]. This was the only edition prior to the [[First Folio]] in 1623.\n\n==Analysis and criticism==\n\n===Style===\nThe play is predominantly written in prose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare.mit.edu/much_ado/full.html |title=Much Ado About Nothing: Entire Play |publisher=Shakespeare.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=12 November 2012}}</ref> The substantial verse sections achieve a sense of decorum and provide energy to its audience.<ref name=arden>{{cite book|editor=A. R. Hunphreys| title=Much Ado About Nothing| publisher=Arden Edition| year=1981}}</ref>\n\n===Setting===\n''Much Ado About Nothing'' is set in [[Messina]], a port on the island of [[Sicily]], which is next to the toe of [[Italy]]. Sicily was [[History of Sicily#Spanish period|ruled by Aragon]] at the time the play was set.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bate|first=Jonathan|authorlink=Jonathan Bate|title=Soul of the Age: the Life, Mind and World of William Shakespeare|publisher=Viking|location=London|year=2008|page=305|isbn=978-0-670-91482-1}}</ref> The action of the play takes place mainly at the home and on the grounds of Leonato's Estate.\n\n===Themes and motifs===\n\n====Gender roles====\n[[File:Kill Claudio.jpg|thumb|Drawing of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as Benedick and [[Winifred Emery]] as Beatrice in a 1905 production. Act II, Scene v: \"Kill Claudio\".]]\nBenedick and Beatrice quickly became the main interest of the play, to the point where they are today considered the leading roles, even though their relationship is given equal or lesser weight in the script than Claudio and Hero's situation.  [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] even wrote 'Benedick and Beatrice' beside the title of the play in his copy of the [[Second Folio]].<ref>G. Blakemore Evans, ''The Riverside Shakespeare'', Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p.&nbsp;327.</ref> The provocative treatment of gender is central to the play and should be considered in its [[Renaissance]] context. While this was reflected and emphasized in certain plays of the period, it was also challenged.<ref name=\"McEachern\">McEachern, ''Much Ado About Nothing'', Arden; 3rd edition, 2005.</ref> Amussen<ref>Amussen, ''Ordered Society'', Columbia University Press (15 April 1994).</ref> notes that the undoing of traditional gender clich\u00e9s appears to have inflamed anxieties about the erosion of social order. It seems that comic drama could be a means of calming such anxieties. Ironically, we can see through the play's popularity that this only increased people's interest in such behavior. Benedick wittily gives voice to male anxieties about women's \"sharp tongues and proneness to sexual lightness\".<ref name=\"McEachern\" /> In the patriarchal society of the play, the men's loyalties were governed by conventional codes of honour and camaraderie and a sense of superiority to women.<ref name=\"McEachern\" /> Assumptions that women are by nature prone to inconstancy are shown in the repeated jokes on [[cuckold]]ry and partly explain Claudio's readiness to believe the slur against Hero. This stereotype is turned on its head in Balthazar's song \"Sigh No More,\" which presents men as the deceitful and inconstant sex that women must suffer.\n\n====Infidelity====\nA [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in Shakespeare is cuckoldry or the infidelity of a wife. Several of the characters seem to be obsessed by the idea that a man has no way to know if his wife is faithful and therefore women can take full advantage of that fact. Don John plays upon Claudio's pride and fear of cuckoldry, which leads to the disastrous first wedding. Many of the males easily believe that Hero is impure and even her father readily condemns her with very little proof. This [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] runs through the play, often in references to horns, a symbol of cuckoldry.\n\nIn contrast, Balthasar's song \"[[Sigh No More (Much Ado About Nothing)|Sigh No More]]\" tells women to accept men's infidelity and continue to live joyfully. Some interpretations say that Balthasar sings poorly, undercutting the message. This is supported by Benedick's cynical comments about the song, where he compares it to a howling dog. However, in the 1993 Branagh film Balthasar sings beautifully, the song is also given a prominent role in both the opening and finale and the message appears to be embraced by the women in the film.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Deleyto|first1= Celestino|year= 1997|title= Men in Leather: Kenneth Branagh's Much Ado about Nothing and Romantic Comedy|journal= Cinema Journal|volume= 36|issue= 3|pages= 91\u2013105|publisher= University of Texas Press |doi= 10.2307/1225677|jstor= 1225677}}</ref>\n\n====Deception====\nIn ''Much Ado About Nothing'', there are many examples of deception and self-deception. The games and tricks played on people often have the best intentions{{snd}}to make people fall in love, to help someone get what they want, or to lead someone to realize their mistake. However, not all are meant well, such as when Don John convinces Claudio that Don Pedro wants Hero for himself, or when Borachio meets 'Hero' (who is actually Margaret, pretending to be Hero) in Hero's bedroom window. These modes of deceit play into a complementary theme of emotional manipulation and the ease with which the characters' sentiments are redirected and their propensities exploited as a means to an end. The characters' feelings for each other are played as vehicles to reach an ultimate goal of engagement rather than seen as an end in themselves.\n\n====Masks and mistaken identity====\nPeople are constantly pretending to be others or being mistaken for other people. An example of this is Margaret who is mistaken for Hero, which leads to Hero's public disgrace at her wedding with Claudio. However, during a masked ball in which everyone must wear a mask, Beatrice rants about Benedick to a masked man who turns out to be Benedick himself but she acts unaware of this at the time. During the same celebration, Don Pedro, masked, pretends to be Claudio and courts Hero for him. After Hero is announced \"dead,\" Leonato orders Claudio to marry his \"niece,\" who is actually Hero in disguise.\n\n====Noting====\n[[File:Beatrice overhears Hero and Ursula.jpg|thumb|A watercolor by [[John Sutcliffe (artist)|John Sutcliffe]]: Beatrice overhears Hero and Ursula.]]\n\nAnother motif is the play on the words ''nothing'' and ''noting'', which in Shakespeare's day were near-[[homophone]]s.<ref>See Stephen Greenblatt's introduction to ''Much Ado about Nothing'' in ''The Norton Shakespeare'' ([[W. W. Norton & Company]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-393-97087-6}}), p.&nbsp;1383.</ref> Taken literally, the title implies that a great fuss (\"much ado\") is made of something which is insignificant (\"nothing\"), such as the unfounded claims of Hero's infidelity and the unfounded claims that Benedick and Beatrice are in love with each other. The title could also be understood as ''Much Ado About Noting''. Much of the action centers around interest in and critique of others, written messages, [[Espionage|spying]], and [[eavesdropping]]. This attention on others is directly mentioned several times, particularly concerning \"seeming,\" \"fashion,\" and outward impressions.\n\n''Nothing'' is also a [[double entendre]]; \"an O-thing\" (or \"n othing\" or \"no thing\") was Elizabethan slang for \"[[vagina]]\", evidently derived from the pun of a woman having \"nothing\" between her legs.<ref name=\"RasmussenShakespeare2007\" /><ref>See Gordon Williams ''A Glossary of Shakespeare's Sexual Language'' (Althone Press, 1997 {{ISBN|0-485-12130-1}}) at p.&nbsp;219: \"As Shakespeare's title ironically acknowledges, vagina and virginity are a nothing causing Much Ado.\"</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/8313901/Title-Deed-How-the-Book-Got-its-Name.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Gary | last=Dexter | title=Title Deed: How the Book Got its Name | date=13 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nExamples of noting as noticing occur in the following instances: (1.1.131\u2013132)\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signor Leonato?<br />\n'''Benedick:''' I noted her not, but I looked on her.}}\nand (4.1.154\u2013157).\n{{quote|'''Friar:''' Hear me a little,<br />\nFor I have only been silent so long<br />\nAnd given way unto this course of fortune<br />\nBy noting of the lady.}}\n\nAt (3.3.102\u2013104), Borachio indicates that a man's clothing doesn't indicate his character:\n{{quote|'''Borachio:''' Thou knowest that the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak is nothing to a man.}}\n\nA triple play on words in which noting signifies noticing, musical notes and nothing occurs at (2.3.47\u201352):\n{{quote|'''Don Pedro:''' Nay pray thee, come;<br />\nOr if thou wilt hold longer argument,<br />\nDo it in notes.<br />\n'''Balthasar:''' Note this before my notes:<br />\nThere's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.<br />\n'''Don Pedro:''' Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks \u2013<br />\nNote notes, forsooth, and nothing!}}\n\nDon Pedro's last line can be understood to mean, \"Pay attention to your music and nothing else!\" The complex layers of meaning include a pun on \"crotchets,\" which can mean both \"[[quarter note]]s\" (in music) and whimsical notions.\n\nThe following are [[pun]]s on notes as messages: (2.1.174\u2013176),\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' I pray you leave me.<br />\n'''Benedick:''' Ho, now you strike like the blind man \u2013 'twas the boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.}}\nin which Benedick plays on the word ''post'' as a pole and as mail delivery in a joke reminiscent of Shakespeare's earlier advice \"[[Shooting the messenger|Don't shoot the messenger]]\"; and (2.3.138\u2013142)\n\n{{quote|'''Claudio:''' Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a [[wikt:pretty|pretty]] jest your daughter told us of.<br />\n'''Leonato:''' O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?}}\nin which Leonato makes a sexual innuendo concerning ''sheet'' as a sheet of paper (on which Beatrice's love note to Benedick is to have been written) and a bedsheet.\n\n==Performance history==\n[[File:Garrick as Benedick.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Benedick, by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Louis Fesch|fr}}, 1770]]\n\nThe play was very popular in its early decades, and continues to be a standard wherever Shakespeare is performed. In a poem published in 1640, [[Leonard Digges (writer)|Leonard Digges]] wrote, \"[\u2026] let but Beatrice&nbsp;/ And Benedick be seen, lo in a trice&nbsp;/ The [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] galleries, boxes, all are full.\"\n\n[[File:Gielgud and Leighton in Much Ado 1959.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[John Gielgud]] and [[Margaret Leighton]] in the 1959 Broadway production of ''Much Ado About Nothing''.]]\n\nAfter the theatres re-opened during the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], Sir [[William Davenant]] staged ''The Law Against Lovers'' (1662), which inserted Beatrice and Benedick into an adaptation of ''[[Measure for Measure]]''. Another adaptation, ''The Universal Passion'', combined ''Much Ado'' with a play by [[Moli\u00e8re]] (1737). Shakespeare's text had been revived by [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] (1721). [[David Garrick]] first played Benedick in 1748 and continued to play him until 1776.<ref>[[F. E. Halliday]], ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564\u20131964.'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964, pp.&nbsp;326 f.</ref>\n\nThe great nineteenth-century stage team [[Henry Irving]] and [[Ellen Terry]] counted Benedick and Beatrice as their greatest triumph and [[Charles Kemble]] also had a great success as Benedick. [[John Gielgud]] made Benedick one of his signature roles between 1931 and 1959, playing the part opposite the Beatrice of [[Diana Wynyard]], [[Peggy Ashcroft]], and [[Margaret Leighton]]. The longest running Broadway production is [[A. J. Antoon]]'s 1972 staging starring [[Sam Waterston]], [[Kathleen Widdoes]], and [[Barnard Hughes]], and [[Derek Jacobi]] won a [[Tony Award]] for playing Benedick in 1984. Jacobi had also played Benedick in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s highly praised 1982 production. Director [[Terry Hands]] produced the play on a stage-length mirror, against an unchanging backdrop of painted trees. [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] played Beatrice. In 2013 [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Vanessa Redgrave]] (then already in their seventies and eighties, respectively) played Benedick and Beatrice on stage at [[The Old Vic]], London.\n{{-}}\n\n===

He has played in the [[English Football League]] and [[Premier League]] for [[Bury F.C.|Bury]], [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]], [[AFC Bournemouth]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].\n\nPugh started his career with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], where he progressed through the youth system. He was released by the club having made his first-team debut while on loan at [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]] and signed a short-term contract with Bury in 2006. Pugh later signed a professional contract at the club and after rejecting an extended contract in 2007 he signed for Shrewsbury Town. He was loaned out to Luton Town and Hereford United, joining the latter permanently in 2009.\n\nPugh left Hereford after one season to sign for Bournemouth in 2010, where he was top scorer in his first two seasons. He has since made over 300 appearances for the club, helping them win [[Promotion and relegation|promotion]] to the Championship in 2013 and the Premier League two years later. As a result, Pugh has played and scored in all five of England's nationwide football divisions. After a spell on loan with Hull City, he was released by Bournemouth in 2019 before joining Queens Park Rangers.\n\n==Early and personal life==\nPugh was born in [[Bacup]], Lancashire<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.soccerway.com/players/marc-pugh/50754/ |title=M.

Nevertheless, Texas and other western states raised barriers to voting and political participation by ethnic Mexicans, including barring them from serving on juries.\n\nAfter Texas was admitted as a state to the Union, it continued to claim the northeastern portion of present-day New Mexico.

In general, personal-use [[personal property]] is not subject to property taxation. On the other hand, property tax is levied on most business-use personal property. The taxable value of property is 1/3 of the assessed value. A tax rate of about 30 [[mill (currency)|mills]] is applied to the taxable value, resulting in an effective tax rate of about 1%.

The governor is [[Michelle Lujan Grisham]] (D), who succeeded [[Susana Martinez]] (R) on January 1, 2019 after she served two terms as governor from 2011 to 2019. [[Gary Johnson]] served as governor from 1995 to 2003. Johnson served as a Republican, but in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], he ran for President from the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. In previous presidential elections, [[Al Gore]] carried the state (by 366 votes) in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]; [[George W.

Republicans have traditionally had their strongholds in the eastern and southern parts of the state, the [[Farmington, New Mexico|Farmington]] area, [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]], and the newly developed areas in the Northwest mesa. Albuquerque's Northeast Heights have historically leaned Republican, but have become a key swing area for Democrats in recent election cycles. While registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 200,000, New Mexico voters have favored moderate to conservative candidates of both parties at the state and federal levels.\n\nNew Mexico abolished its death penalty statute, though not retroactively, effective July 1, 2009. This means individuals on New Mexico's Death Row can still be executed. On March 18, 2009, then Governor [[Bill Richardson]] signed the law abolishing the death penalty in New Mexico following the assembly and senate vote the week before, thus becoming the 15th U.S. state to abolish the penalty.<ref>Le Nouveau-Mexique abolit la peine de mort [archive] in Le Monde of March 19, 2009</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:1em;\"\n|+ '''Presidential elections results'''\n|- style=\"background:lightgrey;\"\n!

State law pre-empts all local gun control ordinances. New Mexico residents may purchase any firearm deemed legal under federal law. There are no waiting periods under state law for picking up a firearm after it has been purchased, and there are no restrictions on magazine capacity. Additionally, New Mexico is a \"shall-issue\" state for [[concealed carry]] permits.\n\nBefore December 2013, New Mexico law neither explicitly allowed nor prohibited [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. Policy concerning the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was determined at the county level; that is, some county clerks issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples while others did not. In December 2013, the [[New Mexico Supreme Court]] issued a unanimous ruling directing all county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, thereby making New Mexico the 17th state to recognize same-sex marriage at the statewide level.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:ApodacaBuildingNMEd.JPG|thumb|The [[New Mexico Public Education Department]] is in Santa Fe.]]\n\nDue to its relatively low population, in combination with numerous federally funded research facilities, New Mexico had the highest concentration of PhD holders of any state in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.07/silicon_pr.html |title=Venture Capitals |website=Wired |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313074736/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.07/silicon_pr.html |archive-date=March 13, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite this, the state routinely ranks near the bottom in surveys of the quality of primary and secondary school education.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/04/wallethub-education-rankings_n_5648067.html| title=These Are The States With The Best And Worst School Systems, According To New Rankings| date=August 4, 2014| work=Huffington Post| accessdate=November 22, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031054/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/04/wallethub-education-rankings_n_5648067.html| archive-date=November 23, 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> In a landmark decision, a state judge ruled in 2018 that \"New Mexico is violating the constitutional rights of at-risk students by failing to provide them with sufficient education,\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |last1=Mckay |first1=Dan |last2=Perea |first2=Shelby |title=New Mexico loses education lawsuit |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1199185/nm-loses-landmark-education-case-ordered-to-provide-adequate-funding.html |website=www.abqjournal.com |publisher=Albuquerque Journal |accessdate=11 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111175424/https://www.abqjournal.com/1199185/nm-loses-landmark-education-case-ordered-to-provide-adequate-funding.html |archive-date=January 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> and ordered that the governor and Legislature provide an adequate system by April 2019.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Martinez v.

important center of Native American culture. Both the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] share [[Athabaskan]] origin. The Apache and some [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] live on federal [[Native American reservation|reservations]] within the state. With 16 million acres (6,500,000 [[hectare|ha]]), mostly in neighboring [[Arizona]], the reservation of the [[Navajo Nation]] ranks as the largest in the United States. The prehistorically agricultural [[Pueblo Indians]] live in pueblos scattered throughout the state. Almost half of New Mexicans claim Hispanic origin; many are descendants of colonial settlers. They settled in the state's northern portion. Most of the Mexican immigrants reside in the southern part of the state. Also 10-15% of the population, mainly in the north, may contain [[Who is a Jew?#New Mexico's Crypto-Jews|Hispanic Jewish ancestry]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nMany New Mexicans speak a unique dialect of Spanish.

It uses numerous Native American words for local features and includes anglicized words that express American concepts and modern inventions.\n\nAlbuquerque has the [[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]], the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], and the [[National Museum of Nuclear Science & History]], as well as hosts the famed annual [[Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta]] every fall.\n\n===Art and literature===\n\nThe earliest New Mexico artists whose work survives today are the Mimbres Indians, whose black and white pottery could be mistaken for modern art, except for the fact that it was produced before 1130 CE.

Veterans were disappointed to return and find their civil rights limited by state discrimination. In Arizona and New Mexico, veterans challenged state laws or practices prohibiting them from voting. In 1948, after veteran Miguel Trujillo, Sr. of [[Isleta Pueblo]] was told by the county registrar that he could not register to vote, he filed suit against the county in federal district court. A three-judge panel overturned as unconstitutional New Mexico's provisions that Indians who did not pay taxes (and could not document if they had paid taxes) could not vote.<ref name=\"suffrage\"/> Judge Phillips wrote:\n<blockquote>Any other citizen, regardless of race, in the State of New Mexico who has not paid one cent of tax of any kind or character, if he possesses the other qualifications, may vote. An Indian, and only an Indian, in order to meet the qualifications to vote must have paid a tax.

State law pre-empts all local gun control ordinances. New Mexico residents may purchase any firearm deemed legal under federal law. There are no waiting periods under state law for picking up a firearm after it has been purchased, and there are no restrictions on magazine capacity. Additionally, New Mexico is a \"shall-issue\" state for [[concealed carry]] permits.\n\nBefore December 2013, New Mexico law neither explicitly allowed nor prohibited [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. Policy concerning the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples was determined at the county level; that is, some county clerks issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples while others did not. In December 2013, the [[New Mexico Supreme Court]] issued a unanimous ruling directing all county clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, thereby making New Mexico the 17th state to recognize same-sex marriage at the statewide level.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:ApodacaBuildingNMEd.JPG|thumb|The [[New Mexico Public Education Department]] is in Santa Fe.]]\n\nDue to its relatively low population, in combination with numerous federally funded research facilities, New Mexico had the highest concentration of PhD holders of any state in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.07/silicon_pr.html |title=Venture Capitals |website=Wired |accessdate=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313074736/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.07/silicon_pr.html |archive-date=March 13, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite this, the state routinely ranks near the bottom in surveys of the quality of primary and secondary school education.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/04/wallethub-education-rankings_n_5648067.html| title=These Are The States With The Best And Worst School Systems, According To New Rankings| date=August 4, 2014| work=Huffington Post| accessdate=November 22, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123031054/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/04/wallethub-education-rankings_n_5648067.html| archive-date=November 23, 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> In a landmark decision, a state judge ruled in 2018 that \"New Mexico is violating the constitutional rights of at-risk students by failing to provide them with sufficient education,\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |last1=Mckay |first1=Dan |last2=Perea |first2=Shelby |title=New Mexico loses education lawsuit |url=https://www.abqjournal.com/1199185/nm-loses-landmark-education-case-ordered-to-provide-adequate-funding.html |website=www.abqjournal.com |publisher=Albuquerque Journal |accessdate=11 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111175424/https://www.abqjournal.com/1199185/nm-loses-landmark-education-case-ordered-to-provide-adequate-funding.html |archive-date=January 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> and ordered that the governor and Legislature provide an adequate system by April 2019.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Martinez v.

important center of Native American culture. Both the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] and [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] share [[Athabaskan]] origin. The Apache and some [[Ute Tribe|Ute]] live on federal [[Native American reservation|reservations]] within the state. With 16 million acres (6,500,000 [[hectare|ha]]), mostly in neighboring [[Arizona]], the reservation of the [[Navajo Nation]] ranks as the largest in the United States. The prehistorically agricultural [[Pueblo Indians]] live in pueblos scattered throughout the state. Almost half of New Mexicans claim Hispanic origin; many are descendants of colonial settlers. They settled in the state's northern portion. Most of the Mexican immigrants reside in the southern part of the state. Also 10-15% of the population, mainly in the north, may contain [[Who is a Jew?#New Mexico's Crypto-Jews|Hispanic Jewish ancestry]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nMany New Mexicans speak a unique dialect of Spanish.
