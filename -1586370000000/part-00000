Since US military service members were a large source of the hostess bars clientele, this effectively closed all hostessing themed establishments nearby all US military bases in Korea.\n\n== Policies ==\nForeign policies between the United States and Republic of Korea determined the U.S.'s occupation and influence in South Korea. Through collaboration between Korean leaders and the U.S. military, an institutionalized system transpired which tolerated and regulated prostitution. The arrival of American GIs resulted in greater demand for Korean sex workers and an increase in clientele for R&R (Rest and Relaxation{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=85}}) establishments.\n\n=== Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law ===\nThe Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law (Public Act No. 7) was passed on November 11, 1947 and took effect on February 14, 1948. The U.S policy was installed in order to alter the system of licensed prostitution which was established in Korea under Japan's rule. Despite the abolishment of licensed prostitution, it only led to the \u201cprivatization\u201d of prostitution and the widespread dispersement of prostitutes throughout the area.{{sfn|Lee|2007|pp=466\u2013468}} This made its difficult for the government to systematically regulate prostitutes and their activities; specifically, mandatory STD exams for prostitutes could no longer be enforced. This resulted in a large spike of STD's among prostitutes and the U.S. military{{sfn|Lee|2007|p=469}} Rehabilitation and welfare assistance for prostitutes were supposed to be a part of the new law; however, policymakers denied national funds towards these programs.\n\nThrough the Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law, the U.S. military government replaced licensed establishments of prostitution to camptowns near military bases. This provided a communal space for prostitutes and U.S. military men.\n\n=== Mutual Defense Treaty ===\nThe United States' involvement in aiding South Korea during the Korean War (1950-1953) resulted in the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1953 that declared the Republic of Korea and the United States as military alliances. Through this treaty, the Republic of Korea formally granted military facilities, areas, and status for U.S. troops in Korea for an indefinite period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/resource/modern-korean-history-portal/us-korea-military-alliance|title=US-Korea Military Alliance|last=Oh|first=Daniel|website=Wilson Center Digital Archive|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usfk.mil/About/SOFA/|title=Status of Forces Agreement|website=www.usfk.mil|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Korea |url=https://www.usfk.mil/Portals/105/Documents/SOFA/A01_SOFA.Art.I-XXXI.pdf |website=www.usfk.mil |accessdate=10 June 2019 |date=9 July 1966}}</ref> The presence of U.S. military troops, under the Mutual Defense Treaty, were the product of high kijich'on prostitution rates.{{sfn|Moon|2006|p=29}}\n\n=== Nixon Doctrine ===\nIn 1969, the Nixon Doctrine declared the need to reduce the United States' military involvement from Asia. This resulted in 20,000 U.S. servicemen being removed from South Korea and the formal withdrawal of American GIs from the DMZ.{{sfn|Moon|2006|p=59}} Due to the economic dependence on the U.S. military's presence for jobs and income, prostitution decreased but competition significantly heightened among clubs, other businesses, and sex workers.

It was publicized that some establishments went from making $200 to $300 per night to a profit of $4 to $5.{{sfn|Moon|2006|pp=68-69}} Many who lived near U.S. bases needed to relocate to more concentrated areas while others found work in different industries.

Since US military service members were a large source of the hostess bars clientele, this effectively closed all hostessing themed establishments nearby all US military bases in Korea.\n\n== Policies ==\nForeign policies between the United States and Republic of Korea determined the U.S.'s occupation and influence in South Korea. Through collaboration between Korean leaders and the U.S. military, an institutionalized system transpired which tolerated and regulated prostitution. The arrival of American GIs resulted in greater demand for Korean sex workers and an increase in clientele for R&R (Rest and Relaxation{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=85}}) establishments.\n\n=== Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law ===\nThe Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law (Public Act No. 7) was passed on November 11, 1947 and took effect on February 14, 1948. The U.S policy was installed in order to alter the system of licensed prostitution which was established in Korea under Japan's rule. Despite the abolishment of licensed prostitution, it only led to the \u201cprivatization\u201d of prostitution and the widespread dispersement of prostitutes throughout the area.{{sfn|Lee|2007|pp=466\u2013468}} This made its difficult for the government to systematically regulate prostitutes and their activities; specifically, mandatory STD exams for prostitutes could no longer be enforced. This resulted in a large spike of STD's among prostitutes and the U.S. military{{sfn|Lee|2007|p=469}} Rehabilitation and welfare assistance for prostitutes were supposed to be a part of the new law; however, policymakers denied national funds towards these programs.\n\nThrough the Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law, the U.S. military government replaced licensed establishments of prostitution to camptowns near military bases. This provided a communal space for prostitutes and U.S. military men.\n\n=== Mutual Defense Treaty ===\nThe United States' involvement in aiding South Korea during the Korean War (1950-1953) resulted in the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1953 that declared the Republic of Korea and the United States as military alliances. Through this treaty, the Republic of Korea formally granted military facilities, areas, and status for U.S. troops in Korea for an indefinite period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/resource/modern-korean-history-portal/us-korea-military-alliance|title=US-Korea Military Alliance|last=Oh|first=Daniel|website=Wilson Center Digital Archive|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usfk.mil/About/SOFA/|title=Status of Forces Agreement|website=www.usfk.mil|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Korea |url=https://www.usfk.mil/Portals/105/Documents/SOFA/A01_SOFA.Art.I-XXXI.pdf |website=www.usfk.mil |accessdate=10 June 2019 |date=9 July 1966}}</ref> The presence of U.S. military troops, under the Mutual Defense Treaty, were the product of high kijich'on prostitution rates.{{sfn|Moon|2006|p=29}}\n\n=== Nixon Doctrine ===\nIn 1969, the Nixon Doctrine declared the need to reduce the United States' military involvement from Asia. This resulted in 20,000 U.S. servicemen being removed from South Korea and the formal withdrawal of American GIs from the DMZ.{{sfn|Moon|2006|p=59}} Due to the economic dependence on the U.S. military's presence for jobs and income, prostitution decreased but competition significantly heightened among clubs, other businesses, and sex workers. Newspapers reported the significant economic losses and the widespread dislocation that occurred after the removal of U.S. troops. It was publicized that some establishments went from making $200 to $300 per night to a profit of $4 to $5.{{sfn|Moon|2006|pp=68-69}} Many who lived near U.S. bases needed to relocate to more concentrated areas while others found work in different industries. The removal of U.S. troops under the Nixon Doctrine caused an increase in camptown problems and great resentment towards the United States.\n\n== Kijich'on (Military Camptown) ==\nThe large army [[Kijich'on|camptowns]] are mainly located near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which is between North and South Korea.{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=7}} The most popular camp towns are P\u2019yLngt\u2019aek, P\u2019aju, Tongduch\u2019Ln, and OijLngbu which have developed near main U.S. army bases.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|last=Lee|first=Na Young|date=2006|title=The Construction of U.S. Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Trans/Formation and Resistance|url=https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/4162/umi-umd-3959.pdf;sequence=1|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Kijich\u2019on towns are neighbored to U.S. military camp bases and contain a combination of American and Korean residents.{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=17}} These towns consist of businesses and entertainment that serve the interests of U.S. military men.

Stallone co-wrote the screenplays of all five films, and directed ''Rambo''.\n\nThe film series has grossed $819 million in total, with the most successful film, ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', grossing $300 million.\n\nIn addition to films, the franchise also spawned an animated television series and a series of comic books, novels, video games and a [[Bollywood]] remake..bx 2nd xbnfryxfxhxhxuxmxzy jcjcc Hf et jexxdztxn\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"  style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director(s)\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriter(s)<!--Do not change the way writers are credit.

In December 1981, Rambo travels to a small town in Washington (actually Hope, British Columbia, Canada), in search of a fellow U.S. Army [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] buddy. He learns that his friend died from cancer the previous summer due to exposure to [[Agent Orange]].\n\nHe attempts to find a diner in town, and maybe a temporary job. The overconfident town sheriff Will Teasle ([[Brian Dennehy]]) does not welcome Rambo, judging the military hero negatively because of his long hair and scruffy look. Rambo disobeys the sheriff's order to stay away from town, as he has done nothing wrong and believes such banishment to be a violation of his freedom of movement, and most of all he is hungry. Rambo returns to town soon afterwards and is promptly charged with vagrancy and subject to harassment from the deputies.\n\nThe harassment triggers flashbacks of Rambo's memories of his torture at the hands of the North Vietnamese when he was a prisoner of war. Rambo fights his way out of the sheriff's department with his bare hands and makes his way into the wilderness. A manhunt ensues, with the sheriff and his deputies all badly wounded. Rambo chooses not to kill any of them, but unintentionally kills a police officer in self-defense by throwing a rock at a helicopter, causing the pilot to lose control and an officer to fall out. The State Police and National Guard are called in.\n\nColonel Samuel Trautman ([[Richard Crenna]]), Rambo's former commanding officer, arrives. He suggests giving Rambo a chance to escape; if Rambo is allowed to slip away, he'll be given time to calm down and he can be arrested without incident. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo through a stolen police radio, but Rambo refuses to surrender, stating that \"They (the deputies) drew first blood not me\" and then hangs up.\n\nThe authorities reject Trautman's recommendation for a wait-and-see attitude and continue the manhunt, and Rambo's subsequent rampage culminates in him returning to town with guns and bombs from a commandeered Army truck. This results in the destruction of the sheriff's office and more of the town's main street. Rambo stands poised to eliminate the sheriff, but Trautman finally confronts Rambo face-to-face, and ultimately convinces his former soldier to surrender to the authorities.\n\nBetween the first and second films, Rambo is convicted and remanded to a civilian maximum-security prison where hard labor is the norm. Despite being a convict, the rigid routine and discipline of prison life provides Rambo with some measure of much-needed stability, as it reminds him of his past in the military and its own rigid hierarchy.\n\n===''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' (1985)===\n{{Main|Rambo: First Blood Part II}}\nThe film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) offering Rambo his freedom if Rambo will return to Vietnam to search for American prisoners of war remaining in Vietnamese captivity. Marshall Murdock ([[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]]), the official in charge of the mission, is portrayed as a corrupt political figure who doesn't want to expose the truth. Rambo is not to engage the enemy and instead is ordered to take photographs of a North Vietnamese camp, the same camp he himself had been held prisoner in, to prove to the American public there are no more POWs in Vietnam, although Murdock knows that there are.\n\nRambo is flown into the country with the purpose of parachuting into the jungle, but a malfunction during his exit from the plane causes him to have to cut away much of his equipment. He then meets his in-country contact, anti-communist Vietnamese rebel Co Bao ([[Julia Nickson]]), who is serving as an intelligence agent. Rambo discovers that there are POWs being held in the camp where he was dropped and that POWs were rotated between camps. Rambo breaks one POW out of the camp and attempts to escape, only to be abandoned at the moment of a pick up by helicopter on a hilltop on the orders of Murdock, after which both he and the POW are recaptured by the Vietnamese soldiers. Rambo is immobilized in a pit of sewage and leeches, then tortured by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldiers, who are allied with the Vietnamese and training Vietnamese soldiers. Co enters the base under the guise of a prostitute for hire, where she aids Rambo in escaping. After Rambo expresses his deepest gratitude for his rescue, the two share a kiss, after Co implores him to take her back to America with him. As they prepare to move on, Co is shot by surprise gunfire.\n\nEnraged, Rambo then acts on his own initiative and starts a one-man war, hunting the Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers searching for him in the jungle and stealing a Soviet-captured helicopter. He flies the helicopter back to the camp, destroying it and killing the remaining Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers in the camp. He frees all the POWs and is pursued by a Soviet Mi-24 Hind helicopter. After destroying the Hind with an RPG, he returns to the US base in Thailand with all the POWs. Rambo is enraged at how the United States government has ignored the existence of surviving soldiers being held captive, and grabs an M-60 machine gun and proceeds into the headquarters building, destroying all of the electronic gear within. Rambo then threatens Murdock and tells him to be forthright with the American public regarding the truth of the POWs and to spare no expense in rescuing them all, or else he will return for Murdock. When Trautman says Rambo will be honored once again, he declines, saying the POWs deserve the accolades more. For his actions in Vietnam, Rambo is granted a [[presidential pardon]] and decides to remain in Thailand.\n\nBetween the second and third films, Rambo takes up residence near a monastery where he engages in frequent meditation to find a sense of inner peace. Although Rambo believes his soldiering days are apparently over, he does not become a complete pacifist, as he often participates in violent stick-fighting matches and donates his winnings to the monks to help renovate the monastery.\n\n===''Rambo III'' (1988)===\n{{Main|Rambo III}}\n[[File:\u05e1\u05d9\u05dc\u05d1\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8 \u05e1\u05d8\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4.jpg|thumb|upright|Stallone in ''[[Rambo III]]'']]\nThe film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) returning to [[Thailand]] to once again enlist Rambo's help. After witnessing Rambo's victory in a stick-fighting match, Trautman visits the temple Rambo is helping to build and asks him to join him on a mission to [[Afghanistan]]. This brings Rambo into the realm of the [[CIA]]'s [[Special Activities Division]] which primarily hires Army Special Forces soldiers. The mission is meant to supply weapons, including [[FIM-92 Stinger]] missiles, to Afghan freedom fighters, the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|Mujahideen]], who are fighting the Soviets. Despite having been shown photos of civilians suffering under Soviet rule, Rambo refuses and Trautman chooses to go on his own.\n\nWhile in Afghanistan, Trautman's troops are ambushed by Soviet troops while passing through the mountains at night. Trautman is imprisoned in a Soviet base and tortured for information by commanding officer Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) and his henchman Kourov (Randy Raney). Rambo learns of the incident from embassy field officer Robert Griggs ([[Kurtwood Smith]]) and immediately flies to Pakistan where he meets up with Mousa (Sasson Gabai), a weapons supplier who agrees to take him to a village deep in the Afghan desert, close to the Soviet base where Trautman is kept. The Mujahideen in the village are already hesitant to help Rambo in the first place, but are convinced not to help him when their village is attacked by Soviet helicopters after one of Mousa's shop assistants informed the Russians of Rambo's presence. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid (Doudi Shoua), Rambo makes his way to the Soviet base and starts his attempts to free Trautman. The first attempt is unsuccessful and results in Hamid getting shot in the leg, and Rambo himself getting hit by wooden shrapnel. After escaping from the base, Rambo tends to Hamid's wounds and sends him and Mousa away to safety.\n\nThe next day, Rambo returns to the base once again, just in time to rescue Trautman from being tortured with a flamethrower.  After rescuing several other prisoners, Rambo steals a helicopter and escapes from the base. The helicopter crashes and Rambo and Trautman are forced to continue on foot. After a confrontation in a cave, where Rambo and Trautman kill several Russian soldiers including Kourov, they are confronted by an entire army of Russian tanks, headed by Zaysen. Just as they are about to be overwhelmed by the might of the Soviet Army, the Mujahideen warriors, together with Mousa and Hamid, ride onto the battlefield in a cavalry charge, overwhelming the Russians despite their numerical and technological superiority. In the ensuing battle, in which both Trautman and Rambo are wounded, Rambo manages to kill Zaysen by driving a tank into the helicopter in which Zaysen is flying.\n\nAt the end of the battle Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to their Mujahideen friends and leave Afghanistan to go home.\n\nBetween the third and four films, Rambo still lives in Thailand, making a meager living as a snake catcher and by providing boat rides.\n\n===''Rambo'' (2008)===\n{{Main|Rambo (2008 film)}} \nThe film opens with news footage of the [[Saffron Revolution|crisis in Burma]]. Burma (also known as Myanmar) is under the iron fist rule of [[Than Shwe]] and takes harsher stances against the nation's pro-democracy movement. Rebels are thrown into a mine-infested marsh and then gunned down by a Burmese army unit, overseen by Major Pa Tee Tint.\n\nFormer U.S. soldier John Rambo still lives in [[Thailand]], now residing in a village near the Burmese border and makes a living capturing snakes and selling them in a nearby village. A missionary, Michael Burnett ([[Paul Schulze]]), asks Rambo to take him and his associates down the [[Salween River]] to Burma on a humanitarian mission to help the [[Karen people]]. Rambo initially refuses but is convinced by another missionary in the group, Sarah Miller ([[Julie Benz]]), to take them.\n\nThe boat is stopped by pirates who demand Sarah in exchange for passage. After taking advantage of the pirates' complacency, Rambo kills them all. Although his actions save the missionaries, it greatly disturbs them. Upon arrival, Michael says that they will travel by road and will not need Rambo's help for the return trip. The mission goes well until the Burmese army, led by Major Tint, attacks the village, killing most of the villagers and two missionaries, and capturing the rest. When the missionaries fail to come back after ten days, their pastor, Arthur Marsh ([[Ken Howard]]), comes to Rambo to ask for his help in guiding hired mercenaries to the village where the missionaries were last seen.\n\nTroubled by Sarah's potential fate, Rambo decides to accompany the soldiers. After seeing the destroyed village filled with mutilated humans and animals, the mercenaries spot some soldiers forcing several surviving villagers to run through a minefield. The mercenaries are hesitant to rescue the villagers, but not Rambo, who shoots the soldiers with a bow and arrow. Rambo reminds his colleagues of the rescue mission and encourages the team to move on. Hijacking a truck, they create a plan to save the hostages at the P.O.W. camp, doing so within fifteen minutes to avoid alerting the army. Rambo helps Sarah and the others to escape.\n\nThe [[Myanmar Armed Forces|Burmese Army (Tatmadaw)]] unit finds their hostages missing and organizes a massive manhunt. Everyone except for Rambo, Sarah, and \"School Boy\" ([[Matthew Marsden]]), the mercenary team's sniper, is captured. Just as the group is to be executed, Rambo hijacks a truck-mounted .50-caliber machine gun and engages the Burmese army. A group of [[Karen people|Karen rebels]] joins the fight to help Rambo and the mercenaries defeat the Burmese unit. Seeing that the battle is lost, Major Tint decides to flee, only to run into Rambo's machete, which Rambo then uses to disembowel the Major.\n\nEncouraged by Sarah's words, Rambo returns to the [[United States]]. The last scene shows him walking along a rural highway, past a horse farm and a rusted mailbox with the name \"R. Rambo\" on it. He makes his way down the gravel driveway as the credits roll.\n\n===''Rambo: Last Blood'' (2019)===\n{{main|Rambo: Last Blood}}\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nEleven years [[Rambo (2008 film)|after the events in Burma]], [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Rambo]] lives in [[Bowie, Arizona]] at his deceased father's horse ranch, which he manages with his old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela. Gabriela tells Rambo that a friend of hers, Gizelle, has found Gabriela's biological father, Miguel, in [[Mexico]]. Both Rambo and Maria tell her not to go to Mexico, but Gabriela secretly drives there to ask why Miguel abandoned she and her mother years ago. Gizelle leads Gabriela to Miguel's apartment, where he coldly tells her that he never really cared for Gabriela or her mother.\n \nGizelle takes a heartbroken Gabriela to a nearby club, where Gabriela is drugged and kidnapped by the enforcers of a [[Mexican cartel]]. Meanwhile, Maria informs Rambo of Gabriela's disappearance in Mexico. Rambo rushes to Mexico and interrogates both Miguel and Gizelle about Gabriela's whereabouts. Gizelle reluctantly leads Rambo to the club where Gabriela was last seen and confronts El Flaco, the man who last spoke with Gabriela. A mysterious woman, Carmen Delgado, tails Rambo as El Flaco leads him to Gabriela's location. Rambo is immediately confronted, beaten and marked by the cartel, led by the brothers Hugo and Victor Martinez. They take his driver's license with the location of Rambo's ranch and a photo of Gabriela, whom Victor recognizes. The cartel vow to mistreat Gabriela further due to Rambo's actions.\n\nCarmen takes Rambo back to her home where she cares for him until he fully recovers after four days. While Rambo is cared for by Carmen, Gabriela is stripped and consistently dosed with heroin and sold to be raped repeatedly. Carmen says she is an [[Freelancer|independent]] journalist who has been investigating the Martinez brothers, who kidnapped and murdered her sister. Rambo later raids one of the brothels, killing several men until he finds a drugged Gabriela. While driving back home in his pickup, Rambo thanks Gabriela for giving him hope for ten years but she dies from the forced overdose. An enraged Rambo sends Maria away and rigs the ranch with traps for a confrontation, and later returns to Mexico to ask Carmen's help in finding Victor. Carmen initially refuses and tells Rambo that it will solve nothing, but is convinced after he appeals to her grief and frustration.\n\nRambo raids Victor's home, killing several guards and decapitating Victor. In retaliation, Hugo leads a group of hitmen to Rambo's ranch, where each falls victim to the rigged traps. Saving Hugo for the last, Rambo mutilates him and rips his heart out, killing him instantly. In the aftermath, a weakened Rambo sits on the porch of his father's house, vowing to continue fighting and keep the memories of his loved ones alive. During the credits, flashbacks to scenes from the first four movies in the franchise are shown, with Rambo finally saddling up his horse and riding off into the sunset.\n\n==Future==\nDuring Cannes 2019, Stallone said he would continue portraying Rambo if the fifth film succeeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/stallone-would-return-as-rambo-if-last-blood-is-a-hit|title= Stallone happy to return as Rambo if Last Blood is a hit|first=Mike|last=Sprague|date=June 12, 2019|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> Grunberg, however, said that ''Rambo: Last Blood'' \"closes the circle\", hoping it would conclude the film series.<ref name=\"Total Film\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/rambo-5-last-blood-director-adrian-grunberg-interview/|title= Exclusive: Rambo: Last Blood director discusses bringing back Sylvester Stallone's action hero: \"This movie closes the circle\"|author=Jack Shepherd, James Mottram|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2019, Stallone confirmed that he has plans for a prequel to the series; although he would not reprise the title role, he would like to explore who Rambo was before the war: {{blockquote|I always thought of Rambo when he was 16 or 17\u2014I hope they can do the prequel\u2014he was the best person you could find.

The music from the first and second films was performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the music from the third by the Hungarian State Opera Orchestra. Goldsmith's main theme for ''Rambo'' was the basis for the end title song \"It's a Long Road\", performed by [[Dan Hill]], part of the ''First Blood'' soundtrack.\n\nThe music for the first film is harsher and more dissonant than that for the sequels, as is keeping with the tone of the film. As such, it bears more of a resemblance to Goldsmith's output of the 1960s and 1970s than it does most of his work in the 1980s. The first film's score does use electronics but is primarily orchestral while the sequel scores incorporate heavier use of electronics. The second film's score is the most popular, being that it is the most exciting. The music in the third film is an extension of the style used in the second, but with a few new themes. Both sequels feature new themes for Rambo that are based on elements found in the original \"It's a Long Road\" theme, which is also heard in its original form in each film as well.\n\nBecause Goldsmith died in 2004, film composer [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]] (''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'') scored the fourth film. He reassured fans at the time of Goldsmith's death that his score would be based on Goldsmith's cues for the first three films.\n\nThe 2008 film, ''Rambo'', was advertised with [[Drowning Pool]]'s \"[[Bodies (Drowning Pool song)|Bodies]]\" and features two songs in the film written and performed by [[Jake La Botz]], who portrays the mercenary \"Reese\" in the film.\n\nThe theme music for 1986 animated TV series, ''Rambo: The Force of Freedom'' came from a Jerry Goldsmith's scores for ''First Blood'' and ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' were licensed for use in the series and tracked throughout (mostly from ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''), with his music for the film's trailer for ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', used as the opening and closing themes. It was supplemented by original music composed by [[Haim Saban]] and [[Shuki Levy]], who received an \"additional music by\" credit.\n\nSoundtracks with music from the films were also released. The soundtracks for ''First Blood'', ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', ''Rambo'' and ''Rambo: Last Blood'' are available on [[iTunes]]. However, the soundtrack for ''Rambo III'' is not available on iTunes. For more on the music of the ''Rambo'' franchise, see the \"Music\" section below.\n\n==Home media==\nAll five existing films in the ''Rambo'' franchise are available from [[Lionsgate]] by virtue of the studio's output deal with [[StudioCanal]] (the company that currently holds the underlying rights to the first three films) and Lionsgate itself co-producing the latter film (in partnership with [[The Weinstein Company]]). [[Paramount Pictures]] (via [[Trifecta Entertainment and Media]]) holds the television rights to the first three films, while [[Debmar-Mercury]] handles television distribution for the latter film on behalf of parent company Lionsgate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Morrell has said that he wrote the novelizations because he wanted to include characterization that he felt wasn't in ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' and ''Rambo III''. Morrell did not write a novelization for the 2008 film, ''Rambo'', as he felt the film's characterization matched that of the original ''First Blood'' novel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Comic books===\nIn 1986 an Italian series of comic books inspired by Rambo was published, ''Rambo Adventures'' by Giorgio Pedrazzi.\n\nIn the late 1980s, [[Blackthorne Publishing]] published a few comics starring the character.

In December 1981, Rambo travels to a small town in Washington (actually Hope, British Columbia, Canada), in search of a fellow U.S. Army [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] buddy. He learns that his friend died from cancer the previous summer due to exposure to [[Agent Orange]].\n\nHe attempts to find a diner in town, and maybe a temporary job. The overconfident town sheriff Will Teasle ([[Brian Dennehy]]) does not welcome Rambo, judging the military hero negatively because of his long hair and scruffy look. Rambo disobeys the sheriff's order to stay away from town, as he has done nothing wrong and believes such banishment to be a violation of his freedom of movement, and most of all he is hungry. Rambo returns to town soon afterwards and is promptly charged with vagrancy and subject to harassment from the deputies.\n\nThe harassment triggers flashbacks of Rambo's memories of his torture at the hands of the North Vietnamese when he was a prisoner of war. Rambo fights his way out of the sheriff's department with his bare hands and makes his way into the wilderness. A manhunt ensues, with the sheriff and his deputies all badly wounded. Rambo chooses not to kill any of them, but unintentionally kills a police officer in self-defense by throwing a rock at a helicopter, causing the pilot to lose control and an officer to fall out. The State Police and National Guard are called in.\n\nColonel Samuel Trautman ([[Richard Crenna]]), Rambo's former commanding officer, arrives. He suggests giving Rambo a chance to escape; if Rambo is allowed to slip away, he'll be given time to calm down and he can be arrested without incident. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo through a stolen police radio, but Rambo refuses to surrender, stating that \"They (the deputies) drew first blood not me\" and then hangs up.\n\nThe authorities reject Trautman's recommendation for a wait-and-see attitude and continue the manhunt, and Rambo's subsequent rampage culminates in him returning to town with guns and bombs from a commandeered Army truck. This results in the destruction of the sheriff's office and more of the town's main street. Rambo stands poised to eliminate the sheriff, but Trautman finally confronts Rambo face-to-face, and ultimately convinces his former soldier to surrender to the authorities.\n\nBetween the first and second films, Rambo is convicted and remanded to a civilian maximum-security prison where hard labor is the norm. Despite being a convict, the rigid routine and discipline of prison life provides Rambo with some measure of much-needed stability, as it reminds him of his past in the military and its own rigid hierarchy.\n\n===''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' (1985)===\n{{Main|Rambo: First Blood Part II}}\nThe film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) offering Rambo his freedom if Rambo will return to Vietnam to search for American prisoners of war remaining in Vietnamese captivity. Marshall Murdock ([[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]]), the official in charge of the mission, is portrayed as a corrupt political figure who doesn't want to expose the truth. Rambo is not to engage the enemy and instead is ordered to take photographs of a North Vietnamese camp, the same camp he himself had been held prisoner in, to prove to the American public there are no more POWs in Vietnam, although Murdock knows that there are.\n\nRambo is flown into the country with the purpose of parachuting into the jungle, but a malfunction during his exit from the plane causes him to have to cut away much of his equipment. He then meets his in-country contact, anti-communist Vietnamese rebel Co Bao ([[Julia Nickson]]), who is serving as an intelligence agent. Rambo discovers that there are POWs being held in the camp where he was dropped and that POWs were rotated between camps. Rambo breaks one POW out of the camp and attempts to escape, only to be abandoned at the moment of a pick up by helicopter on a hilltop on the orders of Murdock, after which both he and the POW are recaptured by the Vietnamese soldiers. Rambo is immobilized in a pit of sewage and leeches, then tortured by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] soldiers, who are allied with the Vietnamese and training Vietnamese soldiers. Co enters the base under the guise of a prostitute for hire, where she aids Rambo in escaping. After Rambo expresses his deepest gratitude for his rescue, the two share a kiss, after Co implores him to take her back to America with him. As they prepare to move on, Co is shot by surprise gunfire.\n\nEnraged, Rambo then acts on his own initiative and starts a one-man war, hunting the Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers searching for him in the jungle and stealing a Soviet-captured helicopter. He flies the helicopter back to the camp, destroying it and killing the remaining Vietnamese and Soviet soldiers in the camp. He frees all the POWs and is pursued by a Soviet Mi-24 Hind helicopter. After destroying the Hind with an RPG, he returns to the US base in Thailand with all the POWs. Rambo is enraged at how the United States government has ignored the existence of surviving soldiers being held captive, and grabs an M-60 machine gun and proceeds into the headquarters building, destroying all of the electronic gear within. Rambo then threatens Murdock and tells him to be forthright with the American public regarding the truth of the POWs and to spare no expense in rescuing them all, or else he will return for Murdock. When Trautman says Rambo will be honored once again, he declines, saying the POWs deserve the accolades more. For his actions in Vietnam, Rambo is granted a [[presidential pardon]] and decides to remain in Thailand.\n\nBetween the second and third films, Rambo takes up residence near a monastery where he engages in frequent meditation to find a sense of inner peace. Although Rambo believes his soldiering days are apparently over, he does not become a complete pacifist, as he often participates in violent stick-fighting matches and donates his winnings to the monks to help renovate the monastery.\n\n===''Rambo III'' (1988)===\n{{Main|Rambo III}}\n[[File:\u05e1\u05d9\u05dc\u05d1\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8 \u05e1\u05d8\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4.jpg|thumb|upright|Stallone in ''[[Rambo III]]'']]\nThe film opens with Colonel Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) returning to [[Thailand]] to once again enlist Rambo's help. After witnessing Rambo's victory in a stick-fighting match, Trautman visits the temple Rambo is helping to build and asks him to join him on a mission to [[Afghanistan]]. This brings Rambo into the realm of the [[CIA]]'s [[Special Activities Division]] which primarily hires Army Special Forces soldiers. The mission is meant to supply weapons, including [[FIM-92 Stinger]] missiles, to Afghan freedom fighters, the [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|Mujahideen]], who are fighting the Soviets. Despite having been shown photos of civilians suffering under Soviet rule, Rambo refuses and Trautman chooses to go on his own.\n\nWhile in Afghanistan, Trautman's troops are ambushed by Soviet troops while passing through the mountains at night. Trautman is imprisoned in a Soviet base and tortured for information by commanding officer Zaysen (Marc de Jonge) and his henchman Kourov (Randy Raney). Rambo learns of the incident from embassy field officer Robert Griggs ([[Kurtwood Smith]]) and immediately flies to Pakistan where he meets up with Mousa (Sasson Gabai), a weapons supplier who agrees to take him to a village deep in the Afghan desert, close to the Soviet base where Trautman is kept. The Mujahideen in the village are already hesitant to help Rambo in the first place, but are convinced not to help him when their village is attacked by Soviet helicopters after one of Mousa's shop assistants informed the Russians of Rambo's presence. Aided only by Mousa and a young boy named Hamid (Doudi Shoua), Rambo makes his way to the Soviet base and starts his attempts to free Trautman. The first attempt is unsuccessful and results in Hamid getting shot in the leg, and Rambo himself getting hit by wooden shrapnel. After escaping from the base, Rambo tends to Hamid's wounds and sends him and Mousa away to safety.\n\nThe next day, Rambo returns to the base once again, just in time to rescue Trautman from being tortured with a flamethrower.  After rescuing several other prisoners, Rambo steals a helicopter and escapes from the base. The helicopter crashes and Rambo and Trautman are forced to continue on foot. After a confrontation in a cave, where Rambo and Trautman kill several Russian soldiers including Kourov, they are confronted by an entire army of Russian tanks, headed by Zaysen. Just as they are about to be overwhelmed by the might of the Soviet Army, the Mujahideen warriors, together with Mousa and Hamid, ride onto the battlefield in a cavalry charge, overwhelming the Russians despite their numerical and technological superiority. In the ensuing battle, in which both Trautman and Rambo are wounded, Rambo manages to kill Zaysen by driving a tank into the helicopter in which Zaysen is flying.\n\nAt the end of the battle Rambo and Trautman say goodbye to their Mujahideen friends and leave Afghanistan to go home.\n\nBetween the third and four films, Rambo still lives in Thailand, making a meager living as a snake catcher and by providing boat rides.\n\n===''Rambo'' (2008)===\n{{Main|Rambo (2008 film)}} \nThe film opens with news footage of the [[Saffron Revolution|crisis in Burma]]. Burma (also known as Myanmar) is under the iron fist rule of [[Than Shwe]] and takes harsher stances against the nation's pro-democracy movement. Rebels are thrown into a mine-infested marsh and then gunned down by a Burmese army unit, overseen by Major Pa Tee Tint.\n\nFormer U.S. soldier John Rambo still lives in [[Thailand]], now residing in a village near the Burmese border and makes a living capturing snakes and selling them in a nearby village. A missionary, Michael Burnett ([[Paul Schulze]]), asks Rambo to take him and his associates down the [[Salween River]] to Burma on a humanitarian mission to help the [[Karen people]]. Rambo initially refuses but is convinced by another missionary in the group, Sarah Miller ([[Julie Benz]]), to take them.\n\nThe boat is stopped by pirates who demand Sarah in exchange for passage. After taking advantage of the pirates' complacency, Rambo kills them all. Although his actions save the missionaries, it greatly disturbs them. Upon arrival, Michael says that they will travel by road and will not need Rambo's help for the return trip. The mission goes well until the Burmese army, led by Major Tint, attacks the village, killing most of the villagers and two missionaries, and capturing the rest. When the missionaries fail to come back after ten days, their pastor, Arthur Marsh ([[Ken Howard]]), comes to Rambo to ask for his help in guiding hired mercenaries to the village where the missionaries were last seen.\n\nTroubled by Sarah's potential fate, Rambo decides to accompany the soldiers. After seeing the destroyed village filled with mutilated humans and animals, the mercenaries spot some soldiers forcing several surviving villagers to run through a minefield. The mercenaries are hesitant to rescue the villagers, but not Rambo, who shoots the soldiers with a bow and arrow. Rambo reminds his colleagues of the rescue mission and encourages the team to move on. Hijacking a truck, they create a plan to save the hostages at the P.O.W. camp, doing so within fifteen minutes to avoid alerting the army. Rambo helps Sarah and the others to escape.\n\nThe [[Myanmar Armed Forces|Burmese Army (Tatmadaw)]] unit finds their hostages missing and organizes a massive manhunt. Everyone except for Rambo, Sarah, and \"School Boy\" ([[Matthew Marsden]]), the mercenary team's sniper, is captured. Just as the group is to be executed, Rambo hijacks a truck-mounted .50-caliber machine gun and engages the Burmese army. A group of [[Karen people|Karen rebels]] joins the fight to help Rambo and the mercenaries defeat the Burmese unit. Seeing that the battle is lost, Major Tint decides to flee, only to run into Rambo's machete, which Rambo then uses to disembowel the Major.\n\nEncouraged by Sarah's words, Rambo returns to the [[United States]]. The last scene shows him walking along a rural highway, past a horse farm and a rusted mailbox with the name \"R. Rambo\" on it. He makes his way down the gravel driveway as the credits roll.\n\n===''Rambo: Last Blood'' (2019)===\n{{main|Rambo: Last Blood}}\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nEleven years [[Rambo (2008 film)|after the events in Burma]], [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Rambo]] lives in [[Bowie, Arizona]] at his deceased father's horse ranch, which he manages with his old friend, Maria Beltran, and her granddaughter, Gabriela. Gabriela tells Rambo that a friend of hers, Gizelle, has found Gabriela's biological father, Miguel, in [[Mexico]]. Both Rambo and Maria tell her not to go to Mexico, but Gabriela secretly drives there to ask why Miguel abandoned she and her mother years ago. Gizelle leads Gabriela to Miguel's apartment, where he coldly tells her that he never really cared for Gabriela or her mother.\n \nGizelle takes a heartbroken Gabriela to a nearby club, where Gabriela is drugged and kidnapped by the enforcers of a [[Mexican cartel]]. Meanwhile, Maria informs Rambo of Gabriela's disappearance in Mexico. Rambo rushes to Mexico and interrogates both Miguel and Gizelle about Gabriela's whereabouts. Gizelle reluctantly leads Rambo to the club where Gabriela was last seen and confronts El Flaco, the man who last spoke with Gabriela. A mysterious woman, Carmen Delgado, tails Rambo as El Flaco leads him to Gabriela's location. Rambo is immediately confronted, beaten and marked by the cartel, led by the brothers Hugo and Victor Martinez. They take his driver's license with the location of Rambo's ranch and a photo of Gabriela, whom Victor recognizes. The cartel vow to mistreat Gabriela further due to Rambo's actions.\n\nCarmen takes Rambo back to her home where she cares for him until he fully recovers after four days. While Rambo is cared for by Carmen, Gabriela is stripped and consistently dosed with heroin and sold to be raped repeatedly. Carmen says she is an [[Freelancer|independent]] journalist who has been investigating the Martinez brothers, who kidnapped and murdered her sister. Rambo later raids one of the brothels, killing several men until he finds a drugged Gabriela. While driving back home in his pickup, Rambo thanks Gabriela for giving him hope for ten years but she dies from the forced overdose. An enraged Rambo sends Maria away and rigs the ranch with traps for a confrontation, and later returns to Mexico to ask Carmen's help in finding Victor. Carmen initially refuses and tells Rambo that it will solve nothing, but is convinced after he appeals to her grief and frustration.\n\nRambo raids Victor's home, killing several guards and decapitating Victor. In retaliation, Hugo leads a group of hitmen to Rambo's ranch, where each falls victim to the rigged traps. Saving Hugo for the last, Rambo mutilates him and rips his heart out, killing him instantly. In the aftermath, a weakened Rambo sits on the porch of his father's house, vowing to continue fighting and keep the memories of his loved ones alive. During the credits, flashbacks to scenes from the first four movies in the franchise are shown, with Rambo finally saddling up his horse and riding off into the sunset.\n\n==Future==\nDuring Cannes 2019, Stallone said he would continue portraying Rambo if the fifth film succeeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/stallone-would-return-as-rambo-if-last-blood-is-a-hit|title= Stallone happy to return as Rambo if Last Blood is a hit|first=Mike|last=Sprague|date=June 12, 2019|publisher=[[JoBlo.com]]|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> Grunberg, however, said that ''Rambo: Last Blood'' \"closes the circle\", hoping it would conclude the film series.<ref name=\"Total Film\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/rambo-5-last-blood-director-adrian-grunberg-interview/|title= Exclusive: Rambo: Last Blood director discusses bringing back Sylvester Stallone's action hero: \"This movie closes the circle\"|author=Jack Shepherd, James Mottram|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=July 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In September 2019, Stallone confirmed that he has plans for a prequel to the series; although he would not reprise the title role, he would like to explore who Rambo was before the war: {{blockquote|I always thought of Rambo when he was 16 or 17\u2014I hope they can do the prequel\u2014he was the best person you could find.

The music from the first and second films was performed by the [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the music from the third by the Hungarian State Opera Orchestra. Goldsmith's main theme for ''Rambo'' was the basis for the end title song \"It's a Long Road\", performed by [[Dan Hill]], part of the ''First Blood'' soundtrack.\n\nThe music for the first film is harsher and more dissonant than that for the sequels, as is keeping with the tone of the film. As such, it bears more of a resemblance to Goldsmith's output of the 1960s and 1970s than it does most of his work in the 1980s. The first film's score does use electronics but is primarily orchestral while the sequel scores incorporate heavier use of electronics. The second film's score is the most popular, being that it is the most exciting. The music in the third film is an extension of the style used in the second, but with a few new themes. Both sequels feature new themes for Rambo that are based on elements found in the original \"It's a Long Road\" theme, which is also heard in its original form in each film as well.\n\nBecause Goldsmith died in 2004, film composer [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]] (''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]'' and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'') scored the fourth film. He reassured fans at the time of Goldsmith's death that his score would be based on Goldsmith's cues for the first three films.\n\nThe 2008 film, ''Rambo'', was advertised with [[Drowning Pool]]'s \"[[Bodies (Drowning Pool song)|Bodies]]\" and features two songs in the film written and performed by [[Jake La Botz]], who portrays the mercenary \"Reese\" in the film.\n\nThe theme music for 1986 animated TV series, ''Rambo: The Force of Freedom'' came from a Jerry Goldsmith's scores for ''First Blood'' and ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' were licensed for use in the series and tracked throughout (mostly from ''Rambo: First Blood Part II''), with his music for the film's trailer for ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', used as the opening and closing themes. It was supplemented by original music composed by [[Haim Saban]] and [[Shuki Levy]], who received an \"additional music by\" credit.\n\nSoundtracks with music from the films were also released. The soundtracks for ''First Blood'', ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'', ''Rambo'' and ''Rambo: Last Blood'' are available on [[iTunes]]. However, the soundtrack for ''Rambo III'' is not available on iTunes. For more on the music of the ''Rambo'' franchise, see the \"Music\" section below.\n\n==Home media==\nAll five existing films in the ''Rambo'' franchise are available from [[Lionsgate]] by virtue of the studio's output deal with [[StudioCanal]] (the company that currently holds the underlying rights to the first three films) and Lionsgate itself co-producing the latter film (in partnership with [[The Weinstein Company]]). [[Paramount Pictures]] (via [[Trifecta Entertainment and Media]]) holds the television rights to the first three films, while [[Debmar-Mercury]] handles television distribution for the latter film on behalf of parent company Lionsgate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Morrell has said that he wrote the novelizations because he wanted to include characterization that he felt wasn't in ''Rambo: First Blood Part II'' and ''Rambo III''. Morrell did not write a novelization for the 2008 film, ''Rambo'', as he felt the film's characterization matched that of the original ''First Blood'' novel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Comic books===\nIn 1986 an Italian series of comic books inspired by Rambo was published, ''Rambo Adventures'' by Giorgio Pedrazzi.\n\nIn the late 1980s, [[Blackthorne Publishing]] published a few comics starring the character.
