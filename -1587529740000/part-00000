Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with [[historical astronomy]], the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the [[history of astronomy]], which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.\n[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|The sunset at the [[equinox]] seen from the prehistoric site of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina|Fondachelli Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]\nArchaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers.<ref>Iwaniszewski 2003, 7\u201310</ref> Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in [[landscape archaeology]] and [[cognitive archaeology]]. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into [[Paganism|beliefs about the cycles of nature]], such as [[Maya civilization#Astronomy|Mayan astronomy]] and its relationship with agriculture.<ref>Aveni 1980</ref> Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.<ref>Chiu & Morrison 1980</ref><ref>Magli 2008</ref>\n\nArchaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs.<ref>McCluskey 2005</ref> It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as \"a field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other\".<ref>Carlson 1999</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{quote|In his short history of 'Astro-archaeology' John Michell argued that the status of research into ancient astronomy had improved over the past two centuries, going 'from lunacy to heresy to interesting notion and finally to the gates of orthodoxy.' Nearly two decades later, we can still ask the question: Is archaeoastronomy still waiting at the gates of orthodoxy or has it gotten inside the gates?|Todd Bostwick quoting John Michell<ref>Bostwick 2006:13</ref>}}\n\nTwo hundred years before [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] wrote the above, there were no archaeoastronomers and there were no [[Archaeology#History of archaeology|professional archaeologists]], but there were astronomers and [[Antiquarianism|antiquarians]]. Some of their works are considered precursors of archaeoastronomy; antiquarians interpreted the astronomical orientation of the ruins that dotted the English countryside as [[William Stukeley]] did of [[Stonehenge]] in 1740,<ref>Michell, 2001:9\u201310</ref> while [[John Aubrey]] in 1678<ref>Johnson, 1912:225</ref> and [[Henry Chauncy]] in 1700 sought similar astronomical principles underlying the orientation of churches.<ref>Hoskin, 2001:7</ref>  Late in the nineteenth century astronomers such as [[Richard Proctor]] and [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]] investigated the astronomical orientations of [[Egyptian pyramids|the pyramids]].<ref>Michell, 2001:17\u201318</ref>\n\nThe term ''archaeoastronomy'' was first used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973,<ref>Sinclair 2006:17</ref> but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined. Clive Ruggles<ref>Ruggles 2005:312\u201313</ref> says that [[Heinrich Nissen]], working in the mid-nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf Sinclair<ref>Sinclair 2006:8</ref> says that [[Norman Lockyer]], working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy'. Euan MacKie<ref>Mackie 2006:243</ref> would place the origin even later, stating: \"...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of [[Alexander Thom]] in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s\".\n\n[[Image:Auglish.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Early archaeoastronomers surveyed Megalithic constructs in the British Isles, at sites like [[Auglish]] in [[County Londonderry]], in an attempt to find statistical patterns.]]\nIn the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer [[Gerald Hawkins]], who proposed that [[Stonehenge]] was a [[Neolithic]] computer,<ref>Hawkins 1976</ref> inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed,<ref>Atkinson 1966</ref> but this was not the case for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of [[megalith]]ic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles.<ref>Thom 1988:9\u201310</ref>  Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate [[winter solstice]] site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon [[stone circle]] in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain.<ref name = \"zkuawc\">MacKie 1977</ref> In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence.<ref>Gingerich 2000</ref> Nevertheless, Thom's legacy remains strong, [[Edwin C. Krupp]]<ref>Krupp 1979:18</ref> wrote in 1979, \"Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades.\" His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.<ref>Hicks 1993</ref><ref>Iwaniszewski 1995</ref>\n[[File:Panoramica Uxmal.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|250x250px|It has been proposed that [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sites such as [[Uxmal]] were built in accordance with astronomical alignments.]]\nThe approach in the [[New World]], where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in [[Amerindian]] civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the [[prehistory]] of Europe lacks such as [[ethnography|ethnographies]]<ref>Zeilik 1985</ref><ref>Zeilik 1986</ref> and the historical records of the early [[Colonization of the Americas|colonizers]]. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni,<ref>Milbraith 1999:8</ref><ref>Broda 2000:233</ref> this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak when compared to the statistically led investigations in Europe.<ref>Hoskin 1996</ref>\n\nThis came to a head at a meeting sponsored by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in [[Oxford]] in 1981.<ref>Ruggles 1993:ix</ref> The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes.<ref>Aveni 1982</ref><ref>Heggie 1982</ref> Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research,<ref>Aveni, 1989a:xi\u2013xiii</ref> which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.\n\n== Relations to other disciplines ==\n{{quote|...[O]ne of the most endearing characteristics of archaeoastronomy is its capacity to set academics in different disciplines at loggerheads with each other.|Clive Ruggles<ref>Ruggles 2000</ref>}}\n\nArchaeoastronomy has long been seen as an interdisciplinary field that uses written and unwritten evidence to study the astronomies of other cultures.  As such, it can be seen as connecting other disciplinary approaches for investigating ancient astronomy: astroarchaeology (an obsolete term for studies that draw astronomical information from the alignments of ancient architecture and landscapes), [[history of astronomy]] (which deals primarily with the written textual evidence), and ethnoastronomy (which draws on the ethnohistorical record and contemporary ethnographic studies).<ref>Aveni 1981: 1\u20132</ref><ref>Aveni 2003: 150</ref>\n\nReflecting Archaeoastronomy's development as an interdisciplinary subject, research in the field is conducted by investigators trained in a wide range of disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.<ref>McCluskey 2004</ref>\n\nBoth practicing archaeoastronomers and observers of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy as part of an archaeology informed by [[cultural anthropology]] and aimed at understanding a \"group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology.<ref>Gummerman & Warburton 2005</ref>  Todd Bostwick argued that \"archaeoastronomy is anthropology\u2014the study of human behavior in the past and present.\"<ref>Bostwick 2006:3</ref> [[Paul Bahn]] has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology.<ref>Bahn 1996:49</ref> Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations<ref>McCluskey 2001</ref> or as it relates to the political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques.<ref>Broda 2006</ref><ref>Aldana 2007:14\u201315</ref>  Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing \"the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism\"<ref>Poss 2005:97</ref> Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable [[Precursorism|precursors]] of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.<ref>Schaefer 2006a:30</ref>\n\nThe reactions of professional archaeologists to archaeoastronomy have been decidedly mixed. Some expressed incomprehension or even hostility, varying from a rejection by the archaeological mainstream of what they saw as an archaeoastronomical fringe to an incomprehension between the cultural focus of archaeologists and the quantitative focus of early archaeoastronomers.<ref>Ruggles 1999: 3\u20139</ref>  Yet archaeologists have increasingly come to incorporate many of the insights from archaeoastronomy into archaeology textbooks<ref>Fisher 2006</ref> and, as mentioned above, some students wrote archaeology dissertations on archaeoastronomical topics.\n\nSince archaeoastronomers disagree so widely on the characterization of the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy to the study of culture, using the term ''Astronomy in Culture'' or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees an important part of the discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline ''Archaeotopography.''<ref>Hoskin 2001:13\u201314.</ref> Ruggles and Saunders proposed ''Cultural Astronomy'' as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies.<ref>Ruggles & Saunders 1993:1\u201331</ref> Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are [[cosmology|cosmologies]] and people who object to the use of [[logos]] have suggested adopting the Spanish ''cosmovisi\u00f3n''.<ref>Ruggles 2005:115\u201317</ref>\n\nWhen debates polarise between techniques, the methods are often referred to by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished.<ref name = \"jgswke\">Aveni 1986</ref> Green ([[Old World]]) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice. Brown ([[New World]]) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and have been described as 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis.<ref>Hoskin 2001:2</ref> Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.<ref>Ruggles & Saunders 1993</ref><ref>Iwaniszewski 2001</ref>\n\n== Methodology ==\n{{quote|For a long time I have believed that such diversity requires the invention of some all-embracing theory. I think I was very na\u00efve in thinking that such a thing was ever possible.|Stanislaw Iwaniszewski<ref>Iwaniszewski 2003:7</ref>}}\n\nThere is no one way to do archaeoastronomy. The divisions between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.\n\n===Green archaeoastronomy===\n\nGreen archaeoastronomy is named after the cover of the book ''Archaeoastronomy in the Old World''.<ref>Aveni 1989:1</ref> It is based primarily on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period. The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.\n\nThom wished to examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He believed that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the Sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge on the other side for a '[[double sunset]]'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a [[hypothetical]] site, one the day before the [[summer solstice]] and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.\n\n<center>[[File:Doublesunset.ogg]]</center>\n\nTo test this idea he surveyed hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but he planned to show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing that there was an astronomical intent to the orientation of at least some of the alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two [[solstice]]s, the two [[equinox]]es and four [[cross-quarter day]]s, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar.<ref>Thom 1967: 107\u201317</ref> While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.\n\nEuan MacKie has supported Thom's analysis, to which he added an archaeological context by comparing [[Neolithic Britain]] to the [[Mayan civilization]] to argue for a stratified society in this period.<ref name = \"zkuawc\"/> To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. [[Kintraw]] is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed that this was a foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].<ref>Ruggles 1999:25\u201329</ref> This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at [[Maes Howe]]<ref name=\"MacKie 1997\">MacKie 1997</ref> and on the [[Bush Barrow]] Lozenge<ref>MacKie 2006:362</ref> led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.<ref>MacKie 2009</ref>\n\nIn contrast [[Clive Ruggles]] has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom's surveys.<ref>Ruggles 1999:19\u201329</ref><ref>Ruggles and Barclay 2000: 69\u201370</ref> Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in [[Atmospheric refraction|refraction]] near the horizon.<ref>Schaefer and Liller 1990</ref> A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer ''whether'' there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer ''why'' people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: \"To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn\u2019t inform the current interpretive questions.\"<ref>Kintigh 1992</ref>  Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.<ref>Hoskin 2001</ref>\n\n=== Brown archaeoastronomy ===\n\nIn contrast to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of green archaeoastronomy, brown archaeoastronomy has been identified as being closer to the [[history of astronomy]] or to [[cultural history]], insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual.<ref name = \"jgswke\"/> The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.<ref>Aveni 1989</ref>\n\nOne famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is [[Chichen Itza]]. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet [[Venus]]. This interest is attested to by the [[Dresden codex]] which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky.<ref name = \"mlxqkn\">Kelley and Milone 2005:369\u201370</ref> These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with [[Quetzalcoatl]] or [[Xolotl]].<ref>Kelley and Milone 2005:367\u201368</ref> Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La estrella de Quetzalc\u00f3atl: El planeta Venus en Mesoam\u00e9rica|last=\u0160prajc|first=Ivan|publisher=Editorial Diana|year=1996|isbn=978-968-13-2947-1|location=Mexico City|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chichen Itza Observatory 2 1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|\"El Caracol\" a possible observatory temple at Chichen Itza.]]The Temple of the Warriors bears iconography depicting feathered serpents associated with Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This means that the building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it coincides with the rainy season) may be meaningful.<ref>Milbraith 1988:70\u201371</ref> However, since both the date and the azimuth of this event change continuously, a solar interpretation of this orientation is much more likely.<ref>{{cite book|last1=S\u00e1nchez Nava|first1=Pedro Francisco|last2=\u0160prajc|first2=Ivan|title=Orientaciones astron\u00f3micas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas|date=2015|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|location=Mexico City|isbn=978-607-484-727-7}}</ref>\n\nAveni claims that another building associated with the planet Venus in the form of Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the [[Caracol]].<ref>Aveni 2006:60\u201364</ref> This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star.<ref>Aveni 1979:175\u201383</ref> However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.<ref>Aveni 1997:137\u201338</ref>\n\nAveni states that one of the strengths of the brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the [[Inca]]s as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ''ceques'' radial routes emanating from the capital at [[Cusco]]. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year.<ref>Aveni 1989:5</ref><ref>Bauer and Dearborn 1995</ref> In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the history of astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the [[Han dynasty]], in the second century BC.<ref>Xu ''et al.'' 2000:1\u20137</ref>\n\nA criticism of this method is that it can be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are.<ref>Schaefer 2006a:42\u201348</ref><ref>Schaefer 2006b</ref> Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy.<ref>Iwaniszewski 2003</ref> Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies are more likely to be considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like [[analogy]] and [[homology (anthropology)|homology]] and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda|first1=A. C\u00e9sar|last2=\u0160prajc|first2=Ivan|title=Astronomical significance of architectural orientations in the Maya Lowlands: A statistical approach|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|date=2016|volume=9|pages=191\u2013202|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.07.020}}</ref> and in other parts of Mesoamerica.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=\u0160prajc|first1=Ivan|title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica|journal=Journal of Archaeological Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=197\u2013251|doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z|year=2018}}</ref>\n\n== Source materials ==\n\nBecause archaeoastronomy is about the many and various ways people interacted with the sky, there are a diverse range of sources giving information about astronomical practices.\n\n===Alignments===<!-- This section is linked from [[History of astronomy]] -->\n\nA common source of data for archaeoastronomy is the study of alignments. This is based on the assumption that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.\n\nAn alignment is calculated by measuring the [[azimuth]], the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces<ref>Ruggles, 2005:112\u201313</ref> The azimuth is usually measured using a [[theodolite]] or a [[compass]]. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its [[magnetic declination]] must be taken into account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunton.com/manuals/current/Compasses/Transit.pdf |title=Brunton Pocket Transit Instruction Manual|page=22|accessdate=2008-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304060347/http://www.brunton.com/manuals/current/Compasses/Transit.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-04}}</ref>\n\nA theodolite can be considerably more accurate if used correctly, but it is also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be [[calibration|calibrated]] using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun.<ref>Ruggles 2005:423\u201325</ref> Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a [[clinometer]].\n\n=== Artifacts ===\n\n[[Image:NAMA Machine d'Anticyth\u00e8re 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Antikythera mechanism (main fragment)]]For artifacts such as the [[Nebra skydisk|Sky Disc of Nebra]], alleged to be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos,<ref>Scholsser 2002</ref><ref>Meller 2004</ref> the analysis would be similar to typical [[Archaeology#Post-excavation analysis|post-excavation analysis]] as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.\n\nA more mundane example is the presence of [[astrological symbol]]s found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but [[Carol van Driel-Murray]] has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings.<ref>van Driel-Murray 2002</ref> This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAnother well-known artefact with an astronomical use is the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. In this case analysis of the artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered by the presence of symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.<ref>T. Freeth ''et al.'' 2006</ref>\n\n=== Art and inscriptions ===\n\n[[Image:Fajadadiagram.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Diagram showing the location of the sun daggers on the [[Fajada Butte]] petroglyph on various days]]Art and inscriptions may not be confined to artefacts, but also appear painted or inscribed on an archaeological site. Sometimes inscriptions are helpful enough to give instructions to a site's use. For example, a Greek inscription on a stele (from [[Itanos (city)|Itanos]]) has been translated as:\"Patron set this up for Zeus Epopsios. Winter solstice. Should anyone wish to know: off \u2018the little pig\u2019 and the stele the sun turns.\"<ref>Inscriptiones Creticae III iv 11; Isager and Skydsgaard 1992:163</ref> From Mesoamerica come [[Maya codices|Mayan]] and [[Aztec codices]]. These are folding books made from [[Amatl]], processed tree bark on which are [[glyph]]s in [[Maya script|Mayan]] or [[Aztec script]]. The [[Dresden codex]] contains information regarding the Venus cycle, confirming its importance to the Mayans.<ref name = \"mlxqkn\"/>\n\nMore problematic are those cases where the movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with [[petroglyph]]s.<ref>Williamson 1987:109\u201314</ref> A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of [[Fajada Butte]] at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph.<ref>Sofaer 2008</ref> The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico.<ref>Fountain 2005</ref><ref>Robins & Ewing 1989</ref> It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices.<ref>Preston & Preston 2005: 115\u201318</ref> The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor [[lunar standstill]]s of the moon's 18.6 year cycle.<ref>Science Mag, Sofaer et al. 1979: 126</ref><ref name=\"Cambridge\">Cambridge U, 1982 sofaer et al.: 126</ref> In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon.<ref>Sofaer and Sinclair: 1987. UNM, ABQ</ref> Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.<ref>Sofaer 1998: Lekson Ed, u of utah: 165</ref>\n\nIf no ethnographic nor historical data are found which can support this assertion then acceptance of the idea relies upon whether or not there are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.\n\n=== Ethnographies ===\n\nAs well as the materials left by peoples themselves, there are also the reports of other who have encountered them. The historical records of the [[Conquistadores]] are a rich source of information about the pre-Columbian Americans. [[Ethnography|Ethnographers]] also provide material about many other peoples.\n\nAveni uses the importance of zenith passages as an example of the importance of ethnography. For peoples living between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn there are two days of the year when the noon Sun passes directly overhead and casts no shadow. In parts of Mesoamerica this was considered a significant day as it would herald the arrival of rains, and so play a part in the cycle of agriculture. This knowledge is still considered important amongst Mayan Indians living in Central America today. The ethnographic records suggested to archaeoastronomers that this day may have been important to the ancient Mayans. There are also shafts known as 'zenith tubes' which illuminate subterranean rooms when the Sun passes overhead found at places like [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]]  and [[Xochicalco]]. It is only through the ethnography that we can speculate that the timing of the illumination was considered important in Mayan society.<ref>Aveni 1980:40\u201343</ref> Alignments to the sunrise and sunset on the day of the zenith passage have been claimed to exist at several sites. However, it has been shown that, since there are very few orientations that can be related to these phenomena, they likely have different explanations.<ref>\u0160prajc and S\u00e1nchez 2013</ref>\n\nEthnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At a site in [[Chaco Canyon]] can be found a [[pictograph]] with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers that this is a record of the [[SN 1054|1054 Supernova]].<ref>Brandt and Williamson 1979</ref> However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general<ref>Krupp. et al. 2010: 42</ref> and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The [[Zuni people]], who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.<ref>Ruggles 2005:89</ref>\n\nEthnoastronomy is also an important field outside of the Americas. For example, anthropological work with Aboriginal Australians is producing much information about their [[Aboriginal astronomy|Indigenous astronomies]]<ref>Cairns 2005</ref><ref>Hamacher 2012</ref> and about their interaction with the modern world.<ref>Saethre 2007</ref>\n\n== Recreating the ancient sky ==\n{{quote|...[A]lthough different ways to do science and different scientific results do arise in different cultures, this provides little support for those who would use such differences to question the sciences' ability to provide reliable statements about the world in which we live.|Stephen McCluskey<ref>McCluskey 2005:78</ref>}}\n\nOnce the researcher has data to test, it is often necessary to attempt to recreate ancient sky conditions to place the data in its historical environment.\n\n=== Declination ===\n{{Main|Declination}}\n\nTo calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90\u00b0 if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or \u221290\u00b0 if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole.<ref name = \"byuqqi\">Ruggles 1999:18</ref> The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as ''declination''. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0\u00b0. The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n[[Image:Decdiag600.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Diagram of the visible portions of sky at varying latitudes.]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Solar positioning ===\n\nWhile the stars are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies throughout the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices a bit like a [[pendulum]], slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5\u00b0 then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice.<ref>A.F. Aveni 1997:23\u201327</ref> For more information see [[History of solar observation]].\n\n=== Lunar positioning ===\n\nThe Moon's appearance is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits\u2014known as [[Lunar standstill|''luni''stices]] rather than ''sol''stices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a [[Sidereal month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]] to complete its cycle rather than the year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking the limits of the Moon's movement move on [[Lunar standstill|an 18.6 year cycle]]. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the Moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the ''[[Lunar phase|phase]]'' of the Moon. The cycle from one [[New Moon]] to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the [[Synodic month]].<ref>Ruggles 1999:36\u201337</ref> Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See [[Moon]] for more details.\n\n=== Stellar positioning ===\n{{Main|Precession of the equinoxes}}\n\n[[Image:Earth precession.jpg|thumb|right|Precessional movement.]]Finally there is often a need to correct for the apparent movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a [[spinning top]]. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble.<ref>Ruggles 2005:345\u201347</ref> The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around [[Polaris]] as they do now. In the case of the [[Egyptian pyramids]], it has been shown they were aligned towards [[Thuban]], a faint star in the constellation of [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].<ref>Ruggles 2005:354\u201355</ref> The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the Sun in the constellation [[Capricornus|Capricorn]]. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the Sun in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Transient phenomena ===\n\n[[Image:Bayeux Tapestry scene32 Halley comet.jpg|thumb|left|Halley's Comet depicted on the [[Bayeux tapestry]]]]Additionally there are often transient phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like [[eclipse]]s. In the case of [[solar eclipse]]s these can be used to date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by [[Herodotus]] enables us to date a battle between the [[Medes]] and the [[Lydia]]ns, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herodotus|authorlink=Herodotus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+1.74.1|title=The Histories I.74|accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref> Other easily calculated events are [[supernova]]e whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.\n\nSome [[comet]]s are predictable, most famously [[Halley's Comet]]. Yet as a class of object they remain unpredictable and can appear at any time. Some have extremely lengthy [[orbital period]]s which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. Others may have only ever passed through the [[Solar System]] once and so are inherently unpredictable.<ref>[http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050701_bright_comets.html Predicting the next bright comet], Space.com.</ref>\n\n[[Meteor shower]]s should be predictable, but some [[meteor]]s are cometary debris and so require calculations of orbits which are currently impossible to complete.<ref>Steel 1999</ref> Other events noted by ancients include [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]], [[sun dog]]s and [[rainbow]]s all of which are as impossible to predict as the ancient weather, but nevertheless may have been considered important phenomena.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Major topics of archaeoastronomical research ==\n{{quote|What has astronomy brought into the lives of cultural groups throughout history? The answers are many and varied...|Von Del Chamberlain and M. Jane Young<ref>Chamberlain & Young 2005:xi</ref>}}\n\n=== The use of calendars ===\n\nA common justification for the need for astronomy is the need to develop an accurate [[calendar]] for [[agriculture|agricultural]] reasons. Ancient texts like [[Hesiod]]'s Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to partially confirm this: astronomical observations are used in combination with [[ecology|ecological]] signs, such as [[bird migration]]s to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical studies of the [[Hopi]] of the [[southwestern United States]] indicate that they carefully observed the rising and setting positions of the Sun to determine the proper times to plant crops.<ref>McCluskey 1990</ref> Howerver, ethnoastronomical work with the [[Mursi people|Mursi]] of [[Ethiopia]] shows that their [[luni-solar calendar]] was somewhat haphazard, indicating the limits of astronomical calendars in some societies.<ref>Turton & Ruggles 1978</ref> All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.\n\nAn example of a non-agricultural calendar is the ''[[Tzolk'in]]'' calendar of the [[Maya civilization]] of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], which is a cycle of 260 days. This count is based on an [[260-day Mesoamerican calendar|earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica]]. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of [[Maya calendar]]s which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.<ref>Aveni 1989b</ref>\n\nOther peculiar calendars include ancient [[Hellenic calendar|Greek calendars]]. These were nominally [[Lunar calendar|lunar]], starting with the [[New Moon]]. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ''ton theoi'', by the [[moon]].<ref>McCluskey 2000</ref> The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as [[Panhellenic Games|games]] or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism may have been used as a politically neutral form of timekeeping.<ref>Salt & Boutsikas 2005</ref> Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liritzis | first1 = I | last2 = Vassiliou | first2 = H | date = 2002 | title = Astronomical orientations of ancient temples at Rhodes and Attica with a tentative interpretation | journal = Mediterranean Archaeology & Archaeometry | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 69\u201379 | bibcode = 2002MAA.....2...69L }}</ref><ref>Liritzis.I and Vassiliou.H (2006) Were Greek temples oriented towards aurora?

Saur Munchen, Leipzig) 99, 2, 523\u201334</ref>\n\n=== Myth and cosmology ===\n\n[[Image:Argo Navis Hevelius.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The constellation [[Argo Navis]] drawn by Johannes Hevelius in 1690.]]Another motive for studying the sky is to understand and explain the [[universe]]. In these cultures [[mythology|myth]] was a tool for achieving this and the explanations, while not reflecting the standards of modern [[science]], are [[cosmology|cosmologies]].\n\nThe [[Inca]]s arranged their empire to demonstrate their cosmology. The capital, [[Cusco]], was at the centre of the empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre.<ref>Bauer & Dearborn 1995</ref> These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four ''suyus'', which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the [[Andes]]. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the [[Milky Way]] in the night sky.<ref>Urton 1981</ref> In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a [[perpendicular]] fashion.\n\nThe importance of observing cosmological factors is also seen on the other side of the world. The [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]] is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: [[North]], [[South]], [[East]], [[West]] and [[Centre (geometry)|Centre]]. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing.<ref>Krupp 1997a:196\u201399</ref> One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the [[Circumpolar constellation|circumpolar stars]]. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as [[feng shui]].\n\nThere is also much information about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the [[constellation]]s. The Barasana of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees.<ref>Hoskin 1999:15\u201316</ref> The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.<ref>Hugh-Jones 1982:191\u201393</ref>\n\nA more well-known source of constellation myth are the texts of the Greeks and Romans. The origin of their constellations remains a matter of vigorous and occasionally fractious debate.<ref>Schaefer 2002</ref><ref>Blomberg 2003, esp p. 76</ref>\n\nThe loss of one of the sisters, Merope, in some Greek myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the Pleiades disappeared from view by the naked eye.<ref>[http://www.pleiade.org/pleiades_02.html ''The Pleiades in mythology''], Pleiade Associates, Bristol, United Kingdom, accessed June 7, 2012</ref>\n\n[[Giorgio de Santillana]], professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], along with Hertha von Dechend believed that the old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial [[cosmology]] clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths are representative of the forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate [[astronomy]] that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book ''Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time'' (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the [[precession of the equinoxes]].<ref>Giorgio de Santillana & Hertha von Dechend, ''Hamlet's Mill'', David R Godine: Boston, 1977.</ref> Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.\n\n=== Displays of power ===\n\n[[Image:1st Pylon Karnak Temple.JPG|thumbnail|250px|left|The [[Precinct of Amun-Re]] was aligned on the midwinter solstice.]]\n\nBy including celestial motifs in clothing it becomes possible for the wearer to make claims the power on Earth is drawn from above. It has been said that the Shield of [[Achilles]] described by [[Homer]] is also a catalogue of constellations.<ref>Hannah 1994</ref> In North America shields depicted in [[Comanche]] [[petroglyph]]s appear to include Venus symbolism.<ref>Krupp 1997a:252\u201353</ref>\n\n[[Solstice|Solsticial]] alignments also can be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the [[Isla del Sol|Island of the Sun]] (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in [[Lake Titicaca]], the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the [[Inca]] ruling elite. Ordinary [[Pilgrimage|pilgrims]] stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.<ref>Dearborn, Seddon & Bauer, 1998</ref>\n\nIn Egypt the temple of [[Amun-Re]] at [[Karnak]] has been the subject of much study. Evaluation of the site, taking into account the change over time of the [[obliquity of the ecliptic]] show that the Great Temple was aligned on the rising of the midwinter Sun.<ref>Krupp 1988</ref> The length of the corridor down which sunlight would travel would have limited illumination at other times of the year.\n\nIn a later period the [[Serapeum]] in [[Alexandria]] was also said to have contained a [[Sun|solar]] alignment so that, on a specific sunrise, a shaft of light would pass across the lips of the statue of [[Serapis]] thus symbolising the [[Sun]] saluting the god.<ref>Rufinus</ref>\n\n== Major sites of archaeoastronomical interest ==\n{{Main|List of archaeoastronomical sites sorted by country}}\n\n[[Clive Ruggles]] and [[Michel Cotte]] recently edited a book on heritage sites of astronomy and archaeoastronomy that provides a list of the main sites around the world.<ref>Clive Ruggles and Michel Cotte (ed.), Heritage Sites of Astronomy and Archaeoastronomy.

Instead it enters via a hollow box above the main doorway discovered by Michael O'Kelly.<ref>O'Kelly 1982:123\u201324</ref> It is this roofbox which strongly indicates that the tomb was built with an astronomical aspect in mind. Clive Ruggles notes:{{blockquote|...[F]ew people\u2014archaeologists or astronomers\u2014have doubted that a powerful astronomical symbolism was deliberately incorporated into the monument, demonstrating that a connection between astronomy and funerary ritual, at the very least, merits further investigation.<ref name = \"byuqqi\"/>}}\n\n=== Egypt ===\n[[Image:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|The pyramids of [[Giza]]]]\n\n{{Main|Giza Necropolis}}\n\nSince the first modern measurements of the precise cardinal orientations of the pyramids by [[Flinders Petrie]], various astronomical methods have been proposed for the original establishment of these orientations.<ref>Belmonte 2001</ref><ref>Neugebauer 1980</ref><ref>Magli 2013</ref> It was recently proposed that this was done by observing the positions of two stars in [[Ursa Major|the Plough / Big Dipper]] which was known to Egyptians as the thigh.

Several architectural features have suggested astronomical elements. Each of the stairways built into the sides of the pyramid has 91 steps. Along with the extra one for the platform at the top, this totals 365 steps, which is possibly one for each day of the year (365.25) or the number of lunar orbits in 10,000 rotations (365.01).\n\n[[Image:Serpent head at the base of El Castillo.jpg|left|thumb|Plumed Serpent]]\nA visually striking effect is seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade of the northern stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season.<ref>Krupp 1997a:267\u201369</ref> The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the central axis of Castillo at Tulum.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=\u0160prajc |first1=Ivan |last2=S\u00e1nchez Nava |first2=Pedro Francisco |title=Astronom\u00eda en la arquitectura de Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1: una reevaluaci\u00f3n |journal=Estudios de Cultura Maya |date=2013 |volume=XLI |issue=41 |pages=31\u201360|doi=10.1016/S0185-2574(13)71376-5 }}</ref> The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, and it has been shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=\u0160prajc|first1=I.|title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica|journal=Journal of Archaeological Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=197\u2013251|date=2018|doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Stonehenge ===\n[[Image:Summer Solstice Sunrise over Stonehenge 2005.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Sun rising over [[Stonehenge]] at the 2005 Summer [[Solstice]].]]\n\n{{Main|Archaeoastronomy and Stonehenge}}\n\nMany astronomical alignments have been claimed for Stonehenge, a complex of [[megalith]]s and [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]]s in the [[Salisbury Plain]] of England. The most famous of these is the midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the Sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.<ref>Parker Pearson ''et al.'' 2007</ref>\n\nAs well as solar alignments, there are proposed lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out a rectangle. The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the Moon. Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received.<ref>Aveni 1997:65\u201366</ref> The Heel Stone azimuth is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while summer solstice sunrise azimuth is no longer equal to the construction era direction.{{citation needed | reason=Source for claim was a personal website; citation was removed, and should be replaced with a reliable source. | date=March 2014}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Maeshowe ===\n[[Image:PicMaesEntrance.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The interior of [[Maeshowe]] chambered tomb.]]\n\n{{Main|Maeshowe}}\n\nThis is an architecturally outstanding Neolithic chambered tomb on the mainland of [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]\u2014probably dating to the early 3rd millennium BC, and where the setting Sun at midwinter shines down the entrance passage into the central chamber (see Newgrange). In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment. Several new aspects of the site were discovered. In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island [[Hoy]], about 10 miles away. Secondly, it consists of two straight lengths, angled at a few degrees to each other. Thirdly, the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just to the left of Ward Hill on Hoy.  Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m away and then to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill, just before it dips down to the notch between it at Cuilags to the right. This indicated line points to sunset on the first Sixteenths of the solar year (according to A. Thom) before and after the winter solstice and the notch at the base of the right slope of the Hill is at the same declination. Fourthly a similar 'double sunset' phenomenon is seen at the right end of Cuilags, also on Hoy; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice, at the beginning of November and February respectively\u2014the Old Celtic festivals of [[Samhain]] and [[Imbolc]]. This alignment is not indicated by an artificial structure but gains plausibility from the other two indicated lines.

The palace is aligned with an [[azimuth]] of 118\u00b0 on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius ''et cetera''? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in [[glyph]]s which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations.<ref>Ruggles 2005:163\u201365</ref> Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.<ref>\u0160prajc 2015</ref>\n\n=== Chaco Canyon ===\n[[Image:Chaco Canyon Chetro Ketl great kiva plaza NPS.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Great Kiva at Chaco Canyon.]]\n\nIn Chaco Canyon, the center of the ancient Pueblo culture in the American Southwest, numerous solar and lunar light markings and architectural and road alignments have been documented. These findings date to the 1977 discovery of the Sun Dagger site by Anna Sofaer.<ref>''Science'' Magazine, Sofaer et al., 1979: 126</ref> Three large stone slabs leaning against a cliff channel light and shadow markings onto two spiral petroglyphs on the cliff wall, marking the solstices, equinoxes and the lunar standstills of the 18.6 year cycle of the moon.<ref name=\"Cambridge\" /> Subsequent research by the Solstice Project and others demonstrated that numerous building and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon are oriented to solar, lunar and cardinal directions.<ref>Malville and Putnam, 1989.

During the 1930s, Otto S. Reuter compiled a study entitled ''Germanische Himmelskunde'', or \"Teutonic Skylore\". The astronomical orientations of ancient monuments claimed by Reuter and his followers would place the ancient Germanic peoples ahead of the [[Ancient Near East]] in the field of astronomy, demonstrating the intellectual superiority of the \"[[Aryan race|Aryans]]\" (Indo-Europeans) over the [[Semitic people|Semites]].<ref>Pedersen 1982:269</ref>\n\nSince the 19th century, numerous scholars have sought to use [[Archaeoastronomy and Vedic chronology|archaeoastronomical calculations]] to demonstrate the antiquity of Ancient Indian Vedic culture, computing the dates of astronomical observations ambiguously described in ancient poetry to as early as 4000 BC.<ref>Witzel 2001</ref> [[David Pingree]], a historian of Indian astronomy, condemned \"the scholars who perpetrate wild theories of prehistoric science and call themselves archaeoastronomers.\"<ref>Pingree 1982:554\u201363, esp. p. 556</ref>\n\nMore recently Gallagher,<ref>Gallagher 1983</ref> Pyle,<ref>Pyle 1983</ref> and [[Barry Fell|Fell]]<ref>Fell 1983</ref> interpreted inscriptions in West Virginia as a description in Celtic [[Ogham]] alphabet of the supposed winter solstitial marker at the site.

Subsequent analyses criticized its cultural inappropriateness, as well as its linguistic and archeaoastronomical<ref>Wise 2003</ref> claims, to describe it as an example of \"[[Pseudoarchaeology|cult archaeology]]\".<ref>Lesser, 1983</ref>\n\nArchaeoastronomy is sometimes related to the fringe discipline of [[Archaeocryptography]], when its followers attempt to find underlying mathematical orders beneath the proportions, size, and placement of archaeoastronomical sites such as Stonehenge and the Pyramid of Kukulc\u00e1n at Chichen Itza.<ref>{{citation | last = Schmeh | first = Klaus| title = The Pathology of Cryptology \u2013 A Current Survey | journal = Cryptologia | volume= 36 | date = 2012 | pages = 14\u201345 | doi = 10.1080/01611194.2011.632803 | postscript = , at pp. 19\u201320.}}</ref>\n\n== Archaeoastronomical organisations and publications ==\n\nThere are currently three academic organisations for scholars of archaeoastronomy.

Archaeoastronomy is also closely associated with [[historical astronomy]], the use of historical records of heavenly events to answer astronomical problems and the [[history of astronomy]], which uses written records to evaluate past astronomical practice.\n[[File:Equinozio da Pizzo Vento,tramonto fondachelli fantina, sicilia.JPG|thumb|The sunset at the [[equinox]] seen from the prehistoric site of Pizzo Vento at [[Fondachelli-Fantina|Fondachelli Fantina]], [[Sicily]]]]\nArchaeoastronomy uses a variety of methods to uncover evidence of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers.<ref>Iwaniszewski 2003, 7\u201310</ref> Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in [[landscape archaeology]] and [[cognitive archaeology]]. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into [[Paganism|beliefs about the cycles of nature]], such as [[Maya civilization#Astronomy|Mayan astronomy]] and its relationship with agriculture.<ref>Aveni 1980</ref> Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.<ref>Chiu & Morrison 1980</ref><ref>Magli 2008</ref>\n\nArchaeoastronomy can be applied to all cultures and all time periods. The meanings of the sky vary from culture to culture; nevertheless there are scientific methods which can be applied across cultures when examining ancient beliefs.<ref>McCluskey 2005</ref> It is perhaps the need to balance the social and scientific aspects of archaeoastronomy which led Clive Ruggles to describe it as \"a field with academic work of high quality at one end but uncontrolled speculation bordering on lunacy at the other\".<ref>Carlson 1999</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{quote|In his short history of 'Astro-archaeology' John Michell argued that the status of research into ancient astronomy had improved over the past two centuries, going 'from lunacy to heresy to interesting notion and finally to the gates of orthodoxy.' Nearly two decades later, we can still ask the question: Is archaeoastronomy still waiting at the gates of orthodoxy or has it gotten inside the gates?|Todd Bostwick quoting John Michell<ref>Bostwick 2006:13</ref>}}\n\nTwo hundred years before [[John Michell (writer)|John Michell]] wrote the above, there were no archaeoastronomers and there were no [[Archaeology#History of archaeology|professional archaeologists]], but there were astronomers and [[Antiquarianism|antiquarians]]. Some of their works are considered precursors of archaeoastronomy; antiquarians interpreted the astronomical orientation of the ruins that dotted the English countryside as [[William Stukeley]] did of [[Stonehenge]] in 1740,<ref>Michell, 2001:9\u201310</ref> while [[John Aubrey]] in 1678<ref>Johnson, 1912:225</ref> and [[Henry Chauncy]] in 1700 sought similar astronomical principles underlying the orientation of churches.<ref>Hoskin, 2001:7</ref>  Late in the nineteenth century astronomers such as [[Richard Proctor]] and [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]] investigated the astronomical orientations of [[Egyptian pyramids|the pyramids]].<ref>Michell, 2001:17\u201318</ref>\n\nThe term ''archaeoastronomy'' was first used by Elizabeth Chesley Baity (at the suggestion of Euan MacKie) in 1973,<ref>Sinclair 2006:17</ref> but as a topic of study it may be much older, depending on how archaeoastronomy is defined. Clive Ruggles<ref>Ruggles 2005:312\u201313</ref> says that [[Heinrich Nissen]], working in the mid-nineteenth century was arguably the first archaeoastronomer. Rolf Sinclair<ref>Sinclair 2006:8</ref> says that [[Norman Lockyer]], working in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, could be called the 'father of archaeoastronomy'. Euan MacKie<ref>Mackie 2006:243</ref> would place the origin even later, stating: \"...the genesis and modern flowering of archaeoastronomy must surely lie in the work of [[Alexander Thom]] in Britain between the 1930s and the 1970s\".\n\n[[Image:Auglish.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Early archaeoastronomers surveyed Megalithic constructs in the British Isles, at sites like [[Auglish]] in [[County Londonderry]], in an attempt to find statistical patterns.]]\nIn the 1960s the work of the engineer Alexander Thom and that of the astronomer [[Gerald Hawkins]], who proposed that [[Stonehenge]] was a [[Neolithic]] computer,<ref>Hawkins 1976</ref> inspired new interest in the astronomical features of ancient sites. The claims of Hawkins were largely dismissed,<ref>Atkinson 1966</ref> but this was not the case for Alexander Thom's work, whose survey results of [[megalith]]ic sites hypothesized widespread practice of accurate astronomy in the British Isles.<ref>Thom 1988:9\u201310</ref>  Euan MacKie, recognizing that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the Kintraw standing stone site in Argyllshire in 1970 and 1971 to check whether the latter's prediction of an observation platform on the hill slope above the stone was correct. There was an artificial platform there and this apparent verification of Thom's long alignment hypothesis (Kintraw was diagnosed as an accurate [[winter solstice]] site) led him to check Thom's geometrical theories at the Cultoon [[stone circle]] in Islay, also with a positive result. MacKie therefore broadly accepted Thom's conclusions and published new prehistories of Britain.<ref name = \"zkuawc\">MacKie 1977</ref> In contrast a re-evaluation of Thom's fieldwork by Clive Ruggles argued that Thom's claims of high accuracy astronomy were not fully supported by the evidence.<ref>Gingerich 2000</ref> Nevertheless, Thom's legacy remains strong, [[Edwin C. Krupp]]<ref>Krupp 1979:18</ref> wrote in 1979, \"Almost singlehandedly he has established the standards for archaeo-astronomical fieldwork and interpretation, and his amazing results have stirred controversy during the last three decades.\" His influence endures and practice of statistical testing of data remains one of the methods of archaeoastronomy.<ref>Hicks 1993</ref><ref>Iwaniszewski 1995</ref>\n[[File:Panoramica Uxmal.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|250x250px|It has been proposed that [[Maya civilization|Maya]] sites such as [[Uxmal]] were built in accordance with astronomical alignments.]]\nThe approach in the [[New World]], where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in [[Amerindian]] civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the [[prehistory]] of Europe lacks such as [[ethnography|ethnographies]]<ref>Zeilik 1985</ref><ref>Zeilik 1986</ref> and the historical records of the early [[Colonization of the Americas|colonizers]]. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni,<ref>Milbraith 1999:8</ref><ref>Broda 2000:233</ref> this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on historical data led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak when compared to the statistically led investigations in Europe.<ref>Hoskin 1996</ref>\n\nThis came to a head at a meeting sponsored by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in [[Oxford]] in 1981.<ref>Ruggles 1993:ix</ref> The methodologies and research questions of the participants were considered so different that the conference proceedings were published as two volumes.<ref>Aveni 1982</ref><ref>Heggie 1982</ref> Nevertheless, the conference was considered a success in bringing researchers together and Oxford conferences have continued every four or five years at locations around the world. The subsequent conferences have resulted in a move to more interdisciplinary approaches with researchers aiming to combine the contextuality of archaeological research,<ref>Aveni, 1989a:xi\u2013xiii</ref> which broadly describes the state of archaeoastronomy today, rather than merely establishing the existence of ancient astronomies, archaeoastronomers seek to explain why people would have an interest in the night sky.\n\n== Relations to other disciplines ==\n{{quote|...[O]ne of the most endearing characteristics of archaeoastronomy is its capacity to set academics in different disciplines at loggerheads with each other.|Clive Ruggles<ref>Ruggles 2000</ref>}}\n\nArchaeoastronomy has long been seen as an interdisciplinary field that uses written and unwritten evidence to study the astronomies of other cultures.  As such, it can be seen as connecting other disciplinary approaches for investigating ancient astronomy: astroarchaeology (an obsolete term for studies that draw astronomical information from the alignments of ancient architecture and landscapes), [[history of astronomy]] (which deals primarily with the written textual evidence), and ethnoastronomy (which draws on the ethnohistorical record and contemporary ethnographic studies).<ref>Aveni 1981: 1\u20132</ref><ref>Aveni 2003: 150</ref>\n\nReflecting Archaeoastronomy's development as an interdisciplinary subject, research in the field is conducted by investigators trained in a wide range of disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.<ref>McCluskey 2004</ref>\n\nBoth practicing archaeoastronomers and observers of the discipline approach it from different perspectives. George Gummerman and Miranda Warburton view archaeoastronomy as part of an archaeology informed by [[cultural anthropology]] and aimed at understanding a \"group's conception of themselves in relation to the heavens', in a word, its cosmology.<ref>Gummerman & Warburton 2005</ref>  Todd Bostwick argued that \"archaeoastronomy is anthropology\u2014the study of human behavior in the past and present.\"<ref>Bostwick 2006:3</ref> [[Paul Bahn]] has described archaeoastronomy as an area of cognitive archaeology.<ref>Bahn 1996:49</ref> Other researchers relate archaeoastronomy to the history of science, either as it relates to a culture's observations of nature and the conceptual framework they devised to impose an order on those observations<ref>McCluskey 2001</ref> or as it relates to the political motives which drove particular historical actors to deploy certain astronomical concepts or techniques.<ref>Broda 2006</ref><ref>Aldana 2007:14\u201315</ref>  Art historian Richard Poss took a more flexible approach, maintaining that the astronomical rock art of the North American Southwest should be read employing \"the hermeneutic traditions of western art history and art criticism\"<ref>Poss 2005:97</ref> Astronomers, however, raise different questions, seeking to provide their students with identifiable [[Precursorism|precursors]] of their discipline, and are especially concerned with the important question of how to confirm that specific sites are, indeed, intentionally astronomical.<ref>Schaefer 2006a:30</ref>\n\nThe reactions of professional archaeologists to archaeoastronomy have been decidedly mixed. Some expressed incomprehension or even hostility, varying from a rejection by the archaeological mainstream of what they saw as an archaeoastronomical fringe to an incomprehension between the cultural focus of archaeologists and the quantitative focus of early archaeoastronomers.<ref>Ruggles 1999: 3\u20139</ref>  Yet archaeologists have increasingly come to incorporate many of the insights from archaeoastronomy into archaeology textbooks<ref>Fisher 2006</ref> and, as mentioned above, some students wrote archaeology dissertations on archaeoastronomical topics.\n\nSince archaeoastronomers disagree so widely on the characterization of the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy to the study of culture, using the term ''Astronomy in Culture'' or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees an important part of the discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline ''Archaeotopography.''<ref>Hoskin 2001:13\u201314.</ref> Ruggles and Saunders proposed ''Cultural Astronomy'' as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies.<ref>Ruggles & Saunders 1993:1\u201331</ref> Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are [[cosmology|cosmologies]] and people who object to the use of [[logos]] have suggested adopting the Spanish ''cosmovisi\u00f3n''.<ref>Ruggles 2005:115\u201317</ref>\n\nWhen debates polarise between techniques, the methods are often referred to by a colour code, based on the colours of the bindings of the two volumes from the first Oxford Conference, where the approaches were first distinguished.<ref name = \"jgswke\">Aveni 1986</ref> Green ([[Old World]]) archaeoastronomers rely heavily on statistics and are sometimes accused of missing the cultural context of what is a social practice. Brown ([[New World]]) archaeoastronomers in contrast have abundant ethnographic and historical evidence and have been described as 'cavalier' on matters of measurement and statistical analysis.<ref>Hoskin 2001:2</ref> Finding a way to integrate various approaches has been a subject of much discussion since the early 1990s.<ref>Ruggles & Saunders 1993</ref><ref>Iwaniszewski 2001</ref>\n\n== Methodology ==\n{{quote|For a long time I have believed that such diversity requires the invention of some all-embracing theory. I think I was very na\u00efve in thinking that such a thing was ever possible.|Stanislaw Iwaniszewski<ref>Iwaniszewski 2003:7</ref>}}\n\nThere is no one way to do archaeoastronomy. The divisions between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends to depend on the location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.\n\n===Green archaeoastronomy===\n\nGreen archaeoastronomy is named after the cover of the book ''Archaeoastronomy in the Old World''.<ref>Aveni 1989:1</ref> It is based primarily on statistics and is particularly apt for prehistoric sites where the social evidence is relatively scant compared to the historic period. The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.\n\nThom wished to examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He believed that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required finding a place where on a specific date the Sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge on the other side for a '[[double sunset]]'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a [[hypothetical]] site, one the day before the [[summer solstice]] and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.\n\n<center>[[File:Doublesunset.ogg]]</center>\n\nTo test this idea he surveyed hundreds of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but he planned to show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing that there was an astronomical intent to the orientation of at least some of the alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two [[solstice]]s, the two [[equinox]]es and four [[cross-quarter day]]s, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar.<ref>Thom 1967: 107\u201317</ref> While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.\n\nEuan MacKie has supported Thom's analysis, to which he added an archaeological context by comparing [[Neolithic Britain]] to the [[Mayan civilization]] to argue for a stratified society in this period.<ref name = \"zkuawc\"/> To test his ideas he conducted a couple of excavations at proposed prehistoric observatories in Scotland. [[Kintraw]] is a site notable for its four-meter high standing stone. Thom proposed that this was a foresight to a point on the distant horizon between Beinn Shianaidh and Beinn o'Chaolias on [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].<ref>Ruggles 1999:25\u201329</ref> This, Thom argued, was a notch on the horizon where a double sunset would occur at midwinter. However, from ground level, this sunset would be obscured by a ridge in the landscape, and the viewer would need to be raised by two meters: another observation platform was needed. This was identified across a gorge where a platform was formed from small stones. The lack of artifacts caused concern for some archaeologists and the petrofabric analysis was inconclusive, but further research at [[Maes Howe]]<ref name=\"MacKie 1997\">MacKie 1997</ref> and on the [[Bush Barrow]] Lozenge<ref>MacKie 2006:362</ref> led MacKie to conclude that while the term 'science' may be anachronistic, Thom was broadly correct upon the subject of high-accuracy alignments.<ref>MacKie 2009</ref>\n\nIn contrast [[Clive Ruggles]] has argued that there are problems with the selection of data in Thom's surveys.<ref>Ruggles 1999:19\u201329</ref><ref>Ruggles and Barclay 2000: 69\u201370</ref> Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in [[Atmospheric refraction|refraction]] near the horizon.<ref>Schaefer and Liller 1990</ref> A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer ''whether'' there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times, its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer ''why'' people would be interested, which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past. Keith Kintigh wrote: \"To put it bluntly, in many cases it doesn't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn\u2019t inform the current interpretive questions.\"<ref>Kintigh 1992</ref>  Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research, especially in Europe.<ref>Hoskin 2001</ref>\n\n=== Brown archaeoastronomy ===\n\nIn contrast to the largely alignment-oriented statistically led methods of green archaeoastronomy, brown archaeoastronomy has been identified as being closer to the [[history of astronomy]] or to [[cultural history]], insofar as it draws on historical and ethnographic records to enrich its understanding of early astronomies and their relations to calendars and ritual.<ref name = \"jgswke\"/> The many records of native customs and beliefs made by the Spanish chroniclers means that brown archaeoastronomy is most often associated with studies of astronomy in the Americas.<ref>Aveni 1989</ref>\n\nOne famous site where historical records have been used to interpret sites is [[Chichen Itza]]. Rather than analysing the site and seeing which targets appear popular, archaeoastronomers have instead examined the ethnographic records to see what features of the sky were important to the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]ns and then sought archaeological correlates. One example which could have been overlooked without historical records is the Mayan interest in the planet [[Venus]]. This interest is attested to by the [[Dresden codex]] which contains tables with information about the Venus's appearances in the sky.<ref name = \"mlxqkn\">Kelley and Milone 2005:369\u201370</ref> These cycles would have been of astrological and ritual significance as Venus was associated with [[Quetzalcoatl]] or [[Xolotl]].<ref>Kelley and Milone 2005:367\u201368</ref> Associations of architectural features with settings of Venus can be found in Chichen Itza, Uxmal, and probably some other Mesoamerican sites.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La estrella de Quetzalc\u00f3atl: El planeta Venus en Mesoam\u00e9rica|last=\u0160prajc|first=Ivan|publisher=Editorial Diana|year=1996|isbn=978-968-13-2947-1|location=Mexico City|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Chichen Itza Observatory 2 1.jpg|left|thumb|200px|\"El Caracol\" a possible observatory temple at Chichen Itza.]]The Temple of the Warriors bears iconography depicting feathered serpents associated with Quetzalcoatl or Kukulcan. This means that the building's alignment towards the place on the horizon where Venus first appears in the evening sky (when it coincides with the rainy season) may be meaningful.<ref>Milbraith 1988:70\u201371</ref> However, since both the date and the azimuth of this event change continuously, a solar interpretation of this orientation is much more likely.<ref>{{cite book|last1=S\u00e1nchez Nava|first1=Pedro Francisco|last2=\u0160prajc|first2=Ivan|title=Orientaciones astron\u00f3micas en la arquitectura maya de las tierras bajas|date=2015|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|location=Mexico City|isbn=978-607-484-727-7}}</ref>\n\nAveni claims that another building associated with the planet Venus in the form of Kukulcan, and the rainy season at Chichen Itza is the [[Caracol]].<ref>Aveni 2006:60\u201364</ref> This is a building with circular tower and doors facing the cardinal directions. The base faces the most northerly setting of Venus. Additionally the pillars of a stylobate on the building's upper platform were painted black and red. These are colours associated with Venus as an evening and morning star.<ref>Aveni 1979:175\u201383</ref> However the windows in the tower seem to have been little more than slots, making them poor at letting light in, but providing a suitable place to view out.<ref>Aveni 1997:137\u201338</ref>\n\nAveni states that one of the strengths of the brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the [[Inca]]s as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ''ceques'' radial routes emanating from the capital at [[Cusco]]. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year.<ref>Aveni 1989:5</ref><ref>Bauer and Dearborn 1995</ref> In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the history of astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the [[Han dynasty]], in the second century BC.<ref>Xu ''et al.'' 2000:1\u20137</ref>\n\nA criticism of this method is that it can be statistically weak. Schaefer in particular has questioned how robust the claimed alignments in the Caracol are.<ref>Schaefer 2006a:42\u201348</ref><ref>Schaefer 2006b</ref> Because of the wide variety of evidence, which can include artefacts as well as sites, there is no one way to practice archaeoastronomy.<ref>Iwaniszewski 2003</ref> Despite this it is accepted that archaeoastronomy is not a discipline that sits in isolation. Because archaeoastronomy is an interdisciplinary field, whatever is being investigated should make sense both archaeologically and astronomically. Studies are more likely to be considered sound if they use theoretical tools found in archaeology like [[analogy]] and [[homology (anthropology)|homology]] and if they can demonstrate an understanding of accuracy and precision found in astronomy. Both quantitative analyses and interpretations based on ethnographic analogies and other contextual evidence have recently been applied in systematic studies of architectural orientations in the Maya area<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gonz\u00e1lez-Garc\u00eda|first1=A. C\u00e9sar|last2=\u0160prajc|first2=Ivan|title=Astronomical significance of architectural orientations in the Maya Lowlands: A statistical approach|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports|date=2016|volume=9|pages=191\u2013202|doi=10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.07.020}}</ref> and in other parts of Mesoamerica.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=\u0160prajc|first1=Ivan|title=Astronomy, Architecture, and Landscape in Prehispanic Mesoamerica|journal=Journal of Archaeological Research|volume=26|issue=2|pages=197\u2013251|doi=10.1007/s10814-017-9109-z|year=2018}}</ref>\n\n== Source materials ==\n\nBecause archaeoastronomy is about the many and various ways people interacted with the sky, there are a diverse range of sources giving information about astronomical practices.\n\n===Alignments===<!-- This section is linked from [[History of astronomy]] -->\n\nA common source of data for archaeoastronomy is the study of alignments. This is based on the assumption that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment at multiple sites.\n\nAn alignment is calculated by measuring the [[azimuth]], the angle from north, of the structure and the altitude of the horizon it faces<ref>Ruggles, 2005:112\u201313</ref> The azimuth is usually measured using a [[theodolite]] or a [[compass]]. A compass is easier to use, though the deviation of the Earth's magnetic field from true north, known as its [[magnetic declination]] must be taken into account. Compasses are also unreliable in areas prone to magnetic interference, such as sites being supported by scaffolding. Additionally a compass can only measure the azimuth to a precision of a half a degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brunton.com/manuals/current/Compasses/Transit.pdf |title=Brunton Pocket Transit Instruction Manual|page=22|accessdate=2008-03-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304060347/http://www.brunton.com/manuals/current/Compasses/Transit.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-04}}</ref>\n\nA theodolite can be considerably more accurate if used correctly, but it is also considerably more difficult to use correctly. There is no inherent way to align a theodolite with North and so the scale has to be [[calibration|calibrated]] using astronomical observation, usually the position of the Sun.<ref>Ruggles 2005:423\u201325</ref> Because the position of celestial bodies changes with the time of day due to the Earth's rotation, the time of these calibration observations must be accurately known, or else there will be a systematic error in the measurements. Horizon altitudes can be measured with a theodolite or a [[clinometer]].\n\n=== Artifacts ===\n\n[[Image:NAMA Machine d'Anticyth\u00e8re 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Antikythera mechanism (main fragment)]]For artifacts such as the [[Nebra skydisk|Sky Disc of Nebra]], alleged to be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos,<ref>Scholsser 2002</ref><ref>Meller 2004</ref> the analysis would be similar to typical [[Archaeology#Post-excavation analysis|post-excavation analysis]] as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and attempts are made to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.\n\nA more mundane example is the presence of [[astrological symbol]]s found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but [[Carol van Driel-Murray]] has proposed that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings.<ref>van Driel-Murray 2002</ref> This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAnother well-known artefact with an astronomical use is the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. In this case analysis of the artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is bolstered by the presence of symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.<ref>T. Freeth ''et al.'' 2006</ref>\n\n=== Art and inscriptions ===\n\n[[Image:Fajadadiagram.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Diagram showing the location of the sun daggers on the [[Fajada Butte]] petroglyph on various days]]Art and inscriptions may not be confined to artefacts, but also appear painted or inscribed on an archaeological site. Sometimes inscriptions are helpful enough to give instructions to a site's use. For example, a Greek inscription on a stele (from [[Itanos (city)|Itanos]]) has been translated as:\"Patron set this up for Zeus Epopsios. Winter solstice. Should anyone wish to know: off \u2018the little pig\u2019 and the stele the sun turns.\"<ref>Inscriptiones Creticae III iv 11; Isager and Skydsgaard 1992:163</ref> From Mesoamerica come [[Maya codices|Mayan]] and [[Aztec codices]]. These are folding books made from [[Amatl]], processed tree bark on which are [[glyph]]s in [[Maya script|Mayan]] or [[Aztec script]]. The [[Dresden codex]] contains information regarding the Venus cycle, confirming its importance to the Mayans.<ref name = \"mlxqkn\"/>\n\nMore problematic are those cases where the movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with [[petroglyph]]s.<ref>Williamson 1987:109\u201314</ref> A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of [[Fajada Butte]] at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph.<ref>Sofaer 2008</ref> The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at the winter solstice two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico.<ref>Fountain 2005</ref><ref>Robins & Ewing 1989</ref> It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices.<ref>Preston & Preston 2005: 115\u201318</ref> The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor [[lunar standstill]]s of the moon's 18.6 year cycle.<ref>Science Mag, Sofaer et al. 1979: 126</ref><ref name=\"Cambridge\">Cambridge U, 1982 sofaer et al.: 126</ref> In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon.<ref>Sofaer and Sinclair: 1987. UNM, ABQ</ref> Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.<ref>Sofaer 1998: Lekson Ed, u of utah: 165</ref>\n\nIf no ethnographic nor historical data are found which can support this assertion then acceptance of the idea relies upon whether or not there are enough petroglyph sites in North America that such a correlation could occur by chance. It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.\n\n=== Ethnographies ===\n\nAs well as the materials left by peoples themselves, there are also the reports of other who have encountered them. The historical records of the [[Conquistadores]] are a rich source of information about the pre-Columbian Americans. [[Ethnography|Ethnographers]] also provide material about many other peoples.\n\nAveni uses the importance of zenith passages as an example of the importance of ethnography. For peoples living between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn there are two days of the year when the noon Sun passes directly overhead and casts no shadow. In parts of Mesoamerica this was considered a significant day as it would herald the arrival of rains, and so play a part in the cycle of agriculture. This knowledge is still considered important amongst Mayan Indians living in Central America today. The ethnographic records suggested to archaeoastronomers that this day may have been important to the ancient Mayans. There are also shafts known as 'zenith tubes' which illuminate subterranean rooms when the Sun passes overhead found at places like [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]]  and [[Xochicalco]]. It is only through the ethnography that we can speculate that the timing of the illumination was considered important in Mayan society.<ref>Aveni 1980:40\u201343</ref> Alignments to the sunrise and sunset on the day of the zenith passage have been claimed to exist at several sites. However, it has been shown that, since there are very few orientations that can be related to these phenomena, they likely have different explanations.<ref>\u0160prajc and S\u00e1nchez 2013</ref>\n\nEthnographies also caution against over-interpretation of sites. At a site in [[Chaco Canyon]] can be found a [[pictograph]] with a star, crescent and hand. It has been argued by some astronomers that this is a record of the [[SN 1054|1054 Supernova]].<ref>Brandt and Williamson 1979</ref> However recent reexaminations of related 'supernova petroglyphs' raises questions about such sites in general<ref>Krupp. et al. 2010: 42</ref> and anthropological evidence suggests other inrepretations. The [[Zuni people]], who claim a strong ancestral affiliation with Chaco, marked their sun-watching station with a crescent, star, hand and sundisc, similar to those found at the Chaco site.<ref>Ruggles 2005:89</ref>\n\nEthnoastronomy is also an important field outside of the Americas. For example, anthropological work with Aboriginal Australians is producing much information about their [[Aboriginal astronomy|Indigenous astronomies]]<ref>Cairns 2005</ref><ref>Hamacher 2012</ref> and about their interaction with the modern world.<ref>Saethre 2007</ref>\n\n== Recreating the ancient sky ==\n{{quote|...[A]lthough different ways to do science and different scientific results do arise in different cultures, this provides little support for those who would use such differences to question the sciences' ability to provide reliable statements about the world in which we live.|Stephen McCluskey<ref>McCluskey 2005:78</ref>}}\n\nOnce the researcher has data to test, it is often necessary to attempt to recreate ancient sky conditions to place the data in its historical environment.\n\n=== Declination ===\n{{Main|Declination}}\n\nTo calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90\u00b0 if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or \u221290\u00b0 if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole.<ref name = \"byuqqi\">Ruggles 1999:18</ref> The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as ''declination''. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0\u00b0. The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n[[Image:Decdiag600.jpg|center|thumb|600px|Diagram of the visible portions of sky at varying latitudes.]]\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Solar positioning ===\n\nWhile the stars are fixed to their declinations the Sun is not. The rising point of the Sun varies throughout the year. It swings between two limits marked by the solstices a bit like a [[pendulum]], slowing as it reaches the extremes, but passing rapidly through the midpoint. If an archaeoastronomer can calculate from the azimuth and horizon height that a site was built to view a declination of +23.5\u00b0 then he or she need not wait until 21 June to confirm the site does indeed face the summer solstice.<ref>A.F. Aveni 1997:23\u201327</ref> For more information see [[History of solar observation]].\n\n=== Lunar positioning ===\n\nThe Moon's appearance is considerably more complex. Its motion, like the Sun, is between two limits\u2014known as [[Lunar standstill|''luni''stices]] rather than ''sol''stices. However, its travel between lunistices is considerably faster. It takes a [[Sidereal month#Sidereal month|sidereal month]] to complete its cycle rather than the year-long trek of the Sun. This is further complicated as the lunistices marking the limits of the Moon's movement move on [[Lunar standstill|an 18.6 year cycle]]. For slightly over nine years the extreme limits of the Moon are outside the range of sunrise. For the remaining half of the cycle the Moon never exceeds the limits of the range of sunrise. However, much lunar observation was concerned with the ''[[Lunar phase|phase]]'' of the Moon. The cycle from one [[New Moon]] to the next runs on an entirely different cycle, the [[Synodic month]].<ref>Ruggles 1999:36\u201337</ref> Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon. See [[Moon]] for more details.\n\n=== Stellar positioning ===\n{{Main|Precession of the equinoxes}}\n\n[[Image:Earth precession.jpg|thumb|right|Precessional movement.]]Finally there is often a need to correct for the apparent movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a [[spinning top]]. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble.<ref>Ruggles 2005:345\u201347</ref> The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around [[Polaris]] as they do now. In the case of the [[Egyptian pyramids]], it has been shown they were aligned towards [[Thuban]], a faint star in the constellation of [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].<ref>Ruggles 2005:354\u201355</ref> The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the Sun in the constellation [[Capricornus|Capricorn]]. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the Sun in [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]] due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n=== Transient phenomena ===\n\n[[Image:Bayeux Tapestry scene32 Halley comet.jpg|thumb|left|Halley's Comet depicted on the [[Bayeux tapestry]]]]Additionally there are often transient phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like [[eclipse]]s. In the case of [[solar eclipse]]s these can be used to date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by [[Herodotus]] enables us to date a battle between the [[Medes]] and the [[Lydia]]ns, which following the eclipse failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herodotus|authorlink=Herodotus|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hdt.+1.74.1|title=The Histories I.74|accessdate=2008-03-22}}</ref> Other easily calculated events are [[supernova]]e whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.\n\nSome [[comet]]s are predictable, most famously [[Halley's Comet]]. Yet as a class of object they remain unpredictable and can appear at any time. Some have extremely lengthy [[orbital period]]s which means their past appearances and returns cannot be predicted. Others may have only ever passed through the [[Solar System]] once and so are inherently unpredictable.<ref>[http://www.space.com/spacewatch/050701_bright_comets.html Predicting the next bright comet], Space.com.</ref>\n\n[[Meteor shower]]s should be predictable, but some [[meteor]]s are cometary debris and so require calculations of orbits which are currently impossible to complete.<ref>Steel 1999</ref> Other events noted by ancients include [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]], [[sun dog]]s and [[rainbow]]s all of which are as impossible to predict as the ancient weather, but nevertheless may have been considered important phenomena.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Major topics of archaeoastronomical research ==\n{{quote|What has astronomy brought into the lives of cultural groups throughout history? The answers are many and varied...|Von Del Chamberlain and M. Jane Young<ref>Chamberlain & Young 2005:xi</ref>}}\n\n=== The use of calendars ===\n\nA common justification for the need for astronomy is the need to develop an accurate [[calendar]] for [[agriculture|agricultural]] reasons. Ancient texts like [[Hesiod]]'s Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to partially confirm this: astronomical observations are used in combination with [[ecology|ecological]] signs, such as [[bird migration]]s to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical studies of the [[Hopi]] of the [[southwestern United States]] indicate that they carefully observed the rising and setting positions of the Sun to determine the proper times to plant crops.<ref>McCluskey 1990</ref> Howerver, ethnoastronomical work with the [[Mursi people|Mursi]] of [[Ethiopia]] shows that their [[luni-solar calendar]] was somewhat haphazard, indicating the limits of astronomical calendars in some societies.<ref>Turton & Ruggles 1978</ref> All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.\n\nAn example of a non-agricultural calendar is the ''[[Tzolk'in]]'' calendar of the [[Maya civilization]] of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]], which is a cycle of 260 days. This count is based on an [[260-day Mesoamerican calendar|earlier calendar and is found throughout Mesoamerica]]. This formed part of a more comprehensive system of [[Maya calendar]]s which combined a series of astronomical observations and ritual cycles.<ref>Aveni 1989b</ref>\n\nOther peculiar calendars include ancient [[Hellenic calendar|Greek calendars]]. These were nominally [[Lunar calendar|lunar]], starting with the [[New Moon]]. In reality the calendar could pause or skip days with confused citizens inscribing dates by both the civic calendar and ''ton theoi'', by the [[moon]].<ref>McCluskey 2000</ref> The lack of any universal calendar for ancient Greece suggests that coordination of panhellenic events such as [[Panhellenic Games|games]] or rituals could be difficult and that astronomical symbolism may have been used as a politically neutral form of timekeeping.<ref>Salt & Boutsikas 2005</ref> Orientation measurements in Greek temples and Byzantine churches have been associated to deity's name day, festivities, and special events.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liritzis | first1 = I | last2 = Vassiliou | first2 = H | date = 2002 | title = Astronomical orientations of ancient temples at Rhodes and Attica with a tentative interpretation | journal = Mediterranean Archaeology & Archaeometry | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 69\u201379 | bibcode = 2002MAA.....2...69L }}</ref><ref>Liritzis.I and Vassiliou.H (2006) Were Greek temples oriented towards aurora?

A preliminary study. ''Byzantinische Zeitscrift'' (K.G. Saur Munchen, Leipzig) 99, 2, 523\u201334</ref>\n\n=== Myth and cosmology ===\n\n[[Image:Argo Navis Hevelius.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The constellation [[Argo Navis]] drawn by Johannes Hevelius in 1690.]]Another motive for studying the sky is to understand and explain the [[universe]]. In these cultures [[mythology|myth]] was a tool for achieving this and the explanations, while not reflecting the standards of modern [[science]], are [[cosmology|cosmologies]].\n\nThe [[Inca]]s arranged their empire to demonstrate their cosmology. The capital, [[Cusco]], was at the centre of the empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre.<ref>Bauer & Dearborn 1995</ref> These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four ''suyus'', which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the [[Andes]]. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the [[Milky Way]] in the night sky.<ref>Urton 1981</ref> In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a [[perpendicular]] fashion.\n\nThe importance of observing cosmological factors is also seen on the other side of the world. The [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]] is laid out to follow cosmic order though rather than observing four directions. The Chinese system was composed of five directions: [[North]], [[South]], [[East]], [[West]] and [[Centre (geometry)|Centre]]. The Forbidden City occupied the centre of ancient Beijing.<ref>Krupp 1997a:196\u201399</ref> One approaches the Emperor from the south, thus placing him in front of the [[Circumpolar constellation|circumpolar stars]]. This creates the situation of the heavens revolving around the person of the Emperor. The Chinese cosmology is now better known through its export as [[feng shui]].\n\nThere is also much information about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the [[constellation]]s. The Barasana of the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (roughly equivalent to the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees.<ref>Hoskin 1999:15\u201316</ref> The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.<ref>Hugh-Jones 1982:191\u201393</ref>\n\nA more well-known source of constellation myth are the texts of the Greeks and Romans. The origin of their constellations remains a matter of vigorous and occasionally fractious debate.<ref>Schaefer 2002</ref><ref>Blomberg 2003, esp p. 76</ref>\n\nThe loss of one of the sisters, Merope, in some Greek myths may reflect an astronomical event wherein one of the stars in the Pleiades disappeared from view by the naked eye.<ref>[http://www.pleiade.org/pleiades_02.html ''The Pleiades in mythology''], Pleiade Associates, Bristol, United Kingdom, accessed June 7, 2012</ref>\n\n[[Giorgio de Santillana]], professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], along with Hertha von Dechend believed that the old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial [[cosmology]] clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters and violence in ancient myths are representative of the forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate [[astronomy]] that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization. Santillana and von Dechend in their book ''Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time'' (1969) clearly state that ancient myths have no historical or factual basis other than a cosmological one encoding astronomical phenomena, especially the [[precession of the equinoxes]].<ref>Giorgio de Santillana & Hertha von Dechend, ''Hamlet's Mill'', David R Godine: Boston, 1977.</ref> Santillana and von Dechend's approach is not widely accepted.\n\n=== Displays of power ===\n\n[[Image:1st Pylon Karnak Temple.JPG|thumbnail|250px|left|The [[Precinct of Amun-Re]] was aligned on the midwinter solstice.]]\n\nBy including celestial motifs in clothing it becomes possible for the wearer to make claims the power on Earth is drawn from above. It has been said that the Shield of [[Achilles]] described by [[Homer]] is also a catalogue of constellations.<ref>Hannah 1994</ref> In North America shields depicted in [[Comanche]] [[petroglyph]]s appear to include Venus symbolism.<ref>Krupp 1997a:252\u201353</ref>\n\n[[Solstice|Solsticial]] alignments also can be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the [[Isla del Sol|Island of the Sun]] (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in [[Lake Titicaca]], the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers on a nearby ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the [[Inca]] ruling elite.

Several architectural features have suggested astronomical elements. Each of the stairways built into the sides of the pyramid has 91 steps.

The most famous of these is the midsummer alignment, where the Sun rises over the Heel Stone. However, this interpretation has been challenged by some archaeologists who argue that the midwinter alignment, where the viewer is outside Stonehenge and sees the Sun setting in the henge, is the more significant alignment, and the midsummer alignment may be a coincidence due to local topography.<ref>Parker Pearson ''et al.'' 2007</ref>\n\nAs well as solar alignments, there are proposed lunar alignments. The four station stones mark out a rectangle. The short sides point towards the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset. The long sides if viewed towards the south-east, face the most southerly rising of the Moon. Aveni notes that these lunar alignments have never gained the acceptance that the solar alignments have received.<ref>Aveni 1997:65\u201366</ref> The Heel Stone azimuth is one-seventh of circumference, matching the latitude of Avebury, while summer solstice sunrise azimuth is no longer equal to the construction era direction.{{citation needed | reason=Source for claim was a personal website; citation was removed, and should be replaced with a reliable source. | date=March 2014}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Maeshowe ===\n[[Image:PicMaesEntrance.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The interior of [[Maeshowe]] chambered tomb.]]\n\n{{Main|Maeshowe}}\n\nThis is an architecturally outstanding Neolithic chambered tomb on the mainland of [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]\u2014probably dating to the early 3rd millennium BC, and where the setting Sun at midwinter shines down the entrance passage into the central chamber (see Newgrange). In the 1990s further investigations were carried out to discover whether this was an accurate or an approximate solar alignment. Several new aspects of the site were discovered. In the first place the entrance passage faces the hills of the island [[Hoy]], about 10 miles away. Secondly, it consists of two straight lengths, angled at a few degrees to each other. Thirdly, the outer part is aligned towards the midwinter sunset position on a level horizon just to the left of Ward Hill on Hoy.  Fourthly the inner part points directly at the Barnhouse standing stone about 400m away and then to the right end of the summit of Ward Hill, just before it dips down to the notch between it at Cuilags to the right. This indicated line points to sunset on the first Sixteenths of the solar year (according to A. Thom) before and after the winter solstice and the notch at the base of the right slope of the Hill is at the same declination. Fourthly a similar 'double sunset' phenomenon is seen at the right end of Cuilags, also on Hoy; here the date is the first Eighth of the year before and after the winter solstice, at the beginning of November and February respectively\u2014the Old Celtic festivals of [[Samhain]] and [[Imbolc]]. This alignment is not indicated by an artificial structure but gains plausibility from the other two indicated lines. Maeshowe is thus an extremely sophisticated calendar site which must have been positioned carefully in order to use the horizon foresights in the ways described.<ref name=\"MacKie 1997\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Uxmal ===\n[[Image:Uxmal-Palace-of-the-Governor.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Palace of the Governor at Uxmal.]]\n\n{{Main|Uxmal}}\n\nUxmal is a Mayan city in the Puuc Hills of [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], Mexico. The Governor's Palace at Uxmal is often used as an exemplar of why it is important to combine ethnographic and alignment data. The palace is aligned with an [[azimuth]] of 118\u00b0 on the pyramid of Cehtzuc. This alignment corresponds approximately to the southernmost rising and, with a much greater precision, to the northernmost setting of Venus; both phenomena occur once every eight years. By itself this would not be sufficient to argue for a meaningful connection between the two events. The palace has to be aligned in one direction or another and why should the rising of Venus be any more important than the rising of the Sun, Moon, other planets, Sirius ''et cetera''? The answer given is that not only does the palace point towards significant points of Venus, it is also covered in [[glyph]]s which stand for Venus and Mayan zodiacal constellations.<ref>Ruggles 2005:163\u201365</ref> Moreover, the great northerly extremes of Venus always occur in late April or early May, coinciding with the onset of the rainy season. The Venus glyphs placed in the cheeks of the Maya rain god Chac, most likely referring to the concomitance of these phenomena, support the west-working orientation scheme.<ref>\u0160prajc 2015</ref>\n\n=== Chaco Canyon ===\n[[Image:Chaco Canyon Chetro Ketl great kiva plaza NPS.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Great Kiva at Chaco Canyon.]]\n\nIn Chaco Canyon, the center of the ancient Pueblo culture in the American Southwest, numerous solar and lunar light markings and architectural and road alignments have been documented.

Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices.

However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger.

Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health.

During [[World War II]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]] began using the Wonderlic Personnel Test to select candidates for [[aviator|pilot]] [[training]] and [[air navigation|navigation]]. During this time period, 1940\u20131960, it was supplied for free as the data was so valuable to E. F. Wonderlic. He wanted to perfect the test, not charge for it. In the 1970s [[Tom Landry]], coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/> It is still used in the annual [[NFL Combine]] as a form of pre-draft assessment.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time. It may be termed as a quick IQ test.<ref name=\"tests.com\">{{cite web|title=Personality and Aptitude Career Tests.

The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test - Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes). The Wonderlic Personnel Test-Quicktest differs from the Wonderlic Personnel Test in that it is not proctored giving employers a general idea of the potential applicant's cognitive ability.

Wonderlic claims that using the Wonderlic Personality Test to select individuals whose traits are aligned with the demands of the position, employers can improve employee productivity, employee satisfaction and customer service while reducing recruitment costs and employee turnover.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wonderlic|url=http://www.wonderlic.com/assessments/personality|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAdded during the 1990s, the Wonderlic Personality Test contains two sections. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile and the Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on five primary dimensions of the individual's personality: [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]], [[neuroticism|emotional stability/neuroticism]], and [[openness to experience]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Description of Five Factor Model|url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/five-factor-model.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> These are essentially the same [[Construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]] as the [[Big Five personality traits]], also known as the Five Factor Model.\n\n===Motivation===\nAveraging 10-15 minutes, the 58-item assessment is based on leading workplace motivation model, Holland/RIASEC. It evaluates a candidate\u2019s interests, which helps predict how motivated they will be by the actual responsibilities of the job. The more motivated they are by those responsibilities, the likelier they will succeed in that position.<ref>[https://wonderlic.com/wonscore/motivation/ \"Motivation\"] ''Wonderlic.com''.

New London''===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\",<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/</ref><ref>https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html</ref> based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.

In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity.

However, the playing field was found to be in deficient condition after rains earlier in the month and a heavy event schedule, which had included a [[Shakira]] concert and a soccer tournament match played by [[Cruz Azul]]. As League and stadium officials evaluated the scene, pictures of the poor conditions began to circulate on social media.

Following a [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] punt, the Rams mounted a 10-play, 83-yard drive that ended with Dick connecting with wide receiver [[Josh Reynolds (American football)|Josh Reynolds]] from four yards out and (with a successful Zuerlein PAT) a 13-0 lead for Los Angeles. The Chiefs struck back quickly on their next drive as running back [[Kareem Hunt]] had a 27-yard run while quarterback [[Patrick Mahomes]] completed three straight passes for 48 yards, the last going 25 yards to wide receiver [[Tyreek Hill]] for a touchdown. The Rams, who benefited from nine penalties called on the Chiefs in the opening period, started from their own 16 and ended the first quarter with 3rd-and-goal at the Kansas City 5-yard-line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201811190ram.htm|title=Kansas City Chiefs at Los Angeles Rams - November 19th, 2018|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Second quarter===\nFollowing an incomplete pass, Zuerlein converted a 23-yard field goal to put the Rams up 16-7. From there, Mahomes and Hunt led the Chiefs down to L.A.'s 1-yard-line. But on 3rd-and-goal, Hunt was tackled for a 1-yard loss by Rams strong safety [[John Johnson (safety)|John Johnson]], forcing Kansas City to settle for a 21-yard field goal by [[Harrison Butker]]. On the Rams' next drive, Goff was sacked twice, the second by defensive end [[Allen Bailey]], who stripped Goff of the ball and recovered the fumble himself at the Ram 21. The Chiefs cashed in quickly as Mahomes hit Hunt for a 21-yard screen pass that with Butker's PAT put Kansas City on top 17-16. The Rams stalled on their next drive, but punter [[Johnny Hekker]]'s 55-yard punt pinned the Chiefs inside their own 10. The Chiefs moved out to their own 22, when on 2nd-and-8 just after the two-minute warning, Mahomes was sacked by Rams defensive tackle [[Aaron Donald]] and separated from the ball, which was picked up by linebacker [[Samson Ebukam]] at the 11 and taken in for a touchdown and a 23-17 advantage for the Rams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2018/11/19/nfl-rams-aaron-donald-fumble-sack/|title=Watch: Aaron Donald forces 2 fumbles, 1 returned for TD|date=2018-11-20|website=Rams Wire|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> Mahomes shook off the turnover and rallied the Chiefs by completing six passes in seven attempts on a 69-yard drive that ended with an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]] with 20 seconds remaining before halftime.

From there, Jared Goff completed four passes to guide the Rams to the Chief 7. Finding no one open on 3rd-and-goal, Goff ran it in himself for the touchdown, lobbing the football over the crossbar as Los Angeles seized a 30-23 lead. The Chiefs tied things up on their next possession, with tight end [[Travis Kelce]] taking a Mahomes pass for a 33-yard catch-and-run to set up a 1st-and-goal situation. Two plays later, Mahomes and Kelce connected again for a 4-yard touchdown and a 30-30 deadlock. The Rams retaliated as Goff found running back [[Todd Gurley]] for screen passes of 19 and 13 yards. Los Angeles drove down to the Kansas City 15, where Zuerlein converted his second field goal of the night, this time from 33 yards out and a 33-30 lead. Following a touchback, Mahomes' short pass attempt was intercepted at the line of scrimmage by Ebukam, who returned it 25 yards for a touchdown (plowing over Mahomes and Hunt at the goal line) to put the Rams up by 10 points, 40-30.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2018/11/19/nfl-los-angeles-rams-samson-ebukam-patrick-mahomes/|title=Watch: Samson Ebukam picks Patrick Mahomes, runs over QB for 2nd TD|date=November 20, 2018|website=Rams Wire|language=en|access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nAfter the teams traded punts on the next two possessions, the Chiefs swung momentum their way with Mahomes throwing deep to a wide-open Hill for a 73-yard touchdown pass play. On the Rams' next drive, Goff was sacked by linebacker [[Justin Houston]] who stripped the ball away. Allen Bailey, who had forced and recovered a Goff fumble earlier in the game, grabbed the ball before it had a chance to hit the ground and returned it two yards for a touchdown to put Kansas City back in the lead 44-40. The Rams came back as Goff found Josh Reynolds (27 yards) and Robert Woods (36 yards) for big gains that led to a 7-yard scoring strike to tight end [[Gerald Everett]] and a 47-44 edge for L.A. Both teams went three-and-out on their next possessions before Mahomes led a six-play, 65-yard drive that ended with a 10-yard score to Conley with 2:47 remaining, Mahomes' sixth touchdown pass of the game (matching his own team record), as the Chiefs went up 51-47. But it would take only six plays for the Rams to regain the lead, as Goff found Everett deep down the right sideline. Everett beat the coverage by Chiefs safety [[Daniel Sorensen]], gathered in the pass at the Chiefs 15, then tiptoed down the sideline to stay in bounds for the 40-yard touchdown reception and a 54-51 lead. With 1:44 left in the game, Mahomes drove the Chiefs to midfield, but a deep pass attempt was intercepted by Rams cornerback [[Marcus Peters]], who was facing his former team for the first time. L.A. looked set to run out the clock, but a false start penalty on tackle [[Andrew Whitworth]] took the Rams out of their game plan, and they were forced to punt. Hekker, a four-time all-pro punter, then boomed his kick 68 yards into the Chiefs end zone. Tyreek Hill returned the punt 14 yards to the Kansas City 12 with under a minute remaining. Mahomes connected with Kelce and Conley for short passes, but throwing under pressure from his own 26, Mahomes' last deep pass was picked off by Rams safety [[Lamarcus Joyner]], and Los Angeles was able to run out the remaining 13 seconds as Goff took a final kneeldown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/20/mahomes-5-turnovers-loom-large-in-chiefs-loss-to-rams/38570293/|title=Mahomes 5 turnovers loom large in Chiefs loss to Rams|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Statistics===\n\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Rams|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Kansas City Chiefs at Los Angeles Rams&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date={{tooltip|November 19|Monday}}\n|time=7:15&nbsp;p.m. CST/5:15&nbsp;p.m. PST\n|road=Chiefs\n|R1=7|R2=16|R3=7|R4=21\n|home='''Rams'''\n|H1=13|H2=10|H3=17|H4=14\n|stadium=Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles, California\n|attendance=77,002\n|weather={{convert|65|F|C}}, cloudy\n|referee=Clete Blakeman\n|TV=ESPN/KABC\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Joe Tessitore]], [[Jason Witten]], [[Booger McFarland]] and [[Lisa Salters]]\n|reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2018111900/2018/REG11/chiefs@rams Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57727/LA_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* LAR - [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] 7-yard pass from [[Jared Goff]] ([[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] kick failed), 12:00.

Kansas City had won all six regular season games during that era. This game was the first regular season meeting between the teams after the Rams' return to Los Angeles.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.footballdb.com/teams/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/teamvsteam?opp=29 |title=Kansas City Chiefs vs. Los Angeles Rams Results \u2014 The Football Database |website=FootballDB.com |language=en |access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe inter-conference matchup was originally slated to be part of the [[NFL International Series]], and was scheduled to be played at [[Estadio Azteca]] in [[Mexico City]], which had hosted games the previous two seasons. However, the playing field was found to be in deficient condition after rains earlier in the month and a heavy event schedule, which had included a [[Shakira]] concert and a soccer tournament match played by [[Cruz Azul]]. As League and stadium officials evaluated the scene, pictures of the poor conditions began to circulate on social media. Unable to remedy the situation in time for the game, the [[National Football League|NFL]] announced that the game would be moved to [[Los Angeles]] just six days before the game was to be played.<ref>{{cite news|title=Chiefs-Rams game moved from Mexico City to L.A.|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000987994/article/chiefsrams-game-moved-from-mexico-city-to-la|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=NFL moves Chiefs-Rams from Mexico City to L.A.|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25268527|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures, LLC|website=ESPN.com|language=en|date=November 13, 2018|access-date=April 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/rams/2018/11/13/mexico-city-nfl-game-moved-chiefs-rams/1993162002/|title=NFL moves Chiefs-Rams game from Mexico City to Los Angeles due to poor field conditions|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref> Chiefs CEO [[Clark Hunt]] said \"[The move is] 100 percent [about] player safety...\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article221668265.html|title=Clark Hunt says reason for Chiefs-Rams relocation was \u2019100 percent player safety\u2019|last=By|website=kansascity|language=en|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref>, as the NFL faced pressure from players who reportedly considered sitting out the game rather than risk potential injury.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2018/11/13/report-players-seriously-considering-not-playing-in-mexico-city/|title=Report: Some players \u201cseriously considering\u201d not playing in Mexico City|last=Alper|first=Josh|date=2018-11-13|website=ProFootballTalk|language=en|access-date=2019-04-13}}</ref>\n\nLeague rules required the designated home team (in this case, the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]]) to maintain availability of their home stadium as a contingency. Team officials and personnel worked quickly to secure facilities, logistics and event staff for the game, as the Rams were not scheduled to play at the Coliseum again for another month. The cancellation of the game in Mexico City was a disappointment to the NFL and local officials, and in particular to fans of both teams who had spent thousands of dollars for tickets and travel costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/colossal-shame-anger-mexico-city-loss-nfl-game-235715794.html|title='Colossal Shame,' anger in Mexico City over loss of NFL game|website=sports.yahoo.com}}</ref> Tickets purchased through either the Rams or Chiefs were refunded, and several air carriers offered travel credits for fans who had booked flights.\n\nAdded to the challenge of putting on the game itself was the fact that the [[Greater Los Angeles|Greater Los Angeles Area]] had itself been reeling in the wake of the [[Thousand Oaks shooting]] on November 7, in which 12 people were gunned down at a restaurant in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], and the [[Woolsey Fire]] which broke out a day later.

The fire continued to burn for nearly two weeks, including the time of the game itself. Many Rams employees were personally affected by the Woolsey Fire, with some being evacuated multiple times from their homes and nearby hotels as the fire threatened local communities. The Rams organization covered all emergency expenses for club personnel during the crisis.\n\n[[File:LATogether-towel.jpg|thumb|right|Towels featuring the \"LATogether\" logo were handed out to fans attending the game.]]\nThe [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] players and coaches had already traveled to [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] in order to prepare for the high-altitude conditions they expected to encounter in Mexico.

The Rams distributed more than 3,000 game tickets to first responders and people affected by the shooting and fires, and towels featuring the \"LATogether\" logo were handed out to fans attending the game. The [[Ventura County Sheriff's Office|Ventura County Sheriff]]\u2019s Honor Guard presented the colors as members of the Cal Lutheran University choir performed the national anthem before the game.

Following a [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] punt, the Rams mounted a 10-play, 83-yard drive that ended with Goff connecting with wide receiver [[Josh Reynolds (American football)|Josh Reynolds]] from four yards out and (with a successful Zuerlein PAT) a 13-0 lead for Los Angeles. The Chiefs struck back quickly on their next drive as running back [[Kareem Hunt]] had a 27-yard run while quarterback [[Patrick Mahomes]] completed three straight passes for 48 yards, the last going 25 yards to wide receiver [[Tyreek Hill]] for a touchdown. The Rams, who benefited from nine penalties called on the Chiefs in the opening period, started from their own 16 and ended the first quarter with 3rd-and-goal at the Kansas City 5-yard-line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201811190ram.htm|title=Kansas City Chiefs at Los Angeles Rams - November 19th, 2018|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Second quarter===\nFollowing an incomplete pass, Zuerlein converted a 23-yard field goal to put the Rams up 16-7. From there, Mahomes and Hunt led the Chiefs down to L.A.'s 1-yard-line. But on 3rd-and-goal, Hunt was tackled for a 1-yard loss by Rams strong safety [[John Johnson (safety)|John Johnson]], forcing Kansas City to settle for a 21-yard field goal by [[Harrison Butker]]. On the Rams' next drive, Goff was sacked twice, the second by defensive end [[Allen Bailey]], who stripped Goff of the ball and recovered the fumble himself at the Ram 21. The Chiefs cashed in quickly as Mahomes hit Hunt for a 21-yard screen pass that with Butker's PAT put Kansas City on top 17-16. The Rams stalled on their next drive, but punter [[Johnny Hekker]]'s 55-yard punt pinned the Chiefs inside their own 10. The Chiefs moved out to their own 22, when on 2nd-and-8 just after the two-minute warning, Mahomes was sacked by Rams defensive tackle [[Aaron Donald]] and separated from the ball, which was picked up by linebacker [[Samson Ebukam]] at the 11 and taken in for a touchdown and a 23-17 advantage for the Rams.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2018/11/19/nfl-rams-aaron-donald-fumble-sack/|title=Watch: Aaron Donald forces 2 fumbles, 1 returned for TD|date=2018-11-20|website=Rams Wire|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> Mahomes shook off the turnover and rallied the Chiefs by completing six passes in seven attempts on a 69-yard drive that ended with an 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Chris Conley (American football)|Chris Conley]] with 20 seconds remaining before halftime.

From there, Jared Goff completed four passes to guide the Rams to the Chief 7. Finding no one open on 3rd-and-goal, Goff ran it in himself for the touchdown, lobbing the football over the crossbar as Los Angeles seized a 30-23 lead. The Chiefs tied things up on their next possession, with tight end [[Travis Kelce]] taking a Mahomes pass for a 33-yard catch-and-run to set up a 1st-and-goal situation. Two plays later, Mahomes and Kelce connected again for a 4-yard touchdown and a 30-30 deadlock. The Rams retaliated as Goff found running back [[Todd Gurley]] for screen passes of 19 and 13 yards. Los Angeles drove down to the Kansas City 15, where Zuerlein converted his second field goal of the night, this time from 33 yards out and a 33-30 lead. Following a touchback, Mahomes' short pass attempt was intercepted at the line of scrimmage by Ebukam, who returned it 25 yards for a touchdown (plowing over Mahomes and Hunt at the goal line) to put the Rams up by 10 points, 40-30.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2018/11/19/nfl-los-angeles-rams-samson-ebukam-patrick-mahomes/|title=Watch: Samson Ebukam picks Patrick Mahomes, runs over QB for 2nd TD|date=November 20, 2018|website=Rams Wire|language=en|access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nAfter the teams traded punts on the next two possessions, the Chiefs swung momentum their way with Mahomes throwing deep to a wide-open Hill for a 73-yard touchdown pass play. On the Rams' next drive, Goff was sacked by linebacker [[Justin Houston]] who stripped the ball away. Allen Bailey, who had forced and recovered a Goff fumble earlier in the game, grabbed the ball before it had a chance to hit the ground and returned it two yards for a touchdown to put Kansas City back in the lead 44-40. The Rams came back as Goff found Josh Reynolds (27 yards) and Robert Woods (36 yards) for big gains that led to a 7-yard scoring strike to tight end [[Gerald Everett]] and a 47-44 edge for L.A. Both teams went three-and-out on their next possessions before Mahomes led a six-play, 65-yard drive that ended with a 10-yard score to Conley with 2:47 remaining, Mahomes' sixth touchdown pass of the game (matching his own team record), as the Chiefs went up 51-47. But it would take only six plays for the Rams to regain the lead, as Goff found Everett deep down the right sideline. Everett beat the coverage by Chiefs safety [[Daniel Sorensen]], gathered in the pass at the Chiefs 15, then tiptoed down the sideline to stay in bounds for the 40-yard touchdown reception and a 54-51 lead. With 1:44 left in the game, Mahomes drove the Chiefs to midfield, but a deep pass attempt was intercepted by Rams cornerback [[Marcus Peters]], who was facing his former team for the first time. L.A. looked set to run out the clock, but a false start penalty on tackle [[Andrew Whitworth]] took the Rams out of their game plan, and they were forced to punt. Hekker, a four-time all-pro punter, then boomed his kick 68 yards into the Chiefs end zone. Tyreek Hill returned the punt 14 yards to the Kansas City 12 with under a minute remaining. Mahomes connected with Kelce and Conley for short passes, but throwing under pressure from his own 26, Mahomes' last deep pass was picked off by Rams safety [[Lamarcus Joyner]], and Los Angeles was able to run out the remaining 13 seconds as Goff took a final kneeldown.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/11/20/mahomes-5-turnovers-loom-large-in-chiefs-loss-to-rams/38570293/|title=Mahomes 5 turnovers loom large in Chiefs loss to Rams|website=USA TODAY|language=en|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Statistics===\n\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Los Angeles Rams|border=2}};text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Kansas City Chiefs at Los Angeles Rams&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|date={{tooltip|November 19|Monday}}\n|time=7:15&nbsp;p.m. CST/5:15&nbsp;p.m. PST\n|road=Chiefs\n|R1=7|R2=16|R3=7|R4=21\n|home='''Rams'''\n|H1=13|H2=10|H3=17|H4=14\n|stadium=Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles, California\n|attendance=77,002\n|weather={{convert|65|F|C}}, cloudy\n|referee=Clete Blakeman\n|TV=ESPN/KABC\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Joe Tessitore]], [[Jason Witten]], [[Booger McFarland]] and [[Lisa Salters]]\n|reference=[http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2018111900/2018/REG11/chiefs@rams Recap], [http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/57727/LA_Gamebook.pdf Gamebook]\n|scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n* LAR - [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] 7-yard pass from [[Jared Goff]] ([[Greg Zuerlein (American football)|Greg Zuerlein]] kick failed), 12:00.

However, the Rams lost the Super Bowl to the [[2018 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], 13\u20133.\n\nThe Chiefs also won three of their remaining five games to finish 12\u20134, winning the [[AFC West]] and clinching the AFC's top playoff seed.  After defeating the [[2018 Indianapolis Colts season|Indianapolis Colts]] in the Divisional Round, 31\u201313, the Chiefs lost the AFC Championship game to the Patriots, 37\u201331 in overtime, preventing a possible Super Bowl re-match with the Rams.  Quarterback [[Patrick Mahomes]] was named the [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|2018 NFL Most Valuable Player]].\n\nWith 105 points, the game was the highest-scoring game in the history of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', bettering a 48-47 [[Green Bay Packers]] victory over the [[Washington Redskins]] in {{nfly|1983}}. It was also the [[List of highest scoring NFL games|third-highest total score in NFL history]].  The only higher scores were a {{nfly|1966}} game in which the [[Washington Redskins]] defeated the [[New York Giants]], 72\u201341 (113 points), and a {{nfly|2004}} game in which the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] defeated the [[Cleveland Browns]], 58\u201348 (106 points).\n\n[[ESPN]]'s broadcast garnered an overnight rating of 11.3, the best showing for a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game since 2014, with an estimated live TV audience of seven million viewers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/chiefs-rams-instant-classic-huge-ratings-monday-night-football-162018871.html|title=Chiefs-Rams instant classic does huge ratings for 'Monday Night Football'|date=November 20, 2018 |website=ESPN |access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nRams quarterback [[Jared Goff]] completed 31 of 49 passes for 413 yards. It was also his third fourth quarter comeback victory in four weeks, fourth of the season and fifth of his career. Wide receiver [[Brandin Cooks]] had eight receptions for 107 yards to lead the Rams in both categories. Fellow wide receiver [[Josh Reynolds (American football)|Josh Reynolds]] (80 yards, 1 TD) and tight end [[Tyler Higbee]] (63 yards) both had six receptions each, while wide receiver [[Robert Woods (wide receiver, born 1992)|Robert Woods]] added four receptions for 72 yards and a TD. Tight end Gerald Everett had 49 yards on three receptions, two of which went for touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including what would ultimately be the game-winning score. Rams running back [[Todd Gurley]] had 12 carries for 55 yards to add to his NFL rushing yardage lead and to put him over 1,000 yards rushing for the third time in his four-year career. However, Gurley (who also added three receptions for 39 yards) was held without a touchdown for the first time in the season, ending his team-record 13-game touchdown scoring streak, which was tied with [[John Riggins]], [[George Rogers (American football)|George Rogers]], and [[Jerry Rice]] for the third-longest in NFL history. On defense, linebacker [[Samson Ebukam]] was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week after scoring touchdowns on an interception and a fumble recovery return with three tackles and a sack. [[Aaron Donald]] had two sacks and two forced fumbles, and [[John Johnson (safety)|John Johnson]] led the Rams with 11 tackles.\n\nFor the Chiefs Mahomes threw for a career-high 478 yards on 33-for-46 passing, the second-highest single-game total in Chiefs team history. Mahomes also threw for six touchdowns for the second time in 2018 (matching the team record he already shared with Hall of Famer [[Len Dawson]]), but was intercepted three times and fumbled twice. Wide receiver [[Tyreek Hill]] had the best single-game performance of his career with 10 catches for 215 yards and two touchdowns. Tight end [[Travis Kelce]] also had 10 receptions for 127 yards and a touchdown, and wide receiver [[Chris Conley]] added seven receptions for 72 yards with two TDs. Running back [[Kareem Hunt]] had 14 carries for 70 yards on the ground and three receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown. Defensively, cornerback [[Ron Parker]] had a team-high eight tackles, while linebacker [[Anthony Hitchens]], cornerback [[Steven Nelson]], and defensive tackle [[Chris Jones (defensive tackle, born 1994)|Chris Jones]] had six tackles each, with Jones leading the Chiefs with two sacks.\n\nAt the [[2019 ESPY Awards]], the Chiefs\u2013Rams battle was named \"[[Best Game ESPY Award|Best Game]],\" with Mahomes and Goff accepting the award on behalf of their respective teams.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.turfshowtimes.com/2019/7/11/20690002/los-angeles-rams-win-espy-award-best-game-chiefs-monday-night-football-instant-classic |title=Los Angeles Rams, Kansas City Chiefs win ESPY award for best game |date=July 11, 2019 |website=Turf Show Times |access-date=August 31, 2019}}</ref> The game was also named the top L.A. sports moment of 2018 by the Los Angeles Sports Council.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-morning-briefing-20190329-story.html |title=Morning Briefing: Rams-Chiefs named top L.A. sports moment of 2018 |date=March 29, 2019 |website=ESPN |access-date=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nFor [[NFL Network]]'s \"100 Greatest Games,\" the 2018 Rams-Chiefs game was ranked No. 33 on the list.

Ichimoku takes into consideration the factor of time as an additional element along with the price action, similar to [[William Delbert Gann]]'s trading ideas.\n\nIn the [[Western world]], it is solely known for its \u201cGraphic Environment\u201d, due to the fact that authors have not translated the original manual into English, German, nor Spanish. However, Ichimoku is also integrated by three other theories that improve and enhance the indicator:\n\n* Time Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Time Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/ichimoku-time-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Wave Movement Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Wave Movement Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-3-ichimoku-wave-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Target Price Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Price Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-4-target-price-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n\n==The key elements of Ichimoku's Graphic Environment==\n\n===Tenkan-sen===\nTenkan-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u8ee2\u63db|\u8ee2\u63db]][[:wikt:\u7dda|\u7dda]]}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the last 9 periods.\n\nIt is primarily used as a signal line and a minor support/resistance line. Tenkan Sen (red line): This is also known as the turning line and is derived by averaging the highest high and the lowest low for the past nine periods. ''The Tenkan Sen is an indicator of the market trend. If the red line is moving up or down, it indicates that the market is trending. If it moves horizontally, it signals that the market is ranging''.\n\n===Kijun-sen===\nKijun-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u57fa\u6e96|\u57fa\u6e96]]\u7dda}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the past 26 periods.\n\nThis is a confirmation line, a support/resistance line, and can be used as a trailing stop line. The Kijun Sen acts as an indicator of future price movement. If the price is higher than the blue line, it could continue to climb higher. If the price is below the blue line, it could keep dropping.\n\n===Senkou span A===\nSenkou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u5148\u884c|\u5148\u884c]]}}) span A calculation: (Tenkan-sen + kijun-sen)/2 plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 1, this line forms one edge of the kumo or cloud.\n\nIf the price is above the Senkou span, the top line serves as the first support level while the bottom line serves as the second support level.\n\nIf the price is below the Senkou span, the bottom line forms the first resistance level while the top line is the second resistance level.\n\n===Senkou span B===\nSenkou span B calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 calculated over the past 52 time periods and plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 2, this line forms the other edge of the Kumo.\n\n===Kumo===\nKumo ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u96f2|\u96f2]]}}, cloud) is the space between Senkou span A and B. The cloud edges identify current and potential future support and resistance points.\n\nThe Kumo cloud changes in shape and height based on price changes. This height represents volatility as larger price movements form thicker clouds, which creates stronger support and resistance. As thinner clouds offer only weak support and resistance, prices can and tend to break through such thin clouds.\n\nGenerally, markets are bullish when Senkou Span A is above Senkou Span B and vice versa when markets are bearish.

Ichimoku takes into consideration the factor of time as an additional element along with the price action, similar to [[William Delbert Gann]]'s trading ideas.\n\nIn the [[Western world]], it is solely known for its \u201cGraphic Environment\u201d, due to the fact that authors have not translated the original manual into English, German, nor Spanish. However, Ichimoku is also integrated by three other theories that improve and enhance the indicator:\n\n* Time Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Time Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/ichimoku-time-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Wave Movement Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Wave Movement Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-3-ichimoku-wave-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Target Price Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Price Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-4-target-price-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n\n==The key elements of Ichimoku's Graphic Environment==\n\n===Tenkan-sen===\nTenkan-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u8ee2\u63db|\u8ee2\u63db]][[:wikt:\u7dda|\u7dda]]}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the last 9 periods.\n\nIt is primarily used as a signal line and a minor support/resistance line. Tenkan Sen (red line): This is also known as the turning line and is derived by averaging the highest high and the lowest low for the past nine periods. ''The Tenkan Sen is an indicator of the market trend. If the red line is moving up or down, it indicates that the market is trending. If it moves horizontally, it signals that the market is ranging''.\n\n===Kijun-sen===\nKijun-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u57fa\u6e96|\u57fa\u6e96]]\u7dda}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the past 26 periods.\n\nThis is a confirmation line, a support/resistance line, and can be used as a trailing stop line. The Kijun Sen acts as an indicator of future price movement. If the price is higher than the blue line, it could continue to climb higher. If the price is below the blue line, it could keep dropping.\n\n===Senkou span A===\nSenkou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u5148\u884c|\u5148\u884c]]}}) span A calculation: (Tenkan-sen + kijun-sen)/2 plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 1, this line forms one edge of the kumo or cloud.\n\nIf the price is above the Senkou span, the top line serves as the first support level while the bottom line serves as the second support level.\n\nIf the price is below the Senkou span, the bottom line forms the first resistance level while the top line is the second resistance level.\n\n===Senkou span B===\nSenkou span B calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 calculated over the past 52 time periods and plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 2, this line forms the other edge of the Kumo.\n\n===Kumo===\nKumo ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u96f2|\u96f2]]}}, cloud) is the space between Senkou span A and B. The cloud edges identify current and potential future support and resistance points.\n\nThe Kumo cloud changes in shape and height based on price changes. This height represents volatility as larger price movements form thicker clouds, which creates stronger support and resistance. As thinner clouds offer only weak support and resistance, prices can and tend to break through such thin clouds.\n\nGenerally, markets are bullish when Senkou Span A is above Senkou Span B and vice versa when markets are bearish. Traders often look for Kumo Twists in future clouds, where Senkou Span A and B exchange positions, a signal of potential trend reversals.\n\nIn addition to thickness, the strength of the cloud can also be ascertained by its angle; upwards for bullish and downwards for bearish. Any clouds behind price are also known as Kumo Shadows.\n\n===Chikou span===\nChikou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u9045\u884c|\u9045\u884c]]}}) span calculation: today's closing price projected back 26 days on the chart.\n\nAlso called the lagging span it is used as a support/resistance aid.\n\nIf the Chikou Span or the green line crosses the price in the bottom-up direction, that is a buy signal. If the green line crosses the price from the top-down, that is a sell signal.\n\n== The key elements of Ichimoku's Time Theory ==\n\nGoichi Hosoda also developed the time theory by differentiating 3-time ranges and two different levels: simple and compound.\n\n===Numerical values===\n\nSimple ranges\n[[File:= SIMPLE ranges.png|thumb|Simple ranges at Ichimoku]]\n\nCompound ranges\n[[File:= COMPOUND RANGES.png|thumb|Compound ranges at Ichimoku]]\n\n===Equality in the numerical values or Taitou-Suchi===\n\nHen-Gi: Using a numerical value that happened before and applying it from another\n\nJyu-Gi: Proposing a numerical value that happened before and applying it from a point between the time range\n\n== The key elements of Ichimoku wave movement theory ==\n\nHosoda knew about [[Elliott wave principle]] but his renderings about it were not as complex as Elliott\u2019s.

Her Roman equivalent is '''Discordia''', which means \"discord\". Eris's Greek opposite is [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], whose Roman counterpart is [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]].<ref>Ruoff, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KaARAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA329 s.v.

The [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] is named after the goddess.\n\nShe had no temples in ancient Greece (Concordia had one in Rome){{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}, and functions essentially as a [[personification]], as which she appears in [[Homer]] and many later works.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Eris'' is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb \u1f40\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''orinein'', \"to raise, stir, excite,\" and the proper name \u1f18\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cd\u03b5\u03c2 ''[[Erinyes]]'' have been suggested. [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejects these derivations and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.<ref>[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 459).</ref>\n\n==Characteristics in Greek mythology==\n[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|right|''[[El Juicio de Paris (Simonet)|El Juicio de Paris]]'' by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1904]]\n[[File:Golden Apple of Discord by Jacob Jordaens.jpg|thumb|''Golden [[apple of discord]]'' by [[Jakob Jordaens]], 1633]]\n[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|''Das Urteil des Paris'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], c. 1757]]\n\nIn [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' 11\u201324, two different goddesses named Eris are distinguished:\n\n<blockquote><poem>So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due.\n\nBut the other is the elder daughter of dark Night ([[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]), and the son of Cronus  [i.e. [[Zeus]]] who sits above and dwells in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel.</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' (226\u2013232), Strife, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:\n\n:And hateful Eris bore painful [[Ponos]] (\"Hardship\"),\n:[[Lethe]] (\"Forgetfulness\") and [[Limos (mythology)|Limos]] (\"Starvation\") and the tearful [[Algos|Algea]] (\"Pains\"),\n:[[Hysminai]] (\"Battles\"), [[Makhai]] (\"Wars\"), [[Phonoi]] (\"Murders\"), and [[Androctasiai|Androktasiai]] (\"Manslaughters\");\n:[[Neikea]] (\"Quarrels\"), Pseudea (\"Lies\"), Logoi (\"Stories\"), [[Amphillogiai]] (\"Disputes\")\n:[[Dysnomia (mythology)|Dysnomia]] (\"Anarchy\") and [[At\u00eb|Ate]] (\"Ruin\"), near one another,\n:and [[Horkos]] (\"Oath\"), who most afflicts men on earth,\n:Then willing swears a false oath.<ref>Caldwell, p. 42 lines 226-232, with the meanings of the names (in parentheses), as given by Caldwell, p. 40 on lines 212&ndash;232.</ref>\n\n\nThe other Strife is presumably she who appears in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Book&nbsp;IV; equated with [[Enyo]] as sister of [[Ares]] and so presumably daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]]:\n\n<blockquote>Strife whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. She also has [[Enyalius|a son whom she named Strife]].</blockquote>\n\nEnyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] in Book 11, of the same work.\n\nThe most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the [[Trojan War]] by causing the [[Judgement of Paris]]. The goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and [[Aphrodite]] had been invited along with the rest of [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]] to the forced wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], who would become the parents of [[Achilles]], but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.\n\nShe therefore (as mentioned at the ''[[Cypria|Kypria]]'' according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and [[Themis]]) tossed into the party the [[Apple of Discord]], a golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]] inscribed {{lang-grc|[[Kallisti|\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3]]|translit=t\u0113(i) kallist\u0113(i)}} &nbsp;\u2013 \"For the most beautiful one\", or \"To the Fairest One\"&nbsp;\u2013 provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of [[Troy]], was appointed to select the fairest by [[Zeus]]. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris's decision, and also attempted to bribe him. [[Hera]] offered political power; [[Athena]] promised infinite wisdom; and [[Aphrodite]] tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta]]. While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.\n\nIn [[Nonnus]]'s ''Dionysiaca'', 2.356, when [[Typhon]] prepares to battle with Zeus:\n\n<blockquote>Eris (\"Strife\") was Typhon's escort in the mel\u00e9e, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (\"Victory\") led Zeus to battle.</blockquote>\n\nAnother story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of [[Polytekhnos]] and [[Aedon]]. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, \"Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!\" Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos's son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.\n\n==Cultural influences==\n===Discordianism===\n{{Main|Discordianism}}\nEris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern [[Discordianism|Discordian]] religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Gregory Hill]] and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] under the [[pen name]]s of \"[[Malaclypse the Younger]]\" and \"Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst\". The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original, wherein she is depicted as a positive (albeit mischievous) force of chaotic creation.\n\nA quote from the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', the first holy book of Discordianism, attempts to clear up the matter:\n\n{{quote|One day Mal-2 consulted his [[Pineal gland|Pineal Gland]] and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. \"They were,\" She added, \"victims of indigestion, you know.\"\n\nSuffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious. But she is mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the ''Principia'', and is referred to as the [[Discordianism#The \"original snub\"|Original Snub]]. The ''Principia Discordia'' states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister [[Aneris]] (called the equivalent of [[Harmonia (Greek goddess)|Harmonia]] by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is Spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/64.php |title=Page 57 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n\nDiscordian Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality, in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth. Discordian Eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos, and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through. This is known as the Aneristic Illusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/56.php|title=Principia Discordia - Page 49|website=www.principiadiscordia.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}</ref>\n\nIn this telling, Eris becomes something of a patron saint of chaotic creation:\n\n{{Quote|text=I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe concept of Eris as developed by the ''Principia Discordia'' is used and expanded upon in the [[science fiction]] work ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (in which characters from ''Principia Discordia'' appear). In this work, Eris is a major character.<ref name=\"starship\">[http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm \"Robert Anton Wilson: Searching For Cosmic Intelligence\" by Jeffrey Elliot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614022635/http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm |date=June 14, 2006 }} Interview discussing novel (URL accessed 21 February 2006)</ref>\n\n===Other===\nThe classic [[fairy tale]] ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' is partly inspired by Eris's role in the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]].

Her Roman equivalent is '''Discordia''', which means \"discord\". Eris's Greek opposite is [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]], whose Roman counterpart is [[Concordia (mythology)|Concordia]].<ref>Ruoff, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KaARAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA329 s.v. Eris, p. 329].</ref> [[Homer]] equated her with the war-goddess [[Enyo]], whose Roman counterpart is [[Bellona (goddess)|Bellona]]. The [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]] is named after the goddess.\n\nShe had no temples in ancient Greece (Concordia had one in Rome){{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}, and functions essentially as a [[personification]], as which she appears in [[Homer]] and many later works.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Eris'' is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb \u1f40\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ''orinein'', \"to raise, stir, excite,\" and the proper name \u1f18\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cd\u03b5\u03c2 ''[[Erinyes]]'' have been suggested. [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejects these derivations and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.<ref>[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 459).</ref>\n\n==Characteristics in Greek mythology==\n[[File:Enrique Simonet - El Juicio de Paris - 1904.jpg|thumb|right|''[[El Juicio de Paris (Simonet)|El Juicio de Paris]]'' by [[Enrique Simonet]], 1904]]\n[[File:Golden Apple of Discord by Jacob Jordaens.jpg|thumb|''Golden [[apple of discord]]'' by [[Jakob Jordaens]], 1633]]\n[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|''Das Urteil des Paris'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], c. 1757]]\n\nIn [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' 11\u201324, two different goddesses named Eris are distinguished:\n\n<blockquote><poem>So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due.\n\nBut the other is the elder daughter of dark Night ([[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]]), and the son of Cronus  [i.e. [[Zeus]]] who sits above and dwells in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel.</poem></blockquote>\n\nIn Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]]'' (226\u2013232), Strife, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:\n\n:And hateful Eris bore painful [[Ponos]] (\"Hardship\"),\n:[[Lethe]] (\"Forgetfulness\") and [[Limos (mythology)|Limos]] (\"Starvation\") and the tearful [[Algos|Algea]] (\"Pains\"),\n:[[Hysminai]] (\"Battles\"), [[Makhai]] (\"Wars\"), [[Phonoi]] (\"Murders\"), and [[Androctasiai|Androktasiai]] (\"Manslaughters\");\n:[[Neikea]] (\"Quarrels\"), Pseudea (\"Lies\"), Logoi (\"Stories\"), [[Amphillogiai]] (\"Disputes\")\n:[[Dysnomia (mythology)|Dysnomia]] (\"Anarchy\") and [[At\u00eb|Ate]] (\"Ruin\"), near one another,\n:and [[Horkos]] (\"Oath\"), who most afflicts men on earth,\n:Then willing swears a false oath.<ref>Caldwell, p. 42 lines 226-232, with the meanings of the names (in parentheses), as given by Caldwell, p. 40 on lines 212&ndash;232.</ref>\n\n\nThe other Strife is presumably she who appears in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' Book&nbsp;IV; equated with [[Enyo]] as sister of [[Ares]] and so presumably daughter of [[Zeus]] and [[Hera]]:\n\n<blockquote>Strife whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. She also has [[Enyalius|a son whom she named Strife]].</blockquote>\n\nEnyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] in Book 11, of the same work.\n\nThe most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the [[Trojan War]] by causing the [[Judgement of Paris]]. The goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and [[Aphrodite]] had been invited along with the rest of [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]] to the forced wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], who would become the parents of [[Achilles]], but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.\n\nShe therefore (as mentioned at the ''[[Cypria|Kypria]]'' according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and [[Themis]]) tossed into the party the [[Apple of Discord]], a golden [[apple (symbolism)|apple]] inscribed {{lang-grc|[[Kallisti|\u03c4\u1fc7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3]]|translit=t\u0113(i) kallist\u0113(i)}} &nbsp;\u2013 \"For the most beautiful one\", or \"To the Fairest One\"&nbsp;\u2013 provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], Prince of [[Troy]], was appointed to select the fairest by [[Zeus]]. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris's decision, and also attempted to bribe him. [[Hera]] offered political power; [[Athena]] promised infinite wisdom; and [[Aphrodite]] tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], wife of [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta]]. While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.\n\nIn [[Nonnus]]'s ''Dionysiaca'', 2.356, when [[Typhon]] prepares to battle with Zeus:\n\n<blockquote>Eris (\"Strife\") was Typhon's escort in the mel\u00e9e, [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] (\"Victory\") led Zeus to battle.</blockquote>\n\nAnother story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of [[Polytekhnos]] and [[Aedon]]. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, \"Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!\" Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos's son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.\n\n==Cultural influences==\n===Discordianism===\n{{Main|Discordianism}}\nEris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern [[Discordianism|Discordian]] religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by [[Gregory Hill (writer)|Gregory Hill]] and [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]] under the [[pen name]]s of \"[[Malaclypse the Younger]]\" and \"Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst\". The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original, wherein she is depicted as a positive (albeit mischievous) force of chaotic creation.\n\nA quote from the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', the first holy book of Discordianism, attempts to clear up the matter:\n\n{{quote|One day Mal-2 consulted his [[Pineal gland|Pineal Gland]] and asked Eris if She really created all of those terrible things. She told him that She had always liked the Old Greeks, but that they cannot be trusted with historic matters. \"They were,\" She added, \"victims of indigestion, you know.\"\n\nSuffice it to say that Eris is not hateful or malicious. But she is mischievous, and does get a little bitchy at times.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the ''Principia'', and is referred to as the [[Discordianism#The \"original snub\"|Original Snub]]. The ''Principia Discordia'' states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister [[Aneris]] (called the equivalent of [[Harmonia (Greek goddess)|Harmonia]] by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is Spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/64.php |title=Page 57 |publisher=Principia Discordia |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n\nDiscordian Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality, in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth. Discordian Eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos, and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through. This is known as the Aneristic Illusion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/56.php|title=Principia Discordia - Page 49|website=www.principiadiscordia.com|access-date=2017-09-22}}</ref>\n\nIn this telling, Eris becomes something of a patron saint of chaotic creation:\n\n{{Quote|text=I am chaos. I am the substance from which your artists and scientists build rhythms. I am the spirit with which your children and clowns laugh in happy anarchy. I am chaos. I am alive, and I tell you that you are free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ology.org/principia/ |title=The Principia Discordia |publisher=Ology.org |date=1997-04-21 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe concept of Eris as developed by the ''Principia Discordia'' is used and expanded upon in the [[science fiction]] work ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert Shea]] and [[Robert Anton Wilson]] (in which characters from ''Principia Discordia'' appear). In this work, Eris is a major character.<ref name=\"starship\">[http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm \"Robert Anton Wilson: Searching For Cosmic Intelligence\" by Jeffrey Elliot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614022635/http://www.rawilsonfans.com/articles/Starship.htm |date=June 14, 2006 }} Interview discussing novel (URL accessed 21 February 2006)</ref>\n\n===Other===\nThe classic [[fairy tale]] ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' is partly inspired by Eris's role in the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]].

Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132&nbsp;Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz, reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz, which is above the [[extremely high frequency|extremely high-frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400&nbsp;Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz. Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost. Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G. 5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high-bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell. 5G can support up to a million devices per square kilometer, while 4G supports only up to 100,000 devices per square kilometer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|title=Eight Reasons Why 5G Is Better Than 4G|date=March 16, 2018|publisher=[[Altran]]|author=Shatrughan Singh|accessdate=May 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525070540/https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|archive-date=May 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/clx-forum/1-million-iot-devices-per-square-km-are-we-ready-for-the-5g-transformation-5d2ba416a984|title=1 Million IoT Devices per Square Km \u2013 Are We Ready for the 5G Transformation?|first=C.

Radio Unit (RU) to the Distributor Unit (DU) being the NGFI-I (Next Generation Fronthaul Interface) and the DU to the Central Unit (CU) being the NGFI-II interface allowing a more diverse and cost-effective network. NGFI-I and NGFI-II have defined performance values which should be compiled to ensure different traffic types defined by the ITU are capable of being carried. 1914.3 standard is creating a new Ethernet frame format capable of carrying IQ data in a much more efficient way depending on the functional split utilized.

Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=2 | Cell types\n!

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

METIS achieved an early global consensus on these systems. In this sense, METIS played an important role of building consensus among other external major stakeholders prior to global standardization activities. This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]].

Low-band uses a similar frequency range as the predecessor, [[4G]]. 5G millimeter wave is the fastest, with actual speeds often being 1\u20132&nbsp;Gbit/s down. Frequencies are above 24&nbsp;GHz, reaching up to 72&nbsp;GHz, which is above the [[extremely high frequency|extremely high-frequency]] band's lower boundary. The reach is short, so more cells are required. Millimeter waves have difficulty traversing many walls and windows, so indoor coverage is limited.\n\n5G mid-band is the most widely deployed, in over 30 networks. Speeds in a 100&nbsp;MHz wide band are usually 100\u2013400&nbsp;Mbit/s down. In the lab and occasionally in the field, speeds can go over a gigabit per second. Frequencies deployed are from 2.4&nbsp;GHz to 4.2&nbsp;GHz. [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] and [[China Mobile]] are using 2.5&nbsp;GHz, while others are mostly between 3.3 and 4.2&nbsp;GHz. Many areas can be covered simply by upgrading existing towers, which lowers the cost. Mid-band networks have better reach, bringing the cost close to the cost of 4G. 5G low-band offers similar capacity to advanced 4G.\n\nThe industry project [[3GPP]] defines any system using \"[[5G NR]]\" (5G New Radio) software as, \"5G\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2017/08/02/understanding-3gpp-starting-basics|title=Understanding 3GPP \u2013 starting with the basics|date=2017-08-01|website=Qualcomm|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> a definition that came into general use by late 2018.

[[Analog signal]]s representing sounds and images are digitized in the telephone, converted by an [[analog to digital converter]] and transmitted as a stream of [[binary digit|bits]]. All the 5G wireless devices in a cell communicate by radio waves with a local [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] array and low power automated [[transceiver]] ([[transmitter]] and [[radio receiver|receiver]]) in the cell, over frequency channels assigned by the transceiver from a pool of frequencies that are reused in other cells. The local antennas are connected with the [[Public switched telephone network|telephone network]] and the [[Internet]] by a high-bandwidth [[optical fiber]] or wireless [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul connection]]. As in other cell networks, a mobile device crossing from one cell to another is automatically \"[[Handover|handed off]]\" seamlessly to the new cell. 5G can support up to a million devices per square kilometer, while 4G supports only up to 100,000 devices per square kilometer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|title=Eight Reasons Why 5G Is Better Than 4G|date=March 16, 2018|publisher=[[Altran]]|author=Shatrughan Singh|accessdate=May 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190525070540/https://connect.altran.com/2018/03/eight-reasons-why-5g-is-better-than-4g/|archive-date=May 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/clx-forum/1-million-iot-devices-per-square-km-are-we-ready-for-the-5g-transformation-5d2ba416a984|title=1 Million IoT Devices per Square Km \u2013 Are We Ready for the 5G Transformation?|first=C.

Also, these higher frequency 5G signals cannot penetrate solid objects easily, such as cars, trees, and walls, because of the nature of these higher frequency electromagnetic waves. 5G cells can be deliberately designed to be as inconspicuous as possible, which finds applications in places like restaurants and shopping malls. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|title=5G speed vs 5G range-What is the value of 5G speed,5G range|website=rfwireless-world.com|access-date=April 21, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224510/http://www.rfwireless-world.com/Terminology/5G-Speed-Vs-5G-Range.html|archive-date=April 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! colspan=2 | Cell types\n!

Small cells are critical to 5G networks, as 5G's radio waves can't travel long distances, because of 5G's higher frequencies.\n\n=== Beamforming ===\n{{main|Beamforming}}\nBeamforming, as the name suggests, is used to direct radio waves to a target. This is achieved by combining elements in an antenna array in such a way that signals at particular angles experience constructive interference while others experience destructive interference. This improves signal quality and data transfer speeds. 5G uses beamforming due to the improved signal quality it provides. Beamforming can be accomplished using [[phased array]] antennas.\n\n=== Wifi-cellular convergence ===\nOne expected benefit of the transition to 5G is the convergence of multiple networking functions to achieve cost, power, and complexity reductions. LTE has targeted convergence with [[Wi-Fi]] band/technology via various efforts, such as [[License Assisted Access]] (LAA; 5G signal in unlicensed frequency bands that are also used by Wi-Fi) and [[LTE-WLAN Aggregation]] (LWA; convergence with Wi-Fi Radio), but the differing capabilities of cellular and Wi-Fi have limited the scope of convergence. However, significant improvement in cellular performance specifications in 5G, combined with migration from Distributed [[Radio access network|Radio Access Network]] (D-RAN) to Cloud- or Centralized-RAN ([[C-RAN]]) and rollout of cellular [[small cell]]s can potentially narrow the gap between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in dense and indoor deployments. Radio convergence could result in sharing ranging from the aggregation of cellular and Wi-Fi channels to the use of a single silicon device for multiple radio access technologies.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n=== NOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) ===\n{{main|NOMA (5G)}}\nNOMA (non-orthogonal multiple access) is a proposed multiple-access technique for future cellular systems via allocation of power.\n\n=== SDN/NFV ===\n{{main|Software-defined networking|SD-WAN|Network function virtualization|5G network slicing}}\nInitially, cellular mobile communications technologies were designed in the context of providing voice services and Internet access.

METIS achieved an early global consensus on these systems. In this sense, METIS played an important role of building consensus among other external major stakeholders prior to global standardization activities. This was done by initiating and addressing work in relevant global fora (e.g. ITU-R), as well as in national and regional regulatory bodies.<ref name=\"METIS presentation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|title=METIS projet presentation|date=November 2012|access-date=2014-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222211609/https://www.metis2020.com/wp-content/uploads/deliverables/METIS_project_presentation_public_Old.pdf|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Also in November 2012, the iJOIN EU project was launched, focusing on \"[[small cell]]\" technology, which is of key importance for taking advantage of limited and strategic resources, such as the [[radio wave]] [[spectrum]].

The show is in the form of a revue, and not a condensed version of either the film or Broadway show. However, it features the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|award-winning music]] from the first film, written by [[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]].

Simba is next seen as a young cub, with Mufasa teaching him about the \"Circle of Life\". Simba's uncle and Mufasa's brother Scar plots to take the throne for himself and tells Simba about an elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has warned Simba not to go. When Simba and his best friend Nala sneak off to the elephant graveyard, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, three hyenas aligned with Scar, attack and try to kill the two cubs, but they are stopped by Mufasa. Scar's next plan is to lure Simba into a gorge while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a cliff, which results in Scar flinging him into the stampede below and killing him. Scar then tricks Simba into thinking that he is responsible for his father's death and tells him to run away, only to later order the hyenas to kill Simba, but they fail. Scar informs the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed and that he is assuming the throne as the next in line. Simba is later found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, who adopt and raise him. It is not until Simba is a young adult lion that he meets Nala again, and the two lions fall in love. Along with Rafiki and Mufasa's ghost, Nala convinces Simba to return to the Pride Lands and claim the throne. Simba, along with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa go to the Pride Rock, where Simba confronts, fights, and defeats Scar, who is later betrayed and killed by his own army of hyenas as a result of Scar's blaming of the hyenas for Mufasa's death. The film concludes with the Pride Lands turning green with life again and Rafiki presenting Simba and Nala's newborn cub.\n\n''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' begins with the presentation of Simba and Nala's daughter named Kiara. Simba is very protective of his daughter and assigns Timon and Pumbaa to be her guardians. One day, the young cub sneaks into the Outlands, the place in which a group of lions loyal to Scar called the Outsiders reside after Simba exiles them from the Pride Lands. In the Outlands, Kiara meets a young male cub named Kovu, Scar's hand-chosen successor, and the two of them befriend each other until Simba and Kovu's mother, Zira arrive and a fight between Pride Landers and Outsiders almost takes place. Later in the film, Zira decides that she can use Kovu's new friendship with Kiara to get her revenge against Simba. Kiara is next seen as an adolescent lioness and is set to go for her first solo-hunt, but discovers that her father still sends Timon and Pumbaa to watch her. Furious, Kiara goes further from home until Zira's other children, Nuka and Vitani, set fire to the plains where Kiara is hunting, causing her to faint and giving Kovu the chance to rescue her. Simba finds that Kovu has helped Kiara and reluctantly allows him into the Pride Lands. While Simba struggles with the idea of accepting Kovu, Kiara and Kovu eventually fall in love. One morning, Simba invites Kovu for a walk but they are ambushed by Zira and her pride. They attack Simba but, while chasing him, Nuka got killed by the logs, resulting in Zira blaming and scratching Kovu for his death giving him a scar over his left eye. A wounded Simba exiles Kovu as he thinks Kovu was behind the ambush, but Kiara, knowing that Kovu would never do such a thing, runs away from Pride Rock against her father's orders and reunites with Kovu and convinces him to return with her to reunite their prides. Meanwhile, Zira leads her pride in a war against Simba and the Pridelanders and a fierce battle breaks out. Kovu and Kiara leap between them and Kiara reminds her father that, by his own words, \"we are one\". Zira refuses to end the battle, but Vitani and the other Outsiders understand Kiara's words and abandon their leader and join the Pridelanders. Now alone, Zira leaps for Simba, but Kiara pushes her away and they fall over a cliff. Kiara lands on a rock, but Zira slips and falls into the lake to death. Simba allows the Outsiders, including Kovu, to return to the Pride Lands, and Kovu is allowed to stand with Kiara at the top of Pride Rock.\n\n''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' is a retelling of the events of the first film from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective.\n\n''The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa'' follows the further adventures of the titular meerkat and warthog duo. The pair is normally seen having misadventures in the jungle, but sometimes find themselves across the globe in various settings. This series also has episodes centering on Rafiki, Zazu, and Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. In the episode \"Once Upon a Timon\", a pre-existing storyline of how Timon met Pumbaa was revealed. This may indicate that ''Timon & Pumbaa'' (or just said episode) and ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' exist in different continuities.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', the majority of the series takes place after Kiara meets Kovu, but before her first hunt. The series follows the adventures of Simba and Nala's son Kion as he assembles the titular group of animals to protect the Pride Lands. In Season 2, Scar, the antagonist of the original film makes his return in the animated series, and plots revenge against Simba and plans to overthrow him as King by gathering up all the Outlanders to form an army. In the special \"Battle for the Pride Lands\" which serves as a prequel and pilot for Season 3, Kion continues to battle the spirit of Scar. In a series of events (ones involving Janja's betrayal of Scar), Kion managed to defeat and destroy Scar forever, but not before receiving a facial wound identical to his great uncle's, courtesy of the cobra Ushari (who is later killed in the fight). Season 3 featured Kion journeying throughout the Pride Lands to the Tree of Life to heal his scar before the venom corrupts him into the lion Scar once was. The last 2 episodes of Season 3 take place after the war between Simba's pride & Zira's outsiders.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of The Lion King characters}}\n\nA total of thirteen supervising animators from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and [[Disney-MGM Studios]] were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the first film's main characters.

He taught them how lions greet one another by gently butting heads, and show affection by placing one's head under the other's chin, mannerisms that can be appreciated in Simba and Nala's encounter during the song \"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]\". Fowler also talked about how they protect themselves by lying on their backs and using their claws to ward off attackers, and how they fight rivals by rising on their hind legs.<ref name=LionKingProduction>{{cite web |url=http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |title=Lion King Production Notes |accessdate=August 5, 2008 |publisher=Lionking.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026100715/http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |archivedate=October 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Screenwriter [[Irene Mecchi]] joined the directing team to help in the character development process as well as to define each character's personality.

Disch's contract and film treatment |accessdate=November 29, 2008|publisher= www.jamescumminsbookseller.com }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The treatment, inspired by ''[[Hamlet]]'', was written by [[Thomas M. Disch]] (author of ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (novel)|The Brave Little Toaster]]'') as work-for-hire; Disch received no credit or royalties. Production took place at the Walt Disney Animation Studios in [[Glendale, California]]. Also, nearly 20 minutes of the film were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios.<ref name=LionKingProduction/> Ultimately, more than 600 artists, animators and technicians contributed to ''The Lion King'' over its lengthy production schedule. More than one million drawings were created for the film, including 1,197 hand-painted backgrounds and 119,058 individually colored frames of film.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/>\n\nIn October 1991, after finishing work on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' as Head of Story, [[Roger Allers]] joined ''The Lion King'', as the initial director. Allers worked for 6 months on story development and was then joined by co-director, [[Rob Minkoff]]. A 2-day story session was held to revamp the story with the two directors, Allers and Minkoff, joined by [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], directors of ''Beauty and the Beast'', and Producer [[Don Hahn]] who presided over the discussion. The creative think-tank produced a character makeover for Simba and a radically revised second half of the film.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/> [[Irene Mecchi]] joined the team that summer to help further develop the characters and define their personalities. Several months later, she was joined by [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]] in the rewriting process. Working together in the animation department and in conjunction with the directors and story team, they tackled the unresolved emotional issues in the script and also added many comic situations.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/> Some of the lead production crew made a trip to Africa to better understand the environment for the film. The trip gave production designer [[Chris Sanders (director)|Chris Sanders]] a new appreciation for the natural environments and inspired him to find ways to incorporate these elements into the design of the film.<ref name=LionKingProduction /> The filmmakers also made use of computers to better present their vision in new ways. The most notable use of [[computer animation]] is in the \"wildebeest stampede\" sequence. Several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Similar multiplication occurs in the \"[[Be Prepared (song)|Be Prepared]]\" musical number with identical marching hyenas.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Computer Animation|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|date=June 15, 1994}}</ref> Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the 2\u00bd minute stampede sequence.<ref name=LionKingProduction/>\n\nAt one time, the Disney Feature Animation staff felt ''The Lion King'' was less important than ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> Both projects were in production at the same time, and most of the staff preferred to work on ''Pocahontas'', believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> As it turned out, while both films were commercial successes, ''The Lion King'' received more positive feedback and larger grosses than ''Pocahontas''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pocahontas.htm |title=Pocahontas revenue |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219131040/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pocahontas.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"rottentomatoestlk\">{{cite web | website =[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title=The Lion King | url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/ | accessdate=September 24, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902001059/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/ | archive-date=September 2, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"rottentomatoespocahontas\">{{cite web | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title= ''Pocahontas'' | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/ | accessdate=September 17, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210090428/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/ | archive-date=February 10, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe sequel ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' was directed by [[Darrell Rooney]] and produced by Jeannine Roussel, with Flip Kobler and Cindy Marcus writing the screenplay.

It contains songs by songwriter [[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]], who wrote five original songs, with Elton John performing \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" during the end credits. Additionally, \"The Morning Report\", a song which was not present in the original theatrical film, was later added to the [[IMAX]] theater and to the [[DVD]] Platinum Edition release. The film's score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and supplemented with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by [[Lebo M]].<ref>{{cite video | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 1), Music: African Influence | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] | date=June 15, 1994}}</ref> Elton John thought his career had hit a new low when he was writing the music to the song \"[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legends.disney.go.com/legends/detail?key=Elton+John|title=Disney Legends: Elton John|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=August 5, 2008}}</ref> However, the strongly enthusiastic audience reception to an early [[film trailer]] which consisted solely of the opening sequence with the song \"[[Circle of Life]]\", suggested that the film would be very successful.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} Out of the five original songs, \"Hakuna Matata\" was listed at number 99 in the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] list in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicmovies.org/articles/afi100songs.htm|title=AFI's \"100 Years, 100 Songs|accessdate=August 9, 2008|publisher=Classic Movies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621231625/http://www.classicmovies.org/articles/afi100songs.htm|archive-date=June 21, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and \"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]\" won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for Best Original Song during the [[67th Academy Awards]].

Rhythm of the Pride Lands was initially printed in a very limited quantity. However, it was re-released in 2003, included in some international versions of The Lion King's special edition soundtrack with an additional track, \"Circle of Life\".\n\nAn audio CD entitled ''[[Return to Pride Rock: Songs Inspired by Disney's The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' was released on September 8, 1998. Although not promoted as a soundtrack to ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', it contained all the songs from the film and some additional songs inspired by it by Lebo M. Tina Turner recorded a version of \"He Lives in You\" for the film. On August 31, 2004, Disney released an \"enhanced soundtrack\" to coincide with the release of the film's 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. However, the CD only contains the songs featured in the film, without any of the inspired songs by the first film. ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert]]'' noted that it was best the film was direct-to-video, since the music was lacking and not remotely equal to the original's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/reviews.html?sec=6&subsec=The+Lion+King+II%3A+Simba%27s+Pride+ |title=The Lion King II: Simba's Pride - Siskel & Ebert }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack for the third film, ''The Lion King 1\u00bd: Songs From Timon and Pumbaa's Hilarious Adventure'', was released to CD by Disney on February 10, 2004.

The rest of the soundtrack includes various [[R&B]] tracks, including remakes of the [[Kool and the Gang]] classic \"Jungle Boogie\" by artist French, and two instrumental pieces from film composer [[Don Harper]].

Simba is next seen as a young cub, with Mufasa teaching him about the \"Circle of Life\". Simba's uncle and Mufasa's brother Scar plots to take the throne for himself and tells Simba about an elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has warned Simba not to go. When Simba and his best friend Nala sneak off to the elephant graveyard, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, three hyenas aligned with Scar, attack and try to kill the two cubs, but they are stopped by Mufasa. Scar's next plan is to lure Simba into a gorge while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a cliff, which results in Scar flinging him into the stampede below and killing him. Scar then tricks Simba into thinking that he is responsible for his father's death and tells him to run away, only to later order the hyenas to kill Simba, but they fail. Scar informs the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed and that he is assuming the throne as the next in line. Simba is later found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, who adopt and raise him. It is not until Simba is a young adult lion that he meets Nala again, and the two lions fall in love. Along with Rafiki and Mufasa's ghost, Nala convinces Simba to return to the Pride Lands and claim the throne. Simba, along with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa go to the Pride Rock, where Simba confronts, fights, and defeats Scar, who is later betrayed and killed by his own army of hyenas as a result of Scar's blaming of the hyenas for Mufasa's death. The film concludes with the Pride Lands turning green with life again and Rafiki presenting Simba and Nala's newborn cub.\n\n''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' begins with the presentation of Simba and Nala's daughter named Kiara. Simba is very protective of his daughter and assigns Timon and Pumbaa to be her guardians. One day, the young cub sneaks into the Outlands, the place in which a group of lions loyal to Scar called the Outsiders reside after Simba exiles them from the Pride Lands. In the Outlands, Kiara meets a young male cub named Kovu, Scar's hand-chosen successor, and the two of them befriend each other until Simba and Kovu's mother, Zira arrive and a fight between Pride Landers and Outsiders almost takes place. Later in the film, Zira decides that she can use Kovu's new friendship with Kiara to get her revenge against Simba. Kiara is next seen as an adolescent lioness and is set to go for her first solo-hunt, but discovers that her father still sends Timon and Pumbaa to watch her. Furious, Kiara goes further from home until Zira's other children, Nuka and Vitani, set fire to the plains where Kiara is hunting, causing her to faint and giving Kovu the chance to rescue her. Simba finds that Kovu has helped Kiara and reluctantly allows him into the Pride Lands. While Simba struggles with the idea of accepting Kovu, Kiara and Kovu eventually fall in love. One morning, Simba invites Kovu for a walk but they are ambushed by Zira and her pride. They attack Simba but, while chasing him, Nuka got killed by the logs, resulting in Zira blaming and scratching Kovu for his death giving him a scar over his left eye. A wounded Simba exiles Kovu as he thinks Kovu was behind the ambush, but Kiara, knowing that Kovu would never do such a thing, runs away from Pride Rock against her father's orders and reunites with Kovu and convinces him to return with her to reunite their prides. Meanwhile, Zira leads her pride in a war against Simba and the Pridelanders and a fierce battle breaks out. Kovu and Kiara leap between them and Kiara reminds her father that, by his own words, \"we are one\". Zira refuses to end the battle, but Vitani and the other Outsiders understand Kiara's words and abandon their leader and join the Pridelanders. Now alone, Zira leaps for Simba, but Kiara pushes her away and they fall over a cliff. Kiara lands on a rock, but Zira slips and falls into the lake to death. Simba allows the Outsiders, including Kovu, to return to the Pride Lands, and Kovu is allowed to stand with Kiara at the top of Pride Rock.\n\n''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' is a retelling of the events of the first film from Timon and Pumbaa's perspective.\n\n''The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa'' follows the further adventures of the titular meerkat and warthog duo. The pair is normally seen having misadventures in the jungle, but sometimes find themselves across the globe in various settings. This series also has episodes centering on Rafiki, Zazu, and Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. In the episode \"Once Upon a Timon\", a pre-existing storyline of how Timon met Pumbaa was revealed. This may indicate that ''Timon & Pumbaa'' (or just said episode) and ''The Lion King 1\u00bd'' exist in different continuities.\n\nIn ''The Lion Guard'', the majority of the series takes place after Kiara meets Kovu, but before her first hunt. The series follows the adventures of Simba and Nala's son Kion as he assembles the titular group of animals to protect the Pride Lands. In Season 2, Scar, the antagonist of the original film makes his return in the animated series, and plots revenge against Simba and plans to overthrow him as King by gathering up all the Outlanders to form an army. In the special \"Battle for the Pride Lands\" which serves as a prequel and pilot for Season 3, Kion continues to battle the spirit of Scar. In a series of events (ones involving Janja's betrayal of Scar), Kion managed to defeat and destroy Scar forever, but not before receiving a facial wound identical to his great uncle's, courtesy of the cobra Ushari (who is later killed in the fight). Season 3 featured Kion journeying throughout the Pride Lands to the Tree of Life to heal his scar before the venom corrupts him into the lion Scar once was. The last 2 episodes of Season 3 take place after the war between Simba's pride & Zira's outsiders.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of The Lion King characters}}\n\nA total of thirteen supervising animators from [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] and [[Disney-MGM Studios]] were responsible for establishing the personalities and setting the tone for the first film's main characters. The animation team studied real-life animals for reference, as was done for the earlier film ''[[Bambi]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/bambi/index.html |title=Bambi Notes |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228102553/http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/masterworks/bambi/index.html |archivedate=February 28, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The animation of the characters was created with supervision by wildlife experts such as [[Jim Fowler]], who visited the studio on several occasions with an assortment of lions and other jungle inhabitants to discuss behavior and help the animators give their drawings an authentic feel. He taught them how lions greet one another by gently butting heads, and show affection by placing one's head under the other's chin, mannerisms that can be appreciated in Simba and Nala's encounter during the song \"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]\". Fowler also talked about how they protect themselves by lying on their backs and using their claws to ward off attackers, and how they fight rivals by rising on their hind legs.<ref name=LionKingProduction>{{cite web |url=http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |title=Lion King Production Notes |accessdate=August 5, 2008 |publisher=Lionking.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026100715/http://www.lionking.org/text/FilmNotes.html |archivedate=October 26, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Screenwriter [[Irene Mecchi]] joined the directing team to help in the character development process as well as to define each character's personality.

Disch's contract and film treatment |accessdate=November 29, 2008|publisher= www.jamescumminsbookseller.com }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The treatment, inspired by ''[[Hamlet]]'', was written by [[Thomas M. Disch]] (author of ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (novel)|The Brave Little Toaster]]'') as work-for-hire; Disch received no credit or royalties. Production took place at the Walt Disney Animation Studios in [[Glendale, California]]. Also, nearly 20 minutes of the film were animated at the Disney-MGM Studios.<ref name=LionKingProduction/> Ultimately, more than 600 artists, animators and technicians contributed to ''The Lion King'' over its lengthy production schedule. More than one million drawings were created for the film, including 1,197 hand-painted backgrounds and 119,058 individually colored frames of film.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/>\n\nIn October 1991, after finishing work on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' as Head of Story, [[Roger Allers]] joined ''The Lion King'', as the initial director. Allers worked for 6 months on story development and was then joined by co-director, [[Rob Minkoff]]. A 2-day story session was held to revamp the story with the two directors, Allers and Minkoff, joined by [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], directors of ''Beauty and the Beast'', and Producer [[Don Hahn]] who presided over the discussion. The creative think-tank produced a character makeover for Simba and a radically revised second half of the film.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/> [[Irene Mecchi]] joined the team that summer to help further develop the characters and define their personalities. Several months later, she was joined by [[Jonathan Roberts (writer)|Jonathan Roberts]] in the rewriting process. Working together in the animation department and in conjunction with the directors and story team, they tackled the unresolved emotional issues in the script and also added many comic situations.<ref name=\"LionKingProduction\"/> Some of the lead production crew made a trip to Africa to better understand the environment for the film. The trip gave production designer [[Chris Sanders (director)|Chris Sanders]] a new appreciation for the natural environments and inspired him to find ways to incorporate these elements into the design of the film.<ref name=LionKingProduction /> The filmmakers also made use of computers to better present their vision in new ways. The most notable use of [[computer animation]] is in the \"wildebeest stampede\" sequence. Several distinct wildebeest characters were created in a 3D computer program, multiplied into hundreds, [[cel shading|cel shaded]] to look like drawn animation, and given randomized paths down a mountainside to simulate the real, unpredictable movement of a herd. Similar multiplication occurs in the \"[[Be Prepared (song)|Be Prepared]]\" musical number with identical marching hyenas.<ref>{{cite video|title=The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 2), Computer Animation|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]]|date=June 15, 1994}}</ref> Five specially trained animators and technicians spent more than two years creating the 2\u00bd minute stampede sequence.<ref name=LionKingProduction/>\n\nAt one time, the Disney Feature Animation staff felt ''The Lion King'' was less important than ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]''.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> Both projects were in production at the same time, and most of the staff preferred to work on ''Pocahontas'', believing it would be the more prestigious and successful of the two.<ref name=PlatinumEditionDVDOrigins /> As it turned out, while both films were commercial successes, ''The Lion King'' received more positive feedback and larger grosses than ''Pocahontas''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pocahontas.htm |title=Pocahontas revenue |accessdate=August 11, 2008 |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219131040/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pocahontas.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"rottentomatoestlk\">{{cite web | website =[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title=The Lion King | url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/ | accessdate=September 24, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902001059/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lion_king/ | archive-date=September 2, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"rottentomatoespocahontas\">{{cite web | website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | title= ''Pocahontas'' | url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/ | accessdate=September 17, 2006 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210090428/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1063809-pocahontas/ | archive-date=February 10, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe sequel ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' was directed by [[Darrell Rooney]] and produced by Jeannine Roussel, with Flip Kobler and Cindy Marcus writing the screenplay. Disney believed that ''Simba's Pride'' would be so popular that it shipped 15 million copies to stores for the October 27 release date.<ref>[http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=173545 ''Lion King II: Simba's Pride'' - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes] ''New York Times''</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[The Lion King (1994 soundtrack)|original motion picture soundtrack]] for the first film was released by [[Walt Disney Records]] on June 13, 1994, two days before the film's release. It contains songs by songwriter [[Elton John]] and [[Tim Rice]], who wrote five original songs, with Elton John performing \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" during the end credits. Additionally, \"The Morning Report\", a song which was not present in the original theatrical film, was later added to the [[IMAX]] theater and to the [[DVD]] Platinum Edition release. The film's score was composed by [[Hans Zimmer]] and supplemented with traditional African music and choir elements arranged by [[Lebo M]].<ref>{{cite video | title = The Lion King: Platinum Edition (Disc 1), Music: African Influence | medium = DVD | publisher = [[Walt Disney Home Entertainment]] | date=June 15, 1994}}</ref> Elton John thought his career had hit a new low when he was writing the music to the song \"[[Hakuna Matata (song)|Hakuna Matata]]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://legends.disney.go.com/legends/detail?key=Elton+John|title=Disney Legends: Elton John|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=August 5, 2008}}</ref> However, the strongly enthusiastic audience reception to an early [[film trailer]] which consisted solely of the opening sequence with the song \"[[Circle of Life]]\", suggested that the film would be very successful.{{Cn|date=November 2019}} Out of the five original songs, \"Hakuna Matata\" was listed at number 99 in the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] list in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicmovies.org/articles/afi100songs.htm|title=AFI's \"100 Years, 100 Songs|accessdate=August 9, 2008|publisher=Classic Movies|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621231625/http://www.classicmovies.org/articles/afi100songs.htm|archive-date=June 21, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and \"[[Can You Feel the Love Tonight]]\" won the [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for Best Original Song during the [[67th Academy Awards]].

Rhythm of the Pride Lands was initially printed in a very limited quantity. However, it was re-released in 2003, included in some international versions of The Lion King's special edition soundtrack with an additional track, \"Circle of Life\".\n\nAn audio CD entitled ''[[Return to Pride Rock: Songs Inspired by Disney's The Lion King II: Simba's Pride]]'' was released on September 8, 1998. Although not promoted as a soundtrack to ''The Lion King II: Simba's Pride'', it contained all the songs from the film and some additional songs inspired by it by Lebo M. Tina Turner recorded a version of \"He Lives in You\" for the film. On August 31, 2004, Disney released an \"enhanced soundtrack\" to coincide with the release of the film's 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. However, the CD only contains the songs featured in the film, without any of the inspired songs by the first film. ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel & Ebert]]'' noted that it was best the film was direct-to-video, since the music was lacking and not remotely equal to the original's soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/atm/reviews.html?sec=6&subsec=The+Lion+King+II%3A+Simba%27s+Pride+ |title=The Lion King II: Simba's Pride - Siskel & Ebert }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}</ref>\n\nThe soundtrack for the third film, ''The Lion King 1\u00bd: Songs From Timon and Pumbaa's Hilarious Adventure'', was released to CD by Disney on February 10, 2004. It includes two songs from the original film, \"That's All I Need\" and \"Hakuna Matata\", re-performed by Nathan Lane who took over the role of voicing the character Timon. The rest of the soundtrack includes various [[R&B]] tracks, including remakes of the [[Kool and the Gang]] classic \"Jungle Boogie\" by artist French, and two instrumental pieces from film composer [[Don Harper]]. The soundtrack also includes [[Ennio Morricone]]'s theme from \"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Lion-King-1-2/dp/B00018H6EY |title=Lion King 1\u00bd Soundtrack |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=September 25, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210152008/http://www.amazon.com/Lion-King-1-2/dp/B00018H6EY |archivedate=December 10, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nDuring its release in 1994, ''The Lion King'' was widely praised and acclaimed, grossing more than $783 million worldwide, becoming the most successful film released that year, and as of June 18, 2018 is the [[List of highest-grossing films|thirty-seventh highest-grossing feature film]] of all time.

Australian and United States forces sought to capture two major [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] bases, one in the town of [[Lae]], and another one at [[Salamaua]]. The campaign to take the Salamaua and Lae area began after the successful [[Battle of Wau|defence of Wau]] in late January, which was followed up by an Australian advance towards [[Battle of Mubo|Mubo]] as the Japanese troops that had attacked Wau withdrew to positions around Mubo. A series of actions followed over the course of several months as the Australian [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] advanced north-east towards Salamaua. After an amphibious [[landing at Nassau Bay]], the Australians were reinforced by a US regimental combat team, which subsequently advanced north up the coast.\n\nAs the Allies kept up the pressure on the Japanese around Salamaua, in early September they launched an [[Landing at Nadzab|airborne assault on Nadzab]], and a [[Landing at Lae|seaborne landing near Lae]], subsequently taking the town with simultaneous drives from the east and north-west. As the situation around Lae grew more desperate, the Salamaua garrison withdrew, and it was captured on 11 September 1943, while Lae fell shortly afterwards on 16 September, bringing the campaign to an end.\n\n==Background==\nIn March 1942, the Japanese [[Invasion of Salamaua\u2013Lae|secured Salamaua and Lae]] and subsequently established major bases on the north coast of [[New Guinea]], in the large town of Lae, and in Salamaua, a small administrative town and port 35 kilometres (22&nbsp;mi) to the south. Salamaua was a staging post for [[Operation Mo|attacks on Port Moresby]], such as the [[Kokoda Track campaign]], and a forward operating base for Japanese aviation.{{sfn|James|2014|p=189}} When the attacks failed, the Japanese turned the port into a major supply base. Logistical limitations meant that the Salamaua\u2013Lae area could garrison only 10,000 Japanese personnel: 2,500 seamen and 7,500 soldiers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/pages/NT000091A6?openDocument |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525235719/http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/pages/NT000091A6?openDocument |archivedate=25 May 2010 |title=Attitudes to the War \u2013 Southern Cross: X The Attack and Defence at Lae and Salamaua |website=Australia-Japan Research Project |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> The defences were centred on the Okabe Detachment, a [[brigade]]-sized force from the [[51st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|51st Division]] under Major General [[Toru Okabe]].{{sfn|Trigellis-Smith|1994|pp=313\u2013316}}\n\nIn January 1943, the Okabe Detachment was defeated in an [[Battle of Wau|attack on the Australian base of Wau]], about 40 kilometres (25&nbsp;mi) away.

The [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] was the result, and a quick follow up landing was subsequently undertaken at [[Battle of Scarlet Beach|Scarlet Beach]] by the [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]].{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=315}}\n\nDespite initial plans to do so, Salamaua was not developed as a base.  The Australian I Corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, visited Salamaua by [[PT boat]] on 14 September 1943, three days after its capture, and found little more than bomb craters and corrugated iron.  He recommended cancelling the development of Salamaua and concentrating all available resources on Lae. The base that had originally been envisaged now looked like a waste of effort, because Salamaua was a poor site for a port or airbase. However, in drawing the Japanese attention away from Lae at a critical time, the assault on Salamaua had already served its purpose.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}\n\nLae, on the other hand, was subsequently transformed into two bases: the Australian Lae Base Sub Area and the [[USASOS]] Base E. Herring combined the two as the Lae Fortress, under Milford. Because Blamey had launched Postern before the logistical preparations were complete, most of the units needed to operate the base were not yet available.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/documents/wwii/lae-port.htm |author=Historical Section, Army Forces Western Pacific |title=Military History of the United States Army Services of Supply in the Southwest Pacific: Chapter 18: Base at Lae Until March 1944 |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of Lae as a port was to supply the airbase at Nadzab, but this was compromised because the Markham Valley Road was found to be in poor condition. To expedite the development of Nadzab, minimal efforts were made to repair it, and heavy military traffic bound for Nadzab was permitted to use it. The road was closed following heavy rains on 7 October and did not reopen until December. Until then, Nadzab had to be supplied by air, and its development was slow because heavy engineer units could not get through.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Bradley |first=Phillip |title=To Salamaua |publisher=Cambridge University Press  |location= Port Melbourne, Victoria  |year= 2010 |isbn=9780521763905|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Buggy |first=Hugh |title=Pacific Victory: A Short History of Australia's Part in the War Against Japan |year=1945 |publisher=Victorian Railway Printing Works |location=North Melbourne, Victoria |oclc=2411075 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Coulthard-Clark|first=Chris|title=The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|year=1998|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=Sydney, New South Wales |isbn=1-86448-611-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dexter |first=David |title=The New Guinea Offensives |series=[[Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945]].

War II. Australian and United States forces sought to capture two major [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] bases, one in the town of [[Lae]], and another one at [[Salamaua]]. The campaign to take the Salamaua and Lae area began after the successful [[Battle of Wau|defence of Wau]] in late January, which was followed up by an Australian advance towards [[Battle of Mubo|Mubo]] as the Japanese troops that had attacked Wau withdrew to positions around Mubo. A series of actions followed over the course of several months as the Australian [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] advanced north-east towards Salamaua. After an amphibious [[landing at Nassau Bay]], the Australians were reinforced by a US regimental combat team, which subsequently advanced north up the coast.\n\nAs the Allies kept up the pressure on the Japanese around Salamaua, in early September they launched an [[Landing at Nadzab|airborne assault on Nadzab]], and a [[Landing at Lae|seaborne landing near Lae]], subsequently taking the town with simultaneous drives from the east and north-west. As the situation around Lae grew more desperate, the Salamaua garrison withdrew, and it was captured on 11 September 1943, while Lae fell shortly afterwards on 16 September, bringing the campaign to an end.\n\n==Background==\nIn March 1942, the Japanese [[Invasion of Salamaua\u2013Lae|secured Salamaua and Lae]] and subsequently established major bases on the north coast of [[New Guinea]], in the large town of Lae, and in Salamaua, a small administrative town and port 35 kilometres (22&nbsp;mi) to the south. Salamaua was a staging post for [[Operation Mo|attacks on Port Moresby]], such as the [[Kokoda Track campaign]], and a forward operating base for Japanese aviation.{{sfn|James|2014|p=189}} When the attacks failed, the Japanese turned the port into a major supply base. Logistical limitations meant that the Salamaua\u2013Lae area could garrison only 10,000 Japanese personnel: 2,500 seamen and 7,500 soldiers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/pages/NT000091A6?openDocument |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525235719/http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/pages/NT000091A6?openDocument |archivedate=25 May 2010 |title=Attitudes to the War \u2013 Southern Cross: X The Attack and Defence at Lae and Salamaua |website=Australia-Japan Research Project |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> The defences were centred on the Okabe Detachment, a [[brigade]]-sized force from the [[51st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|51st Division]] under Major General [[Toru Okabe]].{{sfn|Trigellis-Smith|1994|pp=313\u2013316}}\n\nIn January 1943, the Okabe Detachment was defeated in an [[Battle of Wau|attack on the Australian base of Wau]], about 40 kilometres (25&nbsp;mi) away.

They held on despite fierce Japanese counter-attacks. The battle turned when they were assisted by the 162nd RCT.{{sfn|Maitland|1999|pp=72\u201374}} Throughout July, the Japanese sought to reinforce the Salamaua area, drawing troops away from Lae; by the end of the month there were around 8,000 Japanese around Salamaua.{{sfn|Morison|1975|p=258}}\n\nOn 23 August, Savige and the 3rd Division handed over the Salamaua operation to the [[Australian 5th Division (World War II)|Australian 5th Division]] under Major General [[Edward James Milford|Edward Milford]]. Throughout late August and into early September the Japanese in the Salamaua region fought to hold the advancing Allies along their final line of defence in front of Salamaua, nevertheless the 58th/59th Infantry Battalion succeeded in crossing the Francisco River and the 42nd Infantry Battalion subsequently captured the main Japanese defensive position around Charlie Hill.{{sfn|Tanaka|1980|pp=171\u2013175}} After Allied landings near Lae in the first week of September, the [[Eighteenth Army (Japan)|18th Army]] commander, [[Hataz\u014d Adachi]], ordered Nakano to abandon Salamaua and subsequently his forces withdrew to the north disinvesting the town and transferring between 5,000 and 6,000 troops by barge, while other troops marched out along the coastal road. The 5th Division subsequently occupied Salamaua on 11 September, securing its airfield.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=241}}{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=309\u2013310}}\n\nThe fighting between April and September in the Salamaua region cost the Australians 1,083 casualties, including 343 dead.

Five [[United States Navy|US Navy]] destroyers provided artillery support. The landings were not opposed by land forces but were attacked by Japanese bombers, which inflicted numerous casualties amongst the naval and military personnel on board several landing craft.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=306\u2013307}}\n\nThe [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]] led the assault, with the [[26th Brigade (Australia)|26th]] following them up while the [[24th Brigade (Australia)|24th]] formed the divisional reserve.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=305}} The 9th Division faced formidable natural barriers in the form of rivers swollen by recent rain. They came to a halt at the [[Busu River]], which could not be bridged for two reasons: the 9th lacked heavy equipment, and the far bank was occupied by Japanese soldiers. On 9 September, the [[2/28th Battalion (Australia)|2/28th Infantry Battalion]] led the attack across the Busu River and secured a bridgehead after fierce fighting.{{sfn|Maitland |1999|p= 78}}\n\n===Nadzab===\n{{Main|Landing at Nadzab}}\n[[Image:Awm 128387 nadzab.jpg|250px|thumb|right|5 September 1943.

The airborne forces secured Nadzab Airfield, so that the [[Australian 7th Division]], under Major General [[George Alan Vasey|George Vasey]], could be flown in, to cut off any possible Japanese retreat into the [[Markham Valley]]. The 7th Division suffered its worst casualties of the campaign on 7 September, as they were boarding planes at Port Moresby: a [[B-24 Liberator]] bomber crashed while taking off, hitting five trucks carrying members of the [[2/33rd Battalion (Australia)|2/33rd Infantry Battalion]]: 60 died and 92 were injured.<ref name=AWM>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11284.asp |title=2/33rd Battalion |work=Second World War units, 1939\u20131945 |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Tragic Story of Nadzab |author=Morley, Dave |newspaper=Army News: The Soldiers' Newspaper |edition=1314 |date=26 September 2013 |page=21}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 September, the 7th Division's [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Infantry Brigade]] engaged about 200 Japanese soldiers entrenched at Jensen's Plantation in a firefight, at a range of {{convert|50|yd}},<ref name=LG/> with the 2/4th Field Regiment providing artillery support.

The [[Huon Peninsula campaign]] was the result, and a quick follow up landing was subsequently undertaken at [[Battle of Scarlet Beach|Scarlet Beach]] by the [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]].{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=315}}\n\nDespite initial plans to do so, Salamaua was not developed as a base.  The Australian I Corps commander, Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, visited Salamaua by [[PT boat]] on 14 September 1943, three days after its capture, and found little more than bomb craters and corrugated iron.  He recommended cancelling the development of Salamaua and concentrating all available resources on Lae. The base that had originally been envisaged now looked like a waste of effort, because Salamaua was a poor site for a port or airbase. However, in drawing the Japanese attention away from Lae at a critical time, the assault on Salamaua had already served its purpose.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}\n\nLae, on the other hand, was subsequently transformed into two bases: the Australian Lae Base Sub Area and the [[USASOS]] Base E. Herring combined the two as the Lae Fortress, under Milford. Because Blamey had launched Postern before the logistical preparations were complete, most of the units needed to operate the base were not yet available.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/documents/wwii/lae-port.htm |author=Historical Section, Army Forces Western Pacific |title=Military History of the United States Army Services of Supply in the Southwest Pacific: Chapter 18: Base at Lae Until March 1944 |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |accessdate=25 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe importance of Lae as a port was to supply the airbase at Nadzab, but this was compromised because the Markham Valley Road was found to be in poor condition. To expedite the development of Nadzab, minimal efforts were made to repair it, and heavy military traffic bound for Nadzab was permitted to use it. The road was closed following heavy rains on 7 October and did not reopen until December. Until then, Nadzab had to be supplied by air, and its development was slow because heavy engineer units could not get through.{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=400\u2013403}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Bradley |first=Phillip |title=To Salamaua |publisher=Cambridge University Press  |location= Port Melbourne, Victoria  |year= 2010 |isbn=9780521763905|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Buggy |first=Hugh |title=Pacific Victory: A Short History of Australia's Part in the War Against Japan |year=1945 |publisher=Victorian Railway Printing Works |location=North Melbourne, Victoria |oclc=2411075 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Coulthard-Clark|first=Chris|title=The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|year=1998|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=Sydney, New South Wales |isbn=1-86448-611-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Dexter |first=David |title=The New Guinea Offensives |series=[[Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945]].
