This is achieved by binding the DOI to [[metadata]] about the object, such as a [[URL]], indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as [[ISBN]]s and [[ISRC]]s which aim only to identify their referents uniquely. The DOI system uses the [[indecs Content Model]] for representing metadata.\n\nThe DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL. But every time a URL changes, the publisher has to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.<ref>{{cite book|author= Witten, Ian H.|author2= David Bainbridge|author3= David M.

Most legal [[Unicode]] characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a [[case-insensitive]] manner.

Further development of such services is planned.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1787/603233448430 |title=We Need Publishing Standards for Datasets and Data Tables |date=2009|journal=Research Information |last=Green|first=T.}}</ref>\n\nOther registries include [[Crossref]] and the ''multilingual European DOI Registration Agency''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.medra.org |title=multilingual European DOI Registration Agency |publisher=mEDRA.org |year=2003}}</ref> Since 2015, [[Request for Comments|RFCs]] can be referenced as <code>doi:10.17487/rfc''&hellip;''</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7669#section-3 |title=Assigning Digital Object Identifiers to RFCs \u00a7 DOIs for RFCs |rfc=7669 |first=John R. |last=Levine |author-link=John R.

It also associates [[metadata]] with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the [[Handle System]] and the [[indecs Content Model]] with a social infrastructure.\n\nThe Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on [[open architecture]]s, incorporates [[Computational trust|trust mechanisms]], and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1/|title= DOIs and their discontents|last= Timmer|first= John|date= 6 March 2010|work= [[Ars Technica]]|accessdate= 5 March 2013}}</ref> DOI name-resolution may be used with [[OpenURL]] to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1= Susanne|last1= DeRisi|first2= Rebecca|last2= Kennison|first3= Nick|last3= Twyman|title= Editorial: The what and whys of DOIs|journal= [[PLoS Biology]]|volume= 1|issue= 2|page= e57|date= 2003|doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000057|pmid= 14624257|pmc= 261894}} {{open access}}</ref> However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.<ref>{{Cite book|contribution= Open access to scientific and technical information: the state of the art|first= Jack|last= Franklin|title= Open access to scientific and technical information: state of the art and future trends|editor1-first= Herbert|editor1-last= Gr\u00fcttemeier|editor2-first= Barry|editor2-last= Mahon|publisher= IOS Press|date= 2003|page= 74|url= https://books.google.com/?id=2X3gW1lUvN4C&pg=PA74|isbn= 978-1-58603-377-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[indecs Content Model]] as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.\n\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as [[GS1]] and [[ISBN]].\n\n==Comparison with other identifier schemes==\nA DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a [[First class (computing)|first-class entity]], rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] ([[Uniform Resource Name]]) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifierSpecs.html |title=DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications |publisher=Doi.org |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nA DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]], [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC]], etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifiers.html |title=DOI System and standard identifier registries |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe DOI system offers persistent, [[Semantic interoperability|semantically-interoperable]] resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as \"identifiers\" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other \"identifier systems\" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include [[Persistent Uniform Resource Locator]] (PURL), URLs, [[Globally Unique Identifier]]s (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., [[Archival Resource Key|ARK]]).\n\nA DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.\n\n==Resolution==\nDOI name resolution is provided through the [[Handle System]], developed by [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]], and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its <code><type></code> field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.\n\nTo resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as [https://doi.org/ doi.org].\n\nAnother approach, which avoids typing or [[cut-and-paste|cutting-and-pasting]] into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as <code><nowiki>https://doi.org/</nowiki></code> (preferred)<ref>{{cite web|author1=International DOI Foundation|title=Resolution|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html#3.7.3|website=DOI Handbook|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=7 August 2014}}</ref> or <code><nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/</nowiki></code>, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI <code>10.1000/182</code> can be included in a reference or [[hyperlink]] as <code>https://doi.org/10.1000/182</code>. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal [[hyperlink]]. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.\n\nOther DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, and https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a [[paywall|non-paywalled]] version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version.<ref name=\"capsh\">{{cite web|url=http://doai.io/|title=DOAI|publisher=CAPSH (Committee for the Accessibility of Publications in Sciences and Humanities)|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Schonfeld| first = Roger C.| title = Co-opting 'Official' Channels through Infrastructures for Openness |work = The Scholarly Kitchen| accessdate = 17 October 2016| date = 3 March 2016| url = https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/03/03/coopting-official-channels/}}</ref> Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016.<ref name=\"impactstory\">{{cite web| last=Piwowar| first=Heather| title=Introducing oaDOI: resolve a DOI straight to OA |url=http://blog.impactstory.org/introducting-oadoi/ |date= 25 October 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017 }}</ref> While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).<ref name=\"capsh\"/><ref name=\"impactstory\"/>\n\nAn alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for [[Web browser|browser]]s, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.org/tools.html|title=DOI System Tools}}</ref> which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the [https://www.handle.net/firefox_hdlclient.html CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox], enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like <code>hdl:4263537/4000</code> or <code>doi:10.1000/1</code> directly in the [[Firefox]] browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, [[mail reader]], or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.\n\n==IDF organizational structure==\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organisation created in 1998, is the governance body of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html#7.5 |title=DOI Handbook |chapter=Chapter 7: The International DOI Foundation |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> It safeguards all [[intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.\n\nThe IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.\n\nRegistration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level <code>10</code> prefix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dona.net/mpa/|title=DONA Foundation Multi-Primary Administrators|access-date=7 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114120514/https://dona.net/mpa/|archive-date=14 January 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRegistration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a [[not-for-profit]] cost recovery basis.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe DOI system is an international standard developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1561 |title=Digital object identifier (DOI) becomes an ISO standard |publisher=iso.org |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref> The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation \u2013 Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval.

DOI is not registered as a URN namespace, despite fulfilling all the functional requirements, since URN registration appears to offer no advantage to the DOI System. It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string {{code|urn:doi:10.1000/1}} rather than the simpler {{code|doi:10.1000/1}}) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution.

This is achieved by binding the DOI to [[metadata]] about the object, such as a [[URL]], indicating where the object can be found. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from identifiers such as [[ISBN]]s and [[ISRC]]s which aim only to identify their referents uniquely. The DOI system uses the [[indecs Content Model]] for representing metadata.\n\nThe DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI is supposed to provide a more stable link than simply using its URL. But every time a URL changes, the publisher has to update the metadata for the DOI to link to the new URL.<ref>{{cite book|author= Witten, Ian H.|author2= David Bainbridge|author3= David M.

It also associates [[metadata]] with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the [[Handle System]] and the [[indecs Content Model]] with a social infrastructure.\n\nThe Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on [[open architecture]]s, incorporates [[Computational trust|trust mechanisms]], and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1/|title= DOIs and their discontents|last= Timmer|first= John|date= 6 March 2010|work= [[Ars Technica]]|accessdate= 5 March 2013}}</ref> DOI name-resolution may be used with [[OpenURL]] to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.<ref>{{Cite journal|first1= Susanne|last1= DeRisi|first2= Rebecca|last2= Kennison|first3= Nick|last3= Twyman|title= Editorial: The what and whys of DOIs|journal= [[PLoS Biology]]|volume= 1|issue= 2|page= e57|date= 2003|doi= 10.1371/journal.pbio.0000057|pmid= 14624257|pmc= 261894}} {{open access}}</ref> However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.<ref>{{Cite book|contribution= Open access to scientific and technical information: the state of the art|first= Jack|last= Franklin|title= Open access to scientific and technical information: state of the art and future trends|editor1-first= Herbert|editor1-last= Gr\u00fcttemeier|editor2-first= Barry|editor2-last= Mahon|publisher= IOS Press|date= 2003|page= 74|url= https://books.google.com/?id=2X3gW1lUvN4C&pg=PA74|isbn= 978-1-58603-377-4}}</ref>\n\nThe [[indecs Content Model]] as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.\n\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as [[GS1]] and [[ISBN]].\n\n==Comparison with other identifier schemes==\nA DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a [[First class (computing)|first-class entity]], rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] ([[Uniform Resource Name]]) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifierSpecs.html |title=DOI System and Internet Identifier Specifications |publisher=Doi.org |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nA DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the [[International Standard Book Number|ISBN]], [[International Standard Recording Code|ISRC]], etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doi.org/factsheets/DOIIdentifiers.html |title=DOI System and standard identifier registries |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe DOI system offers persistent, [[Semantic interoperability|semantically-interoperable]] resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed. The comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as \"identifiers\" doesn't mean that they can be compared easily. Other \"identifier systems\" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include [[Persistent Uniform Resource Locator]] (PURL), URLs, [[Globally Unique Identifier]]s (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme. The DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., [[Archival Resource Key|ARK]]).\n\nA DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a [[Uniform Resource Name]] (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name.\n\n==Resolution==\nDOI name resolution is provided through the [[Handle System]], developed by [[Corporation for National Research Initiatives]], and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its <code><type></code> field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.\n\nTo resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as [https://doi.org/ doi.org].\n\nAnother approach, which avoids typing or [[cut-and-paste|cutting-and-pasting]] into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as <code><nowiki>https://doi.org/</nowiki></code> (preferred)<ref>{{cite web|author1=International DOI Foundation|title=Resolution|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/3_Resolution.html#3.7.3|website=DOI Handbook|accessdate=19 March 2015|date=7 August 2014}}</ref> or <code><nowiki>http://dx.doi.org/</nowiki></code>, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI <code>10.1000/182</code> can be included in a reference or [[hyperlink]] as <code>https://doi.org/10.1000/182</code>. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal [[hyperlink]]. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.\n\nOther DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies include http://hdl.handle.net, and https://doi.pangaea.de/. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io. This service is unusual in that it tries to find a [[paywall|non-paywalled]] version of a title and redirects you to that instead of the publisher's version.<ref name=\"capsh\">{{cite web|url=http://doai.io/|title=DOAI|publisher=CAPSH (Committee for the Accessibility of Publications in Sciences and Humanities)|accessdate=6 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last = Schonfeld| first = Roger C.| title = Co-opting 'Official' Channels through Infrastructures for Openness |work = The Scholarly Kitchen| accessdate = 17 October 2016| date = 3 March 2016| url = https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2016/03/03/coopting-official-channels/}}</ref> Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016.<ref name=\"impactstory\">{{cite web| last=Piwowar| first=Heather| title=Introducing oaDOI: resolve a DOI straight to OA |url=http://blog.impactstory.org/introducting-oadoi/ |date= 25 October 2016 |accessdate=17 March 2017 }}</ref> While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult open access resources such as [[BASE (search engine)|BASE]] (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).<ref name=\"capsh\"/><ref name=\"impactstory\"/>\n\nAn alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for [[Web browser|browser]]s, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.doi.org/tools.html|title=DOI System Tools}}</ref> which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. For example. the [https://www.handle.net/firefox_hdlclient.html CNRI Handle Extension for Firefox], enables the browser to access Handle System handles or DOIs like <code>hdl:4263537/4000</code> or <code>doi:10.1000/1</code> directly in the [[Firefox]] browser, using the native Handle System protocol. This plug-in can also replace references to web-to-handle proxy servers with native resolution. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, [[mail reader]], or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.\n\n==IDF organizational structure==\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organisation created in 1998, is the governance body of the DOI system.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/doi_handbook/7_IDF.html#7.5 |title=DOI Handbook |chapter=Chapter 7: The International DOI Foundation |publisher=Doi.org |accessdate=8 July 2015}}</ref> It safeguards all [[intellectual property|intellectual property rights]] relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.\n\nThe IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.\n\nRegistration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level <code>10</code> prefix.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dona.net/mpa/|title=DONA Foundation Multi-Primary Administrators|access-date=7 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114120514/https://dona.net/mpa/|archive-date=14 January 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRegistration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a [[not-for-profit]] cost recovery basis.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe DOI system is an international standard developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1561 |title=Digital object identifier (DOI) becomes an ISO standard |publisher=iso.org |date=10 May 2012 |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref> The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation \u2013 Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval.

However no such widely deployed RDS schemes currently exist.... DOI is not registered as a URN namespace, despite fulfilling all the functional requirements, since URN registration appears to offer no advantage to the DOI System. It requires an additional layer of administration for defining DOI as a URN namespace (the string {{code|urn:doi:10.1000/1}} rather than the simpler {{code|doi:10.1000/1}}) and an additional step of unnecessary redirection to access the resolution service, already achieved through either http proxy or native resolution.

During [[World War II]], the region was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]] once again.

The local Ruthenian population has a problem with self-identification and a portion of them consider themselves to be part of bigger Ukrainian family, while the other \u2013 a separate and unique Slavic group of [[Rusyns]]. Some Carpathian Rusyns consider themselves part of a bigger Russian nation. In regards to the region most Rusyns, however, use the term ''Zakarpattia'' (Trans-Carpathia; literally \"beyond the Carpathian mountains\").{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} This is contrasted implicitly with ''[[Prykarpattia]]'' (Ciscarpathia; \"Near-Carpathia\"), an unofficial region in Ukraine, to the immediate north-east of the central area of the Carpathian Range, and potentially including its foothills, the [[Outer Subcarpathia|Subcarpathia]]n basin and part of the surrounding plains.\n\nFrom a Hungarian, Slovak and Czech perspective the region is usually described as [[Inner Subcarpathia|Subcarpathia]] (literally \"below the Carpathians\"), although technically this name refers only to a long, narrow basin that flanks the northern side of the mountains.\n\nDuring the period in which the region was administered by the [[History of Hungary|Hungarian states]] it was officially referred to in Hungarian as K\u00e1rp\u00e1talja (literally: \"the base of the Carpathians\") or the north-eastern regions of medieval ''Upper Hungary'', which in the 16th century was contested between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe [[Romanian language|Romanian]] name of the region is [[Maramure\u0219]] which is geographically located in the eastern and south-eastern portions of the region.\n\nDuring the period of [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] administration in the first half of the 20th century, the region was referred to for a while as ''Rusinsko'' (Ruthenia) or ''Karpatske Rusinsko'', and later as Subcarpathian Rus ([[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Podkarpatsk\u00e1 Rus'') or Subcarpathian Ukraine (Czech and Slovak: ''Podkarpatsk\u00e1 Ukrajina''), and from 1928 as the Subcarpathoruthenian Land.<ref>{{cite web | title=Subcarpathian Rus\u2019/Podkarpats\u2019ka Rus\u2019 | url=http://www.rusyn.org/geosubcarpathian.html | accessdate=2007-06-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724205028/http://www.rusyn.org/geosubcarpathian.html | archive-date=2008-07-24 | url-status=dead }}</ref> (Czech: ''Zem\u011b podkarpatorusk\u00e1'', Slovak: ''Krajina podkarpatorusk\u00e1'').\n\nAlternative, unofficial names used in Czechoslovakia before World War II included Subcarpathia (Czech and Slovak: ''Podkarpatsko''), Transcarpathia (Czech and Slovak: Zakarpatsko), Transcarpathian Ukraine (Czech and Slovak: ''Zakarpatsk\u00e1 Ukrajina''), Carpathian Rus/Ruthenia (Czech and Slovak: ''Karpatsk\u00e1 Rus'') and, occasionally, Hungarian Rus/Ruthenia ({{lang-cs|Uhersk\u00e1 Rus}}; {{lang-sk|Uhorsk\u00e1 Rus}}).\n\nThe region declared its independence as [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] on March 15, 1939, but was occupied and annexed by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]] in March 15\u201318, 1939 and remained under Hungarian control until the end of the World War II. During this period the region continued to possess a special administration and the term ''K\u00e1rp\u00e1talja'' became more common.\n\nIn 1944\u20131946, the region was occupied by the Soviet Army and was a separate political formation known as Transcarpathian Ukraine or Subcarpathian Ruthenia. During this period the region possessed some form of quasi-autonomy with its own legislature, while remaining under the governance of the Communist Party of Transcarpathian Ukraine. After the signing of a treaty between [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] as well as the decision of the regional council, Transcarpathia joined the [[Ukrainian SSR]] as part of the Ukrainian region (oblast).\n\nThe region has subsequently been referred to as ''Zakarpattia'' ({{lang-uk|\u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0442\u044f}}) or ''Transcarpathia'', and on occasions as ''Carpathian Rus\u2019'' ({{lang-uk|\u041a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] \"Karpats\u2019ka Rus\u2019\"), ''Transcarpathian Rus\u2019'' ({{lang-uk|\u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] \"Zakarpats\u2019ka Rus\u2019\"), ''Subcarpathian Rus\u2019'' ({{lang-uk|\u041f\u0456\u0434\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|translit.]] \"Pidkarpats\u2019ka Rus\u2019\").\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Ukraine-Kamianka-Buzka-Skole-Volovets Railroad-23.jpg|250px|right|thumb|August 2006 view from Kamianka-Buzka-Skole-Volovets railroad]]\n\nCarpathian Ruthenia rests on the southern slopes of the eastern [[Carpathian Mountains]], bordered to the east and south by the [[Tisza]] River, and to the west by the [[Horn\u00e1d]] and [[Poprad River]]s, which borders [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]], and makes up part of the [[Pannonian Plain]].\n\nThe region predominantly rural and infrastructurally underdeveloped being dominated by mostly mountainous relief and geographically separated from Ukraine, Slovakia, and Romania by mountain range and Hungary by Tisza river.

Subsequently Transcarpathia came under the control of the Celts, who arrived from the west and brought with them iron-smelting (ca 400\u2013200 bc); the first local coins were minted in the 3rd century BC. Of the eastern nomadic peoples the earliest to influence Transcarpathia were the Iranian-speaking Scythians (expressed locally from the 6th century BC in the Kushtanovytsia culture) and then the Iazyges, a Sarmatian tribe confronting the Romans in Dacia (50 AD); their influence was followed by the invasions of the Turkic-speaking Huns (380 AD), the Avars (558 AD), and, finally, the Ugro-Finnic Magyars (896 AD). In the 2nd century AD neighboring Dacia (Transylvania) became a Roman province, and Roman merchants visited Transcarpathia. In the early Middle Ages Transcarpathia was traversed by Germanic tribes. Remnants of the Ostrogoths (the Gepidae) remained in neighboring Transylvania until the 10th century. The Slavic colonization of Transcarpathia began in the 2nd century, with migration from the north across the mountain passes. By the 8th and 9th centuries the lowlands of Transcarpathia were fairly densely peopled by White Croatians (at the time inhabiting both the north and the south side of the Carpathians). The Slavs in the upper Tysa River and in Transylvania were subject to the Avars (6th\u20138th centuries) and later to the Bulgarian kingdom (9th\u201310th centuries). With the collapse of Bulgaria in the second half of the 10th century, Transcarpathia came under the sphere of influence of Kyivan Rus\u2019. The Kyivan chroniclers noted the participation of the White Croatians in the campaigns on Byzantium. Following the incorporation of the White Croatians by Prince Volodymyr the Great into his realm, the name Rus\u2019 or Ruthenia became entrenched in Transcarpathia.}}</ref> and during the [[Migration Period]] it is considered that was traversed by [[Huns]] and [[Gepids]] (4th century) and [[Pannonian Avars]] (6th century). \n\n=== Slavic settlement ===\nBy the 8th and 9th century, the valleys of the Northern and Southern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains were \"densely\" settled by Slavic tribe of [[White Croats]],<ref name=\"EOU\"/><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Carpatho-Rusyns|first=Paul Robert|last=Magocsi|journal=Carpatho-Rusyn American|volume=XVIII|number=4|year=1995|url=http://carpatho-rusyn.org/cra/chap3.html|publisher=Carpatho-Rusyn Research Center}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Paul Robert |last=Magocsi |author-link=Paul Robert Magocsi |year=2002 |title=The Roots of Ukrainian Nationalism: Galicia as Ukraine's Piedmont |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=CdiIa8n7SsgC |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802047380 |pages=2\u20134}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Valentin Vasilyevich |last=Sedov |year=2013 |orig-year=1995 |title=\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 |trans-title=Sloveni u ranom srednjem veku (Slavs in Early Middle Ages) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HD4oAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Akademska knjiga |location=Novi Sad |isbn=978-86-6263-026-1 |pages=168, 444, 451}}</ref> who were closely related to East Slavic tribes who inhabited [[Prykarpattia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Transnistria]] and [[Dnieper Ukraine]].<ref name=\"EIU\"/> Whereas some White Croats remained behind in Carpathian Ruthenia, others moved southward into the [[Balkans]] in the 7th century.

Over the time, because of geographical and political isolation from the main Ruthenian-speaking territory, the inhabitants developed distinctive features.\n\n===Habsburg, Ottoman and Hungarian administration===\n[[File:Hungary-ethnic groups.jpg|thumb|270px|right|1885 [[ethnographic]] map of the Hungarian Crown {{legend|gold|[[Ruthenians]]}}]]\nFrom 1526, the region was divided between [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (i.e. its [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538\u20131867)|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]]) and [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom]]. Beginning in 1570, the region was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] suzerainty. Part of Transcarpathia under Habsburg administration was included into the Captaincy of Upper Hungary, which was one of the administrative units of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. During this period, an important factor in the Ruthenian cultural identity, namely religion, came to the fore. The [[Union of Brest|Unions of Brest-Lytovsk]] (1595) and of [https://web.archive.org/web/20051221103310/http://www.saint-mike.org/Papal-Library/John_PaulII/Apostolic_Letters/Union_Uzhorod.html Ungv\u00e1r (Uzhorod)] (1646) were instituted, causing the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Byzantine Orthodox Churches]] of Carpathian and Transcarpathian Rus' to come under the jurisdiction of [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]], thus establishing so-called [[Uniate|\"Unia\"]], or [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]] in the region, the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]] and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]].\n\nIn the 17th century (until 1648) the entire region was part of [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]], and between 1682 and 1685, its north-western part was administered by the vassal Ottoman Principality of the prince [[Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly]], while south-eastern parts were remained administered by Transylvania. From 1699, the entire region became part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and was divided between the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and the Principality of Transylvania. Later, the entire region was included into the Kingdom of Hungary. Between 1850 and 1860 the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary was divided into five military districts, and the region was part of the [[Military District of Kaschau]]. After 1867, the region was administratively included into [[Transleithania]] or Hungarian part of [[Austria-Hungary]].\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Transcarpathia was an area of continuous struggle between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian activists. The former asserted that the Carpatho-Ruthenians were part of the Ukrainian nation, while the latter claimed them to be a separate ethnicity and nationality from the Ukrainians, a part of the Russian ethnos.\n\nIn 1910, population of Transcarpathia included 605,942 people, of which 330,010 (54.5%) speakers of [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], 185,433 (30.6%) speakers of [[Hungarian language]], 64,257 (10.6%) speakers of [[German language]], 11,668 (1.9%) speakers of [[Romanian language]], 6,346 (1%) speakers of [[Slovak language|Slovak]]/[[Czech language]], and 8,228 (1.4%) speakers of other languages.\n\n===Hungarian counties composing the region===\n* [[Ung County]], Ungv\u00e1r ([[Uzhhorod]])\n* [[Bereg County]], Beregsz\u00e1sz ([[Berehove]])\n* [[Ugocsa County]], Nagysz\u0151ll\u0151s ([[Vynohradiv]])\n* [[Maramaros County]] (only the northern part), M\u00e1ramarossziget ([[Sighetu Marma\u021biei]])\n\n===Transitional period (1918\u20131919)===\n[[File:West ukraine.png|thumb|right|250px|[[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (1918), incorporating Carpathian Ruthenia]]\n[[File:Obd\u011bl\u00e1v\u00e1n\u00ed p\u016fdy nejchud\u0161\u00edch roln\u00edk\u016f.gif|thumb|right|250px|The vast majority of people were peasant farmers]]\n[[File:Gregory \u017datkovich.jpg|thumb|[[Gregory \u017datkovich]] signing the Declaration of Common Aims at Independence Hall, [[Philadelphia]] 10-26-1918.]]\n\nAfter World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed and the region was briefly (in 1918 and 1919) claimed as part of the independent [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|West Ukraine]] Republic. However, the region was, for most of this period controlled by the newly formed independent [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], with a short period of West Ukrainian control.\n\nOn November 8, 1918, the first National Council (the [[Lubov\u0148a]] Council, which was later reconvened as the [[Pre\u0161ov]] Council) was held in western Ruthenia. The first of many councils, it simply stated the desire of its members to separate from the newly formed Hungarian state but did not specify a particular alternative \u2014 only that it must involve the right to self-determination.\n\nOver the next months, councils met every few weeks, calling for various solutions. Some wanted to remain part of Hungarian state but with greater autonomy; the most notable of these, the [[Uzhhorod]] Council (November 9, 1918), declared itself the representative of the Rusyn people and began negotiations with Hungarian authorities, resulting in the adoption of Law no. 10, making four of the Rusyn counties autonomous. Other councils, such as the Carpatho-Ruthenian National Council meetings in Huszt ([[Khust]]) (November 1918), called for unification with a [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian]] state. It was only in early January 1919 that the first calls were heard in Ruthenia for union with [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref> Precl\u00edk, Vratislav.

In a series of battles they defeated and crushed the local militias of the newly formed [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], whose proclaimed aim was to \"unite the Hungarian, Rusyn and Jewish toilers against the exploiters of the same nationalities\".

The Allies, however, had few alternatives to choosing Czechoslovakia. Hungary had lost the war and therefore gave up its claims; Ukraine was seen as politically unviable; and Russia was in the midst of a civil war. Thus the Rusyns' decision to become part of Czechoslovakia can only have been important in creating, at least initially, good relations between the leaders of Carpathian Rus and Czechoslovakia.

In 1939, census records showed that 80,000 Jews lived in the autonomous province of Ruthenia. Jews made up approximately 14% of the prewar population, however this population was concentrated in the larger towns, especially [[Mukachevo]], where they constituted 43% of the prewar population. \nAfter the [[Operation Margarethe|German occupation of Hungary]] the pro-[[Nazi]] policies of the Hungarian government resulted in emigration and deportation of Hungarian-speaking [[Jew]]s, and other groups living in the territory were decimated by war. \nDuring the [[Holocaust]], 17 main ghettos were set up in cities in Carpathian Ruthenia, from which all Jews were taken to [[Auschwitz]] for extermination. Ruthenian ghettos were set up in May 1944 and liquidated by June 1944. Most of the Jews of Transcarpathia were killed, though a number survived, either because they were hidden by their neighbours, or were forced into [[labour battalion]]s, which often guaranteed food and shelter.\n\nThe end of the war had a significant impact on the ethnic Hungarian population of the area: 10,000 fled before the arrival of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces. Many of the remaining adult men (25,000) were deported to the Soviet Union; about 30% of them died in Soviet [[labor camp]]s. As a result of this development since 1938, the Hungarian and Hungarian-speaking population of Transcarpathia was recorded differently in various censuses and estimations from that time: 1930 census recorded 116,548 ethnic Hungarians, while the contested Hungarian census from 1941 shows as much as 233,840 speakers of Hungarian language in the region. Subsequent estimations are showing 66,000 ethnic Hungarians in 1946 and 139,700 in 1950, while the Soviet census from 1959 recorded 146,247 Hungarians.\n\n=== Transition to Soviet takeover and control (1944-1945)===\n[[File:ZakapratskaUkraina1944.png|thumb|Front page of the Zakarpattia Ukraine newspaper (1944) with manifest of unification with the [[Soviet Ukraine]] (not Ukrainian SSR)]]\nThe Soviet takeover of the region started with the [[East Carpathian Strategic Offensive]] in the fall of 1944.

The extent of the repression showed to many Carpatho-Ruthenian activists how it would not have been possible to find an accommodation with the coming Soviet regime as it had been with all previous ones.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\nAfter breaking the [[Greek Catholic Church]] in Eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in 1946, Soviet authorities pushed for the return to Orthodoxy of Greek-Catholic parishes in Transcarpathia too, including by engineering the accident and death of recalcitrant bishop [[Theodore Romzha]] on 1 November 1947. In January 1949 the [[Greek-Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo]] was declared illegal; remaining priests and nuns were arrested, and church properties were nationalised and parcelled for public use or lent to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (Moscow Patriarchate) as only accepted religious authority in the region.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\nCultural institutions were also forbidden, including the russophile Dukhnovych Society, the ukrainophile Prosvita, and the Subcarpathian Scholarly Society. New books and publications were circulated, including the ''Zakarpatsk{{'}}a Pravda'' (130,000 copies). The [[Uzhhorod National University]] was opened in 1945. Over 816 cinematographs were open by 1967 to insure the indoctrination of the population to marxism-leninism.  The [[Ukrainian language]] was the first language of instruction in schools throughout the region, followed by Russian, which was used at the university. Most new generations had a passive knowledge of Rusyn language, but no knowledge about local culture. XIX-century Rusyn intellectuals were labelled as \"members of the reactionary class and instruments of Vatican obscurantism\". The Rusyn anthem and hymn were banned from public performance. Carpatho-Rusyn folk culture and songs, which were promoted, were presented as part of Transcarpathian regional culture as a local variant of Ukrainian culture. <ref name=magocsi/>\n\nAs early as 1924, the [[Comintern]] had declared all East Slavic inhabitants of Czechoslovakia ([[Rusyns]], Carpatho-Russians, [[Rusnaks]]) to be [[Ukrainians]]. As the 1946 census, all Rusyns were recorded as Ukrainians; anyone clinging to the old label was considered a separatist and a potential counter-revolutionary. \n\nAlready in February 1945, the National Council proceeded to confiscate 53,000 hectares of land from big landwoners and redistribute it to 54,000 peasant households (37% of the population). Forced collectivisation of land started in 1946; around 2,000 peasants were arrested during protests in 1948-49 and sent for forced labour in the [[gulags]]. Collectivisation, including of mountain shepherds, was completed by May 1950. Central planning decisions set Transcarpatia to become a \"land of orchards and vineyards\" between 1955 and 1965, planting 98,000 hectares with little results. Attempt to cultivate tea and citrus also failed due to climate. Most vineyards were uprooted twenty years later, during [[Gorbachev]]'s anti-alcohol campaign in 1985-87.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\nThe Soviet period also meant the upscaling of industrialisation in Transcarpathia. State-owned lumber mills, chemical and food-processing plants widened, with Mukachevo's tobacco factory and Solotvyno's salt works as the biggest ones, providing steady employment to the residents of the region, beyond the traditional subsistence agriculture. And while traditional labour migration routes to the fields of Hungary or the factories of the Nort-West United States were now closed, Carpathian Ruthens and Romanians could now move for seasonal work in Russia's North and East.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\nThe inhabitants of the oblast grew steadily in the Soviet period, from 776,000 in 1946 to over 1,2 million in 1989. Uzhgorod increased its residents five-fold, from 26,000 to 117,000, and [[Mukachevo]] likewise from 26,600 to 84,000. This population increase also reflected demographic changes. The arrival of the Red Army meant the departure of 5,100 Magyars and 2,500 Germans, while the 15-20,000 Jews survivors of the Holocaust also decided to move out before the borders were sealed. By 1945, around 30,000 Hungarians and Germans had been interned and sent for labour camps in Eastern Ukraine and Siberia; while amnestied in 1955, around 5,000 did not come back. In January 1946, 2,000 more Germans were deported. In return, a large number of Ukrainians and Russians moved to Transcarpathia, were they found jobs in the industry, the military, or the civilian administration. By 1989, around 170,000 Ukrainians (mainly from nearby Galizia) and 49,000 Russians were living in Transcarpatia, mainly in new residential blocks in the main towns of Uzhgorod and Mukachevo, where the dominant language had soon turned from Hungarian and Yiddish to Russian. They kept being considered newcomers (''novoprybuli'') due to their disconnect from the Rusyn- and Hungarian-speaking countryside.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\n===Transition to independent Ukraine (1991-)===\n{{History of Ukraine}}\n{{See also|Zakarpattia Oblast|1991 Transcarpathian general regional referendum}}\nIn July 1991 the [[Ukrainian SSR]] adopted a law about referendums that lasted until 2012. Soon after the [[August Putch]] in Moscow (19\u201322), on 24 August 1991 the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament) of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] proclaimed declaration about its independence and also prohibited the Communist Party in the republic.<ref name=zakrp110922>Pipash, Volodymyr.

Cultural Federation in Transcarpathia (KMKSZ), Shevchenko Association of Ukrainian Language, regional branch of [[Prosvita]].<ref name=zakrp110922/>\n\nBecause of the situation in the region, on 26 August 1991 the deputy chairman of the regional council Yuriy Vorobets signed an order to hold an extraordinary session of the council on 30 August, but on 29 August the head of the council Mykhailo Voloshchuk (formerly the 1st secretary of the [[Zakarpattia Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine|Zakarpattia regional communist party committee]]) postponed it by a separate order.<ref

(LKSMU).<ref name=zakrp110922/> To relieve the pressure, Voloshchuk approved a composition of provisional deputy commission for inspection of activity of officials during the putsch that consisted of 17 members mostly of the recently dissolved Communist Party and couple of Rukh members ([[:uk:\u0422\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e

communities and transferred them as own property 83 church buildings.<ref name=zakrp110922/>\n\nThe government of Zakarpattia decided to bet on separatist actions.<ref name=zakrp110922/> On 27 August 1991 the Mukachevo city council decided to ask the Zakarpattia regional council to adopt a decision about proclamation of the region as the \"Zakarpattia autonomous land of Ukraine\".<ref

[[Places inhabited by Rusyns]] also span adjacent regions of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including regions of present-day [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]]. Ruthenian settlements exist in the [[Balkans]] as well.\n\nIn the 19th century and the first part of the 20th, the inhabitants of Transcarpathia continued to call themselves \"Ruthenians\" (\"''Rusyny''\").  After Soviet annexation the ethnonym \"Ukrainian\", which had replaced \"Ruthenian\" in eastern Ukraine at the turn of the century, was also applied to  Ruthenians/Rusyns of Transcarpathia.  Most present-day inhabitants consider themselves ethnically [[Ukrainians]], although in the most recent census 10,100 people (0.8% of Zakarpattia Oblast's 1.26 million) identified themselves as ethnically [[Rusyns|Rusyn]].\n\n=== Hungarians ===\n[[File:Zakarpatska2001HungarianLanguage.PNG|thumb|Percentage of Hungarian native speakers in [[Zakarpattia oblast]] according to 2001 census]]\nThe following data is according to the Ukrainian census of 2001.\n\n{{Main|Hungarians in Ukraine}}\nThe 1910 Austro-Hungarian census shows 185,433 speakers of Hungarian language, while the Czechoslovak census of 1921 shows 111,052 ethnic Hungarians and 80,132 ethnic Jews, many of whom were speakers of Hungarian language. Much of the difference in these censuses reflects differences in methodology and definitions rather than a decline in the region's ethnic Hungarian ([[Magyars|Magyar]]) or Hungarian-speaking population. According to the 1921 census, Hungarians constituted about 17.9% of the region's total population.\n\nThe end of [[World War II]] had a significant impact on the ethnic Hungarian population of the area: 10,000 fled before the arrival of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces. Many of the remaining adult men (25,000) were deported to the Soviet Union; about 30% of them died in Soviet [[labor camp]]s. As a result of this development since 1938, the Hungarian and Hungarian-speaking population of Transcarpathia was recorded differently in various censuses and estimations from that time: 1930 census recorded 116,548 ethnic Hungarians, while the contested Hungarian census from 1941 shows as much as 233,840 speakers of Hungarian language in the region. Subsequent estimations are showing 66,000 ethnic Hungarians in 1946 and 139,700 in 1950, while the Soviet census from 1959 recorded 146,247 Hungarians.\n\n{{As of|2004}}, about 170,000 (12\u201313%) inhabitants of Transcarpathia declare Hungarian as their mother tongue. Homeland Hungarians refer to Hungarians in Ukraine as ''k\u00e1rp\u00e1taljaiak''.\n\n=== Jews ===\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Carpathian Ruthenia}}\n[[File:Ukrainian Jews from Galicia (left) and Mukachevo (right), 1821.jpg|thumb|180px|Jews from Galicia (left) and Mukachevo (right), 1821]]\nMemoirs and historical studies provide much evidence that in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Rusyn-Jewish relations were generally peaceful. In 1939, census records showed that 80,000 Jews lived in the autonomous province of Ruthenia. Jews made up approximately 14% of the prewar population, however this population was concentrated in the larger towns, especially [[Mukachevo]], where they constituted 43% of the prewar population. Most of them perished during the [[Holocaust]].\n\n=== Germans ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}\nSee [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union]] for information about Carpathian-German (mainly German-speaking [[Bohemian]], [[Moravia]]n German and [[Lower Saxony|Saxon]]/[[Low German]] from middle and eastern Germany) settlement in the 16th to 18th centuries.\n\n=== Czechs ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Czechs]] in Carpathian Ruthenia are ethnoculturally distinct from other [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] groups like the Slovaks, as they originated from Czech-speaking groups from [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] instead of Slovakia.\n\n=== Romani ===\nThere are approximately 25,000 ethnic [[Romani people|Romani]] in present-day Transcarpathia. Some estimates point to a number as high as 50,000 but a true count is hard to obtain as many Romani will claim to be Hungarian or Romanian when interviewed by Ukrainian authorities.\n\nThey are by far the poorest and least-represented ethnic group in the region and face intense prejudice. The years since the fall of the USSR have not been kind to the Romani of the region, as they have been particularly hard hit by the economic problems faced by peoples all over the former USSR. Some Romani in western Ukraine live in major cities such as [[Uzhhorod]] and [[Mukachevo]], but most live in encampments on the outskirts of cities. These encampments are known as \"taberi\" and can house up to 300 families. These encampments tend to be fairly primitive with no running water or electricity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.romaniyag.uz.ua/en/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314022109/http://romaniyag.uz.ua/en/ |archive-date=2007-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Romanians ===\n[[File:Romanians of Zakarpattya Oblast dancing.jpg|thumb|Traditional costume of Romanians of Zakkarpatia]]\nToday some 30,000 Romanians live in this region, mostly in northern [[Maramure\u0219]], around the southern towns of '''Rah\u0103u'''/[[Rakhiv]] and '''Teceu Mare'''/[[Tiachiv]] and close to the border with Romania.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Greeks ===\nAlso known as Carpatho-Greeks and Greek-Carpathians.\n\n=== Armenians ===\nDescendants of [[Armenians]] who came and settled in the region in the 15th to 18th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n== Western views ==\nFor urban European readers in the 19th century, Ruthenia was one origin of the 19th century's imaginary \"[[Ruritania]]\" the most rural, most rustic and deeply provincial tiny province lost in forested mountains that could be imagined.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Conceived sometimes as a kingdom of central Europe, Ruritania was the setting of several novels by [[Anthony Hope]], especially ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1894).\n\nRecently [[Vesna Goldsworthy]], in ''Inventing Ruritania: the imperialism of the imagination'' (1998) has explored the origins of the ideas that underpin Western perceptions of the \"Wild East\" of Europe, especially of Ruthenian and other rural Slavs in the upper Balkans, but ideas that are highly applicable to Transcarpathia, all in all \"an innocent process: a cultural great power seizes and exploits the resources of an area, while imposing new frontiers on its mind-map and creating ideas which, reflected back, have the ability to reshape reality.\"\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Black Ruthenia]]\n* [[Red Ruthenia]]\n* [[White Ruthenia]]\n* [[Military history of Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II]]\n* [[Ruthenians and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Eparchy of Muka\u010devo and Pre\u0161ov]]\n* [[Alexander Dukhnovych]]\n* [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]]\n* [[Ukrainian dialects]]\n* [[K\u00e1rp\u00e1talja football team]]\n* [[Magyaron]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n{{Reflist|group=A}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Baerlein, Henri (1938).

Subsequently Transcarpathia came under the control of the Celts, who arrived from the west and brought with them iron-smelting (ca 400\u2013200 bc); the first local coins were minted in the 3rd century BC. Of the eastern nomadic peoples the earliest to influence Transcarpathia were the Iranian-speaking Scythians (expressed locally from the 6th century BC in the Kushtanovytsia culture) and then the Iazyges, a Sarmatian tribe confronting the Romans in Dacia (50 AD); their influence was followed by the invasions of the Turkic-speaking Huns (380 AD), the Avars (558 AD), and, finally, the Ugro-Finnic Magyars (896 AD). In the 2nd century AD neighboring Dacia (Transylvania) became a Roman province, and Roman merchants visited Transcarpathia. In the early Middle Ages Transcarpathia was traversed by Germanic tribes. Remnants of the Ostrogoths (the Gepidae) remained in neighboring Transylvania until the 10th century. The Slavic colonization of Transcarpathia began in the 2nd century, with migration from the north across the mountain passes. By the 8th and 9th centuries the lowlands of Transcarpathia were fairly densely peopled by White Croatians (at the time inhabiting both the north and the south side of the Carpathians). The Slavs in the upper Tysa River and in Transylvania were subject to the Avars (6th\u20138th centuries) and later to the Bulgarian kingdom (9th\u201310th centuries). With the collapse of Bulgaria in the second half of the 10th century, Transcarpathia came under the sphere of influence of Kyivan Rus\u2019. The Kyivan chroniclers noted the participation of the White Croatians in the campaigns on Byzantium. Following the incorporation of the White Croatians by Prince Volodymyr the Great into his realm, the name Rus\u2019 or Ruthenia became entrenched in Transcarpathia.}}</ref> and during the [[Migration Period]] it is considered that was traversed by [[Huns]] and [[Gepids]] (4th century) and [[Pannonian Avars]] (6th century). \n\n=== Slavic settlement ===\nBy the 8th and 9th century, the valleys of the Northern and Southern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains were \"densely\" settled by Slavic tribe of [[White Croats]],<ref name=\"EOU\"/><ref>{{cite journal|title=The Carpatho-Rusyns|first=Paul Robert|last=Magocsi|journal=Carpatho-Rusyn American|volume=XVIII|number=4|year=1995|url=http://carpatho-rusyn.org/cra/chap3.html|publisher=Carpatho-Rusyn Research Center}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Paul Robert |last=Magocsi |author-link=Paul Robert Magocsi |year=2002 |title=The Roots of Ukrainian Nationalism: Galicia as Ukraine's Piedmont |url=https://books.google.hr/books?id=CdiIa8n7SsgC |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=9780802047380 |pages=2\u20134}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Valentin Vasilyevich |last=Sedov |year=2013 |orig-year=1995 |title=\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0435 \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 |trans-title=Sloveni u ranom srednjem veku (Slavs in Early Middle Ages) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HD4oAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Akademska knjiga |location=Novi Sad |isbn=978-86-6263-026-1 |pages=168, 444, 451}}</ref> who were closely related to East Slavic tribes who inhabited [[Prykarpattia]], [[Volhynia]], [[Transnistria]] and [[Dnieper Ukraine]].<ref name=\"EIU\"/> Whereas some White Croats remained behind in Carpathian Ruthenia, others moved southward into the [[Balkans]] in the 7th century.

All the groups, including local [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] population, blended together creating distinctive culture from main [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]]-speaking areas. Over the time, because of geographical and political isolation from the main Ruthenian-speaking territory, the inhabitants developed distinctive features.\n\n===Habsburg, Ottoman and Hungarian administration===\n[[File:Hungary-ethnic groups.jpg|thumb|270px|right|1885 [[ethnographic]] map of the Hungarian Crown {{legend|gold|[[Ruthenians]]}}]]\nFrom 1526, the region was divided between [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (i.e. its [[Kingdom of Hungary (1538\u20131867)|Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary]]) and [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom]]. Beginning in 1570, the region was divided between the Habsburg Monarchy and [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]] under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] suzerainty. Part of Transcarpathia under Habsburg administration was included into the Captaincy of Upper Hungary, which was one of the administrative units of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary. During this period, an important factor in the Ruthenian cultural identity, namely religion, came to the fore. The [[Union of Brest|Unions of Brest-Lytovsk]] (1595) and of [https://web.archive.org/web/20051221103310/http://www.saint-mike.org/Papal-Library/John_PaulII/Apostolic_Letters/Union_Uzhorod.html Ungv\u00e1r (Uzhorod)] (1646) were instituted, causing the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Byzantine Orthodox Churches]] of Carpathian and Transcarpathian Rus' to come under the jurisdiction of [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]], thus establishing so-called [[Uniate|\"Unia\"]], or [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]] in the region, the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]] and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]].\n\nIn the 17th century (until 1648) the entire region was part of [[Principality of Transylvania (1570\u20131711)|Principality of Transylvania]], and between 1682 and 1685, its north-western part was administered by the vassal Ottoman Principality of the prince [[Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly]], while south-eastern parts were remained administered by Transylvania. From 1699, the entire region became part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and was divided between the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and the Principality of Transylvania. Later, the entire region was included into the Kingdom of Hungary. Between 1850 and 1860 the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary was divided into five military districts, and the region was part of the [[Military District of Kaschau]]. After 1867, the region was administratively included into [[Transleithania]] or Hungarian part of [[Austria-Hungary]].\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Transcarpathia was an area of continuous struggle between pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian activists. The former asserted that the Carpatho-Ruthenians were part of the Ukrainian nation, while the latter claimed them to be a separate ethnicity and nationality from the Ukrainians, a part of the Russian ethnos.\n\nIn 1910, population of Transcarpathia included 605,942 people, of which 330,010 (54.5%) speakers of [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]], 185,433 (30.6%) speakers of [[Hungarian language]], 64,257 (10.6%) speakers of [[German language]], 11,668 (1.9%) speakers of [[Romanian language]], 6,346 (1%) speakers of [[Slovak language|Slovak]]/[[Czech language]], and 8,228 (1.4%) speakers of other languages.\n\n===Hungarian counties composing the region===\n* [[Ung County]], Ungv\u00e1r ([[Uzhhorod]])\n* [[Bereg County]], Beregsz\u00e1sz ([[Berehove]])\n* [[Ugocsa County]], Nagysz\u0151ll\u0151s ([[Vynohradiv]])\n* [[Maramaros County]] (only the northern part), M\u00e1ramarossziget ([[Sighetu Marma\u021biei]])\n\n===Transitional period (1918\u20131919)===\n[[File:West ukraine.png|thumb|right|250px|[[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (1918), incorporating Carpathian Ruthenia]]\n[[File:Obd\u011bl\u00e1v\u00e1n\u00ed p\u016fdy nejchud\u0161\u00edch roln\u00edk\u016f.gif|thumb|right|250px|The vast majority of people were peasant farmers]]\n[[File:Gregory \u017datkovich.jpg|thumb|[[Gregory \u017datkovich]] signing the Declaration of Common Aims at Independence Hall, [[Philadelphia]] 10-26-1918.]]\n\nAfter World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed and the region was briefly (in 1918 and 1919) claimed as part of the independent [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|West Ukraine]] Republic. However, the region was, for most of this period controlled by the newly formed independent [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], with a short period of West Ukrainian control.\n\nOn November 8, 1918, the first National Council (the [[Lubov\u0148a]] Council, which was later reconvened as the [[Pre\u0161ov]] Council) was held in western Ruthenia. The first of many councils, it simply stated the desire of its members to separate from the newly formed Hungarian state but did not specify a particular alternative \u2014 only that it must involve the right to self-determination.\n\nOver the next months, councils met every few weeks, calling for various solutions. Some wanted to remain part of Hungarian state but with greater autonomy; the most notable of these, the [[Uzhhorod]] Council (November 9, 1918), declared itself the representative of the Rusyn people and began negotiations with Hungarian authorities, resulting in the adoption of Law no. 10, making four of the Rusyn counties autonomous. Other councils, such as the Carpatho-Ruthenian National Council meetings in Huszt ([[Khust]]) (November 1918), called for unification with a [[West Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukrainian]] state. It was only in early January 1919 that the first calls were heard in Ruthenia for union with [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref> Precl\u00edk, Vratislav.

In a series of battles they defeated and crushed the local militias of the newly formed [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], whose proclaimed aim was to \"unite the Hungarian, Rusyn and Jewish toilers against the exploiters of the same nationalities\".

The Allies, however, had few alternatives to choosing Czechoslovakia. Hungary had lost the war and therefore gave up its claims; Ukraine was seen as politically unviable; and Russia was in the midst of a civil war. Thus the Rusyns' decision to become part of Czechoslovakia can only have been important in creating, at least initially, good relations between the leaders of Carpathian Rus and Czechoslovakia.

In 1939, census records showed that 80,000 Jews lived in the autonomous province of Ruthenia. Jews made up approximately 14% of the prewar population, however this population was concentrated in the larger towns, especially [[Mukachevo]], where they constituted 43% of the prewar population. \nAfter the [[Operation Margarethe|German occupation of Hungary]] the pro-[[Nazi]] policies of the Hungarian government resulted in emigration and deportation of Hungarian-speaking [[Jew]]s, and other groups living in the territory were decimated by war. \nDuring the [[Holocaust]], 17 main ghettos were set up in cities in Carpathian Ruthenia, from which all Jews were taken to [[Auschwitz]] for extermination. Ruthenian ghettos were set up in May 1944 and liquidated by June 1944. Most of the Jews of Transcarpathia were killed, though a number survived, either because they were hidden by their neighbours, or were forced into [[labour battalion]]s, which often guaranteed food and shelter.\n\nThe end of the war had a significant impact on the ethnic Hungarian population of the area: 10,000 fled before the arrival of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces. Many of the remaining adult men (25,000) were deported to the Soviet Union; about 30% of them died in Soviet [[labor camp]]s. As a result of this development since 1938, the Hungarian and Hungarian-speaking population of Transcarpathia was recorded differently in various censuses and estimations from that time: 1930 census recorded 116,548 ethnic Hungarians, while the contested Hungarian census from 1941 shows as much as 233,840 speakers of Hungarian language in the region. Subsequent estimations are showing 66,000 ethnic Hungarians in 1946 and 139,700 in 1950, while the Soviet census from 1959 recorded 146,247 Hungarians.\n\n=== Transition to Soviet takeover and control (1944-1945)===\n[[File:ZakapratskaUkraina1944.png|thumb|Front page of the Zakarpattia Ukraine newspaper (1944) with manifest of unification with the [[Soviet Ukraine]] (not Ukrainian SSR)]]\nThe Soviet takeover of the region started with the [[East Carpathian Strategic Offensive]] in the fall of 1944.

The court was allowed to hand down either 10 years of forced labour, or death penalty. Several Ruthenian leaders, including [[Andrej Br\u00f3dy]] and [[Shtefan Fentsyk]], were condemned and executed in May 1946. [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]] also died in prison. The extent of the repression showed to many Carpatho-Ruthenian activists how it would not have been possible to find an accommodation with the coming Soviet regime as it had been with all previous ones.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\nAfter breaking the [[Greek Catholic Church]] in Eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] in 1946, Soviet authorities pushed for the return to Orthodoxy of Greek-Catholic parishes in Transcarpathia too, including by engineering the accident and death of recalcitrant bishop [[Theodore Romzha]] on 1 November 1947. In January 1949 the [[Greek-Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo]] was declared illegal; remaining priests and nuns were arrested, and church properties were nationalised and parcelled for public use or lent to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] (Moscow Patriarchate) as only accepted religious authority in the region.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\nCultural institutions were also forbidden, including the russophile Dukhnovych Society, the ukrainophile Prosvita, and the Subcarpathian Scholarly Society. New books and publications were circulated, including the ''Zakarpatsk{{'}}a Pravda'' (130,000 copies). The [[Uzhhorod National University]] was opened in 1945. Over 816 cinematographs were open by 1967 to insure the indoctrination of the population to marxism-leninism.  The [[Ukrainian language]] was the first language of instruction in schools throughout the region, followed by Russian, which was used at the university. Most new generations had a passive knowledge of Rusyn language, but no knowledge about local culture. XIX-century Rusyn intellectuals were labelled as \"members of the reactionary class and instruments of Vatican obscurantism\". The Rusyn anthem and hymn were banned from public performance. Carpatho-Rusyn folk culture and songs, which were promoted, were presented as part of Transcarpathian regional culture as a local variant of Ukrainian culture. <ref name=magocsi/>\n\nAs early as 1924, the [[Comintern]] had declared all East Slavic inhabitants of Czechoslovakia ([[Rusyns]], Carpatho-Russians, [[Rusnaks]]) to be [[Ukrainians]]. As the 1946 census, all Rusyns were recorded as Ukrainians; anyone clinging to the old label was considered a separatist and a potential counter-revolutionary. \n\nAlready in February 1945, the National Council proceeded to confiscate 53,000 hectares of land from big landwoners and redistribute it to 54,000 peasant households (37% of the population). Forced collectivisation of land started in 1946; around 2,000 peasants were arrested during protests in 1948-49 and sent for forced labour in the [[gulags]]. Collectivisation, including of mountain shepherds, was completed by May 1950. Central planning decisions set Transcarpatia to become a \"land of orchards and vineyards\" between 1955 and 1965, planting 98,000 hectares with little results. Attempt to cultivate tea and citrus also failed due to climate. Most vineyards were uprooted twenty years later, during [[Gorbachev]]'s anti-alcohol campaign in 1985-87.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\nThe Soviet period also meant the upscaling of industrialisation in Transcarpathia. State-owned lumber mills, chemical and food-processing plants widened, with Mukachevo's tobacco factory and Solotvyno's salt works as the biggest ones, providing steady employment to the residents of the region, beyond the traditional subsistence agriculture. And while traditional labour migration routes to the fields of Hungary or the factories of the Nort-West United States were now closed, Carpathian Ruthens and Romanians could now move for seasonal work in Russia's North and East.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\nThe inhabitants of the oblast grew steadily in the Soviet period, from 776,000 in 1946 to over 1,2 million in 1989. Uzhgorod increased its residents five-fold, from 26,000 to 117,000, and [[Mukachevo]] likewise from 26,600 to 84,000. This population increase also reflected demographic changes. The arrival of the Red Army meant the departure of 5,100 Magyars and 2,500 Germans, while the 15-20,000 Jews survivors of the Holocaust also decided to move out before the borders were sealed. By 1945, around 30,000 Hungarians and Germans had been interned and sent for labour camps in Eastern Ukraine and Siberia; while amnestied in 1955, around 5,000 did not come back. In January 1946, 2,000 more Germans were deported. In return, a large number of Ukrainians and Russians moved to Transcarpathia, were they found jobs in the industry, the military, or the civilian administration. By 1989, around 170,000 Ukrainians (mainly from nearby Galizia) and 49,000 Russians were living in Transcarpatia, mainly in new residential blocks in the main towns of Uzhgorod and Mukachevo, where the dominant language had soon turned from Hungarian and Yiddish to Russian. They kept being considered newcomers (''novoprybuli'') due to their disconnect from the Rusyn- and Hungarian-speaking countryside.<ref name=magocsi/>\n\n===Transition to independent Ukraine (1991-)===\n{{History of Ukraine}}\n{{See also|Zakarpattia Oblast|1991 Transcarpathian general regional referendum}}\nIn July 1991 the [[Ukrainian SSR]] adopted a law about referendums that lasted until 2012. Soon after the [[August Putch]] in Moscow (19\u201322), on 24 August 1991 the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament) of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] proclaimed declaration about its independence and also prohibited the Communist Party in the republic.<ref name=zakrp110922>Pipash, Volodymyr.

August 1991 the deputy chairman of the regional council Yuriy Vorobets signed an order to hold an extraordinary session of the council on 30 August, but on 29 August the head of the council Mykhailo Voloshchuk (formerly the 1st secretary of the [[Zakarpattia Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine|Zakarpattia regional communist party committee]]) postponed it by a separate order.<ref name=zakrp110922/> On 28 August 1991 the demand for the extraordinary session was supported by the Zakarpattia Democratic League of Youth that previously was part of the [[Komsomol of Ukraine]] (LKSMU).<ref name=zakrp110922/> To relieve the pressure, Voloshchuk approved a composition of provisional deputy commission for inspection of activity of officials during the putsch that consisted of 17 members mostly of the recently dissolved Communist Party and couple of Rukh members ([[:uk:\u0422\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0439\u043b\u043e

communities and transferred them as own property 83 church buildings.<ref name=zakrp110922/>\n\nThe government of Zakarpattia decided to bet on separatist actions.<ref name=zakrp110922/> On 27 August 1991 the Mukachevo city council decided to ask the Zakarpattia regional council to adopt a decision about proclamation of the region as the \"Zakarpattia autonomous land of Ukraine\".<ref

[[Places inhabited by Rusyns]] also span adjacent regions of the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including regions of present-day [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], and [[Romania]]. Ruthenian settlements exist in the [[Balkans]] as well.\n\nIn the 19th century and the first part of the 20th, the inhabitants of Transcarpathia continued to call themselves \"Ruthenians\" (\"''Rusyny''\").  After Soviet annexation the ethnonym \"Ukrainian\", which had replaced \"Ruthenian\" in eastern Ukraine at the turn of the century, was also applied to  Ruthenians/Rusyns of Transcarpathia.  Most present-day inhabitants consider themselves ethnically [[Ukrainians]], although in the most recent census 10,100 people (0.8% of Zakarpattia Oblast's 1.26 million) identified themselves as ethnically [[Rusyns|Rusyn]].\n\n=== Hungarians ===\n[[File:Zakarpatska2001HungarianLanguage.PNG|thumb|Percentage of Hungarian native speakers in [[Zakarpattia oblast]] according to 2001 census]]\nThe following data is according to the Ukrainian census of 2001.\n\n{{Main|Hungarians in Ukraine}}\nThe 1910 Austro-Hungarian census shows 185,433 speakers of Hungarian language, while the Czechoslovak census of 1921 shows 111,052 ethnic Hungarians and 80,132 ethnic Jews, many of whom were speakers of Hungarian language. Much of the difference in these censuses reflects differences in methodology and definitions rather than a decline in the region's ethnic Hungarian ([[Magyars|Magyar]]) or Hungarian-speaking population. According to the 1921 census, Hungarians constituted about 17.9% of the region's total population.\n\nThe end of [[World War II]] had a significant impact on the ethnic Hungarian population of the area: 10,000 fled before the arrival of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces. Many of the remaining adult men (25,000) were deported to the Soviet Union; about 30% of them died in Soviet [[labor camp]]s. As a result of this development since 1938, the Hungarian and Hungarian-speaking population of Transcarpathia was recorded differently in various censuses and estimations from that time: 1930 census recorded 116,548 ethnic Hungarians, while the contested Hungarian census from 1941 shows as much as 233,840 speakers of Hungarian language in the region. Subsequent estimations are showing 66,000 ethnic Hungarians in 1946 and 139,700 in 1950, while the Soviet census from 1959 recorded 146,247 Hungarians.\n\n{{As of|2004}}, about 170,000 (12\u201313%) inhabitants of Transcarpathia declare Hungarian as their mother tongue. Homeland Hungarians refer to Hungarians in Ukraine as ''k\u00e1rp\u00e1taljaiak''.\n\n=== Jews ===\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Carpathian Ruthenia}}\n[[File:Ukrainian Jews from Galicia (left) and Mukachevo (right), 1821.jpg|thumb|180px|Jews from Galicia (left) and Mukachevo (right), 1821]]\nMemoirs and historical studies provide much evidence that in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Rusyn-Jewish relations were generally peaceful. In 1939, census records showed that 80,000 Jews lived in the autonomous province of Ruthenia. Jews made up approximately 14% of the prewar population, however this population was concentrated in the larger towns, especially [[Mukachevo]], where they constituted 43% of the prewar population. Most of them perished during the [[Holocaust]].\n\n=== Germans ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}\nSee [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union]] for information about Carpathian-German (mainly German-speaking [[Bohemian]], [[Moravia]]n German and [[Lower Saxony|Saxon]]/[[Low German]] from middle and eastern Germany) settlement in the 16th to 18th centuries.\n\n=== Czechs ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2014}}\n[[Czechs]] in Carpathian Ruthenia are ethnoculturally distinct from other [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] groups like the Slovaks, as they originated from Czech-speaking groups from [[Bohemia]] and [[Moravia]] instead of Slovakia.\n\n=== Romani ===\nThere are approximately 25,000 ethnic [[Romani people|Romani]] in present-day Transcarpathia. Some estimates point to a number as high as 50,000 but a true count is hard to obtain as many Romani will claim to be Hungarian or Romanian when interviewed by Ukrainian authorities.\n\nThey are by far the poorest and least-represented ethnic group in the region and face intense prejudice. The years since the fall of the USSR have not been kind to the Romani of the region, as they have been particularly hard hit by the economic problems faced by peoples all over the former USSR. Some Romani in western Ukraine live in major cities such as [[Uzhhorod]] and [[Mukachevo]], but most live in encampments on the outskirts of cities. These encampments are known as \"taberi\" and can house up to 300 families. These encampments tend to be fairly primitive with no running water or electricity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.romaniyag.uz.ua/en/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-12-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314022109/http://romaniyag.uz.ua/en/ |archive-date=2007-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Romanians ===\n[[File:Romanians of Zakarpattya Oblast dancing.jpg|thumb|Traditional costume of Romanians of Zakkarpatia]]\nToday some 30,000 Romanians live in this region, mostly in northern [[Maramure\u0219]], around the southern towns of '''Rah\u0103u'''/[[Rakhiv]] and '''Teceu Mare'''/[[Tiachiv]] and close to the border with Romania.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Greeks ===\nAlso known as Carpatho-Greeks and Greek-Carpathians.\n\n=== Armenians ===\nDescendants of [[Armenians]] who came and settled in the region in the 15th to 18th centuries.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n== Western views ==\nFor urban European readers in the 19th century, Ruthenia was one origin of the 19th century's imaginary \"[[Ruritania]]\" the most rural, most rustic and deeply provincial tiny province lost in forested mountains that could be imagined.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Conceived sometimes as a kingdom of central Europe, Ruritania was the setting of several novels by [[Anthony Hope]], especially ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' (1894).\n\nRecently [[Vesna Goldsworthy]], in ''Inventing Ruritania: the imperialism of the imagination'' (1998) has explored the origins of the ideas that underpin Western perceptions of the \"Wild East\" of Europe, especially of Ruthenian and other rural Slavs in the upper Balkans, but ideas that are highly applicable to Transcarpathia, all in all \"an innocent process: a cultural great power seizes and exploits the resources of an area, while imposing new frontiers on its mind-map and creating ideas which, reflected back, have the ability to reshape reality.\"\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Black Ruthenia]]\n* [[Red Ruthenia]]\n* [[White Ruthenia]]\n* [[Military history of Carpathian Ruthenia during World War II]]\n* [[Ruthenians and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)]]\n* [[Eparchy of Muka\u010devo and Pre\u0161ov]]\n* [[Alexander Dukhnovych]]\n* [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]]\n* [[Ukrainian dialects]]\n* [[K\u00e1rp\u00e1talja football team]]\n* [[Magyaron]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n{{Reflist|group=A}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Baerlein, Henri (1938).

have been proposed by the [[United States Congress]] and sent to the [[U.S. state|states]] for [[ratification#Ratification in the United States Constitution|ratification]] since the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] was put into operation on March 4, 1789. Twenty-seven of these, having been ratified by the requisite number of states (38, since 1959), are part of the Constitution. The first ten amendments were adopted and ratified simultaneously and are known collectively as the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]. Six amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states have not been ratified by the required number of states. Four of these amendments are still pending, one is closed and has failed by its own terms, and one is closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it. All 33 amendments are listed and detailed in the tables below.\n\n[[Article Five of the United States Constitution]] details the two-step process for [[Constitutional amendment|amending]] the nation's frame of government. Amendments must be properly ''proposed'' and ''ratified'' before becoming operative.

Screw piles are manufactured using varying sizes of tubular hollow sections for the pile or anchors shaft.\n\nThe pile shaft transfers a [[structure]]'s load into the pile.  Helical steel plates are welded to the pile shaft in accordance with the intended ground conditions.  Helices can be press-formed to a specified pitch or simply consist of flat plates welded at a specified pitch to the pile's shaft. The number of helices, their diameters and position on the pile shaft as well as steel plate thickness are all determined by a combination of:\n\n# The combined structure design load requirement\n# The [[geotechnical]] parameters\n# Environmental [[corrosion]] parameters\n# The minimum [[design life]] of the structure being supported or restrained.\n\nScrew pile steel shaft sections are subjected to design parameters and building codes standards for the region of manufacture.\n\n==Installation==\nScrew piles are wound into the ground much like a screw into wood.

Rotary hydraulic powerheads with [[torque]] capacities ranging from 5,000&nbsp;Nm to 500,000&nbsp;Nm are custom fitted using various boom configurations.  Special drive attachments connect the screw pile to the machine.  Correct installation techniques are paramount to meet engineered design load and settlement outcomes.  Incorrect techniques are likely to result in poor overall pile performance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Screwpilediagram.gif|right|alt=Line drawing of two short helical blades on a long shaft| A screw pile.]]\nScrew piles can be referred to as '''screw-piles''', '''steel screw-in foundations''', '''screw piers''', '''helical piles''', '''helical anchors''', '''screw anchors''', '''screw foundations''' and '''helical piers'''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helical Piles FAQ|url=https://www.piertech.com/products/helical-piers.html}}</ref> Screw piles were first described by the Irish civil engineer [[Alexander Mitchell (engineer)|Alexander Mitchell]] in a paper in ''Civil Engineer's and Architects Journal'' in 1848 - however, helical piles had been used for almost a decade by this point.<ref name=Perko09>Howard A. Perko ''Helical Piles: A Practical Guide to Design and Installation'' John Wiley and Sons, 2009 {{ISBN|0-470-40479-5}} pages 3-11</ref> Screw foundations first appeared in the 1800s  as pile foundations for lighthouses,<ref>William John Macquorn Rankine ''A manual of civil engineering'', C. Griffin, 1876 p. 605, p. 766</ref> and were extensively used for piers in harbours. Between the 1850s through 1890s, more than 100 [[screw-pile lighthouse]]s were erected on the east coast of the United States using screw piles. Made originally from cast or wrought iron, they had limited bearing and tension capacities. Modern screw pile load capacities are in excess of {{convert|2000|kN|STf|abbr=on}}.  Large load capacity screw piles may have various components such as flat half helices, Bisalloy cutting tips and helices, cap plates or re-bar interfaces for connection to various concrete or steel structures.\n\nMore recently, [[composite_materials|composite]] technology has been developed and patented for use in small screw piles.  Composites offer significant advantages over steel in small screw pile manufacture and installed performance.\n\nScrew pile design is based on standard structural and geotechnical principles. Screw pile designers typically use their own design software which has been developed through [[field testing]] of differing compression pile and tension anchor configurations in various soil profiles.  Corrosion is addressed based on extended field trials, combined with worldwide databases on steel in ground corrosion.\n\n==Modern use and benefits==\nScrew pile foundations are still used extensively, and their usage has extended from lighthouses to rail, telecommunications, roads, and numerous other industries where fast installation is required, or building work takes place close to existing structures.\n\nMost industries use screw pile foundations due to the cost efficiencies and - increasingly - the reduced environmental impact. 'Screwing' the foundations in the ground means that there is less soil displacement so excess soil does not need to be transported from the site, saving on transportation costs and reducing the carbon footprint of the project.\n\nThe main benefits of screw pile foundations include: shorter project times, ease of installation, ease of access, reduction of the carbon footprint, ease of removal when the foundations are no longer required, reduced risk to the workforce, and reduced costs.\n\nThey are also suitable for both tensile and compression loads, so they are also used for masts, signs, and retaining structures.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Deep foundations]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:StackOfScrewPiles.jpg|right|thumb|alt=photo of a stack of helical anchors at a construction site|Helical anchors.]]\n'''Screw piles''', sometimes referred to as '''screw anchors''', '''screw-piles''', '''helical piles''', and '''helical anchors''' are a steel screw-in piling and [[Earth anchor|ground anchoring]] system used for building [[Deep foundation|deep]] [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]].

Incorrect techniques are likely to result in poor overall pile performance.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Screwpilediagram.gif|right|alt=Line drawing of two short helical blades on a long shaft| A screw pile.]]\nScrew piles can be referred to as '''screw-piles''', '''steel screw-in foundations''', '''screw piers''', '''helical piles''', '''helical anchors''', '''screw anchors''', '''screw foundations''' and '''helical piers'''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helical Piles FAQ|url=https://www.piertech.com/products/helical-piers.html}}</ref> Screw piles were first described by the Irish civil engineer [[Alexander Mitchell (engineer)|Alexander Mitchell]] in a paper in ''Civil Engineer's and Architects Journal'' in 1848 - however, helical piles had been used for almost a decade by this point.<ref name=Perko09>Howard A. Perko ''Helical Piles: A Practical Guide to Design and Installation'' John Wiley and Sons, 2009 {{ISBN|0-470-40479-5}} pages 3-11</ref> Screw foundations first appeared in the 1800s  as pile foundations for lighthouses,<ref>William John Macquorn Rankine ''A manual of civil engineering'', C. Griffin, 1876 p. 605, p. 766</ref> and were extensively used for piers in harbours. Between the 1850s through 1890s, more than 100 [[screw-pile lighthouse]]s were erected on the east coast of the United States using screw piles. Made originally from cast or wrought iron, they had limited bearing and tension capacities. Modern screw pile load capacities are in excess of {{convert|2000|kN|STf|abbr=on}}.  Large load capacity screw piles may have various components such as flat half helices, Bisalloy cutting tips and helices, cap plates or re-bar interfaces for connection to various concrete or steel structures.\n\nMore recently, [[composite_materials|composite]] technology has been developed and patented for use in small screw piles.  Composites offer significant advantages over steel in small screw pile manufacture and installed performance.\n\nScrew pile design is based on standard structural and geotechnical principles. Screw pile designers typically use their own design software which has been developed through [[field testing]] of differing compression pile and tension anchor configurations in various soil profiles.  Corrosion is addressed based on extended field trials, combined with worldwide databases on steel in ground corrosion.\n\n==Modern use and benefits==\nScrew pile foundations are still used extensively, and their usage has extended from lighthouses to rail, telecommunications, roads, and numerous other industries where fast installation is required, or building work takes pblace close to existing structures.\n\nMost industries use screw pile foundations due to the cost efficiencies and - increasingly - the reduced environmental impact. 'Screwing' the foundations in the ground means that there is less soil displacement so excess soil does not need to be transported from the site, saving on transportation costs and reducing the carbon footprint of the project.\n\nThe main benefits of screw pile foundations include: shorter project times, ease of installation, ease of access, reduction of the carbon footprint, ease of removal when the foundations are no longer required, reduced risk to the workforce, and reduced costs.\n\nThey are also suitable for both tensile and compression loads, so they are also used for masts, signs, and retaining structures..\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Deep foundations]]\n", "name_user": "Argyriou", "label": "safe", "comment": "remove minor mistakes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw_piles"}

In a series of three stages, the conquest of the [[Maghreb]] commenced in 647 and concluded in 709 with the \"Byzantine\" Roman Empire losing its last remaining strongholds to the then-[[Umayyad Caliphate]].\n\nBy 642 AD, under [[Caliph Umar]], Arab forces had laid control of [[Mesopotamia]] (638), [[Syria]] (641), [[Egypt]] (642), and had invaded [[Armenia]], all previously territories split between the warring [[Byzantine]] and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] Empires, and were concluding their conquest of the Persian Empire with their defeat of the Persian army at the [[Battle of Nah\u0101vand]]. It was at this point that Arab military expeditions into North African regions west of Egypt were first launched, continuing for years and furthering the [[spread of Islam]].\n\nIn 644 at Madinah, Caliph [[Umar]] (Omar) was succeeded by [[Uthman ibn Affan]] (Othman), during whose twelve-year rule Armenia, [[Cyprus]], and all of [[Iran]], would be added to the growing Arab empire; [[Afghanistan]] and North Africa would receive major invasions; and Arab sea raids would range from [[Rhodes]] to the southern coasts of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The [[Byzantine navy]] would be defeated in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n== Sources for the history of the invasion ==\nThe earliest [[Arab]] accounts that have come down to us are those of [[ibn 'Abd al-Hakam]], [[al-Baladhuri]] and [[Khalifah ibn Khayyat]], all of which were written in the 9th century, some 200 years after the first invasions. These are not very detailed. In the case of the most informative, the ''History of the Conquest of Egypt and North Africa and Spain'' by ibn 'Abd al-Hakam, Robert Brunschvig has shown that it was written  to illustrating points of [[Maliki]] law rather than documenting the history and that some of the events it describes are probably historical.<ref>Brunschvig 1975.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 12th century, scholars at [[Kairouan]] began to construct a new version of the history of the conquest, which was finalised by [[Ibrahim ibn ar-Raqiq]]. This version was copied in its entirety and sometimes interpolated, by later authors, reaching its zenith in the 14th century with scholars such as [[ibn Idhari]], [[ibn Khaldun]] and [[al-Nuwayri]]. It differs from the earlier version not only in the greater detail but also in giving conflicting accounts of events. This, however, is the best-known version and is the one given below.\n\nThere is ongoing controversy regarding the relative merits of the two versions. For more information, refer to the works cited below by Brunschvig, [[Yves Mod\u00e9ran|Mod\u00e9ran]] and Benabb\u00e8s (all supporters of the earlier version) and Siraj (supports the later version).\n\n== First invasion ==\nThe first invasion of [[North Africa]], ordered by [[Abdallah ibn Sa'd]], commenced in 647. 20,000 Arabs marched from [[Medina]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], another 20,000 joined them in [[Memphis, Egypt]], and [[Abdallah ibn Sa'd]] led them into the Byzantine [[Exarchate of Africa]]. The army took [[Tripolitania]] (in present-day [[Libya]]). [[Gregory the Patrician|Count Gregory]], the local Byzantine governor,<ref>\nRodd, Francis. \"Kahena, Queen of the Berbers: \"A Sketch of the Arab Invasion of Ifriqiya in the First Century of the Hijra\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, Vol. 3, No. 4, (1925), 731-2\n</ref> had declared his independence from the [[Byzantine Empire]] in North Africa. He gathered his allies, confronted the invading Islamic Arab forces and suffered defeat (647) at the [[Battle of Sufetula]], a city 240 kilometres (150&nbsp; mi) south of [[Carthage]]. With the death of Gregory his successor, probably [[Gennadius (7th century)|Gennadius]], secured the Arab withdrawal in exchange for tribute. The campaign lasted fifteen months and Abdallah's force returned to Egypt in 648.\n\nAll further Arab conquests were soon interrupted, however, the [[Kharijite]] dissidents murdered  Caliph Uthman after holding him under house arrest in 656. He was replaced by [[Ali]], who in turn was assassinated in 661. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] of largely secular(it adopted an Islamic/Arab supremacy ideology later on) and hereditary Arab caliphs, then established itself at [[Damascus]] and Caliph [[Muawiyah I]] began consolidating the empire from the [[Aral Sea]] to the western border of Egypt. He put a governor in place in Egypt at [[Cairo|al-Fustat]], creating a subordinate seat of power that would continue for the next two centuries. He then continued the invasion of non-Muslim neighbouring states, attacking [[Sicily]] and [[Anatolia]] (in Asia Minor) in 663. In 664 [[Kabul]], Afghanistan fell to the invading Arab armies.\n\n== Second invasion ==\n[[File: Great Mosque of Kairouan Stitched Panorama - Grande Mosqu\u00e9e de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The Arab conqueror and general Uqba Ibn Nafi founded the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] \n(also known as the Mosque of Uqba) in 670 AD - the oldest and most important mosque in North Africa,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA248 Hans Kung, ''Tracing the Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, page 248]</ref> city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].]]\n\nThe years 665 to 689 saw a new Arab invasion of [[North Africa]].\n\nIt began, according to [[Will Durant]], to protect Egypt \"from flank attack by Byzantine Cyrene\". So \"an army of more than 40,000 Arabs advanced through the desert to [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]], took it, and marched to the neighbourhood of Carthage\", defeating a defending Byzantine army of 20,000 in the process.\n\nNext came a force of 10,000 Arabs led by the Arab general [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] and enlarged by thousands of others. Departing from Damascus, the army marched into North Africa and took the vanguard. In 670 the city of [[Kairouan]] (roughly 150 kilometers [80&nbsp;mi] south of modern [[Tunis]]) was established{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} as a refuge and base for further operations. This would become the capital of the Arab province of [[Ifriqiya]], which would cover the coastal regions of today's western [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], and eastern [[Algeria]].\n\nAfter this, as [[Edward Gibbon]] writes, the fearless general \"plunged into the heart of the country, traversed the wilderness in which his successors erected the splendid capitals of [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] and [[Morocco]], and at length penetrated to the verge of the Atlantic and the [[Sahara|great desert]]\". In his conquest of the [[Maghreb]] (western North Africa) he besieged the coastal city of [[Bejaia|Bugia]] as well as Tingi or [[Tangier]], overwhelming what had once been the traditional [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] province of [[Mauretania Tingitana]].\n\nBut here he was stopped and partially repulsed. Luis Garcia de Valdeavellano writes:\n\n<blockquote>In their invasions against the Byzantines and the Berbers, the Arab chieftains had greatly extended their African dominions, and as early as the year 682 Uqba had reached the shores of the Atlantic, but he was unable to occupy Tangier, for he was forced to turn back toward the Atlas Mountains by a man who became known to history and legend as [[Julian, count of Ceuta|Count Julian]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}</blockquote>\n\nMoreover, as Gibbon writes, Uqba, \"this Mahometan Alexander, who sighed for new worlds, was unable to preserve his recent conquests. By the universal rebellion against Arab occupation of the Greeks and Africans he was recalled from the shores of the Atlantic.\" On his return, a Berber-Byzantine coalition [[Battle of Vescera|ambushed]] and crushed his forces near [[Biskra]], killing Uqba and wiping out his troops.\n\nThen, adds Gibbon, \"The third general or governor of Africa, [[Zuhayr ibn Qays|Zuhayr]], avenged and encountered the fate of his predecessor in the [[Battle of Mamma]]. He vanquished the native population in many battles; but he was overthrown by a powerful army, which [[Constantinople]] had sent to the relief and liberation of Carthage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a new civil war among rivals for the monarchy raged in Arabia and Syria. It resulted in a series of four caliphs between the death of [[Muawiyah I|Muawiya]] in 680 and the accession of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (Abdalmalek) in 685; strife ended only in 692 with the death of the rebel leader.\n\n== Third invasion ==\n\nThis development brought about a return of domestic order that allowed the caliph to resume the Arab invasion of North Africa. It began with the renewed invasion of Ifriqiya. Gibbon writes:\n<blockquote>the standard was delivered to Hassan governor of Egypt, and the revenue of that kingdom, with an army of forty thousand men, was consecrated to the important service. In the vicissitudes of war, the interior provinces had been alternately won and lost by the Saracens. But the seacoast l remained in the hands of the Greeks; the predecessors of Hassan had respected the name and fortifications of Carthage, and the number of its defenders was recruited by the fugitives of [[Gab\u00e8s|Cabes]] and [[Tripoli]]. The arms of Hassan were bolder and more fortunate: he reduced and pillaged the metropolis of Africa; and the mention of scaling-ladders may justify the suspicion, that he anticipated, by a sudden assault, the more tedious operations of a regular siege.</blockquote>\n\nIn 698, the Arabs [[Battle of Carthage (698)|conquered Carthage]] under [[Hassan ibn al-Numan]] and completed the conquest of the eastern Barbary coast. Anticipating attempts at Byzantine reconquest however, they decided to destroy it. The walls were torn down, the agricultural land ravaged, the aqueducts and harbours made unusable. They established their base instead of at Tunis which was heavily expanded, though [[Kairouan]] remained the governor's capital until late-9th century.<ref name=\"Edmund\"/>\n\nBut the Byzantine Empire responded with troops from Constantinople, joined by soldiers and ships from Sicily and a powerful contingent of [[Visigoth]]s from Hispania. This forced the invading Arab army to run back to Kairouan. Then, writes Gibbon, \u201cthe Christians landed; the citizens hailed the ensign of the cross, and the winter was idly wasted in the dream of victory or deliverance.\u201d\n\nThis was immediately followed by a Berber rebellion against the new Arab warlords. Gibbon writes:\n\n<blockquote>Under the standard of their queen [[Kahina]], the independent tribes acquired some degree of union and discipline; and as the Moors respected in their females the character of a prophetess, they attacked the invaders with an enthusiasm similar to their own. The veteran bands of Hassan were inadequate to the defence of Africa: the conquests of an age were lost in a single day; and the Arabian chief, overwhelmed by the torrent, retired to the confines of Egypt.</blockquote>\n\nIn 703, five years passed before Hassan received fresh troops from the caliph. Meanwhile, the people of North Africa's cities chafed under the Berber reign. Thus Hassan was welcomed upon his return. Gibbon writes that \u201cthe friends of civil society conspired against the savages of the land, and the royal prophetess was slain in the first battle.\u201d\n\nBy the meantime, the Arabs had taken most of North Africa from the Byzantines. The area was divided into three provinces: Egypt with its governor at al-Fustat, Ifriqiya with its governor at Kairouan, and the [[Maghreb]] (modern [[Morocco]]) with its governor at [[Tangiers]].\n\nThe successful general [[Musa bin Nusair]] who was appointed the governor of Ifriqiya. His armies brutally put down the Berbers, consisting of various faiths, who fought against the advancing Muslims. Their conquest reached the Atlantic coast in 708. He was noted for the vast number of [[mawla]] he had amassed which consisted of Berber converts to Islam and people from other regions as well. The number of slaves he took in his various campaigns is said to range from 30,000 to 300,000 in various Arab histories and some even allude to a higher number.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ByLG-2hZX-MC&pg=PA124&dq=musa+300,000#v=onepage&q&f=false|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|title=Slave Soldiers and Islam: The Genesis of a Military System|page=124|isbn=9780300024470|year=1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DMZnCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=maghreb+arabs+8th+century#v=onepage&q=maghreb Arabs 8th century&f=false|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|author=Paul B.

So he built a navy of his own which went on to conquer the Christian islands of [[Ibiza]], [[Majorca]], and [[Menorca]]. Advancing into the Maghreb, his forces took [[Algiers]] in 700.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n\nBy 709, all of North Africa was under the control of the Arab caliphate. The only possible exception was [[Ceuta]] at the African [[Pillars of Hercules|Pillar of Hercules]]. Gibbon declares: \"In that age, as well as in the present, the kings of Spain were possessed of the fortress of Ceuta [...] Musa, in the pride of victory, was repulsed from the walls of Ceuta, by the vigilance and courage of Count Julian, the general of the Goths.\"\n\nOther sources, however, maintain that Ceuta represented the last Byzantine outpost in Africa and that Julian, whom the Arabs called Ilya, was an exarch or Byzantine governor. Valdeavellano offers another possibility, that \"as appears more likely, he may have been a Berber who was the lord and master of the Catholic tribe of Gomera.\" In any case, being an able [[diplomat]] who was adept in Visigothic, Berber, and Arab politics, Julian might well have surrendered to Musa on terms that allowed him to retain his title and command.\n\nAt this time the population of Ceuta included many refugees from a ruinous Visigothic civil war that had broken out in [[Hispania]] (modern Portugal and Spain). These include family and confederates of the late King [[Wittiza]], [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians fleeing forced conversions at the hands of the Visigothic [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church, and [[Jew]]s.\n\nAs Gibbon puts it, Musa received an unexpected message from Julian, \"who offered his place, his person, and his sword\" to the Muslim leader in exchange for help in the civil war. Though Julian's \"estates were ample, his followers bold and numerous\", he \"had little to hope and much to fear from the new reign.\" And he was too feeble to challenge Roderic directly. So he sought Musa's aid.\n\nFor Musa, Julian, \"by his Andalusian and Mauritanian commands, [[...]] held in his hands the keys of the Spanish monarchy.\" And so Musa ordered some initial raids on the southern coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 710. In the spring of that same year [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]]\u2014a Berber, a freed slave, and a Muslim general\u2014took Tangier. Musa thereupon made him governor there, backed by an army of 6,700.\n\nThe next year, 711, Musa directed Tariq to invade Hispania. Disembarking from Ceuta aboard ships provided by Julian, Tariq plunged into the Iberian Peninsula, defeated Roderic, and went on to besiege the Visigothic capital of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. He and his allies also took [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Ecija]], [[Granada]], [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Seville]], and other cities. Due to this, the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] completed the Arab conquest of North Africa.\n\nFearing that the Byzantine Empire might reconquer it, they decided to destroy [[Roman Carthage]] in a [[scorched earth policy]] and establish their headquarters somewhere else. Its walls were torn down, its water supply cut off, the agricultural land was ravaged and its harbours made unusable.<ref name=\"Edmund\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA536&dq=carthage+walls+aqueducts+698#v=onepage&q&f=false|last=Bosworth|first=C.

One of them is the constant wars and conquests as well as persecutions. besides many Christians also migrated to Europe. The Church at that time lacked the backbone of a [[Monasticism|monastic tradition]] and was still suffering from the aftermath of heresies including the so-called [[Donatist]] heresy, and that this contributed to the early obliteration of the Church in the present-day Maghreb. Some historians contrast this with the strong monastic tradition in [[Coptic Egypt]], which is credited as a factor that allowed the Coptic Church to remain the majority faith in that country until around after the 14th century despite numerous persecutions. also, the Romans were unable to completely assimilate the indigenous people like the Berbers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IgYqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA335 Ancient African Christianity: An Introduction to a Unique Context and Tradition] By David E.

The [[Byzantine navy]] would be defeated in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\n== Sources for the history of the invasion ==\nThe earliest [[Arab]] accounts that have come down to us are those of [[ibn 'Abd al-Hakam]], [[al-Baladhuri]] and [[Khalifah ibn Khayyat]], all of which were written in the 9th century, some 200 years after the first invasions. These are not very detailed. In the case of the most informative, the ''History of the Conquest of Egypt and North Africa and Spain'' by ibn 'Abd al-Hakam, Robert Brunschvig has shown that it was written with a view to illustrating points of [[Maliki]] law rather than documenting the history and that some of the events it describes are probably historical.<ref>Brunschvig 1975.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 12th century, scholars at [[Kairouan]] began to construct a new version of the history of the conquest, which was finalised by [[Ibrahim ibn ar-Raqiq]]. This version was copied in its entirety and sometimes interpolated, by later authors, reaching its zenith in the 14th century with scholars such as [[ibn Idhari]], [[ibn Khaldun]] and [[al-Nuwayri]]. It differs from the earlier version not only in the greater detail but also in giving conflicting accounts of events. This, however, is the best-known version and is the one given below.\n\nThere is ongoing controversy regarding the relative merits of the two versions. For more information, refer to the works cited below by Brunschvig, [[Yves Mod\u00e9ran|Mod\u00e9ran]] and Benabb\u00e8s (all supporters of the earlier version) and Siraj (supports the later version).\n\n== First invasion ==\nThe first invasion of [[North Africa]], ordered by [[Abdallah ibn Sa'd]], commenced in 647. 20,000 Arabs marched from [[Medina]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], another 20,000 joined them in [[Memphis, Egypt]], and [[Abdallah ibn Sa'd]] led them into the Byzantine [[Exarchate of Africa]]. The army took [[Tripolitania]] (in present-day [[Libya]]). [[Gregory the Patrician|Count Gregory]], the local Byzantine governor,<ref>\nRodd, Francis. \"Kahena, Queen of the Berbers: \"A Sketch of the Arab Invasion of Ifriqiya in the First Century of the Hijra\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, Vol. 3, No. 4, (1925), 731-2\n</ref> had declared his independence from the [[Byzantine Empire]] in North Africa. He gathered his allies, confronted the invading Islamic Arab forces and suffered defeat (647) at the [[Battle of Sufetula]], a city 240 kilometres (150&nbsp; mi) south of [[Carthage]]. With the death of Gregory his successor, probably [[Gennadius (7th century)|Gennadius]], secured the Arab withdrawal in exchange for tribute. The campaign lasted fifteen months and Abdallah's force returned to Egypt in 648.\n\nAll further Arab conquests were soon interrupted, however, the [[Kharijite]] dissidents murdered  Caliph Uthman after holding him under house arrest in 656. He was replaced by [[Ali]], who in turn was assassinated in 661. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] of largely secular(it adopted an Islamic/Arab supremacy ideology later on) and hereditary Arab caliphs, then established itself at [[Damascus]] and Caliph [[Muawiyah I]] began consolidating the empire from the [[Aral Sea]] to the western border of Egypt. He put a governor in place in Egypt at [[Cairo|al-Fustat]], creating a subordinate seat of power that would continue for the next two centuries. He then continued the invasion of non-Muslim neighbouring states, attacking [[Sicily]] and [[Anatolia]] (in Asia Minor) in 663. In 664 [[Kabul]], Afghanistan fell to the invading Arab armies.\n\n== Second invasion ==\n[[File: Great Mosque of Kairouan Stitched Panorama - Grande Mosqu\u00e9e de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The Arab conqueror and general Uqba Ibn Nafi founded the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] \n(also known as the Mosque of Uqba) in 670 AD - the oldest and most important mosque in North Africa,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=sm0BfUKwct0C&pg=PA248 Hans Kung, ''Tracing the Way: Spiritual Dimensions of the World Religions'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006, page 248]</ref> city of [[Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]].]]\n\nThe years 665 to 689 saw a new Arab invasion of [[North Africa]].\n\nIt began, according to [[Will Durant]], to protect Egypt \"from flank attack by Byzantine Cyrene\". So \"an army of more than 40,000 Arabs advanced through the desert to [[Barca (ancient city)|Barca]], took it, and marched to the neighbourhood of Carthage\", defeating a defending Byzantine army of 20,000 in the process.\n\nNext came a force of 10,000 Arabs led by the Arab general [[Uqba ibn Nafi]] and enlarged by thousands of others. Departing from Damascus, the army marched into North Africa and took the vanguard. In 670 the city of [[Kairouan]] (roughly 150 kilometers [80&nbsp;mi] south of modern [[Tunis]]) was established{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} as a refuge and base for further operations. This would become the capital of the Arab province of [[Ifriqiya]], which would cover the coastal regions of today's western [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], and eastern [[Algeria]].\n\nAfter this, as [[Edward Gibbon]] writes, the fearless general \"plunged into the heart of the country, traversed the wilderness in which his successors erected the splendid capitals of [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]] and [[Morocco]], and at length penetrated to the verge of the Atlantic and the [[Sahara|great desert]]\". In his conquest of the [[Maghreb]] (western North Africa) he besieged the coastal city of [[Bejaia|Bugia]] as well as Tingi or [[Tangier]], overwhelming what had once been the traditional [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] province of [[Mauretania Tingitana]].\n\nBut here he was stopped and partially repulsed. Luis Garcia de Valdeavellano writes:\n\n<blockquote>In their invasions against the Byzantines and the Berbers, the Arab chieftains had greatly extended their African dominions, and as early as the year 682 Uqba had reached the shores of the Atlantic, but he was unable to occupy Tangier, for he was forced to turn back toward the Atlas Mountains by a man who became known to history and legend as [[Julian, count of Ceuta|Count Julian]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}</blockquote>\n\nMoreover, as Gibbon writes, Uqba, \"this Mahometan Alexander, who sighed for new worlds, was unable to preserve his recent conquests. By the universal rebellion against Arab occupation of the Greeks and Africans he was recalled from the shores of the Atlantic.\" On his return, a Berber-Byzantine coalition [[Battle of Vescera|ambushed]] and crushed his forces near [[Biskra]], killing Uqba and wiping out his troops.\n\nThen, adds Gibbon, \"The third general or governor of Africa, [[Zuhayr ibn Qays|Zuhayr]], avenged and encountered the fate of his predecessor in the [[Battle of Mamma]]. He vanquished the native population in many battles; but he was overthrown by a powerful army, which [[Constantinople]] had sent to the relief and liberation of Carthage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a new civil war among rivals for the monarchy raged in Arabia and Syria. It resulted in a series of four caliphs between the death of [[Muawiyah I|Muawiya]] in 680 and the accession of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (Abdalmalek) in 685; strife ended only in 692 with the death of the rebel leader.\n\n== Third invasion ==\n\nThis development brought about a return of domestic order that allowed the caliph to resume the Arab invasion of North Africa. It began with the renewed invasion of Ifriqiya. Gibbon writes:\n<blockquote>the standard was delivered to Hassan governor of Egypt, and the revenue of that kingdom, with an army of forty thousand men, was consecrated to the important service. In the vicissitudes of war, the interior provinces had been alternately won and lost by the Saracens. But the seacoast still remained in the hands of the Greeks; the predecessors of Hassan had respected the name and fortifications of Carthage, and the number of its defenders was recruited by the fugitives of [[Gab\u00e8s|Cabes]] and [[Tripoli]]. The arms of Hassan were bolder and more fortunate: he reduced and pillaged the metropolis of Africa; and the mention of scaling-ladders may justify the suspicion, that he anticipated, by a sudden assault, the more tedious operations of a regular siege.</blockquote>\n\nIn 698, the Arabs [[Battle of Carthage (698)|conquered Carthage]] under [[Hassan ibn al-Numan]] and completed the conquest of the eastern Barbary coast. Anticipating attempts at Byzantine reconquest however, they decided to destroy it. The walls were torn down, the agricultural land ravaged, the aqueducts and harbours made unusable. They established their base instead of at Tunis which was heavily expanded, though [[Kairouan]] remained the governor's capital until late-9th century.<ref name=\"Edmund\"/>\n\nBut the Byzantine Empire responded with troops from Constantinople, joined by soldiers and ships from Sicily and a powerful contingent of [[Visigoth]]s from Hispania. This forced the invading Arab army to run back to Kairouan. Then, writes Gibbon, \u201cthe Christians landed; the citizens hailed the ensign of the cross, and the winter was idly wasted in the dream of victory or deliverance.\u201d\n\nThis was immediately followed by a Berber rebellion against the new Arab warlords. Gibbon writes:\n\n<blockquote>Under the standard of their queen [[Kahina]], the independent tribes acquired some degree of union and discipline; and as the Moors respected in their females the character of a prophetess, they attacked the invaders with an enthusiasm similar to their own. The veteran bands of Hassan were inadequate to the defence of Africa: the conquests of an age were lost in a single day; and the Arabian chief, overwhelmed by the torrent, retired to the confines of Egypt.</blockquote>\n\nIn 703, five years passed before Hassan received fresh troops from the caliph. Meanwhile, the people of North Africa's cities chafed under the Berber reign. Thus Hassan was welcomed upon his return. Gibbon writes that \u201cthe friends of civil society conspired against the savages of the land, and the royal prophetess was slain in the first battle.\u201d\n\nBy the meantime, the Arabs had taken most of North Africa from the Byzantines. The area was divided into three provinces: Egypt with its governor at al-Fustat, Ifriqiya with its governor at Kairouan, and the [[Maghreb]] (modern [[Morocco]]) with its governor at [[Tangiers]].\n\nThe successful general [[Musa bin Nusair]] who was appointed the governor of Ifriqiya. His armies brutally put down the Berbers, consisting of various faiths, who fought against the advancing Muslims. Their conquest reached the Atlantic coast in 708. He was noted for the vast number of [[mawla]] he had amassed which consisted of Berber converts to Islam and people from other regions as well. The number of slaves he took in his various campaigns is said to range from 30,000 to 300,000 in various Arab histories and some even allude to a higher number.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ByLG-2hZX-MC&pg=PA124&dq=musa+300,000#v=onepage&q&f=false|last=Pipes|first=Daniel|title=Slave Soldiers and Islam: The Genesis of a Military System|page=124|isbn=9780300024470|year=1981}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DMZnCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=maghreb+arabs+8th+century#v=onepage&q=maghreb Arabs 8th century&f=false|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|author=Paul B.

So he built a navy of his own which went on to conquer the Christian islands of [[Ibiza]], [[Majorca]], and [[Menorca]]. Advancing into the Maghreb, his forces took [[Algiers]] in 700.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\n\nBy 709, all of North Africa was under the control of the Arab caliphate. The only possible exception was [[Ceuta]] at the African [[Pillars of Hercules|Pillar of Hercules]]. Gibbon declares: \"In that age, as well as in the present, the kings of Spain were possessed of the fortress of Ceuta [...] Musa, in the pride of victory, was repulsed from the walls of Ceuta, by the vigilance and courage of Count Julian, the general of the Goths.\"\n\nOther sources, however, maintain that Ceuta represented the last Byzantine outpost in Africa and that Julian, whom the Arabs called Ilya, was an exarch or Byzantine governor. Valdeavellano offers another possibility, that \"as appears more likely, he may have been a Berber who was the lord and master of the Catholic tribe of Gomera.\" In any case, being an able [[diplomat]] who was adept in Visigothic, Berber, and Arab politics, Julian might well have surrendered to Musa on terms that allowed him to retain his title and command.\n\nAt this time the population of Ceuta included many refugees from a ruinous Visigothic civil war that had broken out in [[Hispania]] (modern Portugal and Spain). These include family and confederates of the late King [[Wittiza]], [[Arianism|Arian]] Christians fleeing forced conversions at the hands of the Visigothic [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church, and [[Jew]]s.\n\nAs Gibbon puts it, Musa received an unexpected message from Julian, \"who offered his place, his person, and his sword\" to the Muslim leader in exchange for help in the civil war. Though Julian's \"estates were ample, his followers bold and numerous\", he \"had little to hope and much to fear from the new reign.\" And he was too feeble to challenge Roderic directly. So he sought Musa's aid.\n\nFor Musa, Julian, \"by his Andalusian and Mauritanian commands, [[...]] held in his hands the keys of the Spanish monarchy.\" And so Musa ordered some initial raids on the southern coast of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in 710. In the spring of that same year [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]]\u2014a Berber, a freed slave, and a Muslim general\u2014took Tangier. Musa thereupon made him governor there, backed by an army of 6,700.\n\nThe next year, 711, Musa directed Tariq to invade Hispania. Disembarking from Ceuta aboard ships provided by Julian, Tariq plunged into the Iberian Peninsula, defeated Roderic, and went on to besiege the Visigothic capital of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. He and his allies also took [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Ecija]], [[Granada]], [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Seville]], and other cities. Due to this, the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] completed the Arab conquest of North Africa.\n\nFearing that the Byzantine Empire might reconquer it, they decided to destroy [[Roman Carthage]] in a [[scorched earth policy]] and establish their headquarters somewhere else. Its walls were torn down, its water supply cut off, the agricultural land was ravaged and its harbours made unusable.<ref name=\"Edmund\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA536&dq=carthage+walls+aqueducts+698#v=onepage&q&f=false|last=Bosworth|first=C.

One of them is the constant wars and conquests as well as persecutions. In addition many Christians also migrated to Europe. The Church at that time lacked the backbone of a [[Monasticism|monastic tradition]] and was still suffering from the aftermath of heresies including the so-called [[Donatist]] heresy, and that this contributed to the early obliteration of the Church in the present-day Maghreb. Some historians contrast this with the strong monastic tradition in [[Coptic Egypt]], which is credited as a factor that allowed the Coptic Church to remain the majority faith in that country until around after the 14th century despite numerous persecutions. In addition, the Romans were unable to completely assimilate the indigenous people like the Berbers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IgYqDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA335 Ancient African Christianity: An Introduction to a Unique Context and Tradition] By David E.
