It lies within the [[London Basin]] and constitutes a [[commuter town]] {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of [[Central London]]. The town has three secondary schools and a variety of open spaces. It is thought to have been occupied since the [[Bronze Age]].\n\n==History==\nSome of the earliest records of human occupation of Billericay are the [[burial mound]]s in [[Norsey Wood]]: evidence of occupation in the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s. Evidence of [[Roman occupation of Britain|Roman occupation]] has been found at a number of locations in the town and there may have been a small cavalry fort at Blunts Wall.\n\nThe [[Saxons]] did not settle in the centre of Billericay. They established themselves two miles south, at [[Great Burstead]]. In the late 10th century it was known as 'Burhstede'. Billericay was not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], as it lay within Great Burstead. At this time the parish church for Billericay was at Great Burstead.\n\n===Origin of the name===\nBillericay (previously Billerica) is a well-known exception{{clarify|date=May 2018}} in the identification of the [[Toponymy of England|origins of English place-names]]. The name of the town was first recorded as \"Byllyrica\" in 1291. The urban settlement, which was within the manor and parish of [[Great Burstead]], was one of many founded in the late 13th century in an already densely populated rural landscape. \nSeveral suggestions for the origin of the place name include:\n* ''Villa Erica'' (Heather Villa), suggesting a Romano-British origin.\n* ''beller\u012bca'', a medieval [[Latin]] word meaning 'dyehouse or tanhouse'.<ref>'Oxford Dictionary of British Place-Names', A.D. Mills, Oxford University Press</ref>\n* ''billers'', a traditional name for [[watercress]], for which [[Bilbrook (disambiguation)|Bilbrook]] in Somerset and Staffordshire are named.  Watercress was farmed in Billericay springs during the 20th century.\n\nAlthough the precise etymology of the name is not known, England has other places named Billerica:\n* Billerica, Kent. A deserted town adjacent to the settlement of Court-up-Street by [[Port Lympne]]. Significantly this is adjacent to a Roman \"[[Saxon Shore]]\" fort as well as being on spring lines suitable for growing watercress.\n* Billerica Farm, near [[Upton Noble]], Somerset. Although this farm might be named after the other Billericas, the site is also close to springs suitable for farming watercress.\n\nThe Tudor antiquarian [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] believed the already-abandoned Billerica in Kent was a variant of ''Bellocastrum'', \u2018fair castle\u2019 in Latin. In Billericay there is a Roman fort at Blunt's Wall Farm; likewise \u2018[[Burh]]\u2019 gives is name to Great Burstead.\nThis suggests that a Romano-British place name was reused by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] following the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Norsey Woods, Billericay - geograph.org.uk - 48295.jpg|thumb|alt=Norsey Wood|Norsey woods]]\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries some pilgrims to Canterbury journeyed via Billericay. Some of them may have spent the night in Billericay before crossing the [[River Thames]] at [[Tilbury]]. This may account for the large number of inns in the town.\n\nBillericay's most notable historical episode was the [[Battle of Billericay]] during the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381.\n\nThe [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe preachers]] influenced the town. Four local people (Thomas Watts, Joan Hornes, Elizabeth Thackwell and Margaret Ellis) were [[burnt at the stake]]. Two other residents (Joan Potter and James Harris) were tortured for their faith during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]].\n\n===Pilgrim Fathers===\n\nA meeting of the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] prior to their sailing in the ''[[Mayflower]]'' is said to have taken place in Billericay, and many local names and much historical imagery reflect this: Mayflower House, Morris Men, Taxis, School, Hall. Sunnymede School's [[House system|houses]] were called Mayflower, Pilgrim, [[Chantry]] and Martin (after [[Christopher Martin (Mayflower Pilgrim)|Christopher Martin]], a Billericay merchant who travelled on the ''Mayflower'' as Ship's Governor).\n\nThe ''Mayflower'' set sail once the Pilgrim Fathers had all boarded and set to meet the ''Speedwell'' in the English Channel, the ''Speedwell'' sailing from the Netherlands. Unfortunately the ''Speedwell'' developed leaks and so the ships headed for the Devon coast to repair her, but this proved impossible, the ''Mayflower'' eventually sailing from Plymouth without her.\n\nFour people from Billericay were on board, including Christopher Martin. He and his wife Mary, along with Solomon Prowe and John Langemore, perished shortly after their arrival at [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]]. Christopher Martin remained and lived in Plymouth, Massachusetts, until his death in 1640.  His wife Mary (Mayflower) Martin perished in Plymouth in 1621. \n\nThe unfortunate fate of the would-be pioneers did not deter other inhabitants of Billericay from setting sail for the New World. The town of [[Billerica, Massachusetts]] was established in 1655 by colonists from Billericay and named after their home town in England.\n\n===Georgian and Victorian eras===\n\nIn the [[Georgian period]] many excellent examples of the period's houses were built in Billericay. One of those remaining today is Burghstead Lodge in High Street, which used to house the library. Sadly a number were demolished in the 1980s to make way for new developments, notable examples being on Western Road. \n\nIn the town, the Union Workhouse was built in 1840 to continue to implement the [[Poor Law]].  Parts of this building were later incorporated into what was St. Andrew's Hospital. The railway arrived in Billericay in 1889, being on the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] between London and [[Southend-on-Sea]].\n\n===The 20th century===\nIn 1916, during the First World War, a German Zeppelin airship was shot down during an aerial battle over Billericay.  During its fiery demise, it narrowly missed the High Street, crashing into a field off Greens Farm Lane. A plaque was erected at the site in 2016, to commemorate 100 years since the incident. \nParts of the aluminium frame can be seen at the [[Cater Museum]] in Billericay High Street.\nRecent research has indicated that this may be identified with the 'ghost Zeppelin' of Tonbridge which was allegedly seen floating over that town earlier in the day.\n\nSt. Andrew's Hospital, which was formerly the site of the town's Victorian [[workhouse]], continued to function as an important communal building.  From 1973, it housed the internationally renowned Regional Plastic Surgery and Burns unit until this was relocated to Broomfield Hospital, [[Chelmsford]] in April 1998.  After the relocation, most of the hospital was redeveloped into housing. The listed buildings remain intact but are now residential.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lake Meadows, Billericay - geograph.org.uk - 48246.jpg|thumb|alt=Lake surrounded by trees in Billericay|The Boating Lake at Lake Meadows]]\n[[File:Mill_Meadows_-_Butchers_Field_-_Cowslip_-_20160411.jpg|thumb|Picture of Cowslip Wild Flower - Butchers Field - Mill Meadows, Billericay, Essex - 11 April 2016]]\nBillericay is within the [[London Basin]] and lies on a mixture of [[London clay]], [[London clay#Claygate Beds|Claygate Beds]] and [[Bagshot Beds]].  Near the High Street, there is a change in soil type from sandy to clay, which gives rise to local underground springs. Open spaces include [[Norsey Wood]], [[Mill Meadows, Billericay|Mill Meadows Nature Reserve]], Queen's Park Country Park, Sun Corner, [[Lake Meadows]], Hanningfield Reservoir and South Green. Billericay contains [[Billericay School]], [[Mayflower High School]] and [[St John's School (Billericay)|St John's School]].\n\nMill Meadows is a local nature reserve near the centre of Billericay, one of the finest ancient meadow systems in Essex. Centuries of grazing have created the ideal conditions for a wonderful diversity of wild flowers, fungi, insects and invertebrates, many of which are very rare. It also contains an area of 16.63 acres (6.73 ha) that has been declared as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its unimproved neutral grassland.\n\n==Governance==\nBetween 1 July 1837 and 1 July 1939 Billericay was a registration district. Since 1974, the town has been part of the Basildon district. The registry office is located in Basildon, in the council offices. There is also the facility to register deaths in [[Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust|Basildon Hospital]].<ref>[http://www.essexcc.gov.uk/vip8/ecc/ECCWebsite/dis/guc.jsp?channelOid=13563&guideOid=14832&guideContentOid=13933 Basildon District] \u2013 Essex County Council.

The town was previously represented by [[Teresa Gorman]] from 1987 to 2001, a Conservative rebel who had the [[whip (politics)|whip]] withdrawn for opposing the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. Her predecessor, the Conservative MP [[Harvey Proctor]], was also prominent in the news in 1987, when he was charged with indecency.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/16/newsid_2524000/2524727.stm BBC: On this day 16 April 1987], Retrieved 7 September 2006.</ref>\n\n===Local government===\nBillericay is part of the [[Basildon (borough)|Basildon]] district.

The urban district, but not the parish, was renamed [[Basildon Urban District|Basildon]] in 1955. In 1974 the district was abolished and became the present-day [[Basildon (district)|Basildon district]].\n\n==Transport==\n\nBillericay is a part of the [[London commuter belt]].\n\nIt is served by [[Billericay railway station]] on the [[Abellio Greater Anglia]] [[Shenfield to Southend Line|route]] from [[Liverpool Street station]], in the [[City of London]], to [[Southend]].  The station connects to local bus routes.\n\nBillericay is close to two primary routes: the [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12]] to the north and the [[A127 road|A127]] in the south.  The A176 provides a road link to Basildon to the south of Billericay, as well as to the A127.  The only secondary road in the town, the B1007, passes from just south of the town centre as Laindon Road, meets the [[A129 road|A129]] at Sun Corner and then continues northwards as Billericay's High Street and then Stock Road.  It continues north to the county town of Chelmsford.  Along its route is the village of Stock and an interchange to the A12.  The town is a destination on the A129, linking it to the neighbouring towns of Brentwood and Wickford.\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Billericay Cricket Club - geograph.org.uk - 49506.jpg|thumb|alt=Billericay Cricket Club|Billericay Cricket Club]]\n[[File:Billericay Town F.C.

It lies within the [[London Basin]] and constitutes a [[commuter town]] {{convert|25|mi|km}} east of [[Central London]]. The town has three secondary schools and a variety of open spaces. It is thought to have been occupied since the [[Bronze Age]].\n\n==History==\nSome of the earliest records of human occupation of Billericay are the [[burial mound]]s in [[Norsey Wood]]: evidence of occupation in the [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Iron Age]]s. Evidence of [[Roman occupation of Britain|Roman occupation]] has been found at a number of locations in the town and there may have been a small cavalry fort at Blunts Wall.\n\nThe [[Saxons]] did not settle in the centre of Billericay. They established themselves two miles south, at [[Great Burstead]]. In the late 10th century it was known as 'Burhstede'. Billericay was not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], as it lay within Great Burstead. At this time the parish church for Billericay was at Great Burstead.\n\n===Origin of the name===\nBillericay (previously Billerica) is a well-known exception{{clarify|date=May 2018}} in the identification of the [[Toponymy of England|origins of English place-names]]. The name of the town was first recorded as \"Byllyrica\" in 1291. The urban settlement, which was within the manor and parish of [[Great Burstead]], was one of many founded in the late 13th century in an already densely populated rural landscape. \nSeveral suggestions for the origin of the place name include:\n* ''Villa Erica'' (Heather Villa), suggesting a Romano-British origin.\n* ''beller\u012bca'', a medieval [[Latin]] word meaning 'dyehouse or tanhouse'.<ref>'Oxford Dictionary of British Place-Names', A.D. Mills, Oxford University Press</ref>\n* ''billers'', a traditional name for [[watercress]], for which [[Bilbrook (disambiguation)|Bilbrook]] in Somerset and Staffordshire are named.  Watercress was farmed in Billericay springs during the 20th century.\n\nAlthough the precise etymology of the name is not known, England has other places named Billerica:\n* Billerica, Kent. A deserted town adjacent to the settlement of Court-up-Street by [[Port Lympne]]. Significantly this is adjacent to a Roman \"[[Saxon Shore]]\" fort as well as being on spring lines suitable for growing watercress.\n* Billerica Farm, near [[Upton Noble]], Somerset. Although this farm might be named after the other Billericas, the site is also close to springs suitable for farming watercress.\n\nThe Tudor antiquarian [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] believed the already-abandoned Billerica in Kent was a variant of ''Bellocastrum'', \u2018fair castle\u2019 in Latin. In Billericay there is a Roman fort at Blunt's Wall Farm; likewise \u2018[[Burh]]\u2019 gives is name to Great Burstead.\nThis suggests that a Romano-British place name was reused by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] following the [[end of Roman rule in Britain]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Norsey Woods, Billericay - geograph.org.uk - 48295.jpg|thumb|alt=Norsey Wood|Norsey woods]]\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries some pilgrims to Canterbury journeyed via Billericay. Some of them may have spent the night in Billericay before crossing the [[River Thames]] at [[Tilbury]]. This may account for the large number of inns in the town.\n\nBillericay's most notable historical episode was the [[Battle of Billericay]] during the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381.\n\nThe [[John Wycliffe|Wycliffe preachers]] influenced the town. Four local people (Thomas Watts, Joan Hornes, Elizabeth Thackwell and Margaret Ellis) were [[burnt at the stake]]. Two other residents (Joan Potter and James Harris) were tortured for their faith during the reign of [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]].\n\n===Pilgrim Fathers===\n\nA meeting of the [[Pilgrim Fathers]] prior to their sailing in the ''[[Mayflower]]'' is said to have taken place in Billericay, and many local names and much historical imagery reflect this: Mayflower House, Morris Men, Taxis, School, Hall. Sunnymede School's [[House system|houses]] were called Mayflower, Pilgrim, [[Chantry]] and Martin (after [[Christopher Martin (Mayflower Pilgrim)|Christopher Martin]], a Billericay merchant who travelled on the ''Mayflower'' as Ship's Governor).\n\nThe ''Mayflower'' set sail once the Pilgrim Fathers had all boarded and set to meet the ''Speedwell'' in the English Channel, the ''Speedwell'' sailing from the Netherlands. Unfortunately the ''Speedwell'' developed leaks and so the ships headed for the Devon coast to repair her, but this proved impossible, the ''Mayflower'' eventually sailing from Plymouth without her.\n\nFour people from Billericay were on board, including Christopher Martin. He and his wife Mary, along with Solomon Prowe and John Langemore, perished shortly after their arrival at [[Cape Cod]], [[Massachusetts]]. Christopher Martin remained and lived in Plymouth, Massachusetts, until his death in 1640.  His wife Mary (Mayflower) Martin perished in Plymouth in 1621. \n\nThe unfortunate fate of the would-be pioneers did not deter other inhabitants of Billericay from setting sail for the New World. The town of [[Billerica, Massachusetts]] was established in 1655 by colonists from Billericay and named after their home town in England.\n\n===Georgian and Victorian eras===\n\nIn the [[Georgian period]] many excellent examples of the period's houses were built in Billericay. One of those remaining today is Burghstead Lodge in High Street, which used to house the library. Sadly a number were demolished in the 1980s to make way for new developments, notable examples being on Western Road. \n\nIn the town, the Union Workhouse was built in 1840 to continue to implement the [[Poor Law]].  Parts of this building were later incorporated into what was St. Andrew's Hospital. The railway arrived in Billericay in 1889, being on the [[Great Eastern Main Line]] between London and [[Southend-on-Sea]].\n\n===The 20th century===\nIn 1916, during the First World War, a German Zeppelin airship was shot down during an aerial battle over Billericay.  During its fiery demise, it narrowly missed the High Street, crashing into a field off Greens Farm Lane. A plaque was erected at the site in 2016, to commemorate 100 years since the incident. \nParts of the aluminium frame can be seen at the [[Cater Museum]] in Billericay High Street.\nRecent research has indicated that this may be identified with the 'ghost Zeppelin' of Tonbridge which was allegedly seen floating over that town earlier in the day.\n\nSt. Andrew's Hospital, which was formerly the site of the town's Victorian [[workhouse]], continued to function as an important communal building.  From 1973, it housed the internationally renowned Regional Plastic Surgery and Burns unit until this was relocated to Broomfield Hospital, [[Chelmsford]] in April 1998.  After the relocation, most of the hospital was redeveloped into housing. The listed buildings remain intact but are now residential.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Lake Meadows, Billericay - geograph.org.uk - 48246.jpg|thumb|alt=Lake surrounded by trees in Billericay|The Boating Lake at Lake Meadows]]\n[[File:Mill_Meadows_-_Butchers_Field_-_Cowslip_-_20160411.jpg|thumb|Picture of Cowslip Wild Flower - Butchers Field - Mill Meadows, Billericay, Essex - 11 April 2016]]\nBillericay is within the [[London Basin]] and lies on a mixture of [[London clay]], [[London clay#Claygate Beds|Claygate Beds]] and [[Bagshot Beds]].  Near the High Street, there is a change in soil type from sandy to clay, which gives rise to local underground springs. Open spaces include [[Norsey Wood]], [[Mill Meadows, Billericay|Mill Meadows Nature Reserve]], Queen's Park Country Park, Sun Corner, [[Lake Meadows]], Hanningfield Reservoir and South Green. Billericay contains [[Billericay School]], [[Mayflower High School]] and [[St John's School (Billericay)|St John's School]].\n\nMill Meadows is a local nature reserve near the centre of Billericay, one of the finest ancient meadow systems in Essex. Centuries of grazing have created the ideal conditions for a wonderful diversity of wild flowers, fungi, insects and invertebrates, many of which are very rare. It also contains an area of 16.63 acres (6.73 ha) that has been declared as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its unimproved neutral grassland.\n\n==Governance==\nBetween 1 July 1837 and 1 July 1939 Billericay was a registration district. Since 1974, the town has been part of the Basildon district. The registry office is located in Basildon, in the council offices. There is also the facility to register deaths in [[Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust|Basildon Hospital]].<ref>[http://www.essexcc.gov.uk/vip8/ecc/ECCWebsite/dis/guc.jsp?channelOid=13563&guideOid=14832&guideContentOid=13933 Basildon District] \u2013 Essex County Council.

In 1974 the district was abolished and became the present-day [[Basildon (district)|Basildon district]].\n\n==Transport==\n\nBillericay is a part of the [[London commuter belt]].\n\nIt is served by [[Billericay railway station]] on the [[Abellio Greater Anglia]] [[Shenfield to Southend Line|route]] from [[Liverpool Street station]], in the [[City of London]], to [[Southend]].  The station connects to local bus routes.\n\nBillericay is close to two primary routes: the [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12]] to the north and the [[A127 road|A127]] in the south.  The A176 provides a road link to Basildon to the south of Billericay, as well as to the A127.  The only secondary road in the town, the B1007, passes from just south of the town centre as Laindon Road, meets the [[A129 road|A129]] at Sun Corner and then continues northwards as Billericay's High Street and then Stock Road.  It continues north to the county town of Chelmsford.  Along its route is the village of Stock and an interchange to the A12.  The town is a destination on the A129, linking it to the neighbouring towns of Brentwood and Wickford.\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:Billericay Cricket Club - geograph.org.uk - 49506.jpg|thumb|alt=Billericay Cricket Club|Billericay Cricket Club]]\n[[File:Billericay Town F.C.

It was signed on 20 July 1933 by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], who later became [[Pope]] Pius XII, on behalf of Pope [[Pius XI]] and Vice Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] on behalf of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and the German government. It was ratified 10 September 1933 and it has been in force from that date onward. The treaty guarantees the rights of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Germany]]. When bishops take office Article 16 states they are required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the [[Reich|German Reich]] established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical of Pope [[Pius XI]]. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities.<ref>Coppa, Frank J. Editor Controversial Concordats, 1999, p. 143, {{ISBN|0-8132-0920-X}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Reichskonkordat'' is the most controversial of several concordats that the Vatican negotiated during the pontificate of Pius XI. It is frequently discussed in works that deal with the rise of Hitler in the early 1930s and the [[Holocaust]]. The concordat has been described by some as giving moral legitimacy to the Nazi regime soon after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had acquired quasi-[[dictator]]ial powers through the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], an Act itself facilitated through the support of the Catholic Centre Party. The Holy See became the first legal partner to Hitler's regime.\n\nThe treaty places constraints on the political activity of German clergy of the Catholic Church. Following the passage of the 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]] for example, a policy of nonintervention was followed. The majority of the German church hierarchy regarded the treaty as a symbol of peace between church and state.<ref>Beth Griech-Polelle, Bishop von Galen,  Roman Catholicism and Nazi Germany. p. 51, 53</ref> From a Roman Catholic church perspective it has been argued that the Concordat prevented even greater evils being unleashed against the Church.<ref>Evans, 2008, pp 245-246.

It is still in force today.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Germany\u2013Holy See relations|Apostolic Nuncio to Germany}}\n\nThe 'Reichskonkordat' between Germany and the [[Holy See]] was signed on 30 July 1933 and ratified in September of that year.

The [[Catholic Centre Party]] had formed in 1870, initially to represent the religious interests of Catholics and Protestants, but was transformed by the ''Kulturkampf'' into the \"political voice of Catholics\".<ref>Shelley Baranowski; ''Nazi Empire: German Colonialism and Imperialism from Bismarck to Hitler''; Cambridge University Press; 2011; pp.&nbsp;18\u201319</ref> Bismarck's ''Culture Struggle'' was largely a failure.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/microsoft%20word%20-%20693.pdf Yad Vashem \u2013 ''The German Churches in the Third Reich''] by Franklin F.

But even after subsequent feelers were put out between the two parties the negotiations failed, primarily because both the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] and [[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]] were dominated by non-Catholic majorities who, for a variety of reasons, did not want a formal pact with the Vatican.<ref name=\"lewy6\">Lewy, 1964, p. 58</ref> In the absence of an agreement relating to particular areas of concern with the Reich, the Holy See concluded more wide-ranging concordats with three German states where Catholics were concentrated: Bavaria (1924), Prussia (1929), and Baden (1932).<ref name=\"lewy6\">Lewy, 1964, p. 58</ref>\n\n;Pope Pius XI\n{{Main|Pope Pius XI}}\n\n[[Pius XI]] was elected Pope in 1922. His pontificate coincided with the early aftermath of the First World War. The old European monarchies had been largely swept away and a new and precarious order formed across the continent. In the East, the Soviet Union arose. In Italy, the Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] took power, while in Germany, the fragile Weimar Republic collapsed with the Nazi seizure of power.<ref name=\"EBOPiusXI\">''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Online: \"Pius XI\"; web Apr. 2013</ref> Pope Pius's major diplomatic approach was to make [[concordat]]s. However, wrote Hebblethwaite, these concordats did not prove \"durable or creditable\" and \"wholly failed in their aim of safeguarding the institutional rights of the Church\" for \"Europe was entering a period in which such agreements were regarded as mere scraps of paper\".<ref name=\"Peter Hebblethwaite p.118\">Peter Hebblethwaite, ''Paul VI: The First Modern Pope''. Harper Collins Religious. 1993, p.118</ref>\n\nIn 1929, Pius signed the [[Lateran Treaty]] and a concordat with Italy, confirming the existence of an independent [[Vatican City]] state, in return for recognition of the Kingdom of Italy and an undertaking for the papacy to be neutral in world conflicts.<ref name=\"EBOPiusXI\" /> In Article 24 of the concordat, the papacy undertook \"to remain outside temporal conflicts unless the parties concerned jointly appealed for the pacifying mission of the Holy See\".<ref name=\"Peter Hebblethwaite p.124\">Hebblethwaite, p.124</ref> Other major concordats included those signed with Germany (1933), Austria (1935), Yugoslavia (1935), and Latvia (1938).<ref name=\"Peter Hebblethwaite p.118\"/> The concordats were generally observed by the countries involved, with the exception of Germany.<ref>Lapide, p. 91; who also notes that these concordats appear to have strengthened the anti-Zionist faction with the Roman curia (p. 91); example given of the curia pressurizing the Italian authorities to stop an official who was suspected of Zionist sympathies from being appointed the Jerusalem Consul</ref>\n\nIn October 1929, General Groener pushed the German Foreign Ministry to resolve an issue with the Vatican regarding military [[chaplain]]s who lacked the ability to administer the sacraments of baptism or matrimony without first obtaining the permission of the local priest or bishop.<ref name=\"lewy6\">Lewy, 1964, p. 58</ref> Groener wanted the military to have their own bishop rather than rely on local ordinaries and it was this particular issue that was to mark an important step in the discussions that would ultimately be realized in the concordat with the Vatican.<ref name=\"lewy6\">Lewy, 1964, p. 58</ref> In March 1930, the new Papal Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli, gave indications that the Vatican would be interested in a concordat with the Reich in the event of any reforms of the Reich's constitution having an adverse effect on the validity of the concordats already agreed between the German states and the Vatican.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 59</ref>\n\nDiscussions between the two parties took place between 1931 and 1932 and at one point representatives of the Reich pointed out that Italy had an army Archbishop with Cardinal Pacelli indicating that was because Italy had signed a comprehensive concordat with the Vatican.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 60\u201361</ref> The German negotiators continued to discuss solely on the basis of particular points rather than a general concordat during 1931 but even these were felt to be unlikely to be passed by the Reichstag or the Reichsrat, no matter their political or theological leanings.<ref name=\"lewy4\">Lewy, 1964, p. 62</ref>\n\n==Nazi period==\n===Nazis take power===\nIn January 1933, Hitler became Chancellor.

We shall thus be able to settle everything with them in perfect peace and harmony. I shall give them a few years' reprieve. Why should we quarrel? They will swallow anything in order to keep their material advantages. Matters will never come to a head. They will recognise a firm will, and we need only show them once or twice who is the master. They will know which way the wind blows.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 26</ref></blockquote>\n\nAn initially mainly sporadic [[Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany|persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany]] followed the Nazi takeover. Hitler was [[Religious views of Adolf Hitler|hostile to the Catholic Church]], but for political reasons was prepared to restrain his [[anticlericalism]] and did not allow himself to be drawn into attacking the Church publicly as other Nazis would have liked him to do.<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]. ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''. Fontana Press, 1993. pp. 412\u2013413</ref> Kershaw wrote that, following the appointment of Hitler as Chancellor by President von Hindenberg, the Vatican was anxious to reach agreement with the new government, despite \"continuing molestation of Catholic clergy, and other outrages committed by Nazi radicals against the Church and its organisations\".<ref name=\"Ian Kershaw p.295\">Ian Kershaw; ''Hitler: A Biography''; 2008 Edn; W.W. Norton & Co; London; p. 295</ref> In March 1933, the British Roman Catholic periodical ''The Tablet'' in an article titled \"The Ides of March\" asserted: <blockquote> [Hitler's] Dictatorship is a usurpation and his enforcement of it is a brutality. While we write these lines, with news of more arrests and repressions coming to us every hour, we remember that we have reached the Ides of March and the anniversary of a never-forgotten assassination. But Nazism's daggers cannot slay what is noblest and best in Germany. The Church, now that the Centre is no longer the key-group in German politics, may be persecuted; but HITLER will not succeed where BISMARCK failed.<ref>[http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/18th-march-1933/6/the-ides-of-march \"The Ides of March\", ''The Tablet'', 18 March 1933]</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobert Ventresca wrote that ''because'' of increasing harassment of Catholics and Catholic clergy, Cardinal Pacelli sought a quick ratification of a treaty with the government, seeking in this way to protect the German Church. When Vice-Chancellor Papen and Ambassador to the Vatican [[Diego von Bergen]] met Pacelli in late June 1933, they found him \"visibly influenced\" by reports of actions being taken against German Catholic interests.<ref>Ventresca, p. 84</ref>\n\nThere were some thoughts that the Church was keen on coming to terms with Hitler as he represented a strong resistance against Communism. The Papal Nuncio in Berlin (Cesare Osenigo) is reported to have been \"jubilant\" about Hitler's rise to power and thought that the new government would soon be offering the same concessions to the Church that Mussolini had made in Italy.<ref>Lewy, 1964, p. 27</ref> Historian Michael Phayer balances Lewy and author and journalist John Cormwell stating:\n\n{{quote|John Cornwell in ''Hitler's Pope'' argues that the Concordat was the result of a deal that delivered the parliamentary votes to Hitler, thereby giving him dictatorial power (Enabling Act of 23 March 1933). This is historically inaccurate. According to \"Papen Fails to Get Vatican's Support for Hitler's Plans. Pope Refuses Reconstruction of Centrist Party in Reich and General Concordat. Civil Service is Purged, German Decree Ousts Non-Aryans and Leftists and Excludes Their Admission in the Future,\" (The New York Times, 13 April 1933), von Papen and Goering were received by Pius XI in April 1933, but their mission was understood to have been a failure. They had wanted to obtain Vatican support for a scheme to reconstruct the Centre party to insure its stable support of the Hitler government and to conclude a general concordat between the Holy See and the Reich to replace the three present concordats with Prussia, Bavaria, and Baden. Neither suggestion was approved by the Pope. The failure was interpreted as evidence of the Vatican's lack of confidence in the durability of the Nazi government. The Vatican was likewise reticent to abandon the existing concordats with Prussia, Bavaria, and Baden for a general concordat with the Reich. However, there is no question about Pius XII's tenacious insistence on the Concordat retention before, during, and after the Second World War.<ref>Phayer, Michael, ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust (1930\u20131965)'', 2000, Indiana Univ.

When the [[Nazi Party]] polled six million votes during the [[German federal election, 1930|14 September 1930 election]], the Catholic hierarchy called on its people to examine their consciences. During the next two years, though there had been softening by some, the bishops continued to pronounce against unacceptable policies of the Nazi Party.<ref>Falconi, 1966, p. 193; Ian Kershaw notes \"the high level of relative immunity to Nazism which prevailed before 1933 in Catholic circles.\" Kershaw, ''The Hitler Myth'', Oxford, reissued 2001, p. 36)</ref> When [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler as [[Reichskanzler|Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933, the bishops maintained support for the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] (''Zentrum''), which in turn refused to assent to a proposal that would allow Hitler to assume full power. On 12 March 1933 Pope Pius XI received the German Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber|Faulhaber]] in Rome. On his return Faulhaber reported:\n<blockquote>After my recent experience in Rome in the highest circles, which I cannot reveal here, I must say that I found, despite everything, a greater tolerance with regard to the new government. ...Let us meditate on the words of the Holy Father, who in a consistory, without mentioning his name, indicated before the whole world in Adolf Hitler the statesman who first, after the Pope himself, has raised his voice against Bolshevism.<ref>Falconi, 1966, p. 194; Falconi notes that the German bishops would remember this \"papal eulogy\" in a joint memorandum to Hitler on 20 August 1935 which stated \"In the face of this proclamation of the Pope's confidence, millions of men abroad, both Catholics and non-Catholics, have overcome their initial mistrust and accorded credit to your Government.\" p. 194</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt a cabinet meeting on 20 March 1933 Hitler \"confidently reported\" that the Centre Party had now seen the necessity of the Enabling Act and that \"the acceptance of the Enabling Act also by the ''Zentrum'' would signify a strengthening prestige with regard to foreign countries.\"<ref>Kershaw, ''Hitler'', 2009, p. 281</ref> Early in March 1933 the bishops recommended that Catholics vote for the Centre Party in the [[German federal election, March 1933|elections scheduled for 5 March 1933]]. However, two weeks later the Catholic hierarchy reversed its previous policy \u2013 the bishops now allowed the Centre Party and the Bavarian Catholic Party to vote for the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] which gave Hitler dictatorial powers on 23 March.<ref>Falconi, 1966, p. 193; the Catholic Zentrum Party share of the vote (11.2%) was only slightly down on the previous November poll result.

According to Falconi (1966) the about-turn came through the influence and instructions of the Vatican. Pope Pius XI indicated in ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' (1937) that the Germans had asked for the concordat, and Pope Pius XII affirmed this in 1945.<ref>Lapide, p. 101</ref>\n\nFalconi viewed the Church's realignment as motivated by the desire to avoid being left alone in opposition and to avert reprisals. After the leader of the Centre Party, Monsignor [[Ludwig Kaas|Kaas]], had persuaded the party members to vote for Hitler and the Enabling Act, he left immediately for Rome and on his return on 31 March he was received by Hitler. He returned to Rome accompanied by the Catholic Vice-chancellor von Papen on 7 April with a mandate from Hitler to sound out a concordat with the Vatican.<ref name=\"rhodes1\">Rhodes, p. 176</ref> On the day they set out for Rome to prepare the way for the concordat the first two anti-Semitic laws ([[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service|excluding non-Aryans from public office]] and from the legal profession) were issued in Germany, but this did not impede the discussions.<ref>Falconi, p. 207; Lapide (p. 99) notes that on 30 April the leader of an interfaith group asked Cardinal Bertram to help against the boycott of Jewish businesses but was refused because it was purely an economic matter and because Jews had not spoken out when the Church was persecuted.</ref> Papen recorded in his memoirs that on his arrival in Rome, the Pope \"greeted me with paternal affection, expressing his pleasure that at the head of the German State was a man like Hitler, on whose banner the uncompromising struggle against Communism and Nihilism was inscribed.\"<ref name=\"rhodes1\">Rhodes, p. 176</ref> In Falconi's opinion the concordat was the price paid by Hitler in order to obtain the support of the German episcopate and the Catholic parties.<ref>Falconi, 1966, p. 195</ref> [[Ian Kershaw]] viewed the loss of political Catholicism as the sacrifice needed to protect the position of the Catholic Church in Germany.<ref>Kershaw, ''Hitler'', 2009, p. 290</ref> According to historian Michael Phayer, the view \"that the Concordat was the result of a deal that delivered the parliamentary vote of the Catholic Center Party to Hitler, thereby giving him dictatorial power (the Enabling Act of March 1933) ... is historically inaccurate\".<ref>Phayer, Michael, ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust (1930\u20131965)'', 2000, p. 18</ref>\n\nCardinal Faulhaber wrote to Cardinal Pacelli on 10 April 1933 advising that defending the Jews would be wrong \"because that would transform the attack on the Jews into an attack on the Church; and because the Jews are able to look after themselves\"<ref name=\"firstthings.com\">[[Martin Rhonheimer]], [http://www.firstthings.com/article/2003/11/the-holocaust-what-was-not-said \"''The Holocaust: What Was Not Said''\"] First Things Magazine, November 2003.

The Catholic Church considered the Jews pestilent for fifteen hundred years, put them in ghettos, etc., because it recognized the Jews for what they were. In the epoch of liberalism the danger was no longer recognized. I am moving back toward the time in which a fifteen-hundred-year-long tradition was implemented. I do not set race over religion, but I recognize the representatives of this race as pestilent for the state and for the Church, and perhaps I am thereby doing Christianity a great service by pushing them out of schools and public functions.}} The notes of the meeting do not record any response by Berning. In the opinion of [[Martin Rhonheimer]], who cites the above transcript, \"This is hardly surprising: for a Catholic Bishop in 1933 there was really nothing terribly objectionable in this historically correct reminder. And on this occasion, as always, Hitler was concealing his true intentions.\"<ref name=\"firstthings.com\"/> [[Saul Friedl\u00e4nder]] interpreted Hitler's comments as an attempt to \"blunt possible Catholic criticism of his anti-Jewish policies and to shift the burden of the arguments onto the Church itself.<ref>Friedl\u00e4nder, pp. 46\u201347</ref>\n\n[[Edith Stein]] wrote a letter to Pius XI in April 1933 about the persecution of the Jews in Nazi Germany.

(Edith Stein died in the gas chamber at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] on 9 August 1942).\n\nThe issue of the concordat prolonged Kaas's stay in Rome, leaving the Centre Party without a chairman, and on 5 May Kaas finally resigned from his post. The party then elected [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] as its chairman. At that time, the Centre party was subject to increasing pressure in the wake of the process of [[Gleichschaltung]] and after all the other parties had dissolved (or were banned, like the SPD). The Centre Party dissolved itself on 5 July 1933, as the concordat between the Vatican and the Nazis had dealt it a decisive blow by exchanging a ban on the political activities of priests for the continuation of Catholic education. Cardinal Pacelli and von Papen initialled the concordat in Rome three days later, with signing taking place on 20 July.<ref>''Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives'', [[Alan Bullock]], p. 355, Harper Collins, 1991, {{ISBN|0-00-215494-3}}; Lapide, p. 101</ref> On 2 July the Vatican daily newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' insisted that the concordat wasn't an endorsement of Nazi teachings.<ref name=\"constantine505\">Carroll, p. 505.</ref>\n\nOn 13 July a British minister had an interview with Cardinal Pacelli and reported: \"His Eminence said that the Vatican really viewed with indifference the dissolution of the Centre Party.\"<ref name=\"rhodes1\">Rhodes, p. 176</ref>\n\nAt the 14 July cabinet meeting Hitler brushed aside any debate on the details of the concordat, expressing the view \"that one should only consider it as a great achievement.

Only a short time earlier he had expressed doubts that \"the church would be ready to commit the Bishops to this state.

''Hitler'' p. 295, Penguin, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-14-103588-8}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 July 1933 von Papen attended a meeting of the Catholic Academic Union, during which he first made the connection between the dissolution of the Centre Party and the concordat. He said the Pope was particularly pleased at the promised destruction of [[Bolshevism]] and that Pius XI had agreed to the treaty \"in the recognition that the new Germany had fought a decisive battle against Bolshevism and the atheist movement.\"<ref name=\"constantine520\">Carroll, p. 520</ref> Papen noted that there was \"an undeniable inner connection between the dissolution of the German Center party that has just taken place and the conclusion of the Concordat\" and ended his speech with a call for German Catholicism to put away former resentments and to help build the Third Reich.<ref name=\"lewy\">Lewy, 1964, p. 86</ref> Abbot Herwegen told the meeting:\n<blockquote>What the liturgical movement is to the religious realm, fascism is to the political realm.

The cardinal expressed the view that, with the guarantees given relating to Catholic education, this concordat was an improvement over the 1929 agreement with Prussia.<ref name=\"rhodes\">Rhodes, p. 177</ref> Cardinal Pacelli did sound a note of caution in that his satisfaction was based on the assumption that the German Government \"remained true to its undertaking\", but noted also that Hitler \"was becoming increasingly moderate\".<ref name=\"rhodes\">Rhodes, p. 177</ref>\n\nOn 24 July Cardinal Faulhaber sent a handwritten letter to Hitler, noting that \"For Germany's prestige in the East and the West and before the whole world, this handshake with the papacy, the greatest moral power in the history of the world, is a feat of immeasurable importance.\"<ref name=\"lapide1\">Lapide, p. 102</ref>\n\nOn 4 August 1933 the British Minister reported \"in conversations I have had with Cardinal Pacelli and Monsignor Pizzardo, neither gave me the feeling of the slightest regret at the eclipse of the Centre [Party], and its consequent loss of influence in German politics\".<ref>Rhodes, p. 176; On 23 June 1939 von Bergen wrote \"Cardinal Pacelli told me that the fate of the Concordat depends upon the handling of the Germans' wish for diminution of the political work by priests.\" (Rhodes, p. 176)</ref> On 19 August [[Ivone Kirkpatrick]] had a further discussion with Cardinal Pacelli in which he expressed his \"disgust and abhorrence\" at Hitler's reign of terror to the diplomat. Pacelli said \"I had to choose between an agreement on their lines and the virtual elimination of the Catholic Church in the Reich.\"<ref>Lapide, pp. 102\u2013103</ref> Pacelli also told Kirkpatrick that he deplored the persecution of the Jews, but a pistol had been held to his head and that he had no alternative, being given only one week to decide.<ref name=\"lapide\">Lapide, p. 103</ref> Pinchas Lapide notes that whilst negotiations for the concordat were taking place, pressure had been put on the Vatican by the arrest of ninety-two priests, the searching of Catholic youth-club premises, and the closing down of nine Catholic publications.<ref name=\"lapide\">Lapide, p. 103</ref> The Nazi newspaper ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' wrote: \"By her signature the Catholic Church has recognised National Socialism in the most solemn manner. ...This fact constitutes an enormous moral strengthening of our government and its prestige.\"<ref name=\"lapide1\"/>\n\nThe concordat was ratified on 10 September 1933 and Cardinal Pacelli took the opportunity to send a note to the Germans raising the topic of the social and economic condition of Jews who had converted to Catholicism but of not Jews in general.<ref>Friedl\u00e4nder, p. 47, see also Lapide (p. 104) who also gives a date of 9 September for ratification</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, although the Protestant churches, being local congregations, remained unaffected by restrictions on foreign support, Hitler's government negotiated other agreements with them which in essence put Nazi officials, most of whom were Catholics, into positions of influence or outright authority over Protestant churches. Foreseeing the potential for outright State control of their churches which these agreements portended, many Protestant church [[leader]]s simply reorganized their congregations out of the agreements, causing a schism within the Protestant Churches. These Protestant resisters attempted to rally Catholic prelates to the dangers portended by these agreements but were simply rebuffed when the ''Reichskonkordat'' was ratified. Many of the Protestant clergy who opposed the Nazi religious program (''[[Bekennende Kirche]]'' or Confessing Church) later suffered imprisonment or execution.\n\nChurch leaders were realistic about the concordat's supposed protections.<ref name=Hughes>{{cite journal|journal=National Review |first=John Jay |last=Hughes |title=An Antidotal History |date=2007-05-18 |accessdate=2013-08-29 |url=http://nationalreview.com/articles/220212/antidotal-history/john-jay-hughes |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101185416/http://nationalreview.com/articles/220212/antidotal-history/john-jay-hughes |archivedate=November 1, 2013 }}</ref> Cardinal Faulhaber is reported to have said: \"With the concordat we are hanged, without the concordat we are hanged, drawn and quartered.\"<ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=1438 \"The Record of Pius XII's Opposition to Hitler\"] Catholic Culture</ref> After the signing of the concordat the papal nuncio exhorted the German bishops to support Hitler's r\u00e9gime.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 45</ref> The bishops told their flocks to try to get along with the Nazi r\u00e9gime.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 114</ref> According to Michael Phayer, the concordat prevented Pius XI from speaking out against the Nazi [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, and though he did intend to speak out after the nationwide [[Kristallnacht|pogrom of 1938]], Cardinal Pacelli dissuaded him from doing so.<ref>Phayer, 2000, p. 18</ref>\n\nOn 20 August 1935 the Catholic Bishops conference at Fulda reminded Hitler that Pius XI had:\n<blockquote>exchanged the handshake of trust with you through the concordat \u2013 the first foreign sovereign to do so. ...Pope Pius spoke high praise of you. ...Millions in foreign countries, Catholics and non-Catholics alike, have overcome their original mistrust because of this expression of papal trust, and have placed their trust in your regime.<ref name=\"constantine505\"/></blockquote>\nIn a sermon given in Munich during 1937 Cardinal Faulhaber declared:\n\n<blockquote>\nAt a time when the heads of the major nations in the world faced the new Germany with reserve and considerable suspicion, the Catholic Church, the greatest moral power on earth, through the Concordat, expressed its confidence in the new German government.

As Article 27 states, \"A special and exempt ministry is conceded.\" As the [[Treaty of Versailles]] had forbidden Germany from raising a large army, this provision may have been seen by Hitler as the Vatican giving its tacit approval to German rearmament.<ref name=\"constantine505\"/> Papen wrote to Hitler regarding this secret provision and concluded his brief with, \"I hope this agreement will therefore be pleasing to you.\"<ref name=\"constantine505\"/> The provisions of the annexe were inserted at the request of the German Bishops Fulda Conference and the contents were kept so secret that [[Ernst von Weizsacker]], State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry from 1938, did not know of it until informed by the Papal Nuncio [[Cesare Orsenigo|Orsenigo]] in 1939.<ref name=\"lewy9\"/>\n\n===Reception===\nThe British Roman Catholic periodical ''The Tablet'' reported the signing of the concordat:\n\n<blockquote>Already it is being said that THE POPE OF ROME thinks of nobody save his own adherents and that he does not care how Lutherans are dragooned and how Jews are harried so long as Popish bishops, monastic orders, confessional schools, and Catholic associations are allowed full freedom. We beg our Protestant and Jewish friends to put away such suspicions. As we suggested at the outset of this brief article, the Catholic Church could have done little for other denominations in Germany if she had begun thrusting out wild hands to help them while her own feet were slipping under her. By patience and reasonableness she has succeeded in re-establishing herself, more firmly than before, on a Concordat which does not surrender one feather's weight of essential Catholic principle. She will straightway set about her sacred task, an important part of which will be the casting out of those devils which have been raging \u2013 and are raging still \u2013 in the Reich. But \"this sort\" of devil is not cast out save by prayer. Political action (from which the German clergy are debarred under the Concordat) by the Church would drive matters from bad to worse. We are confident, however, that Catholics will abhor the idea of enjoying complete toleration while Protestants and Jews are under the harrow, and that, quietly but strongly, the Catholic influence will be exerted in the right direction. One German out of three is a Catholic ; and Catholic prestige is high in Germany's public life.<ref>[http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/29th-july-1933/5/pro-ecclesia-dri-pro-rege-et-patria ''The Tablet'', 29 July 1933, p. 5]</ref></blockquote>\n\nCriticism of the concordat was initially from those countries who viewed Germany as a potential threat.

The Nazi authorities claimed that the properties were needed for wartime necessities such as hospitals, or accommodation for refugees or children, but in fact used them for their own purposes. \"Hostility to the state\" was another common cause given for the confiscations, and the action of a single member of a monastery could result in seizure of the whole.

The negotiations over the language of and terms of the Concordant had been concluded long before Hitler was appointed Chancellor by German President Paul von Hindenburg. Bismark engaged in many of the negotiations but never signed the Concordant due to the anti-Catholic reaction he feared.\n\nIn 1933 German President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor.\nThe concordat was negotiated in order to placate [[Pope Pius XI]] and the Vatican by ensuring the German Church's safety. Although Hitler did not have presidential powers at the time of the treaty's signing, he already had dictatorial powers and decided the articles of the treaty.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Lapide, Pinchas.

It was signed on 20 July 1933 by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pius XII|Eugenio Pacelli]], who later became [[Pope]] Pius XII, on behalf of Pope [[Pius XI]] and Vice Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] on behalf of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and the German government. It was ratified 10 September 1933 and it has been in force from that date onward. The treaty guarantees the rights of the [[Roman Catholic Church in Germany]]. When bishops take office Article 16 states they are required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the [[Reich|German Reich]] established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' encyclical of Pope [[Pius XI]]. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities.<ref>Coppa, Frank J. Editor Controversial Concordats, 1999, p. 143, {{ISBN|0-8132-0920-X}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Reichskonkordat'' is the most controversial of several concordats that the Vatican negotiated during the pontificate of Pius XI. It is frequently discussed in works that deal with the rise of Hitler in the early 1930s and the [[Holocaust]]. The concordat has been described by some as giving moral legitimacy to the Nazi regime soon after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] had acquired quasi-[[dictator]]ial powers through the [[Enabling Act of 1933]], an Act itself facilitated through the support of the Catholic Centre Party. The Holy See became the first legal partner to Hitler's regime.\n\nThe treaty places constraints on the political activity of German clergy of the Catholic Church. Following the passage of the 1935 [[Nuremberg Laws]] for example, a policy of nonintervention was followed. The majority of the German church hierarchy regarded the treaty as a symbol of peace between church and state.<ref>Beth Griech-Polelle, Bishop von Galen,  Roman Catholicism and Nazi Germany. p. 51, 53</ref> From a Roman Catholic church perspective it has been argued that the Concordat prevented even greater evils being unleashed against the Church.<ref>Evans, 2008, pp 245-246.

They will swallow anything in order to keep their material advantages. Matters will never come to a head. They will recognise a firm will, and we need only show them once or twice who is the master.

They had wanted to obtain Vatican support for a scheme to reconstruct the Centre party to insure its stable support of the Hitler government and to conclude a general concordat between the Holy See and the Reich to replace the three present concordats with Prussia, Bavaria, and Baden. Neither suggestion was approved by the Pope. The failure was interpreted as evidence of the Vatican's lack of confidence in the durability of the Nazi government. The Vatican was likewise reticent to abandon the existing concordats with Prussia, Bavaria, and Baden for a general concordat with the Reich. However, there is no question about Pius XII's tenacious insistence on the Concordat retention before, during, and after the Second World War.<ref>Phayer, Michael, ''The Catholic Church and the Holocaust (1930\u20131965)'', 2000, Indiana Univ.

During the next two years, though there had been softening by some, the bishops continued to pronounce against unacceptable policies of the Nazi Party.<ref>Falconi, 1966, p. 193; Ian Kershaw notes \"the high level of relative immunity to Nazism which prevailed before 1933 in Catholic circles.\" Kershaw, ''The Hitler Myth'', Oxford, reissued 2001, p. 36)</ref> When [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler as [[Reichskanzler|Chancellor]] on 30 January 1933, the bishops maintained support for the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]] (''Zentrum''), which in turn refused to assent to a proposal that would allow Hitler to assume full power. On 12 March 1933 Pope Pius XI received the German Cardinal [[Michael von Faulhaber|Faulhaber]] in Rome. On his return Faulhaber reported:\n<blockquote>After my recent experience in Rome in the highest circles, which I cannot reveal here, I must say that I found, despite everything, a greater tolerance with regard to the new government. ...Let us meditate on the words of the Holy Father, who in a consistory, without mentioning his name, indicated before the whole world in Adolf Hitler the statesman who first, after the Pope himself, has raised his voice against Bolshevism.<ref>Falconi, 1966, p. 194; Falconi notes that the German bishops would remember this \"papal eulogy\" in a joint memorandum to Hitler on 20 August 1935 which stated \"In the face of this proclamation of the Pope's confidence, millions of men abroad, both Catholics and non-Catholics, have overcome their initial mistrust and accorded credit to your Government.\" p. 194</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt a cabinet meeting on 20 March 1933 Hitler \"confidently reported\" that the Centre Party had now seen the necessity of the Enabling Act and that \"the acceptance of the Enabling Act also by the ''Zentrum'' would signify a strengthening prestige with regard to foreign countries.\"<ref>Kershaw, ''Hitler'', 2009, p. 281</ref> Early in March 1933 the bishops recommended that Catholics vote for the Centre Party in the [[German federal election, March 1933|elections scheduled for 5 March 1933]].

The party then elected [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] as its chairman. At that time, the Centre party was subject to increasing pressure in the wake of the process of [[Gleichschaltung]] and after all the other parties had dissolved (or were banned, like the SPD). The Centre Party dissolved itself on 5 July 1933, as the concordat between the Vatican and the Nazis had dealt it a decisive blow by exchanging a ban on the political activities of priests for the continuation of Catholic education. Cardinal Pacelli and von Papen initialled the concordat in Rome three days later, with signing taking place on 20 July.<ref>''Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives'', [[Alan Bullock]], p. 355, Harper Collins, 1991, {{ISBN|0-00-215494-3}}; Lapide, p. 101</ref> On 2 July the Vatican daily newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' insisted that the concordat wasn't an endorsement of Nazi teachings.<ref name=\"constantine505\">Carroll, p. 505.</ref>\n\nOn 13 July a British minister had an interview with Cardinal Pacelli and reported: \"His Eminence said that the Vatican really viewed with indifference the dissolution of the Centre Party.\"<ref name=\"rhodes1\">Rhodes, p. 176</ref>\n\nAt the 14 July cabinet meeting Hitler brushed aside any debate on the details of the concordat, expressing the view \"that one should only consider it as a great achievement.

Foreseeing the potential for outright State control of their churches which these agreements portended, many Protestant church [[leader]]s simply reorganized their congregations out of the agreements, causing a schism within the Protestant Churches. These Protestant resisters attempted to rally Catholic prelates to the dangers portended by these agreements but were simply rebuffed when the ''Reichskonkordat'' was ratified.

If, however, the rearrangement of a bishopric or of an ecclesiastical province, or any other changes in the delimitation of diocese appear necessary in the future, they will be subject to agreement with the government of the state concerned in case that they involve changes only with boundaries of one German state (Land). In case of rearrangement of changes which exceed the boundaries of one German state, the agreement is to be made with the Reich government, to whose care it shall be left secure the consent of the state governments in question. The same applies to the establishment of new ecclesiastical provinces or alterations therein if these involve several German states. The foregoing provisions are not applicable to the shifting of boundaries which is made only with regard to the local care of souls.

As for the appointment to the metropolitan see of Freiburg, in the diocese of the Upper Rhine, it shall be applicable to the two suffragan [''subordinate''] bishoprics of Rottenburg and Mainz, as well as to the bishoprics of Meissen. The same applies in the said two suffragan bishoprics as regards the appointments to the cathedral chapters and the settlement of the rights of patronage. Furthermore, agreement has been reached on the following points. (i) Catholic clerics who enjoy a spiritual office in Germany or exercise there a pastoral or educational activity, must: (a) be German citizens; (b) have obtained a school certificate (certificate of maturity) entitling them to study at a higher German school; (c) have studied philosophy and theology for at least three years at a German state university, an academic ecclesiastical college in Germany, or a papal high school in Rome.

The conditions laid down above (i) par (a), (b), (c), can be discarded by mutual agreement between Church and state. (With regard to Art. 14, par. 2, sect. 2.

Superiors of religious orders who have their official residence within the German Reich must have German citizenship. Provincials and superiors whose official residence is situated outside the German territory have the right of visitation of their establishments in Germany, even if they have a foreign citizenship. The Holy See will see to it that the organization of the provinces of various religious orders, as regards their establishments in Germany, should be such as to avoid \u2013 so far as it can be done \u2013 the subordination of German establishments to foreign provincials.

The establishment, management and administration of seminaries and hostels for clerical students pertains exclusively, within the limits of the law applicable to all, to ecclesiastical authorities.

In such cases, the parish priest is bound to report the matter at once to the registrar's office. (With regard to Art. 26. It is considered to be a great moral emergency if the timely procuring of documents necessary for the wedding meets with obstacles which are either insuperable or whose removal would be disproportionately costly.)<ref name=\"trans_1954\"/>\n\nArticle 26 allowed that a church wedding could precede a civil marriage ceremony in certain cases.<ref name=\"lewy9\"/>\n\n* '''Article 27''' A special and exempt pastoral ministry is conceded to the officers, employees, and men of the Germany army and to their families.

The ecclesiastical appointment of the military chaplains and other military clergy will be made by the military bishop after previous consultation with the competent authorities of the Reich. The army bishop can, however, appoint as military chaplains only such priest who have obtained, form their ordinary, permission to engage in military pastoral work and who have obtained an appropriate certificate of fitness. Military chaplains have the rights of parish priests with regard to the troops and other army personnel assigned to their care.

As Article 27 states, \"A special and exempt ministry is conceded.\" As the [[Treaty of Versailles]] had forbidden Germany from raising a large army, this provision may have been seen by Hitler as the Vatican giving its tacit approval to German rearmament.<ref name=\"constantine505\"/> Papen wrote to Hitler regarding this secret provision and concluded his brief with, \"I hope this agreement will therefore be pleasing to you.\"<ref name=\"constantine505\"/> The provisions of the annexe were inserted at the request of the German Bishops Fulda Conference and the contents were kept so secret that [[Ernst von Weizsacker]], State Secretary in the Foreign Ministry from 1938, did not know of it until informed by the Papal Nuncio [[Cesare Orsenigo|Orsenigo]] in 1939.<ref name=\"lewy9\"/>\n\n===Reception===\nThe British Roman Catholic periodical ''The Tablet'' reported the signing of the concordat:\n\n<blockquote>Already it is being said that THE POPE OF ROME thinks of nobody save his own adherents and that he does not care how Lutherans are dragooned and how Jews are harried so long as Popish bishops, monastic orders, confessional schools, and Catholic associations are allowed full freedom. We beg our Protestant and Jewish friends to put away such suspicions. As we suggested at the outset of this brief article, the Catholic Church could have done little for other denominations in Germany if she had begun thrusting out wild hands to help them while her own feet were slipping under her. By patience and reasonableness she has succeeded in re-establishing herself, more firmly than before, on a Concordat which does not surrender one feather's weight of essential Catholic principle. She will straightway set about her sacred task, an important part of which will be the casting out of those devils which have been raging \u2013 and are raging still \u2013 in the Reich. But \"this sort\" of devil is not cast out save by prayer. Political action (from which the German clergy are debarred under the Concordat) by the Church would drive matters from bad to worse. We are confident, however, that Catholics will abhor the idea of enjoying complete toleration while Protestants and Jews are under the harrow, and that, quietly but strongly, the Catholic influence will be exerted in the right direction. One German out of three is a Catholic ; and Catholic prestige is high in Germany's public life.<ref>[http://archive.thetablet.co.uk/article/29th-july-1933/5/pro-ecclesia-dri-pro-rege-et-patria ''The Tablet'', 29 July 1933, p. 5]</ref></blockquote>\n\nCriticism of the concordat was initially from those countries who viewed Germany as a potential threat.

The Provincial of the Dominican Province of Teutonia, [[Laurentius Siemer]], a spiritual leader of the German Resistance, was influential in the Committee for Matters Relating to the Orders, which formed in response to Nazi attacks against Catholic monasteries and aimed to encourage the bishops to intercede on behalf of the Orders and oppose the Nazi state more emphatically.<ref name=\"Laurentius Siemer\">[http://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/ Laurentius Siemer]; German Resistance Memorial Centre, Index of Persons; retrieved at 4 September 2013</ref><ref name=\"dw.de\">[http://www.dw.de/memory-of-spiritual-leader-in-german-resistance-lives-on/a-2206790 Memory of Spiritual Leader in German Resistance Lives On]; [[Deutsche Welle]] online; 21 October 2006</ref>\n\nWith the expansion of the war in the East from 1941, there came also an expansion of the regime's attack on the churches. Monasteries and convents were targeted and expropriation of Church properties surged. The Nazi authorities claimed that the properties were needed for wartime necessities such as hospitals, or accommodation for refugees or children, but in fact used them for their own purposes. \"Hostility to the state\" was another common cause given for the confiscations, and the action of a single member of a monastery could result in seizure of the whole.

The President of Germany at the time the Concordant with the Vatican was signed was Paul von Hindenburg. Hitler was merely the newly appointed Chancellor and Hitler was still selecting his cabinet when the Concordant was signed. The negotiations over the language of and terms of the Concordant had been concluded long before Hitler was appointed Chancellor by German President Paul von Hindenburg. Bismark engaged in many of the negotiations but never signed the Concordant due to the anti-Catholic reaction he feared.\n\nIn 1933 German President Paul von Hindenburg appointed Hitler Chancellor.\nThe concordat was negotiated in order to placate [[Pope Pius XI]] and the Vatican by ensuring the German Church's safety. Although Hitler did not have presidential powers at the time of the treaty's signing, he already had dictatorial powers and decided the articles of the treaty.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Lapide, Pinchas.

The film follows an underdog who fights against the evil in society, to re-instate his identity and keep his pride.\n\n==Plot==\nDinkar Maruti Bhosale represents thousands of 'Marathis' who feel they have lost their identity in the cosmopolitan Mumbai. Dinkar feels Mumbai is in Maharashtra but there is no Maharashtra left in Mumbai. He always complains about the lack of respect a Marathi receives in Mumbai and feels he is victimized everywhere because he is a Marathi; little realizing that he himself has brought this situation upon himself.\n\nIn a state of sheer frustration Dinkar gets up one day cursing himself for being born a Marathi. He feels his ancestors must have committed a heinous crime for him to be born a Marathi.\n\nThese outbursts of Dinkar reach Pratapgad and the spirit of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is aroused. Dinkar has to now face a seething Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who is furious at him. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj fires Dinkar for his shallow thinking and tells him he has to command respect, not demand it. He blames Dinkar's thinking for the sorry state of Marathis. \"Before blaming other communities for your short comings, look within and see if you have done anything to keep the Marathi pride intact,\" he roars.\n\nDinkar realizes his mistake but does Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaja's thought arouse him to rectify his mistakes?

The movie is produced by Sanjay Chhabria along with Ashwami Manjrekar and directed by Santosh Manjrekar. The film follows an underdog who fights against the evil in society, to re-instate his identity and keep his pride.\n\n==Plot==\nDinkar Maruti Bhosale represents thousands of 'Marathis' who feel they have lost their identity in the cosmopolitan Mumbai. Dinkar feels Mumbai is in Maharashtra but there is no Maharashtra left in Mumbai. He always complains about the lack of respect a Marathi receives in Mumbai and feels he is victimized everywhere because he is a Marathi; little realizing that he himself has brought this situation upon himself.\n\nIn a state of sheer frustration Dinkar gets up one day cursing himself for being born a Marathi. He feels his ancestors must have committed a heinous crime for him to be born a Marathi.\n\nThese outbursts of Dinkar reach Pratapgad and the spirit of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is aroused. Dinkar has to now face a seething Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, who is furious at him. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj fires Dinkar for his shallow thinking and tells him he has to command respect, not demand it. He blames Dinkar\u2019s thinking for the sorry state of Marathis. \"Before blaming other communities for your short comings, look within and see if you have done anything to keep the Marathi pride intact,\" he roars.\n\nDinkar realizes his mistake but does Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaja\u2019s thought arouse him to rectify his mistakes? The film ends with Bhonsle gladly returning the sword at the shrine of [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]].\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as [[Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]]\n*[[Sachin Khedekar]] as Dinkar Bhosale\n*[[Makarand Anaspure]] as Raiba\n*[[Siddarth Jadhav]] as Usman Parker\n*[[Suchitra Bandekar]] as Sumitra Bhosale\n*[[Priya Bapat]] as Shashikala Bhosale\n*[[Abhijeet Kelkar]] as Rahul Bhosale\n*[[Ganesh Yadav]] as Nandkumar Chandekar\n*[[Pradeep Patwardhan]] as BMC Officer\n*[[Reema Lagoo]] as [[Jijabai]]\n*[[Vidyadhar Joshi]] as Ramniklal Gosalia\n*[[Bharat Jadhav]]- [[Cameo appearance|Special appearance]] as [[Powada]] presenter\n*[[Ankush Chaudhari]]- [[Cameo appearance|Special appearance]] in song \"Masoli\"\n*[[Vineet Kumar Singh]] as tenant to Dinkar Bhosale\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe song ''O raje'' marked the debut of [[Sukhwinder Singh]] in Marathi film industry.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dance numbers bring out the best in me: Sukhwinder Singh |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/music/dance-numbers-bring-out-the-best-in-me-sukhwinder-singh/story-6XPVg80pqOvCDHIoKwTRtJ.html |work=Hindustan Times |date=2 June 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n{{tracklist\n| extra_column    = Artist(s)\n| title1          = O raje \n| extra1          = [[Sukhwinder Singh]]\n| length1         = 4:20\n| title2          = Masoli\n| extra2          = [[Ajit Parab]]\n| length2         = 4:15\n| title3          = Maharastra Geet\n| extra3          = [[Ajit Parab]]\n| length3         = 3:55\n| title4          =  Maharajanchi Keerti Befaam (Powada)\n| extra4          = [[Nandesh Umap]]\n| length4         = 8:34\n}}\n\n==Box Office==\n''Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy'' was a huge blockbuster at the box office.
