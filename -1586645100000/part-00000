The vast majority are descendants of Spanish, Latino and American settlers who intermarried with people of indigenous Filipino descent.  Aside from the more common Spanish, Latino and American mestizos, there are also Eurasians in the Philippines who have ancestries from various European countries or Australia. Significant intermarriage between Filipinos and European Americans has occurred since the United States colonial period up to the present day, as the US had numerous people stationed there at military bases.\n\nMost Eurasians of Spanish or Latino descent own business conglomerates in the real estate, agriculture, and utilities sector, whereas Eurasians of White American descent are largely in the entertainment  industry which are one of the biggest industries in the Philippines working as reporters, writers, producers, directors, models, actors and actresses as modern Philippine mass media and entertainment industry was pioneered during the American colonization of the Philippines by the Americans.

This last plan appears to me more advisable, as the poll-tax is already established, and it is not opportune to make a trial of new taxes when it is a question of allowing the country to be governed by itself. Since the annual tribute is unequal, the average shall be taken and shall be fixed, consequently, at fifteen or sixteen reals per whole tribute, or perhaps one peso fuerte annually from each adult tributary person. This regulation will produce an increase in the revenue of 200,000 or 300,000 pesos fuertes, and this sum shall be set aside to give the impulse for the amalgamation of the races, favoring crossed marriages by means of dowries granted to the single women in the following manner. To a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Filipino shall be given 100 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, Ioo pesos; to a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Spaniard, 1,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, 2,000 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Spaniard, 2,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Filipino chief, 3,000 or 4,000 pesos. Some mestizo and Filipino alcaldes-mayor of the provinces shall be appointed. It shall be ordered that when a Filipino chief goes to the house of a Spaniard, he shall seat himself as the latter's equal. In a word, by these and other means, the idea that they and the Castilians are two kinds of distinct races shall be erased from the minds of the natives, and the families shall become related by marriage in such manner that when free of the Castilian dominion should any exalted Filipinos try to expel or enslave our race, they would find it so interlaced with their own that their plan would be practically impossible.''<ref name=\"Blair19152\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FrJEAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA86&dq=pesos+Chinese+2,000+spanish+mestizo#v=onepage&q=pesos%20Chinese%202%2C000%20spanish%20mestizo&f=false|title=The Philippine Islands, 1493\u20131898: Relating to China and the Chinese|author=Emma Helen Blair|publisher=A.H.

I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.<ref>L. Hunt, Chester, \"Sociology in the Philippine setting: A modular approach\", p. 118, Phoenix Pub. House, 1954</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had spent most of his life in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:\n<blockquote>\"... Spaniards and natives lived together in great harmony, and do not know where I could find a colony in which Europeans mixes as much socially with the natives.<br>\nNot in Java, where a native of position must dismount to salute the humblest Dutchman.<br>\nNot in British India, where the Englishwoman has now made the gulf between British and native into a bottomless pit.\"<ref>Frederic H. Sawyer, \"The Inhabitants of the Philippines, p. 125, New York, 1900</ref></blockquote>In the present times, Filipino mestizos do not socially separate themselves from other Filipinos, making them the only Eurasians to do so. As of today European genes are spread throughout the country in great but specifically unknown scale, together with Chinese genes and Indian, Arabic and Japanese genes, that evolved modern Filipinos in a distinctive Austronesian path. In a research done by Dr. Michael Purugganan, NYU Dean of Science in 2013, he concluded that Filipinos today are the conclusion of an Austronesian's evolutionary result of almost 500 years of European (Hispanic/British/Americans) settling with the Natives and other migrant Asians in the Islands.\n\n====Singapore====\n{{See also|Eurasians in Singapore}}\n\n====Thailand====\n{{See also|Luk khrueng}}\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:PrinceChulaChakrabongse11.jpg|Prince [[Chula Chakrabongse]]\nFile:Ann Thongprasom.jpg|[[Ann Thongprasom]]\nFile:Tata young pimf 2007.JPG|[[Tata Young]]\nFile:Davika Hoorne at Emquartier.JPG|[[Davika Hoorne]]\nFile:Mario Maurer at CTW 10-5-2015.jpg|[[Mario Maurer]]\nFile:NadechKugimiya2014.jpg|[[Nadech Kugimiya]]\nFile:Chappuis Charyl.jpg|[[Charyl Chappuis]]\n</gallery>\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the number of ''luk khrueng'' increased dramatically in the period following [[World War II]], with the increasing number of Western residents and visitors to the country.

Large numbers of white American soldiers were deployed in [[South Vietnam]] to support the country, and intermingling with local Vietnamese women was common. The resulting Eurasian children, known as Amerasians, were products of varying circumstances ranging from genuine long-term relationships and love affairs to prostitution and rape. When the war was going against South Vietnam in the early 1970s, the gradual withdrawal of American troops during the [[Vietnamization]] process included many Vietnamese war brides and their Eurasian children. The situation led the [[United States Congress]] to enact the [[American Homecoming Act]], granting preferential immigration status specifically to Eurasian children born to servicemen in Vietnam claimed by their fathers. The Eurasian children that remained in Vietnam, around 20,000, were typically from the worst circumstances, fatherless, and often ended up in [[orphanages]] as their mothers were incapable or uninterested in raising them. The [[North Vietnam]]ese victory in 1975 saw greater stigma against Eurasian Vietnamese children, as the new government of reunified Vietnam was hostile to the United States and saw them as symbols of foreign occupation. The poor circumstances of the Amerasian children made them vulnerable to severe social and state-sponsored persecution.\n\n===East Asia===\n==== Hong Kong ====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Sir Robert Ho Tung.jpg|[[Robert Hotung]]\nFile:Nancy_Kwan_-_1971.jpg|[[Nancy Kwan]]\nFile:Stanleyho2006.jpg|[[Stanley Ho]]\n</gallery>\nIn 19th century Hong Kong, Eurasian or \"half-caste\" children were often [[Social stigma|stigmatised]] as symbols of 'moral degradation' and 'racial impurity' by both European and Chinese communities.<ref name=Chiu>\n{{cite journal|title='A position of usefulness': gendering history of girls' education in colonial Hong Kong (1850s\u20131890s)|journal=History of Education: Journal of the History of Education Society|publisher=Routledge|author=Patricia Pok\u2010kwan Chiu|volume=37|issue=6|date=November 2008|page=799}}</ref> According to Chiu:\n<blockquote>To the European community, such children were the \u2018tangible evidence of moral irregularity\u2019, while to the Chinese community they embodied the shame and \u2018evil\u2019 of their marginalised mothers.

Carl Smith's study in the 1960s on \"protected women\" (the kept mistresses of foreigners) to an extent supports Eitel's theory. The Tanka were marginalised in Chinese society which consisted of the majority [[Punti]]s (Cantonese-speaking people). Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations and they had limited opportunities of settlement on land. Consequently, the Tanka did not experience the same social pressures when dealing with Europeans. Eitel's theory, however, was criticised by Henry J. Lethbridge writing in the 1970s as a \"myth\" propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community.<ref>{{cite book |author=Meiqi Lee |title=Being Eurasian: Memories Across Racial Divides |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mVGd71y1Y-0C&pg=PA262&dq=eitel+half+caste#v=onepage&q=eitel%20half%20caste&f=false |accessdate=2 November 2011 |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |year=2004 |origyear= |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-962-209-671-4 |page=262 |chapter= |quote=EJ Eitel, in the late 1890s, claims that the 'half-caste population in Hong Kong ' were from the earliest days of the settlement almost exclusively the offspring of liaisons between European men and women of outcaste ethnic groups such as Tanka (Europe in, 169). Lethbridge refutes the theory saying it was based on a 'myth' propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community. Carl Smith's study in the late 1960s on the protected women seems, to some degree, support Eitel's theory. Smith says that the Tankas experienced certain restrictions within the traditional Chinese social structure. Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations. The Tanka women did not have bound feet. Their opportunities for settlement on shore were limited. They were hence not as closely tied to Confucian ethics as other Chinese ethnic groups. Being a group marginal to the traditional Chinese society of the Puntis (Cantonese), they did not have the same social pressure in dealing with Europeans (CT Smith, Chung Chi Bulletin, 27). 'Living under the protection of a foreigner,' says Smith, 'could be a ladder to financial security, if not respectability, for some of the Tanka boat girls' (13 ).}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Maria Jaschok |author2=Suzanne Miers |editor=Maria Jaschok |editor2=Suzanne Miers |title=Women and Chinese patriarchy: submission, servitude, and escape |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5o_t7VxHYAC&pg=PA223 |accessdate=1 November 2011 |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |year=1994 |origyear= |publisher=Zed Books |location= |language= |isbn=978-1-85649-126-6 |page=223 |chapter= |quote=He states that they had a near- monopoly of the trade in girls and women, and that: The half-caste population in Hong Kong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the offspring of these Tan-ka people.

They created distinctive Anglo-Indian, dress, speech and religion.  They established a school system focused on English language and culture, and formed social clubs and associations to run functions, such as regular dances, at holidays such as Christmas and Easter.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Over time, the British colonial government recruited Anglo-Indians into the Customs and Excise, Post and Telegraphs, Forestry Department, the Railways and teaching professions, but they were employed in many other fields as well. A number of factors fostered a strong sense of community among Anglo-Indians.

Originally these people were known as Mesti\u00e7os, literally \"mixed people\" in Portuguese; today they are collectively classified as Burghers. The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] prompted numerous Burghers to flee the island. Most of them settled in Europe, the Americas, Australia and [[New Zealand]].\n\n[[Portuguese Burghers]] are usually descended from a Sri Lankan mother and a Portuguese father.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Peter|title=The Encyclopedia of the Sri Lankan Diaspora|page=28|date=2014|publisher=[[Editions Didier Millet]]}}</ref> This configuration is also the case with the Dutch Burghers. When the Portuguese arrived on the island in 1505, they were accompanied by African slaves. [[Sri Lanka Kaffir people|Kaffirs]] are a mix of African, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese colonist]] and [[Demographics of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]]. The free mixing between the various groups of people was encouraged by the colonials.  Soon the [[Sri Lanka Mesti\u00e7o people|Mesti\u00e7os]] or the \"Mixed People\" began speaking a creole known as the [[Sri Lanka Indo-Portuguese language|Ceylonese-Portuguese Creole]]. It was based on Portuguese, [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].\n\nThe Burgher population numbers 40,000 in Sri Lanka and thousands more worldwide, concentrated mostly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. [[Phenotypically]] Burghers can have skin ranging from light to darker, depending on their ancestors, even within the same family. Burghers with dark to light brown skin usually are of Portuguese Burghers or Kaffir ancestry; they may also have [[European ethnic groups|European]] facial features common to the Mediterranean basin (see [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]]). They have a distinct look compared to native Sri Lankans. Most light-skinned Burghers are of Dutch or British descent. Most Burghers are [[Roman Catholic]] in religion.\n\nLike certain other Asian countries -Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines- Eurasians/Burghers have also been sought after by advertisers and modelling agencies in Sri Lanka. Their mixed look combining both Western and Sri Lankan features makes them attractive to advertisers who see them as a representation of an \"exotic Sri Lankan/Sinhalese\". Predictions within the advertising industry in Sri Lanka estimate that more than 50% of advertising models in Sri Lanka are Burghers/Eurasians.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWWqyWtgkh0C&pg|title=Buying and Believing: Sri Lankan Advertising and Consumers in a Transnational World|first=Steven|last=Kemper|date=1 May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=9 January 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780226430416}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Public Eye Awards 2008 mit Melanie Winiger - Crop (2).jpg|[[Melanie Winiger]]\nFile:Youri Djorkaeff 2011.jpg|[[Youri Djorkaeff]]\nFile:Graf Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi (1894\u20131972) ~1930.jpg|[[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]]\nFile:OT Berlin 09-13 Marcel Nguyen.jpg|[[Marcel Nguyen]]\nFile:France Nuyen.jpg|[[France Nuyen]]\nFile:B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe 2, 2012.jpg|[[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe]]\nFile:Florence Faivre at 2015 Fan Expo Canada.jpg|[[Florence Faivre]]\n</gallery>\n\nImmigration to Europe has led to the rise of Eurasian communities in Europe, most prominently in the Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom, where significant numbers of Indonesian, Filipino, and Indo-Pakistani Eurasians live.

If all people with Chinese ancestry in Hawaii (including the Sino-Hawaiians) are included, they form about one-third of Hawaii's entire population. Many thousands of them married women of Hawaiian, Hawaiian/European and European origin. A large percentage of the Chinese men married Hawaiian and Hawaiian European women. While a minority married white women in Hawaii were with [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]] women. The 12,592 Asiatic Hawaiians enumerated in 1930 were the result of Chinese men intermarrying with Hawaiian and part Hawaiian European. Most Asiatic Hawaiians men also married Hawaiians and European women (and vice versa). On the census some Chinese with little native blood would be classified as Chinese not an Asiatic Hawaiians due to dilution of native blood. Intermarriage started to decline in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GrvXiBNOsO0C&pg=PA154 |title=Interracial Marriage in Hawaii|author=Romanzo Adams|year=2005|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|location=|page=396|isbn=978-1-4179-9268-3|accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a904831799|title=Interethnic Marriage and Divorce in Hawaii A Panel Study of 1968 First Marriages|author=Margaret M.

When it comes to religion, self-reported Asian Brazilians are only less [[Irreligion|Irreligious]] than whites, and a little more [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Catholic]] than [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindians]]. They are the least group when it comes to traditional churches of [[Christianity]], and also the least group in percent of [[Protestantism in Brazil|Protestants]], and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] or [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] as well.

The vast majority are descendants of Spanish, Latino and American settlers who intermarried with people of indigenous Filipino descent.  Aside from the more common Spanish, Latino and American mestizos, there are also Eurasians in the Philippines who have ancestries from various European countries or Australia. Significant intermarriage between Filipinos and European Americans has occurred since the United States colonial period up to the present day, as the US had numerous people stationed there at military bases.\n\nMost Eurasians of Spanish or Latino descent own business conglomerates in the real estate, agriculture, and utilities sector, whereas Eurasians of White American descent are largely in the entertainment  industry which are one of the biggest industries in the Philippines working as reporters, writers, producers, directors, models, actors and actresses as modern Philippine mass media and entertainment industry was pioneered during the American colonization of the Philippines by the Americans.

I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.<ref>L. Hunt, Chester, \"Sociology in the Philippine setting: A modular approach\", p. 118, Phoenix Pub. House, 1954</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had spent most of his life in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:\n<blockquote>\"... Spaniards and natives lived together in great harmony, and do not know where I could find a colony in which Europeans mixes as much socially with the natives.<br>\nNot in Java, where a native of position must dismount to salute the humblest Dutchman.<br>\nNot in British India, where the Englishwoman has now made the gulf between British and native into a bottomless pit.\"<ref>Frederic H. Sawyer, \"The Inhabitants of the Philippines, p. 125, New York, 1900</ref></blockquote>In the present times, Filipino mestizos do not socially separate themselves from other Filipinos, making them the only Eurasians to do so. As of today European genes are spread throughout the country in great but specifically unknown scale, together with Chinese genes and Indian, Arabic and Japanese genes, that evolved modern Filipinos in a distinctive Austronesian path. In a research done by Dr. Michael Purugganan, NYU Dean of Science in 2013, he concluded that Filipinos today are the conclusion of an Austronesian's evolutionary result of almost 500 years of European (Hispanic/British/Americans) settling with the Natives and other migrant Asians in the Islands.\n\n====Singapore====\n{{See also|Eurasians in Singapore}}\n\n====Thailand====\n{{See also|Luk khrueng}}\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:PrinceChulaChakrabongse11.jpg|Prince [[Chula Chakrabongse]]\nFile:Ann Thongprasom.jpg|[[Ann Thongprasom]]\nFile:Tata young pimf 2007.JPG|[[Tata Young]]\nFile:Davika Hoorne at Emquartier.JPG|[[Davika Hoorne]]\nFile:Mario Maurer at CTW 10-5-2015.jpg|[[Mario Maurer]]\nFile:NadechKugimiya2014.jpg|[[Nadech Kugimiya]]\nFile:Chappuis Charyl.jpg|[[Charyl Chappuis]]\n</gallery>\n\nIn the mid-20th century, the number of ''luk khrueng'' increased dramatically in the period following [[World War II]], with the increasing number of Western residents and visitors to the country.

Large numbers of white American soldiers were deployed in [[South Vietnam]] to support the country, and intermingling with local Vietnamese women was common. The resulting Eurasian children, known as Amerasians, were products of varying circumstances ranging from genuine long-term relationships and love affairs to prostitution and rape. When the war was going against South Vietnam in the early 1970s, the gradual withdrawal of American troops during the [[Vietnamization]] process included many Vietnamese war brides and their Eurasian children. The situation led the [[United States Congress]] to enact the [[American Homecoming Act]], granting preferential immigration status specifically to Eurasian children born to servicemen in Vietnam claimed by their fathers. The Eurasian children that remained in Vietnam, around 20,000, were typically from the worst circumstances, fatherless, and often ended up in [[orphanages]] as their mothers were incapable or uninterested in raising them. The [[North Vietnam]]ese victory in 1975 saw greater stigma against Eurasian Vietnamese children, as the new government of reunified Vietnam was hostile to the United States and saw them as symbols of foreign occupation. The poor circumstances of the Amerasian children made them vulnerable to severe social and state-sponsored persecution.\n\n===East Asia===\n==== Hong Kong ====\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Sir Robert Ho Tung.jpg|[[Robert Hotung]]\nFile:Nancy_Kwan_-_1971.jpg|[[Nancy Kwan]]\nFile:Stanleyho2006.jpg|[[Stanley Ho]]\n</gallery>\nIn 19th century Hong Kong, Eurasian or \"half-caste\" children were often [[Social stigma|stigmatised]] as symbols of 'moral degradation' and 'racial impurity' by both European and Chinese communities.<ref name=Chiu>\n{{cite journal|title='A position of usefulness': gendering history of girls' education in colonial Hong Kong (1850s\u20131890s)|journal=History of Education: Journal of the History of Education Society|publisher=Routledge|author=Patricia Pok\u2010kwan Chiu|volume=37|issue=6|date=November 2008|page=799}}</ref> According to Chiu:\n<blockquote>To the European community, such children were the \u2018tangible evidence of moral irregularity\u2019, while to the Chinese community they embodied the shame and \u2018evil\u2019 of their marginalised mothers.

Carl Smith's study in the 1960s on \"protected women\" (the kept mistresses of foreigners) to an extent supports Eitel's theory. The Tanka were marginalised in Chinese society which consisted of the majority [[Punti]]s (Cantonese-speaking people). Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations and they had limited opportunities of settlement on land. Consequently, the Tanka did not experience the same social pressures when dealing with Europeans. Eitel's theory, however, was criticised by Henry J. Lethbridge writing in the 1970s as a \"myth\" propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community.<ref>{{cite book |author=Meiqi Lee |title=Being Eurasian: Memories Across Racial Divides |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mVGd71y1Y-0C&pg=PA262&dq=eitel+half+caste#v=onepage&q=eitel%20half%20caste&f=false |accessdate=2 November 2011 |edition=illustrated |series= |volume= |year=2004 |origyear= |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |location= |language= |isbn=978-962-209-671-4 |page=262 |chapter= |quote=EJ Eitel, in the late 1890s, claims that the 'half-caste population in Hong Kong ' were from the earliest days of the settlement almost exclusively the offspring of liaisons between European men and women of outcaste ethnic groups such as Tanka (Europe in, 169). Lethbridge refutes the theory saying it was based on a 'myth' propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community. Carl Smith's study in the late 1960s on the protected women seems, to some degree, support Eitel's theory. Smith says that the Tankas experienced certain restrictions within the traditional Chinese social structure. Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations. The Tanka women did not have bound feet. Their opportunities for settlement on shore were limited. They were hence not as closely tied to Confucian ethics as other Chinese ethnic groups. Being a group marginal to the traditional Chinese society of the Puntis (Cantonese), they did not have the same social pressure in dealing with Europeans (CT Smith, Chung Chi Bulletin, 27).

They established a school system focused on English language and culture, and formed social clubs and associations to run functions, such as regular dances, at holidays such as Christmas and Easter.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Over time, the British colonial government recruited Anglo-Indians into the Customs and Excise, Post and Telegraphs, Forestry Department, the Railways and teaching professions, but they were employed in many other fields as well.

Originally these people were known as Mesti\u00e7os, literally \"mixed people\" in Portuguese; today they are collectively classified as Burghers. The [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] prompted numerous Burghers to flee the island. Most of them settled in Europe, the Americas, Australia and [[New Zealand]].\n\n[[Portuguese Burghers]] are usually descended from a Sri Lankan mother and a Portuguese father.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reeves|first1=Peter|title=The Encyclopedia of the Sri Lankan Diaspora|page=28|date=2014|publisher=[[Editions Didier Millet]]}}</ref> This configuration is also the case with the Dutch Burghers. When the Portuguese arrived on the island in 1505, they were accompanied by African slaves. [[Sri Lanka Kaffir people|Kaffirs]] are a mix of African, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese colonist]] and [[Demographics of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan]]. The free mixing between the various groups of people was encouraged by the colonials.  Soon the [[Sri Lanka Mesti\u00e7o people|Mesti\u00e7os]] or the \"Mixed People\" began speaking a creole known as the [[Sri Lanka Indo-Portuguese language|Ceylonese-Portuguese Creole]]. It was based on Portuguese, [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]].\n\nThe Burgher population numbers 40,000 in Sri Lanka and thousands more worldwide, concentrated mostly in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. [[Phenotypically]] Burghers can have skin ranging from light to darker, depending on their ancestors, even within the same family. Burghers with dark to light brown skin usually are of Portuguese Burghers or Kaffir ancestry; they may also have [[European ethnic groups|European]] facial features common to the Mediterranean basin (see [[Mediterranean race|Mediterraneans]]). They have a distinct look compared to native Sri Lankans. Most light-skinned Burghers are of Dutch or British descent. Most Burghers are [[Roman Catholic]] in religion.\n\nLike certain other Asian countries -Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines- Eurasians/Burghers have also been sought after by advertisers and modelling agencies in Sri Lanka. Their mixed look combining both Western and Sri Lankan features makes them attractive to advertisers who see them as a representation of an \"exotic Sri Lankan/Sinhalese\". Predictions within the advertising industry in Sri Lanka estimate that more than 50% of advertising models in Sri Lanka are Burghers/Eurasians.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWWqyWtgkh0C&pg|title=Buying and Believing: Sri Lankan Advertising and Consumers in a Transnational World|first=Steven|last=Kemper|date=1 May 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=9 January 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780226430416}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Public Eye Awards 2008 mit Melanie Winiger - Crop (2).jpg|[[Melanie Winiger]]\nFile:Youri Djorkaeff 2011.jpg|[[Youri Djorkaeff]]\nFile:Graf Richard Nikolaus von Coudenhove-Kalergi (1894\u20131972) ~1930.jpg|[[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]]\nFile:OT Berlin 09-13 Marcel Nguyen.jpg|[[Marcel Nguyen]]\nFile:France Nuyen.jpg|[[France Nuyen]]\nFile:B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe 2, 2012.jpg|[[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe]]\nFile:Florence Faivre at 2015 Fan Expo Canada.jpg|[[Florence Faivre]]\n</gallery>\n\nImmigration to Europe has led to the rise of Eurasian communities in Europe, most prominently in the Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom, where significant numbers of Indonesian, Filipino, and Indo-Pakistani Eurasians live.

In [[Brazil]], home to the largest [[Japanese diaspora|Japanese community overseas]], [[miscegenation]] is celebrated, and it promoted [[racial integration]] and mixing over the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, nevertheless as a way of dealing with and assimilating its non-white population, submitted to white elites, with no dangers of uprisings that would put its ''status quo'' in risk.\nWhile [[culture shock]] was strong for the first and second generations of Japanese Brazilians, and the living conditions in the ''[[Hacienda|fazendas]]'' (plantation farms) after the [[Slavery in Brazil|slavery]] crisis were sometimes worse than in Asia, Brazil stimulated immigration as means of substitution for the lost workforce, and any qualms about the non-whiteness of the Japanese were quickly forgotten. After Japan became one of the world's most developed and rich nations, the Japanese in Brazil and their culture as well gained an image of progress, instead of the old bad perception of a people which would not be [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] or integrated as its culture and race were deemed as diametrically opposed to the Brazilian ones.\n\nIn the censuses, self-reported ''amarelos'' (literally \"yellows\" i.e. Mongolics, people [[Race (classification of human beings)|racially]] Asian) include about 2,100,000 people, or around 1% of the Brazilian population. A greater number of persons may have Japanese and less commonly [[Chinese Brazilian|Chinese]] and [[Korean Brazilian|Korean]] ancestry, but identify as [[White Brazilian|white]] (Brazilian society has no [[one drop rule]]), ''[[pardo]]'' (i.e. [[Brown people#Brazil|brown-skinned]] multiracial or assimilated [[Amerindian]], ''pardo'' stands for a Brazilian darker than white and lighter than black, but not necessarily implying a white-black admixture) or [[Afro-Brazilian]]. When it comes to religion, self-reported Asian Brazilians are only less [[Irreligion|Irreligious]] than whites, and a little more [[Roman Catholicism in Brazil|Catholic]] than [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindians]]. They are the least group when it comes to traditional churches of [[Christianity]], and also the least group in percent of [[Protestantism in Brazil|Protestants]], and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] or [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] as well. Asian Brazilians have the highest income per capita according to the 2010 census.\n\n====Peru====\n{{See also|Asian Peruvians}}\nAbout 100,000 Cantonese [[coolie]]s (almost all males) in 1849 to 1874 migrated to [[Peru]] and intermarried with Peruvian women of [[mestizo]], European, Amerindian, European/mestizo, [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[mulatto]] origin. Many Peruvian Chinese and Peruvian Japanese today are of [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Italian people|Italian]], African and American. Estimates for Chinese-Peruvian is about 1.3\u20131.6 millions.

When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the ''Vitalogy'' era. McCready said in 2006, \"Even though there are three guitars, I think there's maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a [[power chord]] thing, and I fit into all that.\"<ref>Cross, Charles R. \"Better Man\". ''Guitar World Presents: Guitar Legends: Pearl Jam''.

As he had more influence on the band's sound, Vedder sought to make the band's musical output less [[Hook (music)|catchy]]. He said, \"I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes.\"<ref name=\"secondcoming\"/> He has also contributed performances on the [[ukulele]], harmonica, [[accordion]], and [[electric sitar]] to various Pearl Jam recordings.\n\n[['Weird Al' Yankovic]] wrote the song \"My Baby's in Love with Eddie Vedder\" for his album [[Running with Scissors (\"Weird Al\" Yankovic album)|''Running with Scissors'']].

Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in [[stage diving]] as well as [[crowd surfing]]. During the early part of Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage lighting rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, \"It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates.\"<ref name=\"hiatt\">{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | title = Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = June 20, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nVedder began incorporating social commentary and political criticism into his lyrics and performances early in his career with Pearl Jam.

Early in Pearl Jam's existence, Vedder and the band became known for their intense live performances. Vedder participated in [[stage diving]] as well as [[crowd surfing]]. During the early part of Pearl Jam's career, Vedder was known to climb the stage lighting rig and hang from the stage roof. Looking back at this time, Vedder said, \"It's hard for us to watch early performances, even though that's when people think we were on fire and young. Playing music for as long as I had been playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...a different kind of energy. And I find it kind of hard to watch those early performances because it's so just fucking, semi-testosterone-fueled or whatever. But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates.\"<ref name=\"hiatt\">{{cite web | last = Hiatt | first = Brian | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10611546/eddie_vedders_embarrassing_tale_naked_in_public/2 | title = Eddie Vedder's Embarrassing Tale: Naked in Public | work = [[Rolling Stone]] | date = June 20, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-03-03 }}</ref>\n\nVedder began incorporating social commentary and political criticism into his lyrics and performances early in his career with Pearl Jam. He usually comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U.S. foreign policy. During Pearl Jam's 1992 appearance on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', Vedder stood atop his stool, took out a marker pen, and wrote \"[[pro-choice]]\" down his arm in large letters when the band performed the song \"Porch\". During Pearl Jam's 2007 [[Lollapalooza]] headlining show, Vedder and the band played a song telling the crowd in Chicago to boycott the oil company [[BP|B.P.

The mushroom has a brownish-orange conical [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that has grooves extending to the center, and reaches up to {{convert|11|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Its slender [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is colored similarly to the cap, and long\u2014up to {{convert|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} tall. Microscopic characteristics include the weakly [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] spores (turning blue to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), the smooth, swollen [[cheilocystidia]] and pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edges and faces, respectively) with long rounded tips, the [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] hyphae of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]], and the absence of [[clamp connection]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==\nThe mushroom was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999 and, along with seven other ''Mycena'' species, identified as a new species in a 2007 publication. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''fusco-'' (meaning \"dark\") and ''aurantiaca'' (\"orange-yellow\"), and refers to the color of the fruit bodies.

''M.&nbsp;subfusca'' may be distinguished by its spindle- to broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia without a narrow neck, club-shaped to irregularly shaped caulocystidia, and lack of pleurocystidia.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]], which reaches {{convert|8|to|11|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, is initially conical to convex to bell-shaped, but becomes flattened in age. It is radially grooved almost to the center, and somewhat [[hygrophanous]] (changing color as it loses or absorbs moisture). The cap surface is dry, minutely [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] initially (that is, appearing as if covered with a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The cap is brown to brownish-orange when young, with a somewhat darker center, and fades to paler toward the margin with age. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, and up to 0.5&nbsp;mm thick. It does not have any distinctive taste or odor. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|30|to|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|to|0.8|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, centrally attached to the cap, slender, hollow, and dry. Its color is orange to brownish-orange, and it is initially pruinose, but later becomes smooth. The base of the stem is covered with coarse, stiff white hairs. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed (narrowly attached to the stem), and distantly spaced, with between 16 and 18 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 1.8&nbsp;mm broad, thin, and pale brownish. The gill edges are pruinose, and the same color as the gill face.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[basidiospore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] and measure 9\u201310.5 by 6\u20137&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are smooth, thin-walled, colorless, and weakly [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are 19\u201330 by 7\u20139&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, and two-spored. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are thin-walled, smooth, 25\u201347 by 3\u201320&nbsp;\u00b5m, abundant, spindle-shaped with a prolonged thickened tip, smooth, and colorless or pale [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are 27\u201375 by 5\u201320&nbsp;\u00b5m, scattered, and similar in shape and color to the cheilocystidia. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] tissue (tissue of the [[hymenium]]-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 10\u201322&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical, often somewhat inflated, smooth, colorless, and [[dextrinoid]] (turning reddish to reddish-brown when stained with Melzer's reagent). The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20137&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are smooth or covered with scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled brownish [[diverticulum|diverticulae]]. The layer of hyphae beneath the cap cuticle is arranged in a parallel manner, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and dextrinoid, containing short and inflated cells that measure up to 34&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The cuticle of the stem is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20134&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical, smooth, brownish, and thin-walled. The flesh of the stem is composed of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 8\u201320&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. The [[wikt:strigose|strigose]] (stiff or bristly) hairs at the base of the stem are 2\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and arise directly from the stem cuticle. They are bent-over or erect, cylindrical, with rounded tips, sometimes [[wikt:flexuous|flexuous]] (winding from side to side), smooth, colorless, and thin-walled. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent in all tissues of this species.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mycena fuscoaurantiaca'' is known only from [[Kanagawa]], Japan.

He says the music in this format abandoned ironic sensibilities in favor of unintellectual, conventional aesthetics rooted in [[Victorian era]] [[Romanticism]], while downplaying the more radical aspects of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], such as politics, race, [[African-American music]], and [[Art pop|pop in the art sense]]. \"Though classic rock draws its inspiration and most of its heroes from the '60s, it is, of course, a construction of the '70s,\" he writes in 1991 for ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' magazine. \"It was invented by prepunk/predisco radio programmers who knew that before they could totally commodify '60s culture they'd have to rework it\u2014that is, selectively distort it till it threatened no one ...

He also believes it was inevitable that certain rock artists would be canonized by critics, major media, and music establishment entities such as the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"Christgau\"/> Confirming this assessment in 2018, [[Steven Hyden]] recalls how the appearance of classic rock as a timeless music lent it a distinction from the \"inherently nihilistic\" pop he had first listened to on the radio as a teenager in the early 1990s. \"[I]t seemed to have been around forever,\" he writes of the classic rock format. \"It was there long before I was born, and I was sure it was still going to be around after I was gone.\"<ref name=\"Steven Hyden\">{{cite book|last=Hyden|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven Hyden|title=Twilight of the Gods: A Journey to the End of Classic Rock|date=2018|publisher=Dey Street|isbn=9780062657121|page=19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJElDwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\nPolitically, the mindset underlying classic rock is regarded by Christgau as regressive. He says the music in this format abandoned ironic sensibilities in favor of unintellectual, conventional aesthetics rooted in [[Victorian era]] [[Romanticism]], while downplaying the more radical aspects of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], such as politics, race, [[African-American music]], and [[Art pop|pop in the art sense]]. \"Though classic rock draws its inspiration and most of its heroes from the '60s, it is, of course, a construction of the '70s,\" he writes in 1991 for ''[[Details (magazine)|Details]]'' magazine. \"It was invented by prepunk/predisco radio programmers who knew that before they could totally commodify '60s culture they'd have to rework it\u2014that is, selectively distort it till it threatened no one ...

The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of the fungus has a smooth, violet-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, and a slender [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long. Distinguishing microscopic characteristics of the mushroom include the relatively large, distinctly [[amyloid]] spores (turning blue to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), the smooth, spindle-shaped cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge), the absence of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), the [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] hyphae of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]], and the absence of [[clamp connection]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==\nThe fungus was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999, and described as a new species along with seven other Japanese Mycenas in a 2007 publication. The mushroom's Japanese name is ''Izumino-ashinagatake'' (\u30a4\u30ba\u30df\u30ce\u30a2\u30b7\u30ca\u30ac\u30bf\u30b1). The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''fonticola'' is derived from [[Latin]], and means \"dweller in fountain\".<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\nAccording to Takahashi, various macro- and microscopic features suggest that this species is best [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Fragilipedes'' (Fr.) Qu\u00e9l., as defined by the Dutch ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus|Maas Geesteranus]].<ref name=Takahaski2007/><ref name=MaasGeesteranus1980/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, and ranges in shape from conical to convex to bell-shaped. The surface has radially arranged shallow grooves extending almost to the center of the cap. The cap surface is somewhat [[hygrophanous]] (changing color as it loses or absorbs water), dry, and smooth. It is colored violet-brown when young, then becomes somewhat paler from the margin. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to 1&nbsp;mm thick, and lacks any distinctive odor or taste. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is long and slender compared to the size of the cap, typically {{convert|7|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} tall by {{convert|1|to|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} thick, cylindrical, slightly enlarged at the base, and hollow. It is grayish-brown to violet-brown at the top, gradually becoming violet-brown on the lower portion. The stem surface is initially [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (appearing to be covered with a fine whitish powder), but becomes smooth in age. The stem base bears large, bristle-like coarse white hairs. The [[Lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed (narrowly attached to the stem), with between 23\u201327 reaching the stem. The gills are up to {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} broad, thin, and have a whitish or with a grayish hue; the gills edges are the same color as the gill faces.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, colorless, distinctly [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] (absorbing iodine stain from [[Melzer's reagent]]), thin-walled, and measure 11.5\u201314 by 6\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are 17\u201328 by 6\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, and four-spored. The basidioles (immature or aborted basidia) are club-shaped. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the gills edges) are 32\u201339 by 5\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m, abundant, spindle-shaped to roughly club-shaped, often apically broadly rounded, smooth, colorless, and thin-walled. They form a sterile gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are absent in this species. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] tissue (tissue of the [[hymenium]]-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 7\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical, smooth, colorless, and [[dextrinoid]] (staining reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical, and densely covered with warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle are parallel, colorless or with cytoplasmic brownish pigment, dextrinoid, and have short and inflated cells measuring up to 30&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are covered with scattered, thin-walled warty or finger-like [[diverticulum|diverticulae]] that can be either colorless, or contain brownish [[pigment]] in the [[cytoplasm]]. The flesh of the stem is made of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 5\u201317&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid.

The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of the fungus has a smooth, violet-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, and a slender [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long. Distinguishing microscopic characteristics of the mushroom include the relatively large, distinctly [[amyloid]] spores (turning blue to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), the smooth, spindle-shaped cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge), the absence of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), the [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] hyphae of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]], and the absence of [[clamp connection]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==\nThe fungus was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999, and described as a new species along with seven other Japanese Mycenas in a 2007 publication. The mushroom's Japanese name is ''Izumino-ashinagatake'' (\u30a4\u30ba\u30df\u30ce\u30a2\u30b7\u30ca\u30ac\u30bf\u30b1). The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''fonticola'' is derived from [[Latin]], and means \"dweller in fountain\".<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\nAccording to Takahashi, various macro- and microscopic features suggest that this species is best [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Fragilipedes'' (Fr.) Qu\u00e9l., as defined by the Dutch ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus|Maas Geesteranus]].<ref name=Takahaski2007/><ref name=MaasGeesteranus1980/>\n\n==Description==\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter, and ranges in shape from conical to convex to bell-shaped. The surface has radially arranged shallow grooves extending almost to the center of the cap. The cap surface is somewhat [[hygrophanous]] (changing color as it loses or absorbs water), dry, and smooth. It is colored violet-brown when young, then becomes somewhat paler from the margin. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to 1&nbsp;mm thick, and lacks any distinctive odor or taste. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is long and slender compared to the size of the cap, typically {{convert|7|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} tall by {{convert|1|to|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} thick, cylindrical, slightly enlarged at the base, and hollow. It is grayish-brown to violet-brown at the top, gradually becoming violet-brown on the lower portion. The stem surface is initially [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (appearing to be covered with a fine whitish powder), but becomes smooth in age. The stem base bears large, bristle-like coarse white hairs. The [[Lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed (narrowly attached to the stem), with between 23\u201327 reaching the stem. The gills are up to {{convert|2.5|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} broad, thin, and have a whitish or with a grayish hue; the gills edges are the same color as the gill faces.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, colorless, distinctly [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] (absorbing iodine stain from [[Melzer's reagent]]), thin-walled, and measure 11.5\u201314 by 6\u20138&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are 17\u201328 by 6\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, and four-spored. The basidioles (immature or aborted basidia) are club-shaped. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the gills edges) are 32\u201339 by 5\u201312&nbsp;\u00b5m, abundant, spindle-shaped to roughly club-shaped, often apically broadly rounded, smooth, colorless, and thin-walled. They form a sterile gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) are absent in this species. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] tissue (tissue of the [[hymenium]]-bearing structure) is made of thin-walled hyphae that are 7\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical, smooth, colorless, and [[dextrinoid]] (staining reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical, and densely covered with warty or finger-like thin-walled diverticulae that are colorless or contain cytoplasmic brownish pigment. The layer of hyphae underlying the cap cuticle are parallel, colorless or with cytoplasmic brownish pigment, dextrinoid, and have short and inflated cells measuring up to 30&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and cylindrical. These hyphae are covered with scattered, thin-walled warty or finger-like [[diverticulum|diverticulae]] that can be either colorless, or contain brownish [[pigment]] in the [[cytoplasm]]. The flesh of the stem is made of longitudinally running, cylindrical hyphae that are 5\u201317&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, smooth, colorless, and dextrinoid. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent in all tissues of this species.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''[[Mycena mustea]]'' is another similar ''Mycena'' that was discovered and reported concurrently with ''M.&nbsp;fonticola''; it differs in forming a pale grayish purple cap with a low and broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]].
