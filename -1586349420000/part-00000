It was founded in 1891 and renamed in 1988 after [[J. Willard Marriott]], founder of [[Marriott International]], and his wife Alice following their $15 million endowment gift to the school.\n\nThe school is housed in the Tanner Building and supports 137 full-time faculty and approximately 200 adjunct, part-time or visiting faculty, full-time staff and students who teach. It has approximately 2,100 undergraduate and 1,200 graduate students, and approximately 62 percent of its student body are bilingual. As of 2019, its alumni base numbers 55,000.\n\n==Description==\nGoing by several different names since its inception in 1891, the business school at BYU had been known as the Marriott School of Management since 1988, when [[Marriott International]] founders [[J. Willard Marriott|J. Willard]] and [[Alice Marriott]] made a $15 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|15|1988|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) donation to the school.

Eldon Tanner Building]] and offers five undergraduate and six graduate degrees.\n\nEthical decision-making is strongly emphasized at the school: undergraduate students are required to complete 14 hours of religion coursework for graduation, all Marriott School students must take at least one course in management ethics, and both students and faculty must commit to abide by the [[Brigham Young University Honor Code|university's honor code]]. The school also exhibits a unique culture because the majority of its student and faculty are members of the LDS Church.\n\nMany Marriott School students obtain a level of foreign language proficiency while serving as [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]].(Sixty-five percent of the student body is [[Multilingualism|bilingual]].) Consequently, the Marriott School sponsors high-proficiency business language courses in 11 languages.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The school claims over 53,000 alumni and is accredited by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1891, Brigham Young Academy, the predecessor to BYU, formed the ''Commercial College'', which offered coursework in business education.

It was founded in 1891 and renamed in 1988 after [[J. Willard Marriott]], founder of [[Marriott International]], and his wife Alice following their $15 million endowment gift to the school.\n\nThe school is housed in the Tanner Building and supports 137 full-time faculty and approximately 200 adjunct, part-time or visiting faculty, full-time staff and students who teach. It has approximately 2,100 undergraduate and 1,200 graduate students, and approximately 62 percent of its student body are bilingual. As of 2019, its alumni base numbers 55,000.\n\n==Description==\nGoing by several different names since its inception in 1891, the business school at BYU had been known as the Marriott School of Management since 1988, when [[Marriott International]] founders [[J. Willard Marriott|J. Willard]] and [[Alice Marriott]] made a $15 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|15|1988|r=2}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) donation to the school.

Eldon Tanner Building]] and offers five undergraduate and six graduate degrees.\n\nEthical decision-making is strongly emphasized at the school: undergraduate students are required to complete 14 hours of religion coursework for graduation, all Marriott School students must take at least one course in management ethics, and both students and faculty must commit to abide by the [[Brigham Young University Honor Code|university's honor code]]. The school also exhibits a unique culture because the majority of its student and faculty are members of the LDS Church.\n\nMany Marriott School students obtain a level of foreign language proficiency while serving as [[Missionary (LDS Church)|LDS missionaries]].(Sixty-five percent of the student body is [[Multilingualism|bilingual]].) Consequently, the Marriott School sponsors high-proficiency business language courses in 11 languages.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The school claims over 53,000 alumni and is accredited by the [[Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1891, Brigham Young Academy, the predecessor to BYU, formed the ''Commercial College'', which offered coursework in business education.

On January 1, 2018, paid programming was also added to the 5:00 a.m. hour for both weekdays and weekends.\n\nIn June 2018, Buzzr launched a live stream hosted on their website, which mirrors the network broadcast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/the-tv-network-buzzr-is-launching-a-free-online-stream/|title=The TV Network Buzzr is Launching a FREE Online Stream|last=Bouma|first=Luke|date=2018-05-31|website=Cord Cutters News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{main|List of programs broadcast by Buzzr}}\n[[Fremantle (company)|Fremantle]]'s library of [[game show]]s spanned 154 series and an estimated 40,000 episodes overall at the time of its launch, from which Buzzr draws its programming.<ref name=ew>{{cite news|title=Fox Television Stations gets rights to classic game show library Buzzr TV|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/01/20/fox-tv-stations-pick-up-classic-game-show-library-buzzr-tv|author=Megan Daley|periodical=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=January 20, 2015|accessdate=January 23, 2015}}</ref> The network's regular lineup \u2013 with series produced from the 1950s to 2000 \u2013 includes such programs as ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', ''Password'', ''Family Feud'' (encompassing episodes beginning with [[Richard Dawson]] as host and dating up to [[John O'Hurley]]'s tenure), ''[[What's My Line?]]'', ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[Card Sharks]]'',  ''[[Body Language]]'', ''[[Match Game]]''<ref name=tnc/><ref name=vty/><ref name=ddln>{{cite news|title=Fox TV Stations Bolsters Game Show Content With Buzzr TV|url=http://deadline.com/2015/01/fox-tv-stations-games-shows-buzzr-tv-fremantlemedia-north-america-debmar-mercury-1201353525/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Business Media|date=January 20, 2015|accessdate=January 23, 2015}}</ref> (including, beginning in 2019, the ''[[Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour]]'', which, up until then, had never been shown in reruns)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/match-game-hollywood-squares-hour-streaming-buzzr.html|title=Holy [Blank]: The Long-Lost Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour Returns to TV After 35-Year Absence|last=Adalian|first=Josef|date=2019-02-01 |website=www.vulture.com |access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref> and the [[The Price Is Right (1956 game show)|original 1950s & 1960s version of ''The Price Is Right'']] hosted by [[Bill Cullen]].<ref name=hollywood>{{cite news|title=Fox TV Stations to Air Classic Game Shows From Buzzr TV's Massive Library|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fox-tv-stations-air-classic-764821|author=Alex Ben Block|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Guggenheim Digital Media]]|date=January 20, 2015|accessdate=January 23, 2015}}</ref> In addition to the [[Mark Goodson]]-[[Bill Todman]] programs mentioned above, Buzzr's library includes the Al Howard Productions (''[[Sale of the Century]]'' and ''[[Supermarket Sweep]]''), [[Bill Carruthers]] (''[[Press Your Luck]]'') and [[Stefan Hatos-Monty Hall Productions|Stefan Hatos]]-[[Monty Hall]] (''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' and ''[[Split Second (game show)|Split Second]]'') catalogs.\n\nAs of 2018, almost all of Buzzr's lineup consists of game shows that originally had aired between 1973 and 1993 (''Match Game'', ''Password'', ''Family Feud'' and ''Supermarket Sweep'', in particular, air multiple episodes each day), with select blocks of 1950s and 1960s [[panel show]]s also being featured. ''[[Celebrity Name Game (American game show)|Celebrity Name Game]]'' and ''[[Temptation (2007 U.S. game show)|Temptation]]'' are the only recent game shows the network has aired. More obscure programs occasionally air as special program blocks, including the anthology series ''Lost and Found,'' featuring rare episodes, unsold pilots, and forgotten shows. On October 20, 2017, Buzzr debuted its first original program ''Game Changers''. This documentary reviewed the history of the game show genre and featured interviews with game show personalities such as [[Alex Trebek]], [[Wink Martindale]] and [[Drew Carey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sneak Peek: Game Changers & Hosting|url=https://www.facebook.com/BUZZRplay/videos/vb.1594990200717769/1903972339819552/?type=3&theater|publisher=Buzzr|date=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBuzzr airs one hour of [[E/I|educational children's programming]] (cut from three hours shortly after the FCC eliminated rules requiring digital subchannels to carry such programs in late 2019), leading out of its weekend morning [[infomercial]] blocks to minimize interruption; ''[[Animal Rescue]]'' and ''Science Now'' air one episode each week.  Other than these, the only non-game show related programming on Buzzr thus far was between September 14, 2017 and October 6, 2017, when episodes of ''[[Richard Simmons]] Dream Maker'' briefly appeared on the schedule, and a marathon of ''[[The Great Christmas Light Fight]]'' in November 2018 and on November 28, 2019.\n\n==Streaming==\nIn 2017, Buzzr began streaming its programming to [[Amazon Prime Video]] and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]; the Prime Video offering provides [[video on demand]], while Twitch offered a linear feed separate from the over-the-air telecast.

This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]\nA '''surname''', '''family name''', or '''last name''' is the portion (in some cultures) of a [[personal name]] that indicates a person's family (or tribe or community, depending on the culture).<ref>{{cite dictionary |title=surname |dictionary=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/surname |accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> Depending on the culture, all members of a family unit may have identical surnames or there may be variations based on the cultural rules.chopda\n\n== Cultural differences ==\nIn the [[English-speaking world]], a surname is commonly referred to as a last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's full name, after any given names. In many parts of Asia, as well as some parts of Europe and Africa, the family name is placed before a person's given name. In most [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]] and [[Lusophone|Portuguese-speaking]] countries, two surnames are commonly used and in some families even three or more are used (often due to a family claim to nobility).\n\nSurnames have not always existed and today are not universal in all cultures. This tradition has arisen separately in different cultures around the world. In Europe, the concept of surnames became popular in the [[Roman Empire]] and expanded throughout the Mediterranean and Western Europe as a result. During the Middle Ages this practice died out as Germanic, Persian, and other influences took hold. During the late Middle Ages surnames gradually re-emerged, first in the form of [[Epithet#Usage_prior_to_surnames|bynames]] (typically indicating individual's occupation or area of residence), which gradually evolved into modern surnames. In China surnames have been the norm since at least the 2nd century BC.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The complex origins of Chinese names demystified |date=18 November 2016 |author=Koon, Wee Kek |magazine=Post Magazine |url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2046955/complex-origins-chinese-names-demystified}}</ref>\n\nA family name is typically a part of a person's [[personal name]] which, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from one or both of their parents' family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, with each culture having its own rules as to how these names are formed, passed and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is [[#History|far from universal]]. In many cultures, it is common for people to have one name or [[mononym]], with some cultures not using family names. In most [[Slavic countries]], as well as other countries including [[Greece]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], for example, there are different family name forms for male and female members of the family. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a new-born child, on the adoption of a common family name on marriage, on renouncing of a family name and on changing of a family name.\n\n[[Surname law]]s vary around the world. Traditionally in many [[Europe]]an countries for the past few hundred years, it was the custom or law that a woman would on marriage use the surname of her husband and that children of a man would have the father's surname. If a child's paternity was not known, or if the [[putative father]] denied paternity, the new-born child would have the surname of the mother. That is still the custom or law in many countries. The surname for children of married parents is usually inherited from the father.<ref>Kelly, 99 W Va L Rev at 10; see id. at 10 n 25 (The custom of taking the father's surname assumes that the child is born to parents in a \"state-sanctioned marriage.\" The custom is different for children born to unmarried parents.). Cited in [http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/docs/A127262.htm#N_15_ Doherty v. Wizner, Oregon Court of Appeals] (2005)</ref> In recent years there has been a trend towards equality of treatment in relation to family names, with women being not automatically required or expected, or in some places even forbidden, to take the husband's surname on marriage, and children not automatically being given the father's surname. In this article, family name and surname both mean the [[patrilineal]] surname, handed down from or inherited from the father's, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, the term \"maternal surname\" means the ''patrilineal'' surname which one's mother inherited from either or both of her parents. For a discussion of ''[[matrilineal]]'' ('mother-line') surnames, passing from mothers to daughters, see [[matrilineal surname]].\n\nIt is common for women in the entertainment industry (like [[Celebrity|celebrities]]) to keep their [[maiden name]] after they get married, especially if they achieved their fame before marriage. The same can be said for women who achieved their fame during a previous marriage; For example: [[Kris Jenner]] (born Kris Houghton) was married to her second spouse [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce Jenner]] (now Caitlyn) when she rose to prominence in the reality show ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'' and singer [[Britney Spears]] has been married twice after she rose to prominence, but she still uses her maiden name.\n\nIn [[Anglosphere|English-speaking cultures]], family names are often used by children when referring to adults but are also used to refer to someone in authority, the elderly, or in a formal setting, and are often used with a [[title]] or [[honorific]] such as [[Mr.]], [[Mrs.]], [[Ms.]], [[Miss]], [[Doctor (title)|Doctor]], and so on. Generally the [[given name]] is the one used by friends, family, and other intimates to address an individual. It may also be used by someone who is in some way senior to the person being addressed. This practice also differs between cultures; see [[T\u2013V distinction]].\n\nThe study of proper names (in family names, personal names, or places) is called [[onomastics]]. A [[one-name study]] is a collection of vital and other biographical data about all persons worldwide sharing a particular surname.\n\n== Order of names ==\n{{Further|Personal name#Name order}}\nIn many cultures (particularly in [[Culture of Europe|European]] and European-influenced cultures in the Americas, Oceania, etc., as well as the Middle East, South Asia, and most African cultures), the surname or family name (\"last name\") is placed after the personal, [[Given name|forename]] (in Europe) or given name (\"first name\"). In other cultures the surname is placed first, followed by the given name or names. The latter is often called the [[Name order|Eastern naming order]] because Europeans are most familiar with the examples from the [[East Asian cultural sphere]], specifically, [[Chinese name|Greater China]], [[Korean name|Korea (Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea)]], [[Japanese name|Japan]], and [[Vietnamese name|Vietnam]]. This is also the case in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], parts of [[South India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Madagascar]]. But there are parts of Europe that also follow the Eastern Order, such as [[Hungary]], [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[Albanian name|Albania, Kosovo]], and [[Romania]].\n\nSince family names are normally written last in European societies, the terms last name or surname are commonly used for the family name, while in Japan (with vertical writing) the family name may be referred to as upper name ({{Nihongo||\u4e0a\u306e\u540d\u524d|ue-no-namae}}).\n\nWhen people from areas using Eastern naming order write their personal name in the [[Latin alphabet]], it is common to reverse the order of the given and family names for the convenience of Westerners, so that they know which name is the family name for official/formal purposes. Reversing the order of names for the same reason is also [[Norm (social)|customary]] for the [[Baltic Finns|Baltic Fennic peoples]] and the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], but other [[Uralic languages|Uralic peoples]] traditionally did not have surnames, perhaps because of the [[clan]] structure of their societies. The [[Samis]] saw no change or a transformation of their name. For example: some Sire became Siri,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snl.no/Aslak_Jacobsen_H%C3%A6tta |title=Guttorm |publisher=Snl.no |date= 29 May 2017|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> H\u00e6tta J\u00e1hko\u0161 \u00c1sslat became [[Aslak H\u00e6tta|Aslak Jacobsen H\u00e6tta]] \u2014 as was the [[Convention (norm)|norm]]. Recently, integration into the [[European Union|EU]] and increased communications with foreigners prompted many Samis to reverse the order of their full name to given name followed by surname, to avoid their given name being mistaken for and used as a surname.\n\nIndian surnames may often denote [[caste]], profession, and village and are invariably mentioned along with the personal names. However, hereditary last names are not universal. In Indian passports the surname is shown first. In telephone directories the surname is used for [[collation]]. In North Indian states the surname is placed after given names where it exists. In parts of south India, surname is placed before personal name and in most cases it is only shown as an initial (for example 'S.' for Suryapeth).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn English and other languages like Spanish\u2014although the usual order of names is \"first middle last\"\u2014for the purpose of cataloging in libraries and in citing the names of authors in scholarly papers, the order is changed to \"last, first middle,\" with the last and first names separated by a comma, and items are alphabetized by the last name.<ref>[http://www.ala.org/tools/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet27 \"Filing Rules\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121153423/http://www.ala.org/tools/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet27 |date=21 January 2013 }} on the [[American Library Association]] website</ref><ref>[http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/05/ \"MLA Works Cited Page: Basic Format\"] on the [[Purdue Online Writing Lab]] website, [[Purdue University]]</ref> In [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Belgium]] and [[Latin America]], administrative usage is to put the surname before the first on official documents.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Name change}}\nWhile the use of given names to identify individuals is attested in the oldest historical records, the advent of surnames is a relatively recent{{when|date=February 2018}} phenomenon.<ref name=\"Doll1992\">{{Cite news |last=Doll |first=Cynthia Blevins |year=1992 |title=Harmonizing Filial and Parental Rights in Names: Progress, Pitfalls, and Constitutional Problems |periodical=Howard Law Journal |publisher=Howard University School of Law |volume=35 |page=227 |issn=0018-6813}} ''Note: content available by subscription only.

[[Henry VIII]] (ruled 1509\u20131547) ordered that marital births be recorded under the surname of the father.<ref name=\"Doll1992\" /> In England and cultures derived from there, there has long been a tradition for a woman to change her surname upon marriage from her [[Name at birth|birth name]] to her husband's family name. (See [[Maiden and married names]].) The first known instance in the United States of a woman insisting on the use of her birth name was that of [[Lucy Stone]] in 1855; and there has been a general increase in the rate of women using their birth name. This has gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} As of 2006, more than 80% of American women adopted the husband's family name after marriage.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5482928 \"American Women, Changing Their Names\"], ''[[National Public Radio]]''.

For example, [[Alexander the Great]] was known as [[Heracleidae|''Heracleides'']], as a supposed descendant of [[Heracles]], and by the dynastic name [[Caranus of Macedon|''Karanos''/''Caranus'']], which referred to the founder of the [[Argead dynasty|dynasty to which he belonged]]. In none of these cases, though, were these names considered essential parts of the person's name, nor were they explicitly inherited in the manner that is common in many cultures today.\n\nIn the Roman Empire, the bestowal and use of clan and family names waxed and waned with changes in the various subcultures of the realm. (''See [[Roman naming conventions]].'') The nomen, which was the gens name, was inherited much like last names are, but their purposes were quite different{{how|date=February 2018}}. In later{{when|date=February 2018}} Europe, last names were developed to distinguish between individuals. The nomen were to identify group kinship. The praenomen was the \"forename\" and was originally used like a first name today. In later times{{when|date=February 2018}}, praenomen became less useful for distinguishing individuals as it was often passed down for males along with the nomen (like an entire culture where \"John Smith, Jr.\" was the norm), and females, were often given no praenomen at all or functional names like Major and Minor (\"Older\" and \"Younger\") or Maxima, Maio, and Mino (\"Biggest,\" \"Middle,\" \"Littlest\") or ordinal numbers rather than what we might think of as names: Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, etc. Around this time,{{when|date=February 2018}} the nomen became followed by one or more additional names called cognomen. It became usual that one of these cognomen was inherited, but as the praenomen and nomen became more rigidly used and less useful for identifying individuals, additional personal cognomen were more often used, to the point that the first the praenomen and then the nomen fell out of use entirely.{{when|date=February 2018}} With the gradual influence of Greek and Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes put in front of traditional cognomen, but eventually, people reverted to single names.<ref name=\"Chavez2006\">{{cite web |url=http://heraldry.sca.org/laurel/names/byzantine/introduction.html |title=Personal Names of the Aristocracy in the Roman Empire During the Later Byzantine Era |accessdate=21 September 2008 |last=Chavez |first=Berret |date=9 November 2006 |work=Official Web Page of the Laurel Sovereign of Arms for the Society for Creative Anachronism |publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism}}</ref> By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. In Western Europe, where Germanic culture dominated the aristocracy, family names were almost non-existent. They would not significantly reappear again in Eastern Roman society until the 10th century, apparently influenced by the familial affiliations of the Armenian military aristocracy.<ref name=\"Chavez2006\" /> The practice of using family names spread through the Eastern Roman Empire and gradually into Western Europe, although it was not until the modern era that family names came to be explicitly inherited as they are today.\n\nIn Ireland, the use of surnames has a very old history. Ireland was the first country in Europe to use fixed surnames{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}. As noted in the Annals, the first recorded fixed{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} surname was \u00d3 Cleirigh, which recorded the death of Tigherneach Ua Cleirigh, lord of Aidhne in Galway in the year 916.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Origins of Irish Surnames |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/magazine/surname/index.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409124022/http://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/magazine/surname/index.htm |archivedate=9 April 2016 |work=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\nIn England, the introduction of family names is generally attributed to the preparation of the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} following the [[Norman conquest]]. Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by affixing 'de' (of) before the name of their village in France. This is what is known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. In medieval times in France, such a name indicated lordship, or ownership, of the village. Some early Norman nobles in England chose{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} to drop the French derivations and call themselves instead after their new English holdings.\n\nSurnames were uncommon prior to the 12th century, and still somewhat rare into the 13th; most European surnames were originally occupational or locational, and served to distinguish one person from another if they happened to live near one another (e.g., two different people named John could conceivably be identified as 'John Butcher' and 'John Chandler'). This still happens, in some communities where a surname is particularly common.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, when a man from a lower-status family married an only daughter from a higher-status family, he would often adopt the wife's family name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} In the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, bequests were sometimes made contingent upon a man's changing (or hyphenating) his family name, so that the name of the [[testator]] continued. It is rare but not unknown for an English-speaking man to take his wife's family name, whether for personal reasons or as a matter of tradition (such as among [[matrilineal]] [[First Nations|Canadian aboriginal]] groups, such as the [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Gitxsan]]); it is exceedingly rare but does occur in the United States, where a married couple may choose an entirely new last name by going through a legal change of name. As an alternative, both spouses may adopt a [[double-barrelled name]]. For instance, when John Smith and Mary Jones marry each other, they may become known as \"John Smith-Jones\" and \"Mary Smith-Jones\". A spouse may also opt to use their birth name as a middle name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} An additional option, although rarely practiced{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, is the adoption of a last name derived from a blend of the prior names, such as \"Simones\", which also requires a legal name change.  Some couples keep their own last names but give their children hyphenated or combined surnames.<ref>Daniella Miletic (20 July 2012) [http://m.theage.com.au/victoria/most-women-say-i-do-to-husbands-name-20120719-22d5c.html Most women say 'I do' to husband's name]. The Age.</ref>\n\nIn medieval [[Spain]], a patronymic system was used. For example, \u00c1lvaro, the son of Rodrigo would be named \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez.  His son, Juan, would not be named Juan Rodr\u00edguez, but Juan \u00c1lvarez. Over time, many of these patronymics became family names and are some of the most common names in the Spanish-speaking world. Other sources of surnames are personal appearance or habit, e.g. Delgado (\"thin\") and Moreno (\"dark\"); occupations, e.g. Molinero (\"miller\"), Zapatero (\"shoe-maker\") and Guerrero (\"warrior\"); and geographic location or ethnicity, e.g. Alem\u00e1n (\"German\").\n\n=== Modern era ===\nDuring the modern era, many cultures around the world adopted family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the age of European expansion and particularly since 1600. Notable examples include the Netherlands (1795\u20131811), Japan (1870s), Thailand (1920), and Turkey (1934). Nonetheless, their use is not universal: Icelanders, Burmese, Javanese, and many people groups in East Africa do not use family names.\n\nFamily names sometimes change or are replaced by non-family-name surnames under political pressure to avoid persecution.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Examples are the cases with [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Chinese Indonesians]] and [[Chinese Thai surname|Chinese Thais]] after migration there during the 20th century, or the [[Jew]]s who fled to different European countries to avoid persecution from the Nazis during World War II.\n\nThe United States followed the naming customs and practices of English common law and traditions until recent{{when|date=February 2018}} times. Beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, traditional naming practices, writes one commentator, were recognized as \"com[ing] into conflict with current sensitivities about children's and women's rights\".<ref>Richard H. Thornton, ''The Controversy Over Children's Surnames: Familial Autonomy, Equal Protection and the Child's Best Interests'', 1979 Utah L Rev 303.</ref> Those changes accelerated a shift away from the interests of the parents to a focus on the best interests of the child.

With a few exceptions, Europe's languages are [[cognate]], so most European surnames have a common [[etymological]] origin. Some surnames are monogenetic (derived from one family at a specific place and time); others are polygenetic (coined independently at different places and times).<ref name=\"hanks\" />\n\n=== Classification of European Surnames ===\n[[Basil Cottle]] classifies European surnames under four broad categories, depending on their origin: given name (patronymics), occupational name, local name (toponymics), and nickname.<ref name=\"cottle\">Cottle, Basil. ''Penguin Dictionary of Surnames''. Baltimore, MD: Penguin Books, 1967. No ISBN.</ref> This classification can be extended to surnames originating elsewhere.

Multiple surnames may be derived from a single given name: e.g. there are thought to be over 90 Italian surnames based on the given name \"[[Giovanni (name)|Giovanni]]\".<ref name=\"hanks\">[[Patrick Hanks|Hanks, Patrick]] and Hodges, Flavia. ''A Dictionary of Surnames''. Oxford University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-19-211592-8}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Icelandic Patronyms.svg|thumb|250px|A family tree showing the Icelandic patronymic naming system.]]\nThe Icelandic system, formerly used in much of Scandinavia, does not use family names. A person's last name indicates the first name of their father ([[patronymic]]) or in some cases mother ([[matronymic]]). Many common family names in other Scandinavian countries are a result of this naming practice, such as [[Hansen (surname)|Hansen]] (son of [[Hans (name)|Hans]]), [[Johansen]] (son of [[Johan (given name)|Johan]]) and [[Olsen (surname)|Olsen]] (son of [[Ole (name)|Ole]]/Ola), the three most common surnames in [[Norway]].<ref>Statistics Norway [http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/00/navn_en/ name statistics, 2009]</ref> This also occurs in other cultures: Spanish and Portuguese (L\u00f3pez or Lopes, son of Lope; \u00c1lvarez or \u00c1lvares, son of \u00c1lvaro; Dom\u00ednguez or Domingues, son of Domingo or Domingos; etc.); Armenian (Gregoryan, son of Gregor; Petrossyan, son of Petros; etc.); in English (Johnson, son of John; Richardson, son of Richard), etc.\n\nPatronymic name conventions are similar in some other nations, including Malaysia (see [[Malaysian name]]) and other Muslim countries, among most people of the Indian states of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] (unlike another Indian state [[Andhra Pradesh]], where ancestral origin village names have become surnames for the people), in [[Mongolian name|Mongolia]] and in the [[Scottish Gaelic personal naming system]]. In [[Russian name|Russia]] and [[Bulgarian name|Bulgaria]], both patronymic and family name are obligatory parts of one's full name: e.g. if a Russian is called Ivan Andreyevich Sergeyev, that means that his father's name is Andrey and his family name is Sergeyev. A similar system is used in [[Greek names|Greece]].\n\nIn [[Habesha name|Ethiopia and Eritrea]], a child adopts the given name of one of their parents, usually the father, as a pseudo-surname. For example, Abraham Mesfin's father's first name would have been Mesfin, while Abraham Mesfin's child might be called \"Netsanet Abraham\". Just as in Iceland, referring to Abraham Mesfin as \"Mr Mesfin\" would be erroneous: the correct term would be \"Mr Abraham\". Very rarely do children adopt their mother's given name, who in any case would retain their \"pseudo-surname\".\n\nIn traditional [[Patronymic#Jewish usage|Hebrew patronymic names]], a male's given name is followed by ''ben'' ({{lang-he|\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df}}, ''son of''), and the father's name, e.g. [[Ben Adam]] ({{lang-he|\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd}}) or [[Abraham ben Abraham]]. A woman's given name is similarly followed by ''bath'', \"daughter of\" (also transcribed as ''bat''), as in \"Elishevah bath Shemuel,\" where Elishevah's father's given name is Shemuel. ''Ben'' also forms part of [[Hebrew name]]s, e.g. [[Benjamin]]. \nSome modern Israeli last names are formed by using the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] version of ''ben'', [[Bar (Aramaic)#Aramaic|Bar-]], e.g. [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]. In Israel, traditional patronymic forms have become European-style patrilineal surnames. For example, Yoram ben Yehudah or Hannah Bar-Ilan may not be literally the son and daughter of Yehudah and Ilan, but rather the male and female descendants of men called, respectively, ben Yehudah and Bar-Ilan.\n\n* '''[[Patronymic]]s, [[matronymic]]s or ancestral''', often from a person's given name. e.g., from male name: ''[[Richardson (surname)|Richardson]]'', ''[[Stephenson]]'', ''[[Jones (surname)|Jones]]'' (Welsh for John), ''[[Williams (surname)|Williams]]'', ''[[Jackson (name)|Jackson]]'', ''[[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]]'', ''[[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]'', ''[[Benson (surname)|Benson]]'', ''[[Johnson]]'', ''[[Harris (surname)|Harris]]'', ''[[Evans (surname)|Evans]]'', ''[[Simpson (surname)|Simpson]]'', ''[[Willis (surname)|Willis]]'', ''[[Fox (surname)|Fox]]'', ''[[Davies]]'', ''[[Reynolds (surname)|Reynolds]]'', ''[[Adams (surname)|Adams]]'', ''[[Dawson (surname)|Dawson]]'', ''[[Lewis (surname)|Lewis]]'', ''[[Rogers (surname)|Rogers]]'', ''[[Murphy]]'', ''[[Morrow (surname)|Morrow]]'', ''[[Nicholson (surname)|Nicholson]]'', ''[[Robinson (name)|Robinson]]'', ''[[Powell (surname)|Powell]]'', ''[[Ferguson (name)|Ferguson]]'', ''[[Davis (surname)|Davis]]'', ''[[Edwards (surname)|Edwards]]'', ''[[Hudson (surname)|Hudson]]'', ''[[Roberts (surname)|Roberts]]'', ''[[Harrison (name)|Harrison]]'', ''[[Watson (surname)|Watson]]'', or female names ''Molson'' (from Moll for Mary), ''[[Madison (name)|Madison]]'' (from Maud), ''Emmott'' (from Emma), ''Marriott'' (from Mary) or from a clan name (for those of Scottish origin, e.g., ''[[MacDonald]]'', ''[[Clan Forbes|Forbes]]'', ''[[Henderson (surname)|Henderson]]'', ''[[Armstrong (surname)|Armstrong]]'', ''[[Grant (surname)|Grant]]'', ''[[Cameron (surname)|Cameron]]'', ''[[Stewart (name)|Stewart]]'', ''[[Douglas (surname)|Douglas]]'', ''[[Crawford (name)|Crawford]]'', ''[[Campbell (surname)|Campbell]]'', ''[[Hunter (name)|Hunter]]'') with \"Mac\" [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] for son.<ref>Katherine M.

Some are prefixes (e.g., Gaelic ''mac'') but more are suffixes.\n\n====Occupational surname==== <!-- [[Occupational name]] and [[Occupational surname]] redirects here -->\n[[Vocation|Occupational]] names include such simple examples as ''[[Smith (surname)|Smith]]'' (for a [[metalsmith|smith]]), ''[[Miller (name)|Miller]]'' (for a [[miller]]), ''[[Farmer (surname)|Farmer]]'' (for [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farmers]] or sometimes [[farmer]]s), ''[[Thatcher (profession)|Thatcher]]'' (for a [[thatching|thatcher]]), ''[[Shepherd (surname)|Shepherd]]'' (for a [[shepherd]]), ''[[Potter (surname)|Potter]]'' (for a [[pottery|potter]]), and so on, as well as non-English ones, such as the German ''Eisenhauer'' (iron [[hewer]], later Anglicized in America as ''[[Eisenhower (name)|Eisenhower]]'') or ''[[Schneider (surname)|Schneider]]'' (tailor) \u2013 or, as in English, ''[[Schmidt (surname)|Schmidt]]'' (smith). There are also more complicated names based on occupational titles. In England it was common for servants to take a modified version of their employer's occupation or first name as their last name,{{According to whom|date=July 2018}} adding the letter ''s'' to the word, although this formation could also be a [[patronymic]]. For instance, the surname ''[[Vickers (surname)|Vickers]]'' is thought to have arisen as an occupational name adopted by the servant of a vicar,<ref name=\"reaney\">Reaney, P.H., and Wilson, R.M.

Rev. 3rd ed. {{ISBN|0-19-860092-5}}.</ref> while ''[[Roberts (surname)|Roberts]]'' could have been adopted by either the son or the servant of a man named Robert. A subset of occupational names in English are names thought to be derived from the medieval [[Mystery play#English mystery plays|mystery plays]]. The participants would often play the same roles for life, passing the part down to their oldest sons. Names derived from this may include ''[[King (surname)|King]]'', ''[[Lord (surname)|Lord]]'' and ''Virgin''. The original meaning of names based on medieval occupations may no longer be obvious in modern English (so the surnames ''Cooper'', ''Chandler'', and ''Cutler'' come from the occupations of making barrels, candles, and cutlery, respectively).\n\n===== Examples =====\n{{Category see also|Occupational surnames}}\n''[[Archer (surname)|Archer]]'', ''[[Bailey (surname)|Bailey]]'', ''[[Bailhache (surname)|Bailhache]]'', ''[[Baker (surname)|Baker]]'', ''[[Brewer (surname)|Brewer]]'', ''[[Butcher (surname)|Butcher]]'', ''[[Carpenter (surname)|Carpenter]]'', ''[[Carter (name)|Carter]]'', ''[[Chandler (surname)|Chandler]]'', ''[[Clark]]'' or ''[[Clarke]]'', ''[[Collier (surname)|Collier]]'', ''[[Cooper (surname)|Cooper]]'', ''[[Cook (surname)|Cook]]'' or ''[[Cooke (surname)|Cooke]]'',  ''Dempster'', ''[[Dyer (surname)|Dyer]]'', ''[[Farmer (surname)|Farmer]]'', ''[[Faulkner (surname)|Faulkner]]'', ''[[Fisher (surname)|Fisher]]'', ''[[Fletcher (surname)|Fletcher]]'', ''[[Fowler (surname)|Fowler]]'', ''[[Fuller (surname)|Fuller]]'', ''Gardener'', ''[[Glover (surname)|Glover]]'', ''[[Hayward (profession)|Hayward]]'', ''[[Hawkins (name)|Hawkins]]'', ''Head'', ''[[Hunt (surname)|Hunt]]'' or ''[[Hunter (surname)|Hunter]]'', ''[[Judge (surname)|Judge]]'', ''[[Knight (surname)|Knight]]'', ''[[Mason (surname)|Mason]]'', ''[[Miller (name)|Miller]]'', ''Mower'', ''[[Page (surname)|Page]]'', ''[[Palmer (surname)|Palmer]]'', ''[[Parker (surname)|Parker]]'', ''[[Porter (name)|Porter]]'', ''[[Potter (name)|Potter]]'', ''[[Reeve (surname)|Reeve]]'' or ''[[Reeves (surname)|Reeves]]'', ''[[Sawyer (occupation)|Sawyer]]'', ''[[Slater]]'', ''[[Smith (surname)|Smith]]'', ''[[Stringer (surname)|Stringer]]'', ''[[Taylor (surname)|Taylor]]'', ''[[Thatcher (profession)|Thatcher]]'', ''[[Turner (surname)|Turner]]'', ''[[Walker (surname)|Walker]]'', ''[[Weaver (surname)|Weaver]]'', ''Woodman'' and ''[[Wright]]'' (or variations such as ''[[Cartwright (surname)|Cartwright]]'' and ''[[Wainwright (name)|Wainwright]]'').\n\n====Toponymic surname====<!-- [[Habitation name]], [[Habitational name]], [[Habitative name]], and [[Location name]] redirects here -->\n{{Main|Toponymic surname}}\nLocation (toponymic, habitation) names derive from the inhabited location associated with the person given that name. Such locations can be any type of settlement, such as: homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds or cottages. One element of a habitation name may describe the type of settlement. Examples of [[Old English]] elements are frequently found in the second element of habitational names. The habitative elements in such names can differ in meaning, according to different periods, different locations, or with being used with certain other elements. For example, the Old English element ''t\u016bn'' may have originally meant \"enclosure\" in one name, but can have meant \"farmstead\", \"village\", \"manor\", or \"estate\" in other names.\n\nLocation names, or habitation names, may be as generic as \"Monte\" (Portuguese for \"mountain\"), \"G\u00f3rski\" (Polish for \"hill\") or \"Pitt\" (variant of \"pit\"), but may also refer to specific locations. \"Washington\", for instance, is thought to mean \"the homestead of the family of Wassa\",<ref name=\"cottle\" /> while \"Lucci\" means \"resident of [[Lucca]]\".<ref name=\"hanks\" /> Although some surnames, such as \"London\", \"Lisboa\", or \"Bia\u0142ystok\" are derived from large cities, more people reflect the names of smaller communities, as in [[\u00d3 Creachmhaoil]], derived from a village in [[County Galway]]. This is thought to be due to the tendency in Europe during the Middle Ages for migration to chiefly be from smaller communities to the cities and the need for new arrivals to choose a defining surname.<ref name=\"cottle\" /><ref name=\"bowman\">Bowman, William Dodgson. ''The Story of Surnames''. London, George Routledge & Sons, Ltd., 1932. No ISBN.</ref>\n\nIn [[Portuguese-speaking countries]], it is uncommon, but not unprecedented, to find surnames derived from names of countries, such as Portugal, Fran\u00e7a, Brasil, Holanda. Surnames derived from country names are also found in English, such as \"England\", \"Wales\", \"Spain\".\n\nMany [[Japanese name|Japanese surnames]] derive from geographical features; for example, Ishikawa (\u77f3\u5ddd) means \"stone river\", Yamamoto (\u5c71\u672c) means \"the base of the mountain\", and Inoue (\u4e95\u4e0a) means \"above the well\".\n\nArabic names sometimes contain surnames that denote the city of origin. For example, in cases of [[Saddam Hussein]] al Tikriti,<ref name=\"saddam\">{{cite news |title=Saddam Hussein's top aides hanged |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6261965.stm |accessdate=17 October 2011 |newspaper=BBC News |date=15 January 2007}}</ref> meaning Saddam Hussein originated from [[Tikrit]], a city in [[Iraq]].

Forced adoption in 19th century is the source of German, Polish and even Italian ornamental surnames for Latvians such as \"Rozent\u0101ls (Rosental)\" (\"rose valley\"), \"Eizenbaums (Eisenbaum\") (\"steel wood\"), \"Freibergs (Freiberg)\" (\"free mountain\"). In some cases, such as [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Chinese Indonesians]] and [[Chinese Thai surname|Chinese Thais]], certain ethnic groups are subject to political pressure to change their surnames, in which case surnames can lose their family-name meaning. For instance, Indonesian business tycoon Liem Swie Liong (\u6797\u7ecd\u826f) \"indonesianised\" his name to [[Sudono Salim]]. In this case \"Liem\" (\u6797) was rendered by \"Salim\", a name of Arabic origin, while \"Sudono\", a Javanese name with the honorific prefix \"su-\" (of Sanskrit origin), was supposed{{by whom|date=January 2016}} to be a rendering of \"Swie Liong\".\n\nDuring the era of the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]] many Africans lost their native names and were forced by their owners to take the owners' surnames and any given name the \"owner\" or slave master desired. In the Americas, the family names of many African-Americans have their origins in slavery (''i.e.'' [[slave name]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many of them came to bear the surnames of their former owners. Many freed slaves either created family names themselves or adopted the name of their former master.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n=== Gender-specific versions of surname ===\nIn some cultures and languages, especially most of Slavic languages (such as Bulgarian, Russian, Slovak, Czech, etc.) and some other nations \u2013 Greece, Finland, Island, Latvia and Lithuania \u2013 surnames change form depending on the gender of the bearer.\n\nSome Slavic cultures distinguished originally daughter surnames from wife surnames by different suffixes, but this distinction is mostly abandoned. In Slavic languages, substantivized adjective surnames have commonly symmetrical adjective variants for males and females (Podwi\u0144ski/Podwi\u0144ska in Polish, Nov\u00fd/Nov\u00e1 in Czech or Slovak etc.). In case of nominative and quazi-nominative surnames, the female variant is derived from the male variant by a possessive suffix (Nov\u00e1k/Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, Hromada/Hromadov\u00e1). In Czech and Slovak, the pure possessive would be Nov\u00e1kova, Hromadova, but the surname evoluted to a more adjectivized form Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, Hromadov\u00e1, to suppress the historical possessivity. Some rare types of surnames are universal and gender-neutral: in Czech language e.g. Jan\u016f, Martin\u016f, Fojt\u016f, Kov\u00e1\u0159\u016f etc., which are archaic form of possessive, related to plural name of the family. Such rare surnames are also often used for transgender persons during transformation phase, because most of common surnames are gender-specific. Some Czech dialects (Southwest-Bohemian) use the form \"Nov\u00e1kojc\" as informal for both genders. In culture of [[Sorbs]] (Lusatians), [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] used different female form for unmarried daughters (Jordanojc, Nowcyc, Kuba\u0161ec, Markulic), and different form for wives (Nowakowa, Budarka, Nowcyna, Markulina). In Polish, typical daughter surnames ended -\u00f3wna, -anka or -ianka, while wife surnames used possessive suffixes -ina or -owa. Informal dialectal female form in Polish and Czechs dialects was also -ka (Pawlaczka, Kube\u0161ka). Polish language tends to abandon both form of feminized surnames. In Czech language, a trend to use male surnames for women is popular among cosmopolitans or celebrities, but is often criticized from patriotic views and can be seen as ridiculous and as degradation and disruption of Czech grammar. Adaptation of surnames of foreign women by suffix \"-ov\u00e1\" is currently a hot linguistic and political question in Czechia; is massively advocated as well as criticized and opposed.\n\nGenerally, inflected languages use names and surnames as living words, not as static identifiers. Thus, the pair or the family can be named by plural form which can differ from the singular male and female form. E.g., when the male form is Nov\u00e1k and the female form Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, the family name is Nov\u00e1kovi in Czech and Nov\u00e1kovci in Slovak. When male form is Hrub\u00fd and female form is Hrub\u00e1, the plural family name is Hrub\u00ed (or \"rodina Hrub\u00fdch\").\n\nIn Greece, if a man called Papadopoulos has a daughter, she will likely be named Papadopoulou (if the couple have decided their offspring will take his surname), the genitive form, as if the daughter is \"of\" a man named Papadopoulos.\n\nIn Lithuania, if the husband is named Vilkas, his wife will be named Vilkien\u0117 and his daughter will be named Vilkait\u0117. Male surnames have suffixes -as, -is, -ius, or -us, unmarried girl surnames ait\u0117, -yt\u0117, -i\u016bt\u0117 or -ut\u0117, wife surnames -ien\u0117.\n\nLatvian uses strictly feminized surnames for women, even in case of foreign names. The function of the suffix is purely grammar. Male surnames ending -e or -a need not to be modified for women. An exception is: 1) the female surnames which correspond to nouns in the sixth declension with the ending \"-s\" \u2013 \"Iron\", (\"iron\"), \"rock\", 2) as well as surnames of both genders, which are written in the same nominative case because corresponds to nouns in the third declension ending in \"-us\" \"Grigus\", \"Markus\"; 3) surnames based on an adjective have indefinite suffixes typical of adjectives \"-s, -a\" (\"Stalts\", \"Stalta\") or the specified endings \"-ais, -\u0101\" (\"\u010caklais\", \"\u010cakl\u0101\") (\"diligent\").\n\nIn Iceland, surnames have a gender-specific suffix (-d\u00f3ttir = daughter, -son = son).\n\nFinnish language used gender-specific sufix up to 1929, when the Marriage Act forced women to use the husband's form of surname. In 1985, this sentence was released from the act.\n\n=== Other ===\nThe meanings of some names are unknown or unclear. The most common European name in this category may be the English (Irish derivative) name [[Ryan (surname)|Ryan]], which means 'little king' in Irish.<ref name=\"cottle\" /><ref name=\"reaney\" /> Also, Celtic origin of the name Arthur, meaning '[[Artur|bear]]'. Other surnames may have arisen from more than one source: the name [[DeLuca|De Luca]], for instance, likely arose either in or near Lucania or in the family of someone named Lucas or Lucius;<ref name=\"hanks\" /> in some instances, however, the name may have arisen from Lucca, with the spelling and pronunciation changing over time and with emigration.<ref name=\"hanks\" /> The same name may appear in different cultures by coincidence or romanization; the surname [[Lee (English name)|Lee]] is used in English culture, but is also a romanization of the Chinese surname ''[[Li (surname \u674e)|Li]]''.<ref name=\"reaney\" /> Surname origins have been the subject of much [[folk etymology]].\n\nIn [[French Canada]] until the 19th century, several families adopted surnames that followed the family name in order to distinguish the various branches of a large family. Such a surname was preceded by the word ''dit'' ('so-called,' lit.'said') and was known as a ''nom-dit'' ('said-name'). (Compare with some [[Roman naming conventions]].) While this tradition is no longer in use, in many cases the ''nom-dit'' has come to replace the original family name. Thus the Bourbeau family has split into Bourbeau dit Verville, Bourbeau dit Lacourse, and Bourbeau dit Beauchesne. In many cases Verville, Lacourse, or Beauchesne has become the new family name. Likewise, the Rivard family has split into the Rivard dit Lavigne, Rivard dit Loranger and Rivard dit Lanoie. The origin of the ''nom-dit'' can vary. Often it denoted a geographical trait of the area where that branch of the family lived: Verville lived towards the city, Beauchesne lived near an oak tree, Larivi\u00e8re near a river, etc. Some of the oldest ''noms-dits'' are derived from the war name of a settler who served in the army or militia: Tranchemontagne ('mountain slasher'), Jolic\u0153ur ('braveheart'). Others denote a personal trait: Lacourse might have been a fast runner, Legrand was probably tall, etc. Similar in German it is with \"gennant\" \u2013 \"Vietinghoff genannt Scheel\"\n\n== Compound surnames ==\n\nWhile in many countries surnames are usually one word, in others a surname may contain two words ([[double surname]]) or more, as described below.\n\n=== Spanish compound surnames ===\n{{Main|Spanish naming customs}}\n{{Further|Double-barrelled name#Iberian tradition}}\n{{See also|#Spanish-speaking world}}\n\nIn traditional Spanish culture, and as is still the case in many Spanish-speaking countries, an individual does not have only a single surname. Instead an individual inherits the surnames of all of their ancestors, in particular their father and mother. In practice individuals mostly use only the two surnames of their parents. For instance, Spanish ex-premier [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] has [[Jos\u00e9]] [[Luis]] as his given name, [[Rodr\u00edguez (surname)|Rodr\u00edguez]], as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and [[Zapatero (surname)|Zapatero]] as his second (i.e. maternal) surname. But in reality an individual can be referred to by any number of his or her surnames as the occasion may require. For example, Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero could also be referred to as\n\n:Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero Garc\u00eda Valero Garc\u00eda Asensio\n\nAdditional surnames refer to grandmothers, great-grandmothers, and so forth. The number of surnames a person has is theoretically unlimited though it is rare to use more than a few (and indeed an individual may not know more than a few of his or her ancestors' names).\n\nThis custom is not seen in the Hispanic world as being a true compound surname system ''per se'', since it is widely understood that the first surname denotes one's father's family, and the second surname denotes one's mother's family. So \"Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero\" is not considered one surname; it is two distinct surnames. Given that it is not a true compound surname, his children do not inherit the \"compound\" surname \"Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero\". Only the paternal surname of both father and mother are passed on. The father's paternal surname becomes the child's own paternal surname, while the mother's paternal surname becomes the child's second surname (as the child's own maternal surname). Thus, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero would pass on only Rodr\u00edguez to his children as their first (i.e. paternal) surname.\n\nAn additional complication is introduced by marriage. Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero's wife was born Sonsoles Espinosa D\u00edaz. Under Spanish tradition she is still known by that name, even after marriage. But she may also be known as\n:Sonsoles Espinosa D\u00edaz de Rodr\u00edguez\n:Sonsoles Espinosa de Rodr\u00edguez\n:Sonsoles de Rodr\u00edguez\n\nThese other forms, particularly the last, are becoming less common{{when|date=June 2018}} as they are increasingly seen as sexist (i.e. that a wife is expected to take her husband's name but not the other way around).<ref>{{cite web |title=Proper married name? |website=Spanish Dict |date=9 January 2012 |url=http://www.spanishdict.com/answers/219019/proper-married-name}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Language and the Sexes |author=Frank, Francine; Anshen, Frank |year=1985 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-882-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_fvHy48GiIEC |page=18}}</ref> Additionally, in Spain and some other countries it is becoming more common, in law and in practice, to allow placing the mother's name before the father's in a child's surname rather than insisting that the privilege belongs exclusively to the father.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spain overhauls tradition of 'sexist' double-barrelled surnames |author=Govan, Fiona |website=The Local |date=1 June 2017 |url=https://www.thelocal.es/20170601/spain-overhauls-tradition-of-sexist-double-barrelled-surnames}}</ref>\n\n==== True compound surnames ====\nBeyond this seemingly \"compound\" surname system in the Hispanic world, there are also true compound surnames in the Spanish-speaking countries. These true compound surnames are passed on and inherited as compounds. For instance, former Chairman of the [[Military junta|Supreme Military Junta]] of [[Ecuador]], General [[Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o]] Estrella, has [[Luis]] as his first given name, [[Telmo]] as his middle name, the true compound surname [[Pazmi\u00f1o|Paz y Mi\u00f1o]] as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Estrella as his second (i.e. maternal) surname.\n\nLuis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o Estrella is also known more casually as Luis Paz y Mi\u00f1o, Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o, or Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o. He would never be regarded as Luis Estrella, Telmo Estrella, or Luis Telmo Estrella, nor as Luis Paz, Telmo Paz, or Luis Telmo Paz. This is because \"Paz\" alone is not his surname (although other people use the \"Paz\" surname on its own).\n\nIn this case, [[Pazmi\u00f1o|Paz y Mi\u00f1o]] is in fact the paternal surname, being a true compound surname. His children, therefore, would inherit the compound surname \"Paz y Mi\u00f1o\" as their paternal surname, while Estrella would be lost, since the mother's paternal surname becomes the children's second surname (as their own maternal surname). \"Paz\" alone would not be passed on, nor would \"Mi\u00f1o\" alone.\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, one might often informally see these true compound surnames hyphenated, for instance, as Paz-y-Mi\u00f1o. This is true especially in the [[English-speaking world]], but also sometimes even in the Hispanic world, since to many Hispanics unfamiliar with this and other compound surnames, \"Paz y Mi\u00f1o\" might be inadvertently mistaken as \"Paz\" for the paternal surname and \"Mi\u00f1o\" for the maternal surname. Although Mi\u00f1o did start off as the maternal surname in this compound surname, it was many generations ago, around five centuries, that it became compounded, and henceforth inherited and passed on as a compound.\n\nOther surnames which started off as compounds of two or more surnames, but which merged into one single word, also exist. An example would be the surname [[Pazmi\u00f1o]], whose members are related to the Paz y Mi\u00f1o, as both descend from the \"Paz Mi\u00f1o\" family of five centuries ago.\n\n[[\u00c1lava]], Spain is known for its incidence of true compound surnames, characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic (i.e. from the [[Castilian language]]) or more unusually a [[Basque language]] patronymic, followed by the [[preposition]] \"de\", with the second part of the surname being a local toponymic surname from \u00c1lava.\n\n=== English compound surnames ===\n{{Further|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}\nCompound surnames in English and several other European cultures feature two (or occasionally more) words, often joined by a [[hyphen]] or hyphens. However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example [[Iain Duncan Smith]], a former leader of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], whose surname is \"Duncan Smith\". A surname with the prefix \"Fitz\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, as in \"Fitz William\", as well as \"FitzWilliam\" or \"Fitzwilliam\". Like, for example, [[Robert FitzRoy]].\n\n=== Scottish and Irish compound surnames{{anchor|Celtic_compound_names}} ===\nIrish surnames are the oldest surnames in Europe. The common prefixes \"\u00d3\" and \"Mac\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, yielding \"\u00d3 Briain\" or \"Mac Millan\" as well as the anglicized \"O'Brien\" and \"MacMillan\" or \"Macmillan\".\n\n=== Chinese compound surnames ===\n{{main|Chinese compound surname}}\nSome [[Chinese surname]]s use more than one [[Chinese character|character]].\n\n== Culture and prevalence ==\n[[File:Power law surnames.jpg|thumb|450px|Rank and frequency of some US surnames]]\nIn the United States, 1,712 surnames cover 50% of the population, and about 1% of the population has the surname Smith,<ref>[https://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/dist.all.last Genealogy] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101012101346/http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/dist.all.last |date=12 October 2010 }}, U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division (1995).</ref> which is also the most frequent English name and an occupational name (\"metal worker\"), a contraction, for instance, of [[blacksmith]] or other [[metalsmith]]s. Several American surnames are a result of corruptions or phonetic misappropriations of European surnames, perhaps as a result of the registration process at the immigration entry points. Spellings and pronunciations of names remained fluid in the United States until the Social Security System enforced standardization.\n\nApproximately 70% of Canadians have surnames that are of English, Irish, French, or Scottish derivation.\n\nAccording to some estimates, 85% of China's population shares just 100 surnames. The names Wang (\u738b), Zhang (\u5f20) and Li (\u674e) are the most frequent.<ref>LaFraniere S.

''New York Times''. 20 April 2009.</ref>\n\n== Spanish-speaking world ==\n{{Main|Spanish naming customs|Naming customs of Hispanic America}}\n{{See also|#Spanish compound surnames}}\n\nIn [[Spain]] and in most [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]], the custom is for people to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from the father and the second from the mother, but it could be the other way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be the mother's first surname. For example, if Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Torres and Mar\u00eda Acosta G\u00f3mez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo Garc\u00eda Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.\n{{chart/start|align=center | summary=An example family tree}}\n{{chart| | | JGT |y| MAG | | |JGT=Jos\u00e9 '''{{font color|red|Garc\u00eda}} Torres'''|MAG=Mar\u00eda '''{{font color|blue|Acosta}} G\u00f3mez'''|}}\n{{chart| | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart| | | | |  PGA  | | | | | |PGA=Pablo '''{{font color|red|Garc\u00eda}} {{font color|blue|Acosta}}'''| }}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nIn some instances, when an individual's given name and first family name are too common (such as in [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] and [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]), both family names are used (though not necessarily both given names). A person could even take the maternal name for informal situations instead of the paternal name, for personal preferences or if the maternal name is somehow \"special\" (Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero is known in Spanish as \"Jos\u00e9 Luis Zapatero\" or just as \"Zapatero\"). In Spain, a new law approved in 1999 allows an adult to change the order of his/her family names, and parents can also change the order of their children's family names if they (and the child, if over 12) agree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Privado/rd193-2000.html |title=Real Decreto 193/2000, de 11 de febrero, de modificaci\u00f3n de determinados art\u00edculos del Reglamento del Registro Civil en materia relativa al nombre y apellidos y orden de los mismos. |accessdate=22 September 2008 |author=Juan Carlos R. |date=11 February 2000 |work=Base de Datos de Legislaci\u00f3n |publisher=Noticias Juridicas |language=Spanish }} ''Note: Google auto translation of title into English\u2192Royal Decree 193/2000, of 11 February, to amend certain articles of the Civil Registration Regulations in the field on the name and order.</ref>\n\nIn Spain, especially [[Catalonia]], the paternal and maternal surnames are often combined using the conjunction ''y'' (\"and\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or ''i'' (\"and\" in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), see for example the economist [[Xavier Sala-i-Martin]] or painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] i Dom\u00e8nech.\n\nIn Spain, a woman does not change her legal surnames when she marries. In some Spanish-speaking countries in [[Latin America]], a woman may, on her marriage, drop her mother's surname and add her husband's surname to her father's surname using the preposition ''de'' (\"of\"), ''del'' (\"of the\", when the following word is masculine) or ''de la'' (\"of the\", when the following word is feminine). For example, if \"Clara Reyes Alba\" were to marry \"Alberto G\u00f3mez Rodr\u00edguez\", the wife could use \"Clara Reyes ''de'' G\u00f3mez\" as her name (or \"Clara Reyes G\u00f3mez\", or, rarely, \"Clara G\u00f3mez Reyes\". She can be addressed as ''[[Mrs.|Sra]]. de G\u00f3mez'' corresponding to \"Mrs G\u00f3mez\"). In some countries, this form may be mainly social and not an official name change, i.e. her name would still legally be her birth name. This custom of adding the husband's surname is slowly fading.\n\nSometimes a father transmits his combined family names, thus creating a new one e.g., the paternal surname of the son of ''Javier'' (given name) ''Reyes'' (paternal family name) ''de la Barrera'' (maternal surname) may become the new paternal surname ''Reyes de la Barrera''. ''De'' is also the [[nobiliary particle]] used with Spanish surnames. This can not be chosen by the person, as it is part of the surname, for example \"Puente\" and \"Del Puente\" are not the same surname.\n\nChildren take the surnames of both parents, so if the couple above had two children named \"Andr\u00e9s\" and \"Ana\", then their names would be \"Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Reyes\" and \"Ana G\u00f3mez Reyes\". In [[Spain]], a 1995 reform in the law allows the parents to choose whether the father's or the mother's surname goes first, although this order must be the same for all their children. For instance, the name of the son of the couple in the example above could be either \"Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Reyes\" or \"Andr\u00e9s Reyes G\u00f3mez\".<ref>[http://noticias.juridicas.com/index.php?doc=http%3A//noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Privado/lrc.html ''Art. 55 Ley de Registro Civil'' \u2013 Civil Register Law] (article in Spanish)</ref> Sometimes, for single mothers or when the father would or could not recognize the child, the mother's surname has been used twice: for example, \"Ana Reyes Reyes\". In Spain, however, children with just one parent receive both surnames of that parent, although the order may also be changed. In 1973 in Chile, the law was changed to avoid stigmatizing illegitimate children with the maternal surname repeated.\n\nSome Hispanic people, after leaving their country, drop their maternal surname, even if not formally, so as to better fit into the non-Hispanic society they live or work in. Dropping the paternal surname is not unusual when it is a very common one. For instance, painter Pablo Ruiz [[Picasso]] and Spanish Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] are known by their maternal surnames as \"Picasso\" and \"Zapatero\". Similarly, Anglophones with just one surname may be asked to provide a second surname on official documents in Spanish-speaking countries. When none (such as the mother's maiden name) is provided, the last name may simply be repeated.\n\nTraditionally in most countries, and currently in some Spanish-speaking countries, women, upon marrying, keep their own family names. It is considered impolite towards her family for a woman to change her name. The higher class women of [[Cuba]] and Spain traditionally never change their names.  In certain rare situations, a woman may be addressed with her paternal surname followed by her husband's paternal surname linked with ''de''. For example, a woman named ''Ana Garc\u00eda D\u00edaz'', upon marrying ''Juan Guerrero Mac\u00edas'', could be called ''Ana Garc\u00eda de Guerrero''. This custom, begun in medieval times, is decaying and only has legal validity{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} in [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Peru]], [[Panama]], and to a certain extent in [[Mexico]] (where it is optional but becoming obsolete), but is frowned upon by people in Spain, Cuba, and elsewhere.  In Peru and the Dominican Republic, women normally conserve all family names after getting married. For example, if ''Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez'' marries ''Juan Mart\u00edn De la Cruz G\u00f3mez'', she will be called ''Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez de De la Cruz'', and if the husband dies, she will be called ''Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez Vda. de De la Cruz'' (Vda. being the abbreviation for ''viuda'', \"widow\" in Spanish).  The law in Peru changed some years ago, and all married women can keep their maiden last name if they wish with no alteration.\n\nIn some churches, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where the family structure is emphasized, as well as legal marriage, the wife is referred to as \"''hermana''\" [sister] plus the surname of her husband. And most records of the church follow that structure as well.\n\nA new trend in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American born English-speakers are not aware of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the individual for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban \u00c1lvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban \u00c1lvarez Cobos, would become Esteban \u00c1lvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.\n\nIn Spanish villages in Catalonia, [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and [[Asturias]] and in Cuba, people are often known by the name of their dwelling or collective family nickname rather than by their surnames. For example, Remei Pujol i Serra who lives at Ca l'Elvira would be referred to as \"Remei de Ca l'Elvira\"; and Adela Barreira L\u00f3pez who is part of the \"Provisores\" family would be known as \"Adela dos Provisores\". In the case of [[Cantabria]] the family's nickname is used instead of the surname: if one family is known as \"\u00d1ecos\" because of an ancestor who was known as \"\u00d1ecu\", they would be \"Jos\u00e9 el de \u00d1ecu\" or \"Ana la de \u00d1ecu\" (collective: the \u00d1eco's). Some common nicknames are \"Rubiu\" (blonde or ginger hair), \"Roju\" (reddish, as referred to ginger hair), \"Chiqui\" (small), \"Jinchu\" (big), and a bunch of names about certain characteristics, family relationship or geographical origin (pasiegu, masoniegu, sobanu, llebaniegu, tresmeranu, pejinu, naveru, merachu, tresneru, troule, mallavia, marotias, llamoso, lipa, \u00f1ecu, tarugu, trapajeru, lich\u00f3n, andar\u00edvel).\n\n{{See also|Surnames by country#The Philippines}}\n\n== Portuguese-speaking countries ==\n{{Main|Portuguese name}}\n\nIn the case of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] naming customs, the main surname (the one used in alphasorting, indexing, abbreviations, and greetings), appears last.\n\nEach person usually has two family names: though the law specifies no order, the first one is usually the maternal family name, whereas the last one is commonly the paternal family name. In Portugal, a person's full name has a minimum legal length of two names (one given name and one family name from either parent) and a maximum of six names (two first names and four surnames \u2013 he or she may have up to four surnames in any order desired picked up from the total of his/her parents and grandparents' surnames). The use of any surname outside this lot, or of more than six names, is legally possible, but it requires dealing with bureaucracy. Parents or the person him/herself must explain the claims they have to bearing that surname (a family nickname, a rare surname lost in past generations, or any other reason one may find suitable). In Brazil there is no limit of surnames used.\n\nIn general, the traditions followed in countries like [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]] and [[Angola]] are somewhat different from the ones in Spain. In the Spanish tradition, usually the father's surname comes first, followed by the mother's surname, whereas in Portuguese-speaking countries the father's name is the last, mother's coming first.  A woman may adopt her husband's surname(s), but nevertheless she usually keeps her birth names, or at least the last one. Since 1977, a husband can also adopt his wife's surname. When this happens, usually both spouses change their name after marriage.\n\nThe custom of a woman changing her name upon marriage is recent. It spread in the late 19th century in the upper classes, under French influence, and in the 20th century, particularly during the 1930s and 1940, it became socially almost obligatory. Nowadays, fewer women adopt, even officially, their husbands' names, and among those who do so officially, it is quite common not to use it either in their professional or informal life.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe children usually bear only the last surnames of the parents (i.e., the paternal surname of each of their parents). For example, ''Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves'' and ''Ana Lu\u00edsa de Albuquerque Pereira (Gon\u00e7alves)'' (in case she adopted her husband's name after marriage) would have a child named ''Lucas Pereira Gon\u00e7alves''. However, the child may have any other combination of the parents' surnames, according to [[euphony]], social significance or other reasons. For example, is not uncommon for the first born male to be given the father's full name followed by \"J\u00fanior\" or \"Filho\" (son), and the next generation's first born male to be given the grandfather's name followed by \"Neto\" (grandson). Hence ''Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves'' might choose to name his first born son ''Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves J\u00fanior'', who in turn might name his first born son ''Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves Neto'', in which case none of the mother's family names are passed on.\n\n{{chart/start|align=center | summary=An example family tree}}\n{{chart| | | CSG |e| ALAP | | |CSG=Carlos '''da Silva {{font color|red|Gon\u00e7alves}}'''|ALAP=Ana Lu\u00edsa '''de Albuquerque {{font color|blue|Pereira}}'''|}}\n{{chart| | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart| | | | |  LPG  | | | | | |LPG=Lucas '''{{font color|blue|Pereira}} {{font color|red|Gon\u00e7alves}}'''| }}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nIn ancient times a patronymic was commonly used \u2013 surnames like ''Gon\u00e7alves'' (\"son of ''Gon\u00e7alo''\"), ''Fernandes'' (\"son of ''Fernando''\"), ''Nunes'' (\"son of ''Nuno''\"), ''Soares'' (\"son of ''Soeiro''\"), ''Sanches'' (\"son of ''Sancho''\"), ''Henriques'' (\"son of ''Henrique''\"), ''Rodrigues'' (\"son of ''Rodrigo''\") which along with many others are still in regular use as very prevalent family names.\n\nIn Medieval times, Portuguese nobility started to use one of their estates' names or the name of the town or village they ruled as their surname, just after their patronymic. [[Soeiro Mendes da Maia]] bore a name \"Soeiro\", a patronymic \"Mendes\" (\"son of Hermenegildo \u2013 shortened to Mendo\") and the name of the town he ruled \"[[Maia, Porto, Portugal|Maia]]\". He was often referred to in 12th-century documents as \"Soeiro Mendes, senhor da Maia\", Soeiro Mendes, lord of Maia. Noblewomen also bore patronymics and surnames in the same manner and never bore their husband's surname. First-born males bore their father's surname, other children bore either both or only one of them at their will.\n\nOnly during the Early Modern Age, lower-class males started to use at least one surname; married lower-class women usually took up their spouse's surname, since they rarely ever used one beforehand. After the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], Portuguese authorities realized the benefits of enforcing the use and registry of surnames. Henceforth, they became mandatory, although the rules for their use were very liberal.\n\nUntil the end of the 19th century it was common for women, especially those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only by their first names. A woman would then adopt her husband's full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames.\nDuring the mid-20th century, under French influence and among upper classes, women started to take up their husbands' surname(s). From the 1960s onwards, this usage spread to the common people, again under French influence, this time, however, due to the forceful legal adoption of their husbands' surname which was imposed onto Portuguese immigrant women in France.\n\nFrom the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] onwards the adoption of their husbands' surname(s) receded again, and today both the adoption and non-adoption occur, with non-adoption being chosen in the majority of cases in recent years (60%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lifestyle.publico.pt/artigos/341672_identidade-submissao-ou-amor-o-que-significa-adoptar-o-apelido-do-marido |title=Identidade, submiss\u00e3o ou amor?

Some surnames are connected to [[East Syriac Rite]] [[Christianity]], the religion Assyrians currently follow and have followed since the 1st century AD, with others being of distinctly ancient Assyrian/Mesopotamian origin.\n\nCommon surnames include: ''Aboona'', ''Abraham'', ''Abro'', ''Agajan'', ''Agassi'', ''Aghase'', ''Akkad'', ''Akbalit/Akbalut'',  ''Alamasha'', ''Alawerdy'', ''Aldawid'', ''Amo Baba'', ''Amu'', ''Antar'', ''Aprim'', ''Apshu'',  ''Afarcan'', ''Arad'', ''Ashai'', ''Ashouri'', ''Ashurian'', ''Ashur'', ''Awdishu'', ''Awikam'',  ''Awishalim'', ''Awitor'', ''Awia'', ''Awrohum'',  ''Aziz'', ''Azzo'', ''Baba'', ''Bacchus'', ''Badel'', ''Barkha/Barkho'', ''Brikha'',  ''Bronit'',  ''Balou'', ''Barkoo'', ''Benassi'', ''Benyamin'', ''Bidavid'', ''Bidawid'', ''Bishu'', ''Cabani'', ''Dadashu/Dadasho'',  ''Darmu'',  ''Dinkha'', ''Daoud'', ''Dayan/Daian'',  ''Disho'', ''Duman'', ''Elia'', ''Elias'', ''Enwia'', ''Eshai'', ''Farhad'', ''Gorges/Georgis'', ''Gewargis'', ''Hadad/Adad'', ''Hamsho'',  ''Hasso'', ''Harshu'', ''Hormis'', ''Hosanna'', ''Hurmis'', ''Ilshu'', ''Ilishu'', ''Ishmael'', ''Ishai'',  ''Isaac'', ''Ishaq'', ''Iskhaq'', ''Iwassi'', ''Jabri'', ''Jelu'', ''Jendo'', ''Juna'', ''Kambar'',  ''Karam'', ''Karoukian'', ''Kasri'',  ''Khamo'', ''Khanbaba'', ''Khanisho/Khnanisu'', ''Khnaninia'',  ''Khedroo'', ''Khoshanu'', ''Khoshaba'', ''Malech'', ''Malek'', ''Malka'', ''Malkai'', ''Malick'', ''Mamendo'', ''Matti'', ''Merza'', ''Mikhael/Mikhail'', ''Mnashi'', ''Nisan'', ''Nimrod'', ''Narsai'', ''Ninweh'', ''Nineveh'', ''Nessar'',  ''Odah'', ''Odisha'', ''Odisho'', ''Oraham'', ''Oshana'', ''Qateneh'', ''Raaba'',  ''Rabi'', ''Rafael'', ''Ramsin/Rumsin'', ''Rassam'', ''Rifkha'',  ''Ronay'', ''Samo'', ''Sargis'', ''Sargon'', ''Sarkis'', ''Sarmas'', ''Sayad'', ''Semma'', ''Shabad'', ''Shamash/Shamasha'', ''Shamshi'', ''Sinharib'', ''Sharrukin'', ''Shimun'', ''Shamoon'', ''Shimon'', ''Shimonaya'', ''Shinu'', ''Shinai'', ''Sleman'', ''Shulman'', ''Sliwoo/Sliwa'', ''Tematheus'', ''Thoma'', ''Thomaya'', ''Tamraz'', ''Tiras'', ''Tiyareh/Tyareh'', ''Urshan'', ''Warda'', ''Warad'', ''Yacoub'', ''Yawalaha'', ''Yalda'', ''Yatrin'', ''Yetron'',  ''Yelu'', ''Yoel'', ''Yohannan'', ''Yonan'', ''Yonadam'', ''Yoseph'', ''Yoshu'',  ''Youkhana'', ''Younan'', ''Yousif'', ''Yukhannan'', ''Zakharia'', ''Zilkha'',  ''Zimri''.\n\n=== Circassians ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nIn the case of [[Circassians]], especially [[Adyges]] and [[Kabardians]], hereditary surnames have been borne by people for many years.\n\nMost surnames of Adyge origin fall into six types:\n* Occupations (e.g., 'smith', 'hunter', 'tailor')\n* Personal characteristics (e.g., 'short', 'deaf', 'beautiful')\n* Geographical features (e.g., 'hill', 'river', 'cave', 'wood', 'fields')\n* Animal names (e.g., 'bear', 'horse', 'snake', 'fox', 'wild boar')\n* Patronymics and ancestry, often from a male's given name ('son of...') or from an ethnic name (e.g., ''Shapsug'', ''Kabardey'')\n* Religious names (e.g., ''Shogen'' 'Priest', ''Yefendi'' 'Efendi', ''Mole'' 'Mullah')\n\n''Shogen'' comes from the Christian era, and ''Yefendi'' and ''Mole'' come from the Muslim era.\n\nCircassian women, even when they marry, do not change their surnames. By keeping their surnames and passing it on to the next generation, children come to distinguish relatives from the maternal side and respect her family as well as those from their father's side.\n\nOn the other hand, children cannot marry someone who bears the same surname as they do, no matter how distantly related.\n\nIn the Circassian tradition, the formula for surnames is patterned to mean \"daughter of ...\"\n\nAbkhaz families follow similar naming patterns reflecting the common roots of the Abkhazian, Adygean and Wubikh peoples.\n\nCircassian family names cannot be derived from women's names or from the name of female ancestors.\n\n=== Jewish ===\n{{Main|Jewish name}}\n\n[[Jewish]] names have historically varied, encompassing throughout the centuries several different traditions. The most usual last name for those of the [[Kohanim|priest tribe]] is \"Cohen\"/\"Kahen\"/\"Kogan\"/\"Kohen\"/\"Katz\" (a Hebrew [[acronym]] of Kohen Tzedek, or righteous Kohen) and for those of the [[Levite]]s, \"Levi\"/\"Levine\". Those who came from Central or Eastern Europe usually have \"Rosen\"(\"rose\"), \"Spiel\", \"Gold\", and other German words as their names' prefixes, and \"man\", \"wyn\"/\"wein\"(\"wine\"), \"berg\"(\"mountain\"), and other German words as their names' suffixes. Many [[Sephardic Jew]]s adopted [[Spain|Spanish]] or [[Arabic]] names, like \"Toledo\", \"Bejarano\", \"Azizi\" (\"you're [someones] love\"), \"[[Hassan (surname)|Hassan]]\" or added words to their original names, like Beizaee( \"Iza\", God is perfection),  \"Kohenzadeh\" (\"[she] bore a Kohen\"){{clarify|date=September 2018|reason=I don't see how the examples support the claim}}. Names like \"Johnson\" and \"Peterson\" may be used in Jewish tradition{{clarify|date=September 2018|reason=it's a factual question. Are they used or not? and does this refer to the English form or to Hebrew forms as in the following sentence?}} as they too used the father's name as identification. So \"Johnson\" in Hebrew is \"Ben Yochanon\", meaning \"Yochanon (John)'s son\".\nAnother common group of Jewish surnames is [[Toponymic surname|toponymic]]s, for example \"San'ani\" (from [[Sana'a]] in Yemen), \"Varshavski\" (from [[Warsaw]] in Poland), \"Yerushalmi\" (from [[Jerusalem]]).\n\nJews who immigrated to [[Israel]] or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] often changed their surnames to [[Hebrew]] ones, a process described under [[Hebraization of surnames]].\n\n=== Kurdish ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nThe majority of Kurds do not hold Kurdish names because the names have been banned in the countries they primarily live in (namely Iran, Turkey and Syria). Kurds in these respective countries tend to hold Turkish, Persian or Arabic names, in the majority of cases, forcefully appointed by the ruling governments.<ref>{{cite speech |title=(Requests to Syrian government regarding restoration of rights to Kurds residing in Syria) |first=Jian |last=Badrakhan |date=August 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2008 |location=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (Session 58), Working Group on Minorities (Session 12) |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/minorities/docs/12/YASA_Kurdish_Centre_for_Legal_Studies_Consultancy.doc}}</ref> Others hold Arabic names as a result of the influence of Islam and Arab culture.\n\nKurds holding authentic Kurdish names are generally found in Diaspora or in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] where Kurds are relatively free. Traditionally, Kurdish family names are inherited from the tribes of which the individual or families are members. However, some families inherit the names of the regions they are from.\n\nCommon affixes of authentic Kurdish names are \"-\u00ee\" and \"-za\" also \"-a\" and \"-\u00ea\" by two surnames.<br />\ne.g.:<br />\n'''Name+1Surname+2Surname'''<br />\n''Male:''\n* Baran(\u00ea) Mem\u00ea Alan\nBaran of Mem of Alan\n\n''Female:''\n* Berf\u00een(a) Soreya Ev\u00een\u00ea\nBerfin of Sarah of Evin\n<br />\nthere are also names with the word \"Mal(a)\" [House (of)]\ne.g.:\n* Baran mala Alan\nBaran of House of Alan\n* Berf\u00een mala Ev\u00een\nBerfin of House of Evin\n\nSome common Kurdish last names, which are also the names of their respective tribes, include Baradost, Barzani, Berwari, Berzinji, Chelki, Diri, Doski, Jaf, Mutki, Rami, Rekani, Rozaki, Sindi, and Tovi/Tuvi. Other names include Akreyi, Alan, Amedi, Botani, Hewrami, Mukri, Serhati and Zibari.\n\nTraditionally, Kurdish women did not inherit a man's last name. Although still not in practice by many Kurds, this can be more commonly found today.\n\n=== Tibet ===\n\nTibetan people are often named at birth by the local Buddhist Lama or they may request a name from the Dalai Lama. The majority do not have family names.  They may change their name throughout life if advised by a Buddhist Lama, for example if a different name removes obstacles. Tibetans who enter monastic life take a name from their ordination Lama, which will be a combination of the Lama's name and a new name for them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tibettravel.org/tibetan-people/tibetan-names.html |title=Tibetan Names |website=Tibet Travel and Tours \u2013 Tibet Vista |language=en |access-date=9 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Rajputs ===\n{{Main|Rajputs}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nRajputs are an ethnic group in India, spread all over the country and have a rich cultural identity.\n\nThe common surnames include: ''Singh'', ''Chauhan'', ''Rajput'', ''Sinha (or Singha)'', ''Rathore'', ''Tomar'', ''Parmar'', ''kushwah'', ''bhadoriya''  etc.\n\n<!-- this section is under construction ... please don't revert or delete!\nconstructive edits are appreciable -->\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Genealogy]]\n* [[Generation name]]\n* [[Given name]]\n* [[Legal name]]\n* [[List of family name affixes]]\n* [[Lists of most common surnames]]\n* [[Maiden and married names]]\n* [[Matriname]]\n* [[Name blending]]\n* [[Name change]]\n* [[Nobiliary particle]]\n* [[One-name study]]\n* [[Patronymic surname]]\n* [[Personal name]]\n* [[Skin name]]\n* [[Galton\u2013Watson process|Surname extinction]]\n* [[Surname map]]\n* [[Surname law]]\n* [[Surnames by country]]\n* [[Naming law]]\n* [[T\u2013V distinction]]\n* [[Tussenvoegsel]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n; Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bowman, William Dodgson.

In many parts of Asia, as well as some parts of Europe and Africa, the family name is placed before a person's given name. In most [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking]] and [[Lusophone|Portuguese-speaking]] countries, two surnames are commonly used and in some families even three or more are used (often due to a family claim to nobility).\n\nSurnames have not always existed and today are not universal in all cultures. This tradition has arisen separately in different cultures around the world. In Europe, the concept of surnames became popular in the [[Roman Empire]] and expanded throughout the Mediterranean and Western Europe as a result. During the Middle Ages this practice died out as Germanic, Persian, and other influences took hold. During the late Middle Ages surnames gradually re-emerged, first in the form of [[Epithet#Usage_prior_to_surnames|bynames]] (typically indicating individual's occupation or area of residence), which gradually evolved into modern surnames. In China surnames have been the norm since at least the 2nd century BC.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The complex origins of Chinese names demystified |date=18 November 2016 |author=Koon, Wee Kek |magazine=Post Magazine |url=http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2046955/complex-origins-chinese-names-demystified}}</ref>\n\nA family name is typically a part of a person's [[personal name]] which, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from one or both of their parents' family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, with each culture having its own rules as to how these names are formed, passed and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is [[#History|far from universal]]. In many cultures, it is common for people to have one name or [[mononym]], with some cultures not using family names. In most [[Slavic countries]], as well as other countries including [[Greece]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Latvia]], for example, there are different family name forms for male and female members of the family. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a new-born child, on the adoption of a common family name on marriage, on renouncing of a family name and on changing of a family name.\n\n[[Surname law]]s vary around the world. Traditionally in many [[Europe]]an countries for the past few hundred years, it was the custom or law that a woman would on marriage use the surname of her husband and that children of a man would have the father's surname. If a child's paternity was not known, or if the [[putative father]] denied paternity, the new-born child would have the surname of the mother. That is still the custom or law in many countries. The surname for children of married parents is usually inherited from the father.<ref>Kelly, 99 W Va L Rev at 10; see id. at 10 n 25 (The custom of taking the father's surname assumes that the child is born to parents in a \"state-sanctioned marriage.\" The custom is different for children born to unmarried parents.). Cited in [http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/docs/A127262.htm#N_15_ Doherty v. Wizner, Oregon Court of Appeals] (2005)</ref> In recent years there has been a trend towards equality of treatment in relation to family names, with women being not automatically required or expected, or in some places even forbidden, to take the husband's surname on marriage, and children not automatically being given the father's surname. In this article, family name and surname both mean the [[patrilineal]] surname, handed down from or inherited from the father's, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, the term \"maternal surname\" means the ''patrilineal'' surname which one's mother inherited from either or both of her parents. For a discussion of ''[[matrilineal]]'' ('mother-line') surnames, passing from mothers to daughters, see [[matrilineal surname]].\n\nIt is common for women in the entertainment industry (like [[Celebrity|celebrities]]) to keep their [[maiden name]] after they get married, especially if they achieved their fame before marriage. The same can be said for women who achieved their fame during a previous marriage; For example: [[Kris Jenner]] (born Kris Houghton) was married to her second spouse [[Caitlyn Jenner|Bruce Jenner]] (now Caitlyn) when she rose to prominence in the reality show ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'' and singer [[Britney Spears]] has been married twice after she rose to prominence, but she still uses her maiden name.\n\nIn [[Anglosphere|English-speaking cultures]], family names are often used by children when referring to adults but are also used to refer to someone in authority, the elderly, or in a formal setting, and are often used with a [[title]] or [[honorific]] such as [[Mr.]], [[Mrs.]], [[Ms.]], [[Miss]], [[Doctor (title)|Doctor]], and so on. Generally the [[given name]] is the one used by friends, family, and other intimates to address an individual. It may also be used by someone who is in some way senior to the person being addressed. This practice also differs between cultures; see [[T\u2013V distinction]].\n\nThe study of proper names (in family names, personal names, or places) is called [[onomastics]]. A [[one-name study]] is a collection of vital and other biographical data about all persons worldwide sharing a particular surname.\n\n== Order of names ==\n{{Further|Personal name#Name order}}\nIn many cultures (particularly in [[Culture of Europe|European]] and European-influenced cultures in the Americas, Oceania, etc., as well as the Middle East, South Asia, and most African cultures), the surname or family name (\"last name\") is placed after the personal, [[Given name|forename]] (in Europe) or given name (\"first name\"). In other cultures the surname is placed first, followed by the given name or names. The latter is often called the [[Name order|Eastern naming order]] because Europeans are most familiar with the examples from the [[East Asian cultural sphere]], specifically, [[Chinese name|Greater China]], [[Korean name|Korea (Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea)]], [[Japanese name|Japan]], and [[Vietnamese name|Vietnam]]. This is also the case in [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], parts of [[South India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Madagascar]]. But there are parts of Europe that also follow the Eastern Order, such as [[Hungary]], [[Bavaria]], [[Austria]], [[Albanian name|Albania, Kosovo]], and [[Romania]].\n\nSince family names are normally written last in European societies, the terms last name or surname are commonly used for the family name, while in Japan (with vertical writing) the family name may be referred to as upper name ({{Nihongo||\u4e0a\u306e\u540d\u524d|ue-no-namae}}).\n\nWhen people from areas using Eastern naming order write their personal name in the [[Latin alphabet]], it is common to reverse the order of the given and family names for the convenience of Westerners, so that they know which name is the family name for official/formal purposes. Reversing the order of names for the same reason is also [[Norm (social)|customary]] for the [[Baltic Finns|Baltic Fennic peoples]] and the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]], but other [[Uralic languages|Uralic peoples]] traditionally did not have surnames, perhaps because of the [[clan]] structure of their societies. The [[Samis]] saw no change or a transformation of their name. For example: some Sire became Siri,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://snl.no/Aslak_Jacobsen_H%C3%A6tta |title=Guttorm |publisher=Snl.no |date= 29 May 2017|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref> H\u00e6tta J\u00e1hko\u0161 \u00c1sslat became [[Aslak H\u00e6tta|Aslak Jacobsen H\u00e6tta]] \u2014 as was the [[Convention (norm)|norm]]. Recently, integration into the [[European Union|EU]] and increased communications with foreigners prompted many Samis to reverse the order of their full name to given name followed by surname, to avoid their given name being mistaken for and used as a surname.\n\nIndian surnames may often denote [[caste]], profession, and village and are invariably mentioned along with the personal names. However, hereditary last names are not universal. In Indian passports the surname is shown first. In telephone directories the surname is used for [[collation]]. In North Indian states the surname is placed after given names where it exists. In parts of south India, surname is placed before personal name and in most cases it is only shown as an initial (for example 'S.' for Suryapeth).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn English and other languages like Spanish\u2014although the usual order of names is \"first middle last\"\u2014for the purpose of cataloging in libraries and in citing the names of authors in scholarly papers, the order is changed to \"last, first middle,\" with the last and first names separated by a comma, and items are alphabetized by the last name.<ref>[http://www.ala.org/tools/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet27 \"Filing Rules\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121153423/http://www.ala.org/tools/libfactsheets/alalibraryfactsheet27 |date=21 January 2013 }} on the [[American Library Association]] website</ref><ref>[http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/747/05/ \"MLA Works Cited Page: Basic Format\"] on the [[Purdue Online Writing Lab]] website, [[Purdue University]]</ref> In [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Belgium]] and [[Latin America]], administrative usage is to put the surname before the first on official documents.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Name change}}\nWhile the use of given names to identify individuals is attested in the oldest historical records, the advent of surnames is a relatively recent{{when|date=February 2018}} phenomenon.<ref name=\"Doll1992\">{{Cite news |last=Doll |first=Cynthia Blevins |year=1992 |title=Harmonizing Filial and Parental Rights in Names: Progress, Pitfalls, and Constitutional Problems |periodical=Howard Law Journal |publisher=Howard University School of Law |volume=35 |page=227 |issn=0018-6813}} ''Note: content available by subscription only.

For example, [[Alexander the Great]] was known as [[Heracleidae|''Heracleides'']], as a supposed descendant of [[Heracles]], and by the dynastic name [[Caranus of Macedon|''Karanos''/''Caranus'']], which referred to the founder of the [[Argead dynasty|dynasty to which he belonged]]. In none of these cases, though, were these names considered essential parts of the person's name, nor were they explicitly inherited in the manner that is common in many cultures today.\n\nIn the Roman Empire, the bestowal and use of clan and family names waxed and waned with changes in the various subcultures of the realm. (''See [[Roman naming conventions]].'') The nomen, which was the gens name, was inherited much like last names are, but their purposes were quite different{{how|date=February 2018}}. In later{{when|date=February 2018}} Europe, last names were developed to distinguish between individuals. The nomen were to identify group kinship. The praenomen was the \"forename\" and was originally used like a first name today. In later times{{when|date=February 2018}}, praenomen became less useful for distinguishing individuals as it was often passed down for males along with the nomen (like an entire culture where \"John Smith, Jr.\" was the norm), and females, were often given no praenomen at all or functional names like Major and Minor (\"Older\" and \"Younger\") or Maxima, Maio, and Mino (\"Biggest,\" \"Middle,\" \"Littlest\") or ordinal numbers rather than what we might think of as names: Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, etc. Around this time,{{when|date=February 2018}} the nomen became followed by one or more additional names called cognomen. It became usual that one of these cognomen was inherited, but as the praenomen and nomen became more rigidly used and less useful for identifying individuals, additional personal cognomen were more often used, to the point that the first the praenomen and then the nomen fell out of use entirely.{{when|date=February 2018}} With the gradual influence of Greek and Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes put in front of traditional cognomen, but eventually, people reverted to single names.<ref name=\"Chavez2006\">{{cite web |url=http://heraldry.sca.org/laurel/names/byzantine/introduction.html |title=Personal Names of the Aristocracy in the Roman Empire During the Later Byzantine Era |accessdate=21 September 2008 |last=Chavez |first=Berret |date=9 November 2006 |work=Official Web Page of the Laurel Sovereign of Arms for the Society for Creative Anachronism |publisher=Society for Creative Anachronism}}</ref> By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. In Western Europe, where Germanic culture dominated the aristocracy, family names were almost non-existent.

Ireland was the first country in Europe to use fixed surnames{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}. As noted in the Annals, the first recorded fixed{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} surname was \u00d3 Cleirigh, which recorded the death of Tigherneach Ua Cleirigh, lord of Aidhne in Galway in the year 916.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Origins of Irish Surnames |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/magazine/surname/index.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409124022/http://www.irishtimes.com/ancestor/magazine/surname/index.htm |archivedate=9 April 2016 |work=The Irish Times}}</ref>\n\nIn England, the introduction of family names is generally attributed to the preparation of the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} following the [[Norman conquest]]. Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by affixing 'de' (of) before the name of their village in France. This is what is known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. In medieval times in France, such a name indicated lordship, or ownership, of the village. Some early Norman nobles in England chose{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} to drop the French derivations and call themselves instead after their new English holdings.\n\nSurnames were uncommon prior to the 12th century, and still somewhat rare into the 13th; most European surnames were originally occupational or locational, and served to distinguish one person from another if they happened to live near one another (e.g., two different people named John could conceivably be identified as 'John Butcher' and 'John Chandler'). This still happens, in some communities where a surname is particularly common.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, when a man from a lower-status family married an only daughter from a higher-status family, he would often adopt the wife's family name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} In the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, bequests were sometimes made contingent upon a man's changing (or hyphenating) his family name, so that the name of the [[testator]] continued. It is rare but not unknown for an English-speaking man to take his wife's family name, whether for personal reasons or as a matter of tradition (such as among [[matrilineal]] [[First Nations|Canadian aboriginal]] groups, such as the [[Haida people|Haida]] and [[Gitxsan]]); it is exceedingly rare but does occur in the United States, where a married couple may choose an entirely new last name by going through a legal change of name. As an alternative, both spouses may adopt a [[double-barrelled name]]. For instance, when John Smith and Mary Jones marry each other, they may become known as \"John Smith-Jones\" and \"Mary Smith-Jones\". A spouse may also opt to use their birth name as a middle name.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} An additional option, although rarely practiced{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, is the adoption of a last name derived from a blend of the prior names, such as \"Simones\", which also requires a legal name change.  Some couples keep their own last names but give their children hyphenated or combined surnames.<ref>Daniella Miletic (20 July 2012) [http://m.theage.com.au/victoria/most-women-say-i-do-to-husbands-name-20120719-22d5c.html Most women say 'I do' to husband's name]. The Age.</ref>\n\nIn medieval [[Spain]], a patronymic system was used. For example, \u00c1lvaro, the son of Rodrigo would be named \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez.  His son, Juan, would not be named Juan Rodr\u00edguez, but Juan \u00c1lvarez. Over time, many of these patronymics became family names and are some of the most common names in the Spanish-speaking world. Other sources of surnames are personal appearance or habit, e.g. Delgado (\"thin\") and Moreno (\"dark\"); occupations, e.g. Molinero (\"miller\"), Zapatero (\"shoe-maker\") and Guerrero (\"warrior\"); and geographic location or ethnicity, e.g. Alem\u00e1n (\"German\").\n\n=== Modern era ===\nDuring the modern era, many cultures around the world adopted family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the age of European expansion and particularly since 1600. Notable examples include the Netherlands (1795\u20131811), Japan (1870s), Thailand (1920), and Turkey (1934). Nonetheless, their use is not universal: Icelanders, Burmese, Javanese, and many people groups in East Africa do not use family names.\n\nFamily names sometimes change or are replaced by non-family-name surnames under political pressure to avoid persecution.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Examples are the cases with [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Chinese Indonesians]] and [[Chinese Thai surname|Chinese Thais]] after migration there during the 20th century, or the [[Jew]]s who fled to different European countries to avoid persecution from the Nazis during World War II.\n\nThe United States followed the naming customs and practices of English common law and traditions until recent{{when|date=February 2018}} times. Beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, traditional naming practices, writes one commentator, were recognized as \"com[ing] into conflict with current sensitivities about children's and women's rights\".<ref>Richard H. Thornton, ''The Controversy Over Children's Surnames: Familial Autonomy, Equal Protection and the Child's Best Interests'', 1979 Utah L Rev 303.</ref> Those changes accelerated a shift away from the interests of the parents to a focus on the best interests of the child.

With a few exceptions, Europe's languages are [[cognate]], so most European surnames have a common [[etymological]] origin. Some surnames are monogenetic (derived from one family at a specific place and time); others are polygenetic (coined independently at different places and times).<ref name=\"hanks\" />\n\n=== Classification of European Surnames ===\n[[Basil Cottle]] classifies European surnames under four broad categories, depending on their origin: given name (patronymics), occupational name, local name (toponymics), and nickname.<ref name=\"cottle\">Cottle, Basil. ''Penguin Dictionary of Surnames''. Baltimore, MD: Penguin Books, 1967. No ISBN.</ref> This classification can be extended to surnames originating elsewhere.

Multiple surnames may be derived from a single given name: e.g. there are thought to be over 90 Italian surnames based on the given name \"[[Giovanni (name)|Giovanni]]\".<ref name=\"hanks\">[[Patrick Hanks|Hanks, Patrick]] and Hodges, Flavia.

Oxford University Press, 1989. {{ISBN|0-19-211592-8}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Icelandic Patronyms.svg|thumb|250px|A family tree showing the Icelandic patronymic naming system.]]\nThe Icelandic system, formerly used in much of Scandinavia, does not use family names. A person's last name indicates the first name of their father ([[patronymic]]) or in some cases mother ([[matronymic]]). Many common family names in other Scandinavian countries are a result of this naming practice, such as [[Hansen (surname)|Hansen]] (son of [[Hans (name)|Hans]]), [[Johansen]] (son of [[Johan (given name)|Johan]]) and [[Olsen (surname)|Olsen]] (son of [[Ole (name)|Ole]]/Ola), the three most common surnames in [[Norway]].<ref>Statistics Norway [http://www.ssb.no/english/subjects/00/navn_en/ name statistics, 2009]</ref> This also occurs in other cultures: Spanish and Portuguese (L\u00f3pez or Lopes, son of Lope; \u00c1lvarez or \u00c1lvares, son of \u00c1lvaro; Dom\u00ednguez or Domingues, son of Domingo or Domingos; etc.); Armenian (Gregoryan, son of Gregor; Petrossyan, son of Petros; etc.); in English (Johnson, son of John; Richardson, son of Richard), etc.\n\nPatronymic name conventions are similar in some other nations, including Malaysia (see [[Malaysian name]]) and other Muslim countries, among most people of the Indian states of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] (unlike another Indian state [[Andhra Pradesh]], where ancestral origin village names have become surnames for the people), in [[Mongolian name|Mongolia]] and in the [[Scottish Gaelic personal naming system]]. In [[Russian name|Russia]] and [[Bulgarian name|Bulgaria]], both patronymic and family name are obligatory parts of one's full name: e.g. if a Russian is called Ivan Andreyevich Sergeyev, that means that his father's name is Andrey and his family name is Sergeyev. A similar system is used in [[Greek names|Greece]].\n\nIn [[Habesha name|Ethiopia and Eritrea]], a child adopts the given name of one of their parents, usually the father, as a pseudo-surname. For example, Abraham Mesfin's father's first name would have been Mesfin, while Abraham Mesfin's child might be called \"Netsanet Abraham\". Just as in Iceland, referring to Abraham Mesfin as \"Mr Mesfin\" would be erroneous: the correct term would be \"Mr Abraham\". Very rarely do children adopt their mother's given name, who in any case would retain their \"pseudo-surname\".\n\nIn traditional [[Patronymic#Jewish usage|Hebrew patronymic names]], a male's given name is followed by ''ben'' ({{lang-he|\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df}}, ''son of''), and the father's name, e.g. [[Ben Adam]] ({{lang-he|\u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd}}) or [[Abraham ben Abraham]]. A woman's given name is similarly followed by ''bath'', \"daughter of\" (also transcribed as ''bat''), as in \"Elishevah bath Shemuel,\" where Elishevah's father's given name is Shemuel. ''Ben'' also forms part of [[Hebrew name]]s, e.g. [[Benjamin]]. \nSome modern Israeli last names are formed by using the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] version of ''ben'', [[Bar (Aramaic)#Aramaic|Bar-]], e.g. [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]. In Israel, traditional patronymic forms have become European-style patrilineal surnames. For example, Yoram ben Yehudah or Hannah Bar-Ilan may not be literally the son and daughter of Yehudah and Ilan, but rather the male and female descendants of men called, respectively, ben Yehudah and Bar-Ilan.\n\n* '''[[Patronymic]]s, [[matronymic]]s or ancestral''', often from a person's given name. e.g., from male name: ''[[Richardson (surname)|Richardson]]'', ''[[Stephenson]]'', ''[[Jones (surname)|Jones]]'' (Welsh for John), ''[[Williams (surname)|Williams]]'', ''[[Jackson (name)|Jackson]]'', ''[[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]]'', ''[[Thompson (surname)|Thompson]]'', ''[[Benson (surname)|Benson]]'', ''[[Johnson]]'', ''[[Harris (surname)|Harris]]'', ''[[Evans (surname)|Evans]]'', ''[[Simpson (surname)|Simpson]]'', ''[[Willis (surname)|Willis]]'', ''[[Fox (surname)|Fox]]'', ''[[Davies]]'', ''[[Reynolds (surname)|Reynolds]]'', ''[[Adams (surname)|Adams]]'', ''[[Dawson (surname)|Dawson]]'', ''[[Lewis (surname)|Lewis]]'', ''[[Rogers (surname)|Rogers]]'', ''[[Murphy]]'', ''[[Morrow (surname)|Morrow]]'', ''[[Nicholson (surname)|Nicholson]]'', ''[[Robinson (name)|Robinson]]'', ''[[Powell (surname)|Powell]]'', ''[[Ferguson (name)|Ferguson]]'', ''[[Davis (surname)|Davis]]'', ''[[Edwards (surname)|Edwards]]'', ''[[Hudson (surname)|Hudson]]'', ''[[Roberts (surname)|Roberts]]'', ''[[Harrison (name)|Harrison]]'', ''[[Watson (surname)|Watson]]'', or female names ''Molson'' (from Moll for Mary), ''[[Madison (name)|Madison]]'' (from Maud), ''Emmott'' (from Emma), ''Marriott'' (from Mary) or from a clan name (for those of Scottish origin, e.g., ''[[MacDonald]]'', ''[[Clan Forbes|Forbes]]'', ''[[Henderson (surname)|Henderson]]'', ''[[Armstrong (surname)|Armstrong]]'', ''[[Grant (surname)|Grant]]'', ''[[Cameron (surname)|Cameron]]'', ''[[Stewart (name)|Stewart]]'', ''[[Douglas (surname)|Douglas]]'', ''[[Crawford (name)|Crawford]]'', ''[[Campbell (surname)|Campbell]]'', ''[[Hunter (name)|Hunter]]'') with \"Mac\" [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] for son.<ref>Katherine M.

Some are prefixes (e.g., Gaelic ''mac'') but more are suffixes.\n\n====Occupational surname==== <!-- [[Occupational name]] and [[Occupational surname]] redirects here -->\n[[Vocation|Occupational]] names include such simple examples as ''[[Smith (surname)|Smith]]'' (for a [[metalsmith|smith]]), ''[[Miller (name)|Miller]]'' (for a [[miller]]), ''[[Farmer (surname)|Farmer]]'' (for [[Farm (revenue leasing)|tax farmers]] or sometimes [[farmer]]s), ''[[Thatcher (profession)|Thatcher]]'' (for a [[thatching|thatcher]]), ''[[Shepherd (surname)|Shepherd]]'' (for a [[shepherd]]), ''[[Potter (surname)|Potter]]'' (for a [[pottery|potter]]), and so on, as well as non-English ones, such as the German ''Eisenhauer'' (iron [[hewer]], later Anglicized in America as ''[[Eisenhower (name)|Eisenhower]]'') or ''[[Schneider (surname)|Schneider]]'' (tailor) \u2013 or, as in English, ''[[Schmidt (surname)|Schmidt]]'' (smith). There are also more complicated names based on occupational titles. In England it was common for servants to take a modified version of their employer's occupation or first name as their last name,{{According to whom|date=July 2018}} adding the letter ''s'' to the word, although this formation could also be a [[patronymic]]. For instance, the surname ''[[Vickers (surname)|Vickers]]'' is thought to have arisen as an occupational name adopted by the servant of a vicar,<ref name=\"reaney\">Reaney, P.H., and Wilson, R.M. ''A Dictionary of English Surnames.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997. Rev. 3rd ed. {{ISBN|0-19-860092-5}}.</ref> while ''[[Roberts (surname)|Roberts]]'' could have been adopted by either the son or the servant of a man named Robert. A subset of occupational names in English are names thought to be derived from the medieval [[Mystery play#English mystery plays|mystery plays]]. The participants would often play the same roles for life, passing the part down to their oldest sons. Names derived from this may include ''[[King (surname)|King]]'', ''[[Lord (surname)|Lord]]'' and ''Virgin''. The original meaning of names based on medieval occupations may no longer be obvious in modern English (so the surnames ''Cooper'', ''Chandler'', and ''Cutler'' come from the occupations of making barrels, candles, and cutlery, respectively).\n\n===== Examples =====\n{{Category see also|Occupational surnames}}\n''[[Archer (surname)|Archer]]'', ''[[Bailey (surname)|Bailey]]'', ''[[Bailhache (surname)|Bailhache]]'', ''[[Baker (surname)|Baker]]'', ''[[Brewer (surname)|Brewer]]'', ''[[Butcher (surname)|Butcher]]'', ''[[Carpenter (surname)|Carpenter]]'', ''[[Carter (name)|Carter]]'', ''[[Chandler (surname)|Chandler]]'', ''[[Clark]]'' or ''[[Clarke]]'', ''[[Collier (surname)|Collier]]'', ''[[Cooper (surname)|Cooper]]'', ''[[Cook (surname)|Cook]]'' or ''[[Cooke (surname)|Cooke]]'',  ''Dempster'', ''[[Dyer (surname)|Dyer]]'', ''[[Farmer (surname)|Farmer]]'', ''[[Faulkner (surname)|Faulkner]]'', ''[[Fisher (surname)|Fisher]]'', ''[[Fletcher (surname)|Fletcher]]'', ''[[Fowler (surname)|Fowler]]'', ''[[Fuller (surname)|Fuller]]'', ''Gardener'', ''[[Glover (surname)|Glover]]'', ''[[Hayward (profession)|Hayward]]'', ''[[Hawkins (name)|Hawkins]]'', ''Head'', ''[[Hunt (surname)|Hunt]]'' or ''[[Hunter (surname)|Hunter]]'', ''[[Judge (surname)|Judge]]'', ''[[Knight (surname)|Knight]]'', ''[[Mason (surname)|Mason]]'', ''[[Miller (name)|Miller]]'', ''Mower'', ''[[Page (surname)|Page]]'', ''[[Palmer (surname)|Palmer]]'', ''[[Parker (surname)|Parker]]'', ''[[Porter (name)|Porter]]'', ''[[Potter (name)|Potter]]'', ''[[Reeve (surname)|Reeve]]'' or ''[[Reeves (surname)|Reeves]]'', ''[[Sawyer (occupation)|Sawyer]]'', ''[[Slater]]'', ''[[Smith (surname)|Smith]]'', ''[[Stringer (surname)|Stringer]]'', ''[[Taylor (surname)|Taylor]]'', ''[[Thatcher (profession)|Thatcher]]'', ''[[Turner (surname)|Turner]]'', ''[[Walker (surname)|Walker]]'', ''[[Weaver (surname)|Weaver]]'', ''Woodman'' and ''[[Wright]]'' (or variations such as ''[[Cartwright (surname)|Cartwright]]'' and ''[[Wainwright (name)|Wainwright]]'').\n\n====Toponymic surname====<!-- [[Habitation name]], [[Habitational name]], [[Habitative name]], and [[Location name]] redirects here -->\n{{Main|Toponymic surname}}\nLocation (toponymic, habitation) names derive from the inhabited location associated with the person given that name. Such locations can be any type of settlement, such as: homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds or cottages. One element of a habitation name may describe the type of settlement. Examples of [[Old English]] elements are frequently found in the second element of habitational names. The habitative elements in such names can differ in meaning, according to different periods, different locations, or with being used with certain other elements. For example, the Old English element ''t\u016bn'' may have originally meant \"enclosure\" in one name, but can have meant \"farmstead\", \"village\", \"manor\", or \"estate\" in other names.\n\nLocation names, or habitation names, may be as generic as \"Monte\" (Portuguese for \"mountain\"), \"G\u00f3rski\" (Polish for \"hill\") or \"Pitt\" (variant of \"pit\"), but may also refer to specific locations. \"Washington\", for instance, is thought to mean \"the homestead of the family of Wassa\",<ref name=\"cottle\" /> while \"Lucci\" means \"resident of [[Lucca]]\".<ref name=\"hanks\" /> Although some surnames, such as \"London\", \"Lisboa\", or \"Bia\u0142ystok\" are derived from large cities, more people reflect the names of smaller communities, as in [[\u00d3 Creachmhaoil]], derived from a village in [[County Galway]]. This is thought to be due to the tendency in Europe during the Middle Ages for migration to chiefly be from smaller communities to the cities and the need for new arrivals to choose a defining surname.<ref name=\"cottle\" /><ref name=\"bowman\">Bowman, William Dodgson. ''The Story of Surnames''. London, George Routledge & Sons, Ltd., 1932. No ISBN.</ref>\n\nIn [[Portuguese-speaking countries]], it is uncommon, but not unprecedented, to find surnames derived from names of countries, such as Portugal, Fran\u00e7a, Brasil, Holanda. Surnames derived from country names are also found in English, such as \"England\", \"Wales\", \"Spain\".\n\nMany [[Japanese name|Japanese surnames]] derive from geographical features; for example, Ishikawa (\u77f3\u5ddd) means \"stone river\", Yamamoto (\u5c71\u672c) means \"the base of the mountain\", and Inoue (\u4e95\u4e0a) means \"above the well\".\n\nArabic names sometimes contain surnames that denote the city of origin. For example, in cases of [[Saddam Hussein]] al Tikriti,<ref name=\"saddam\">{{cite news |title=Saddam Hussein's top aides hanged |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6261965.stm |accessdate=17 October 2011 |newspaper=BBC News |date=15 January 2007}}</ref> meaning Saddam Hussein originated from [[Tikrit]], a city in [[Iraq]].

Forced adoption in 19th century is the source of German, Polish and even Italian ornamental surnames for Latvians such as \"Rozent\u0101ls (Rosental)\" (\"rose valley\"), \"Eizenbaums (Eisenbaum\") (\"steel wood\"), \"Freibergs (Freiberg)\" (\"free mountain\"). In some cases, such as [[Indonesian-sounding names adopted by Chinese Indonesians|Chinese Indonesians]] and [[Chinese Thai surname|Chinese Thais]], certain ethnic groups are subject to political pressure to change their surnames, in which case surnames can lose their family-name meaning. For instance, Indonesian business tycoon Liem Swie Liong (\u6797\u7ecd\u826f) \"indonesianised\" his name to [[Sudono Salim]]. In this case \"Liem\" (\u6797) was rendered by \"Salim\", a name of Arabic origin, while \"Sudono\", a Javanese name with the honorific prefix \"su-\" (of Sanskrit origin), was supposed{{by whom|date=January 2016}} to be a rendering of \"Swie Liong\".\n\nDuring the era of the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]] many Africans lost their native names and were forced by their owners to take the owners' surnames and any given name the \"owner\" or slave master desired. In the Americas, the family names of many African-Americans have their origins in slavery (''i.e.'' [[slave name]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many of them came to bear the surnames of their former owners. Many freed slaves either created family names themselves or adopted the name of their former master.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n=== Gender-specific versions of surname ===\nIn some cultures and languages, especially most of Slavic languages (such as Bulgarian, Russian, Slovak, Czech, etc.) and some other nations \u2013 Greece, Finland, Island, Latvia and Lithuania \u2013 surnames change form depending on the gender of the bearer.\n\nSome Slavic cultures distinguished originally daughter surnames from wife surnames by different suffixes, but this distinction is mostly abandoned. In Slavic languages, substantivized adjective surnames have commonly symmetrical adjective variants for males and females (Podwi\u0144ski/Podwi\u0144ska in Polish, Nov\u00fd/Nov\u00e1 in Czech or Slovak etc.). In case of nominative and quazi-nominative surnames, the female variant is derived from the male variant by a possessive suffix (Nov\u00e1k/Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, Hromada/Hromadov\u00e1). In Czech and Slovak, the pure possessive would be Nov\u00e1kova, Hromadova, but the surname evoluted to a more adjectivized form Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, Hromadov\u00e1, to suppress the historical possessivity. Some rare types of surnames are universal and gender-neutral: in Czech language e.g. Jan\u016f, Martin\u016f, Fojt\u016f, Kov\u00e1\u0159\u016f etc., which are archaic form of possessive, related to plural name of the family. Such rare surnames are also often used for transgender persons during transformation phase, because most of common surnames are gender-specific. Some Czech dialects (Southwest-Bohemian) use the form \"Nov\u00e1kojc\" as informal for both genders. In culture of [[Sorbs]] (Lusatians), [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] used different female form for unmarried daughters (Jordanojc, Nowcyc, Kuba\u0161ec, Markulic), and different form for wives (Nowakowa, Budarka, Nowcyna, Markulina). In Polish, typical daughter surnames ended -\u00f3wna, -anka or -ianka, while wife surnames used possessive suffixes -ina or -owa. Informal dialectal female form in Polish and Czechs dialects was also -ka (Pawlaczka, Kube\u0161ka). Polish language tends to abandon both form of feminized surnames. In Czech language, a trend to use male surnames for women is popular among cosmopolitans or celebrities, but is often criticized from patriotic views and can be seen as ridiculous and as degradation and disruption of Czech grammar. Adaptation of surnames of foreign women by suffix \"-ov\u00e1\" is currently a hot linguistic and political question in Czechia; is massively advocated as well as criticized and opposed.\n\nGenerally, inflected languages use names and surnames as living words, not as static identifiers. Thus, the pair or the family can be named by plural form which can differ from the singular male and female form. E.g., when the male form is Nov\u00e1k and the female form Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1, the family name is Nov\u00e1kovi in Czech and Nov\u00e1kovci in Slovak. When male form is Hrub\u00fd and female form is Hrub\u00e1, the plural family name is Hrub\u00ed (or \"rodina Hrub\u00fdch\").\n\nIn Greece, if a man called Papadopoulos has a daughter, she will likely be named Papadopoulou (if the couple have decided their offspring will take his surname), the genitive form, as if the daughter is \"of\" a man named Papadopoulos.\n\nIn Lithuania, if the husband is named Vilkas, his wife will be named Vilkien\u0117 and his daughter will be named Vilkait\u0117. Male surnames have suffixes -as, -is, -ius, or -us, unmarried girl surnames ait\u0117, -yt\u0117, -i\u016bt\u0117 or -ut\u0117, wife surnames -ien\u0117.\n\nLatvian uses strictly feminized surnames for women, even in case of foreign names. The function of the suffix is purely grammar. Male surnames ending -e or -a need not to be modified for women. An exception is: 1) the female surnames which correspond to nouns in the sixth declension with the ending \"-s\" \u2013 \"Iron\", (\"iron\"), \"rock\", 2) as well as surnames of both genders, which are written in the same nominative case because corresponds to nouns in the third declension ending in \"-us\" \"Grigus\", \"Markus\"; 3) surnames based on an adjective have indefinite suffixes typical of adjectives \"-s, -a\" (\"Stalts\", \"Stalta\") or the specified endings \"-ais, -\u0101\" (\"\u010caklais\", \"\u010cakl\u0101\") (\"diligent\").\n\nIn Iceland, surnames have a gender-specific suffix (-d\u00f3ttir = daughter, -son = son).\n\nFinnish language used gender-specific sufix up to 1929, when the Marriage Act forced women to use the husband's form of surname. In 1985, this sentence was released from the act.\n\n=== Other ===\nThe meanings of some names are unknown or unclear. The most common European name in this category may be the English (Irish derivative) name [[Ryan (surname)|Ryan]], which means 'little king' in Irish.<ref name=\"cottle\" /><ref name=\"reaney\" /> Also, Celtic origin of the name Arthur, meaning '[[Artur|bear]]'. Other surnames may have arisen from more than one source: the name [[DeLuca|De Luca]], for instance, likely arose either in or near Lucania or in the family of someone named Lucas or Lucius;<ref name=\"hanks\" /> in some instances, however, the name may have arisen from Lucca, with the spelling and pronunciation changing over time and with emigration.<ref name=\"hanks\" /> The same name may appear in different cultures by coincidence or romanization; the surname [[Lee (English name)|Lee]] is used in English culture, but is also a romanization of the Chinese surname ''[[Li (surname \u674e)|Li]]''.<ref name=\"reaney\" /> Surname origins have been the subject of much [[folk etymology]].\n\nIn [[French Canada]] until the 19th century, several families adopted surnames that followed the family name in order to distinguish the various branches of a large family. Such a surname was preceded by the word ''dit'' ('so-called,' lit.'said') and was known as a ''nom-dit'' ('said-name'). (Compare with some [[Roman naming conventions]].) While this tradition is no longer in use, in many cases the ''nom-dit'' has come to replace the original family name. Thus the Bourbeau family has split into Bourbeau dit Verville, Bourbeau dit Lacourse, and Bourbeau dit Beauchesne. In many cases Verville, Lacourse, or Beauchesne has become the new family name. Likewise, the Rivard family has split into the Rivard dit Lavigne, Rivard dit Loranger and Rivard dit Lanoie. The origin of the ''nom-dit'' can vary. Often it denoted a geographical trait of the area where that branch of the family lived: Verville lived towards the city, Beauchesne lived near an oak tree, Larivi\u00e8re near a river, etc. Some of the oldest ''noms-dits'' are derived from the war name of a settler who served in the army or militia: Tranchemontagne ('mountain slasher'), Jolic\u0153ur ('braveheart'). Others denote a personal trait: Lacourse might have been a fast runner, Legrand was probably tall, etc. Similar in German it is with \"gennant\" \u2013 \"Vietinghoff genannt Scheel\"\n\n== Compound surnames ==\n\nWhile in many countries surnames are usually one word, in others a surname may contain two words ([[double surname]]) or more, as described below.\n\n=== Spanish compound surnames ===\n{{Main|Spanish naming customs}}\n{{Further|Double-barrelled name#Iberian tradition}}\n{{See also|#Spanish-speaking world}}\n\nIn traditional Spanish culture, and as is still the case in many Spanish-speaking countries, an individual does not have only a single surname. Instead an individual inherits the surnames of all of their ancestors, in particular their father and mother. In practice individuals mostly use only the two surnames of their parents. For instance, Spanish ex-premier [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] has [[Jos\u00e9]] [[Luis]] as his given name, [[Rodr\u00edguez (surname)|Rodr\u00edguez]], as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and [[Zapatero (surname)|Zapatero]] as his second (i.e. maternal) surname. But in reality an individual can be referred to by any number of his or her surnames as the occasion may require. For example, Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero could also be referred to as\n\n:Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero Garc\u00eda Valero Garc\u00eda Asensio\n\nAdditional surnames refer to grandmothers, great-grandmothers, and so forth. The number of surnames a person has is theoretically unlimited though it is rare to use more than a few (and indeed an individual may not know more than a few of his or her ancestors' names).\n\nThis custom is not seen in the Hispanic world as being a true compound surname system ''per se'', since it is widely understood that the first surname denotes one's father's family, and the second surname denotes one's mother's family. So \"Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero\" is not considered one surname; it is two distinct surnames. Given that it is not a true compound surname, his children do not inherit the \"compound\" surname \"Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero\". Only the paternal surname of both father and mother are passed on. The father's paternal surname becomes the child's own paternal surname, while the mother's paternal surname becomes the child's second surname (as the child's own maternal surname). Thus, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero would pass on only Rodr\u00edguez to his children as their first (i.e. paternal) surname.\n\nAn additional complication is introduced by marriage. Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero's wife was born Sonsoles Espinosa D\u00edaz. Under Spanish tradition she is still known by that name, even after marriage. But she may also be known as\n:Sonsoles Espinosa D\u00edaz de Rodr\u00edguez\n:Sonsoles Espinosa de Rodr\u00edguez\n:Sonsoles de Rodr\u00edguez\n\nThese other forms, particularly the last, are becoming less common{{when|date=June 2018}} as they are increasingly seen as sexist (i.e. that a wife is expected to take her husband's name but not the other way around).<ref>{{cite web |title=Proper married name? |website=Spanish Dict |date=9 January 2012 |url=http://www.spanishdict.com/answers/219019/proper-married-name}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Language and the Sexes |author=Frank, Francine; Anshen, Frank |year=1985 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-87395-882-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_fvHy48GiIEC |page=18}}</ref> Additionally, in Spain and some other countries it is becoming more common, in law and in practice, to allow placing the mother's name before the father's in a child's surname rather than insisting that the privilege belongs exclusively to the father.<ref>{{cite web |title=Spain overhauls tradition of 'sexist' double-barrelled surnames |author=Govan, Fiona |website=The Local |date=1 June 2017 |url=https://www.thelocal.es/20170601/spain-overhauls-tradition-of-sexist-double-barrelled-surnames}}</ref>\n\n==== True compound surnames ====\nBeyond this seemingly \"compound\" surname system in the Hispanic world, there are also true compound surnames in the Spanish-speaking countries. These true compound surnames are passed on and inherited as compounds. For instance, former Chairman of the [[Military junta|Supreme Military Junta]] of [[Ecuador]], General [[Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o]] Estrella, has [[Luis]] as his first given name, [[Telmo]] as his middle name, the true compound surname [[Pazmi\u00f1o|Paz y Mi\u00f1o]] as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Estrella as his second (i.e. maternal) surname.\n\nLuis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o Estrella is also known more casually as Luis Paz y Mi\u00f1o, Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o, or Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o. He would never be regarded as Luis Estrella, Telmo Estrella, or Luis Telmo Estrella, nor as Luis Paz, Telmo Paz, or Luis Telmo Paz. This is because \"Paz\" alone is not his surname (although other people use the \"Paz\" surname on its own).\n\nIn this case, [[Pazmi\u00f1o|Paz y Mi\u00f1o]] is in fact the paternal surname, being a true compound surname. His children, therefore, would inherit the compound surname \"Paz y Mi\u00f1o\" as their paternal surname, while Estrella would be lost, since the mother's paternal surname becomes the children's second surname (as their own maternal surname). \"Paz\" alone would not be passed on, nor would \"Mi\u00f1o\" alone.\n\nTo avoid ambiguity, one might often informally see these true compound surnames hyphenated, for instance, as Paz-y-Mi\u00f1o. This is true especially in the [[English-speaking world]], but also sometimes even in the Hispanic world, since to many Hispanics unfamiliar with this and other compound surnames, \"Paz y Mi\u00f1o\" might be inadvertently mistaken as \"Paz\" for the paternal surname and \"Mi\u00f1o\" for the maternal surname. Although Mi\u00f1o did start off as the maternal surname in this compound surname, it was many generations ago, around five centuries, that it became compounded, and henceforth inherited and passed on as a compound.\n\nOther surnames which started off as compounds of two or more surnames, but which merged into one single word, also exist. An example would be the surname [[Pazmi\u00f1o]], whose members are related to the Paz y Mi\u00f1o, as both descend from the \"Paz Mi\u00f1o\" family of five centuries ago.\n\n[[\u00c1lava]], Spain is known for its incidence of true compound surnames, characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic (i.e. from the [[Castilian language]]) or more unusually a [[Basque language]] patronymic, followed by the [[preposition]] \"de\", with the second part of the surname being a local toponymic surname from \u00c1lava.\n\n=== English compound surnames ===\n{{Further|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}\nCompound surnames in English and several other European cultures feature two (or occasionally more) words, often joined by a [[hyphen]] or hyphens. However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example [[Iain Duncan Smith]], a former leader of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], whose surname is \"Duncan Smith\". A surname with the prefix \"Fitz\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, as in \"Fitz William\", as well as \"FitzWilliam\" or \"Fitzwilliam\". Like, for example, [[Robert FitzRoy]].\n\n=== Scottish and Irish compound surnames{{anchor|Celtic_compound_names}} ===\nIrish surnames are the oldest surnames in Europe. The common prefixes \"\u00d3\" and \"Mac\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, yielding \"\u00d3 Briain\" or \"Mac Millan\" as well as the anglicized \"O'Brien\" and \"MacMillan\" or \"Macmillan\".\n\n=== Chinese compound surnames ===\n{{main|Chinese compound surname}}\nSome [[Chinese surname]]s use more than one [[Chinese character|character]].\n\n== Culture and prevalence ==\n[[File:Power law surnames.jpg|thumb|450px|Rank and frequency of some US surnames]]\nIn the United States, 1,712 surnames cover 50% of the population, and about 1% of the population has the surname Smith,<ref>[https://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/dist.all.last Genealogy] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101012101346/http://www.census.gov/genealogy/names/dist.all.last |date=12 October 2010 }}, U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division (1995).</ref> which is also the most frequent English name and an occupational name (\"metal worker\"), a contraction, for instance, of [[blacksmith]] or other [[metalsmith]]s. Several American surnames are a result of corruptions or phonetic misappropriations of European surnames, perhaps as a result of the registration process at the immigration entry points. Spellings and pronunciations of names remained fluid in the United States until the Social Security System enforced standardization.\n\nApproximately 70% of Canadians have surnames that are of English, Irish, French, or Scottish derivation.\n\nAccording to some estimates, 85% of China's population shares just 100 surnames. The names Wang (\u738b), Zhang (\u5f20) and Li (\u674e) are the most frequent.<ref>LaFraniere S.

''New York Times''. 20 April 2009.</ref>\n\n== Spanish-speaking world ==\n{{Main|Spanish naming customs|Naming customs of Hispanic America}}\n{{See also|#Spanish compound surnames}}\n\nIn [[Spain]] and in most [[Hispanophone|Spanish-speaking countries]], the custom is for people to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from the father and the second from the mother, but it could be the other way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be the mother's first surname. For example, if Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Torres and Mar\u00eda Acosta G\u00f3mez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo Garc\u00eda Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.\n{{chart/start|align=center | summary=An example family tree}}\n{{chart| | | JGT |y| MAG | | |JGT=Jos\u00e9 '''{{font color|red|Garc\u00eda}} Torres'''|MAG=Mar\u00eda '''{{font color|blue|Acosta}} G\u00f3mez'''|}}\n{{chart| | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart| | | | |  PGA  | | | | | |PGA=Pablo '''{{font color|red|Garc\u00eda}} {{font color|blue|Acosta}}'''| }}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nIn some instances, when an individual's given name and first family name are too common (such as in [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] and [[Mario Vargas Llosa]]), both family names are used (though not necessarily both given names). A person could even take the maternal name for informal situations instead of the paternal name, for personal preferences or if the maternal name is somehow \"special\" (Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero is known in Spanish as \"Jos\u00e9 Luis Zapatero\" or just as \"Zapatero\"). In Spain, a new law approved in 1999 allows an adult to change the order of his/her family names, and parents can also change the order of their children's family names if they (and the child, if over 12) agree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Privado/rd193-2000.html |title=Real Decreto 193/2000, de 11 de febrero, de modificaci\u00f3n de determinados art\u00edculos del Reglamento del Registro Civil en materia relativa al nombre y apellidos y orden de los mismos. |accessdate=22 September 2008 |author=Juan Carlos R. |date=11 February 2000 |work=Base de Datos de Legislaci\u00f3n |publisher=Noticias Juridicas |language=Spanish }} ''Note: Google auto translation of title into English\u2192Royal Decree 193/2000, of 11 February, to amend certain articles of the Civil Registration Regulations in the field on the name and order.</ref>\n\nIn Spain, especially [[Catalonia]], the paternal and maternal surnames are often combined using the conjunction ''y'' (\"and\" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) or ''i'' (\"and\" in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), see for example the economist [[Xavier Sala-i-Martin]] or painter [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] i Dom\u00e8nech.\n\nIn Spain, a woman does not change her legal surnames when she marries. In some Spanish-speaking countries in [[Latin America]], a woman may, on her marriage, drop her mother's surname and add her husband's surname to her father's surname using the preposition ''de'' (\"of\"), ''del'' (\"of the\", when the following word is masculine) or ''de la'' (\"of the\", when the following word is feminine). For example, if \"Clara Reyes Alba\" were to marry \"Alberto G\u00f3mez Rodr\u00edguez\", the wife could use \"Clara Reyes ''de'' G\u00f3mez\" as her name (or \"Clara Reyes G\u00f3mez\", or, rarely, \"Clara G\u00f3mez Reyes\". She can be addressed as ''[[Mrs.|Sra]]. de G\u00f3mez'' corresponding to \"Mrs G\u00f3mez\"). In some countries, this form may be mainly social and not an official name change, i.e. her name would still legally be her birth name. This custom of adding the husband's surname is slowly fading.\n\nSometimes a father transmits his combined family names, thus creating a new one e.g., the paternal surname of the son of ''Javier'' (given name) ''Reyes'' (paternal family name) ''de la Barrera'' (maternal surname) may become the new paternal surname ''Reyes de la Barrera''. ''De'' is also the [[nobiliary particle]] used with Spanish surnames. This can not be chosen by the person, as it is part of the surname, for example \"Puente\" and \"Del Puente\" are not the same surname.\n\nChildren take the surnames of both parents, so if the couple above had two children named \"Andr\u00e9s\" and \"Ana\", then their names would be \"Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Reyes\" and \"Ana G\u00f3mez Reyes\". In [[Spain]], a 1995 reform in the law allows the parents to choose whether the father's or the mother's surname goes first, although this order must be the same for all their children. For instance, the name of the son of the couple in the example above could be either \"Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Reyes\" or \"Andr\u00e9s Reyes G\u00f3mez\".<ref>[http://noticias.juridicas.com/index.php?doc=http%3A//noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/Privado/lrc.html ''Art. 55 Ley de Registro Civil'' \u2013 Civil Register Law] (article in Spanish)</ref> Sometimes, for single mothers or when the father would or could not recognize the child, the mother's surname has been used twice: for example, \"Ana Reyes Reyes\". In Spain, however, children with just one parent receive both surnames of that parent, although the order may also be changed. In 1973 in Chile, the law was changed to avoid stigmatizing illegitimate children with the maternal surname repeated.\n\nSome Hispanic people, after leaving their country, drop their maternal surname, even if not formally, so as to better fit into the non-Hispanic society they live or work in. Dropping the paternal surname is not unusual when it is a very common one. For instance, painter Pablo Ruiz [[Picasso]] and Spanish Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] are known by their maternal surnames as \"Picasso\" and \"Zapatero\". Similarly, Anglophones with just one surname may be asked to provide a second surname on official documents in Spanish-speaking countries. When none (such as the mother's maiden name) is provided, the last name may simply be repeated.\n\nTraditionally in most countries, and currently in some Spanish-speaking countries, women, upon marrying, keep their own family names. It is considered impolite towards her family for a woman to change her name. The higher class women of [[Cuba]] and Spain traditionally never change their names.  In certain rare situations, a woman may be addressed with her paternal surname followed by her husband's paternal surname linked with ''de''. For example, a woman named ''Ana Garc\u00eda D\u00edaz'', upon marrying ''Juan Guerrero Mac\u00edas'', could be called ''Ana Garc\u00eda de Guerrero''. This custom, begun in medieval times, is decaying and only has legal validity{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} in [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Peru]], [[Panama]], and to a certain extent in [[Mexico]] (where it is optional but becoming obsolete), but is frowned upon by people in Spain, Cuba, and elsewhere.  In Peru and the Dominican Republic, women normally conserve all family names after getting married. For example, if ''Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez'' marries ''Juan Mart\u00edn De la Cruz G\u00f3mez'', she will be called ''Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez de De la Cruz'', and if the husband dies, she will be called ''Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez Vda. de De la Cruz'' (Vda. being the abbreviation for ''viuda'', \"widow\" in Spanish).  The law in Peru changed some years ago, and all married women can keep their maiden last name if they wish with no alteration.\n\nIn some churches, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where the family structure is emphasized, as well as legal marriage, the wife is referred to as \"''hermana''\" [sister] plus the surname of her husband. And most records of the church follow that structure as well.\n\nA new trend in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American born English-speakers are not aware of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the individual for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban \u00c1lvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban \u00c1lvarez Cobos, would become Esteban \u00c1lvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names.\n\nIn Spanish villages in Catalonia, [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], and [[Asturias]] and in Cuba, people are often known by the name of their dwelling or collective family nickname rather than by their surnames. For example, Remei Pujol i Serra who lives at Ca l'Elvira would be referred to as \"Remei de Ca l'Elvira\"; and Adela Barreira L\u00f3pez who is part of the \"Provisores\" family would be known as \"Adela dos Provisores\". In the case of [[Cantabria]] the family's nickname is used instead of the surname: if one family is known as \"\u00d1ecos\" because of an ancestor who was known as \"\u00d1ecu\", they would be \"Jos\u00e9 el de \u00d1ecu\" or \"Ana la de \u00d1ecu\" (collective: the \u00d1eco's). Some common nicknames are \"Rubiu\" (blonde or ginger hair), \"Roju\" (reddish, as referred to ginger hair), \"Chiqui\" (small), \"Jinchu\" (big), and a bunch of names about certain characteristics, family relationship or geographical origin (pasiegu, masoniegu, sobanu, llebaniegu, tresmeranu, pejinu, naveru, merachu, tresneru, troule, mallavia, marotias, llamoso, lipa, \u00f1ecu, tarugu, trapajeru, lich\u00f3n, andar\u00edvel).\n\n{{See also|Surnames by country#The Philippines}}\n\n== Portuguese-speaking countries ==\n{{Main|Portuguese name}}\n\nIn the case of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] naming customs, the main surname (the one used in alphasorting, indexing, abbreviations, and greetings), appears last.\n\nEach person usually has two family names: though the law specifies no order, the first one is usually the maternal family name, whereas the last one is commonly the paternal family name. In Portugal, a person's full name has a minimum legal length of two names (one given name and one family name from either parent) and a maximum of six names (two first names and four surnames \u2013 he or she may have up to four surnames in any order desired picked up from the total of his/her parents and grandparents' surnames). The use of any surname outside this lot, or of more than six names, is legally possible, but it requires dealing with bureaucracy. Parents or the person him/herself must explain the claims they have to bearing that surname (a family nickname, a rare surname lost in past generations, or any other reason one may find suitable). In Brazil there is no limit of surnames used.\n\nIn general, the traditions followed in countries like [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]] and [[Angola]] are somewhat different from the ones in Spain. In the Spanish tradition, usually the father's surname comes first, followed by the mother's surname, whereas in Portuguese-speaking countries the father's name is the last, mother's coming first.  A woman may adopt her husband's surname(s), but nevertheless she usually keeps her birth names, or at least the last one. Since 1977, a husband can also adopt his wife's surname. When this happens, usually both spouses change their name after marriage.\n\nThe custom of a woman changing her name upon marriage is recent. It spread in the late 19th century in the upper classes, under French influence, and in the 20th century, particularly during the 1930s and 1940, it became socially almost obligatory. Nowadays, fewer women adopt, even officially, their husbands' names, and among those who do so officially, it is quite common not to use it either in their professional or informal life.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe children usually bear only the last surnames of the parents (i.e., the paternal surname of each of their parents). For example, ''Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves'' and ''Ana Lu\u00edsa de Albuquerque Pereira (Gon\u00e7alves)'' (in case she adopted her husband's name after marriage) would have a child named ''Lucas Pereira Gon\u00e7alves''. However, the child may have any other combination of the parents' surnames, according to [[euphony]], social significance or other reasons. For example, is not uncommon for the first born male to be given the father's full name followed by \"J\u00fanior\" or \"Filho\" (son), and the next generation's first born male to be given the grandfather's name followed by \"Neto\" (grandson). Hence ''Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves'' might choose to name his first born son ''Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves J\u00fanior'', who in turn might name his first born son ''Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves Neto'', in which case none of the mother's family names are passed on.\n\n{{chart/start|align=center | summary=An example family tree}}\n{{chart| | | CSG |e| ALAP | | |CSG=Carlos '''da Silva {{font color|red|Gon\u00e7alves}}'''|ALAP=Ana Lu\u00edsa '''de Albuquerque {{font color|blue|Pereira}}'''|}}\n{{chart| | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{chart| | | | |  LPG  | | | | | |LPG=Lucas '''{{font color|blue|Pereira}} {{font color|red|Gon\u00e7alves}}'''| }}\n{{chart/end}}\n\nIn ancient times a patronymic was commonly used \u2013 surnames like ''Gon\u00e7alves'' (\"son of ''Gon\u00e7alo''\"), ''Fernandes'' (\"son of ''Fernando''\"), ''Nunes'' (\"son of ''Nuno''\"), ''Soares'' (\"son of ''Soeiro''\"), ''Sanches'' (\"son of ''Sancho''\"), ''Henriques'' (\"son of ''Henrique''\"), ''Rodrigues'' (\"son of ''Rodrigo''\") which along with many others are still in regular use as very prevalent family names.\n\nIn Medieval times, Portuguese nobility started to use one of their estates' names or the name of the town or village they ruled as their surname, just after their patronymic. [[Soeiro Mendes da Maia]] bore a name \"Soeiro\", a patronymic \"Mendes\" (\"son of Hermenegildo \u2013 shortened to Mendo\") and the name of the town he ruled \"[[Maia, Porto, Portugal|Maia]]\". He was often referred to in 12th-century documents as \"Soeiro Mendes, senhor da Maia\", Soeiro Mendes, lord of Maia. Noblewomen also bore patronymics and surnames in the same manner and never bore their husband's surname. First-born males bore their father's surname, other children bore either both or only one of them at their will.\n\nOnly during the Early Modern Age, lower-class males started to use at least one surname; married lower-class women usually took up their spouse's surname, since they rarely ever used one beforehand. After the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]], Portuguese authorities realized the benefits of enforcing the use and registry of surnames. Henceforth, they became mandatory, although the rules for their use were very liberal.\n\nUntil the end of the 19th century it was common for women, especially those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only by their first names. A woman would then adopt her husband's full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames.\nDuring the mid-20th century, under French influence and among upper classes, women started to take up their husbands' surname(s). From the 1960s onwards, this usage spread to the common people, again under French influence, this time, however, due to the forceful legal adoption of their husbands' surname which was imposed onto Portuguese immigrant women in France.\n\nFrom the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] onwards the adoption of their husbands' surname(s) receded again, and today both the adoption and non-adoption occur, with non-adoption being chosen in the majority of cases in recent years (60%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lifestyle.publico.pt/artigos/341672_identidade-submissao-ou-amor-o-que-significa-adoptar-o-apelido-do-marido |title=Identidade, submiss\u00e3o ou amor?

Some surnames are connected to [[East Syriac Rite]] [[Christianity]], the religion Assyrians currently follow and have followed since the 1st century AD, with others being of distinctly ancient Assyrian/Mesopotamian origin.\n\nCommon surnames include: ''Aboona'', ''Abraham'', ''Abro'', ''Agajan'', ''Agassi'', ''Aghase'', ''Akkad'', ''Akbalit/Akbalut'',  ''Alamasha'', ''Alawerdy'', ''Aldawid'', ''Amo Baba'', ''Amu'', ''Antar'', ''Aprim'', ''Apshu'',  ''Afarcan'', ''Arad'', ''Ashai'', ''Ashouri'', ''Ashurian'', ''Ashur'', ''Awdishu'', ''Awikam'',  ''Awishalim'', ''Awitor'', ''Awia'', ''Awrohum'',  ''Aziz'', ''Azzo'', ''Baba'', ''Bacchus'', ''Badel'', ''Barkha/Barkho'', ''Brikha'',  ''Bronit'',  ''Balou'', ''Barkoo'', ''Benassi'', ''Benyamin'', ''Bidavid'', ''Bidawid'', ''Bishu'', ''Cabani'', ''Dadashu/Dadasho'',  ''Darmu'',  ''Dinkha'', ''Daoud'', ''Dayan/Daian'',  ''Disho'', ''Duman'', ''Elia'', ''Elias'', ''Enwia'', ''Eshai'', ''Farhad'', ''Gorges/Georgis'', ''Gewargis'', ''Hadad/Adad'', ''Hamsho'',  ''Hasso'', ''Harshu'', ''Hormis'', ''Hosanna'', ''Hurmis'', ''Ilshu'', ''Ilishu'', ''Ishmael'', ''Ishai'',  ''Isaac'', ''Ishaq'', ''Iskhaq'', ''Iwassi'', ''Jabri'', ''Jelu'', ''Jendo'', ''Juna'', ''Kambar'',  ''Karam'', ''Karoukian'', ''Kasri'',  ''Khamo'', ''Khanbaba'', ''Khanisho/Khnanisu'', ''Khnaninia'',  ''Khedroo'', ''Khoshanu'', ''Khoshaba'', ''Malech'', ''Malek'', ''Malka'', ''Malkai'', ''Malick'', ''Mamendo'', ''Matti'', ''Merza'', ''Mikhael/Mikhail'', ''Mnashi'', ''Nisan'', ''Nimrod'', ''Narsai'', ''Ninweh'', ''Nineveh'', ''Nessar'',  ''Odah'', ''Odisha'', ''Odisho'', ''Oraham'', ''Oshana'', ''Qateneh'', ''Raaba'',  ''Rabi'', ''Rafael'', ''Ramsin/Rumsin'', ''Rassam'', ''Rifkha'',  ''Ronay'', ''Samo'', ''Sargis'', ''Sargon'', ''Sarkis'', ''Sarmas'', ''Sayad'', ''Semma'', ''Shabad'', ''Shamash/Shamasha'', ''Shamshi'', ''Sinharib'', ''Sharrukin'', ''Shimun'', ''Shamoon'', ''Shimon'', ''Shimonaya'', ''Shinu'', ''Shinai'', ''Sleman'', ''Shulman'', ''Sliwoo/Sliwa'', ''Tematheus'', ''Thoma'', ''Thomaya'', ''Tamraz'', ''Tiras'', ''Tiyareh/Tyareh'', ''Urshan'', ''Warda'', ''Warad'', ''Yacoub'', ''Yawalaha'', ''Yalda'', ''Yatrin'', ''Yetron'',  ''Yelu'', ''Yoel'', ''Yohannan'', ''Yonan'', ''Yonadam'', ''Yoseph'', ''Yoshu'',  ''Youkhana'', ''Younan'', ''Yousif'', ''Yukhannan'', ''Zakharia'', ''Zilkha'',  ''Zimri''.\n\n=== Circassians ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nIn the case of [[Circassians]], especially [[Adyges]] and [[Kabardians]], hereditary surnames have been borne by people for many years.\n\nMost surnames of Adyge origin fall into six types:\n* Occupations (e.g., 'smith', 'hunter', 'tailor')\n* Personal characteristics (e.g., 'short', 'deaf', 'beautiful')\n* Geographical features (e.g., 'hill', 'river', 'cave', 'wood', 'fields')\n* Animal names (e.g., 'bear', 'horse', 'snake', 'fox', 'wild boar')\n* Patronymics and ancestry, often from a male's given name ('son of...') or from an ethnic name (e.g., ''Shapsug'', ''Kabardey'')\n* Religious names (e.g., ''Shogen'' 'Priest', ''Yefendi'' 'Efendi', ''Mole'' 'Mullah')\n\n''Shogen'' comes from the Christian era, and ''Yefendi'' and ''Mole'' come from the Muslim era.\n\nCircassian women, even when they marry, do not change their surnames. By keeping their surnames and passing it on to the next generation, children come to distinguish relatives from the maternal side and respect her family as well as those from their father's side.\n\nOn the other hand, children cannot marry someone who bears the same surname as they do, no matter how distantly related.\n\nIn the Circassian tradition, the formula for surnames is patterned to mean \"daughter of ...\"\n\nAbkhaz families follow similar naming patterns reflecting the common roots of the Abkhazian, Adygean and Wubikh peoples.\n\nCircassian family names cannot be derived from women's names or from the name of female ancestors.\n\n=== Jewish ===\n{{Main|Jewish name}}\n\n[[Jewish]] names have historically varied, encompassing throughout the centuries several different traditions. The most usual last name for those of the [[Kohanim|priest tribe]] is \"Cohen\"/\"Kahen\"/\"Kogan\"/\"Kohen\"/\"Katz\" (a Hebrew [[acronym]] of Kohen Tzedek, or righteous Kohen) and for those of the [[Levite]]s, \"Levi\"/\"Levine\". Those who came from Central or Eastern Europe usually have \"Rosen\"(\"rose\"), \"Spiel\", \"Gold\", and other German words as their names' prefixes, and \"man\", \"wyn\"/\"wein\"(\"wine\"), \"berg\"(\"mountain\"), and other German words as their names' suffixes. Many [[Sephardic Jew]]s adopted [[Spain|Spanish]] or [[Arabic]] names, like \"Toledo\", \"Bejarano\", \"Azizi\" (\"you're [someones] love\"), \"[[Hassan (surname)|Hassan]]\" or added words to their original names, like Beizaee( \"Iza\", God is perfection),  \"Kohenzadeh\" (\"[she] bore a Kohen\"){{clarify|date=September 2018|reason=I don't see how the examples support the claim}}. Names like \"Johnson\" and \"Peterson\" may be used in Jewish tradition{{clarify|date=September 2018|reason=it's a factual question. Are they used or not? and does this refer to the English form or to Hebrew forms as in the following sentence?}} as they too used the father's name as identification. So \"Johnson\" in Hebrew is \"Ben Yochanon\", meaning \"Yochanon (John)'s son\".\nAnother common group of Jewish surnames is [[Toponymic surname|toponymic]]s, for example \"San'ani\" (from [[Sana'a]] in Yemen), \"Varshavski\" (from [[Warsaw]] in Poland), \"Yerushalmi\" (from [[Jerusalem]]).\n\nJews who immigrated to [[Israel]] or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] often changed their surnames to [[Hebrew]] ones, a process described under [[Hebraization of surnames]].\n\n=== Kurdish ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nThe majority of Kurds do not hold Kurdish names because the names have been banned in the countries they primarily live in (namely Iran, Turkey and Syria). Kurds in these respective countries tend to hold Turkish, Persian or Arabic names, in the majority of cases, forcefully appointed by the ruling governments.<ref>{{cite speech |title=(Requests to Syrian government regarding restoration of rights to Kurds residing in Syria) |first=Jian |last=Badrakhan |date=August 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2008 |location=United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (Session 58), Working Group on Minorities (Session 12) |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/minorities/docs/12/YASA_Kurdish_Centre_for_Legal_Studies_Consultancy.doc}}</ref> Others hold Arabic names as a result of the influence of Islam and Arab culture.\n\nKurds holding authentic Kurdish names are generally found in Diaspora or in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] where Kurds are relatively free. Traditionally, Kurdish family names are inherited from the tribes of which the individual or families are members. However, some families inherit the names of the regions they are from.\n\nCommon affixes of authentic Kurdish names are \"-\u00ee\" and \"-za\" also \"-a\" and \"-\u00ea\" by two surnames.<br />\ne.g.:<br />\n'''Name+1Surname+2Surname'''<br />\n''Male:''\n* Baran(\u00ea) Mem\u00ea Alan\nBaran of Mem of Alan\n\n''Female:''\n* Berf\u00een(a) Soreya Ev\u00een\u00ea\nBerfin of Sarah of Evin\n<br />\nthere are also names with the word \"Mal(a)\" [House (of)]\ne.g.:\n* Baran mala Alan\nBaran of House of Alan\n* Berf\u00een mala Ev\u00een\nBerfin of House of Evin\n\nSome common Kurdish last names, which are also the names of their respective tribes, include Baradost, Barzani, Berwari, Berzinji, Chelki, Diri, Doski, Jaf, Mutki, Rami, Rekani, Rozaki, Sindi, and Tovi/Tuvi. Other names include Akreyi, Alan, Amedi, Botani, Hewrami, Mukri, Serhati and Zibari.\n\nTraditionally, Kurdish women did not inherit a man's last name. Although still not in practice by many Kurds, this can be more commonly found today.\n\n=== Tibet ===\n\nTibetan people are often named at birth by the local Buddhist Lama or they may request a name from the Dalai Lama. The majority do not have family names.  They may change their name throughout life if advised by a Buddhist Lama, for example if a different name removes obstacles. Tibetans who enter monastic life take a name from their ordination Lama, which will be a combination of the Lama's name and a new name for them.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tibettravel.org/tibetan-people/tibetan-names.html |title=Tibetan Names |website=Tibet Travel and Tours \u2013 Tibet Vista |language=en |access-date=9 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Rajputs ===\n{{Main|Rajputs}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nRajputs are an ethnic group in India, spread all over the country and have a rich cultural identity.\n\nThe common surnames include: ''Singh'', ''Chauhan'', ''Rajput'', ''Sinha (or Singha)'', ''Rathore'', ''Tomar'', ''Parmar'', ''kushwah'', ''bhadoriya''  etc.\n\n<!-- this section is under construction ... please don't revert or delete!\nconstructive edits are appreciable -->\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Genealogy]]\n* [[Generation name]]\n* [[Given name]]\n* [[Legal name]]\n* [[List of family name affixes]]\n* [[Lists of most common surnames]]\n* [[Maiden and married names]]\n* [[Matriname]]\n* [[Name blending]]\n* [[Name change]]\n* [[Nobiliary particle]]\n* [[One-name study]]\n* [[Patronymic surname]]\n* [[Personal name]]\n* [[Skin name]]\n* [[Galton\u2013Watson process|Surname extinction]]\n* [[Surname map]]\n* [[Surname law]]\n* [[Surnames by country]]\n* [[Naming law]]\n* [[T\u2013V distinction]]\n* [[Tussenvoegsel]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n; Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Bowman, William Dodgson.

It was founded in [[Geelong]], Victoria, in 1925 as an outpost of [[Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited]]. At that time, Ford Canada was a separate company from Ford USA. [[Henry Ford]] had granted the manufacturing rights of Ford motor vehicles in the British Empire (later the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]), except the United Kingdom, to Canadian investors.\n\nFord Australia's first products were Model Ts assembled from [[Complete knock down|complete knock-down (CKD) kits]] provided by Ford of Canada. It is best known in more recent times for having produced the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]], originally a US model introduced in Australia in 1960, but adapted to Australian requirements and road conditions.\n\nKay Hart your company is a disgrace...\nOur transmission gone at 88000...

The first Australian-built Ford was a [[Ford Model T|Model T]] that came off an improvised production line in a disused Geelong wool storage warehouse in June 1925, while work started on a factory in the nearby suburb of Norlane. In 1928 the factory switched to the [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] and was followed by the [[1932 Ford|Ford V8]] in 1932.<ref name=gex150>{{cite book | author = Peter Begg | title = Geelong \u2013 The First 150 Years | publisher = Globe Press | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-9592863-5-7 | page = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the company released a [[coupe utility]] based upon the Model A American Ford \"Closed Cab Pickup Truck\" that had been produced for 6 years from 1928. The local designer was Ford engineer [[Lewis Bandt|Louis (Lewis) Bandt]].<ref name=gex150 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bandt-louis-thornett-lewis-12169/text21807|title=Bandt, Louis Thornett (Lewis) (1910\u20131987)  |author=Damian Veltri |publisher= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], National Centre of Biography, [[Australian National University]] |accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> During the [[Great Depression]], banks would not extend credit to farmers to purchase passenger cars- in the belief they were unnecessary luxuries. However, they would lend money for the purchase of \"working\" vehicles. The coupe utility fulfilled the need of farmers to have a workhorse which could also be used \"to take the wife to church on Sunday and the pigs to the market on Monday\".\n\nIn 1956, the company bought a large tract of land in the northern [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Campbellfield, Victoria|Campbellfield]], and in July 1961 announced that the new Melbourne factory would become the company headquarters.<ref name=gex150 />\n\nFord Australia is one of Ford's five product development centres globally, and will continue to design and develop cars and trucks for the Asia/Pacific region after the closure of the manufacturing arm. It was expected to retain about 1300 workers in Australia.<ref>http://www.motoring.com.au/ford-splits-australian-hq-49272/</ref>\n\n=== End of Australian production ===\nIn 2009, the parent Ford company, seeking to avoid the Chapter 11 bankruptcy that had already befallen General Motors and Chrysler, began abandoning overseas projects. Around July 2009 Ford Australia had received permission from Detroit to add a new small car to its Falcon production line. On 23 May 2013, Ford Australia announced that it would stop making cars after 88 years due to uncompetitive manufacturing costs and lacklustre sales. The carmaker's annual financial report, for the previous year, showed a loss of A$141m dollars (\u00a390m/$136m) after tax for the 2012 financial year. This followed a loss of A$290m in 2011 and a total loss of A$600m over the preceding five years, as a result, 1,200 staff would lose their jobs.<ref>{{cite news|last=.co.uk|first=Guardian|title=Ford Australia to stop making cars|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/23/ford-australia-stop-making-cars|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=23 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nFord had two main factories, both in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]: located in the [[Geelong]] suburb of [[Norlane, Victoria|Norlane]] and the northern Melbourne suburb of Campbellfield. The [[Ford Discovery Centre]], a museum of the history of the Ford Motor Company in Australia that was also located in Geelong, closed; the site is now been occupied by [[Deakin University]].\n\nFrom 1972 to 2016, Ford Falcons were fully Australian designed. It also produced the [[Ford Territory (Australia)|Territory]], which also ended production in 2016. Production of the Falcon ended with the closure of the Broadmeadows (Campbellfield) and Geelong engine and panel stamping plants. The Geelong factory produced its last Australian-made straight-six and V8 engines on 26 September 2016. Assembly at Broadmeadows ended on 7 October 2016.\n\n== Sites ==\n[[File:Ford stamping plant Geelong.jpg|thumb|Stamping plant at Geelong (closed 2016)]]\n\nFord has also designated as one of five (worldwide) full-service Regional Product Development Centre, specifically for the Asia Pacific and African regions. Products launched so far include the Ford Ikon and [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] in India and the [[Ford Bantam]] ute and [[Ford Ikon|Ikon]] (a sedan version of the Fiesta) in South Africa, and has also developed the new Ranger.<ref>[http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=23353 Ford Motor Company \u2013 Press Release \u2013 FORD AUSTRALIA ANNOUNCES MAJOR NEW PROJECTS<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612184143/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=23353 |date=12 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 January 2019, engineers and designers were among more than 100 workers to lose their jobs at Ford in Victoria. About 40 salaried workers, 75 hourly workers and 90 contractors across Ford bases in Broadmeadows, Lara and Geelong will be affected, the company confirmed, as the automaker further consolidates its operations. Ford's engineering work on its Ranger ute and other models \"will be led out of the United States\", the company said in a statement. Remaining Australian-based engineers will have a \"strategic role\" in developing a new medium-sized pick-up truck for Ford and the German brand, the automaker said.<ref>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/more-than-100-ford-jobs-cut-in-victoria.</ref>\n\n== Models produced ==\nFord Australia started by assembling Model Ts. As Ford introduced new models, these were assembled in Australia. During World War II, Ford Australia ceased producing cars to commence military production to support the war effort.\n\nAfter World War II, Ford recommenced assembly of imported Ford models. Initially, they assembled the UK sourced [[Ford Pilot|Pilot]], then a range of British cars, including the [[Ford Prefect|Prefect]], [[Ford Anglia|Anglia]], [[Ford Consul|Consul]], [[Ford Zephyr|Zephyr]] and [[Ford Zodiac|Zodiac]]. Ford also assembled the Canadian Ford V8.\n\n=== Hatchback ===\nThe [[Ford Laser]] was produced in Ford's plant at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] in Sydney, from 1981 until September 1994 when the plant closed, after which they were fully imported from Japan. The Laser was replaced by the [[Ford Focus]] in 2002. It is currently offered in sedan and hatchback variants with a 2.0L engine, which is one of the market leaders in sales. The [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]], a global Ford product, has also been offered since 2004.\n\n=== Mid-size ===\nMid-size cars assembled in Australia included the [[Ford Cortina]], [[Ford Capri|Capri]] and [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]], from the UK. These were adapted for the Australian market: for example, from 1972, the Cortina was available with the option of either a 3.3-litre or 4.1-litre six-cylinder engine, and the Escort could be offered across the range with the Cortina's 2.0-litre motor. In 1977, lack of capacity meant that the Cortina wagon was in fact assembled in [[Renault]]'s (now long since closed) Australian factory in [[Heidelberg, Victoria]].\n\nThe Cortina's replacement, the [[Mazda 626]]-based [[Ford Telstar|Telstar]], was initially assembled in Australia. In 1989 the Telstar sedan was replaced by the locally assembled [[Ford Corsair]] which was basically a rebadged [[Nissan Pintara]]. When Nissan shut down its Australian manufacturing operations in 1992 the Telstar nameplate was reintroduced, and as before it was a rebadged and respecced Mazda 626. In 1995 the Telstar was dropped in favour of the [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]], imported from [[Belgium]].\n\nFord Australia dropped the Mondeo in 2001, arguing at the time that the segment of the market in which it competed was in decline, but in 2007, it announced that it would introduce the new [[Ford Mondeo#Mk IV (2007)|Mk IV]] model in Australia.<ref>[http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/MiniSite/MiniSiteArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=36535&vf=28&MiniSiteID=4 Ford confirms Mondeo's return to Oz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111120434/http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/MiniSite/MiniSiteArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=36535&vf=28&MiniSiteID=4 |date=11 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Large car ===\n[[File:2015 Ford Falcon (FG X) G6E Turbo (2017-11-18) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] (1960\u20132016)]]\n\nThe Ford Falcon was manufactured in Australia according to its North American design, with the first model rolling off the production line at Ford's Broadmeadows plant on 28 June 1960. It differed little from the American design apart from conversion to [[right hand drive]], and the Falcon soon proved unable to cope on harsh Australian roads, sparking a massive effort to introduce running engineering changes to improve its reliability. By the mid-1960s, the car was substantially different from its North American cousin and was offered in sedan, wagon, coupe, utility and panel van styles.\n\nProduction of the North American Falcon, upon which the Falcon was now loosely based, ended in 1970, forcing Australia to go it alone on design. The first true all-Australian Ford Falcon arrived with the XA model in June 1972.\n\nThe Falcon had been an Australian automotive icon for most of its 56 years in production, playing a prominent part in Australian life, popular culture and motor racing. Falcons have served as taxis, police cars, family runabouts, transport for tradespeople and have been the winning car many times in the Australian Touring Car Championship and at the annual Bathurst 1000 touring car race, where the Falcon's reputation for engineering excellence was cemented by the early 1970s through the Falcon GT and GTHO muscle car variants.\n\nFord has manufactured more than four million units since 1960, and has topped the sales charts on many occasions. Until 2016, the Falcon line-up was offered in sedan and utility body styles, however in the past panel vans, station wagons, and hardtops were offered. Falcons had dominated the ranks of taxis in Australia and New Zealand, along with sister car, the Ford Fairlane. Performance variants of the Falcon have been used extensively for pursuit work for many years.\n\n=== Luxury car ===\nFord Australia produced a range of full-size luxury cars alongside the Falcon for most of its production history. These models were named the [[Ford Fairlane (Australia)|Fairlane]] and the LTD. The first Fairlane was released in 1959 and was an Australian assembled version of the [[1957 Ford|Fairlane]] from the USA. This process of assembling American cars would continue until 1967 where Ford Australia would design its own luxury car, the ZA Fairlane. The ZA Fairlane was heavily based on the existing XR Falcon with an extended wheelbase, longer boot and styling changes. The car was released to critical acclaim and quickly established the Australian luxury car market as its own.\n\nFord Fairlanes were preferred vehicles among politicians and businessmen and was seen as the pinnacle of Australian automotive engineering and prestige. The second generation of Fairlane, introduced in 1972 brought a new model into the Australian luxury car market, the LTD. The LTD in effect was a Fairlane with even more luxury features such as retractable headlights, a vinyl roof and an even longer wheelbase. From the third generation of Fairlane onwards, the LTD shared the same wheelbase and body as the Fairlane with it being pitched as a more luxurious version of the Fairlane rather than being a completely different car.\n\nThe Fairlane sat on top of the Australian luxury car sales charts for many decades before its gradual downfall starting in the late 1980s with the rising import of foreign luxury cars such as BMW and Mercedes Benz. By the turn of the millennium, the Fairlane had been overtaken by the [[Holden Caprice|Holden Statesman]] in sales.

It was founded in [[Geelong]], Victoria, in 1925 as an outpost of [[Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited]]. At that time, Ford Canada was a separate company from Ford USA. [[Henry Ford]] had granted the manufacturing rights of Ford motor vehicles in the British Empire (later the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]), except the United Kingdom, to Canadian investors.\n\nFord Australia's first products were Model Ts assembled from [[Complete knock down|complete knock-down (CKD) kits]] provided by Ford of Canada. It is best known in more recent times for having produced the [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]], originally a US model introduced in Australia in 1960, but adapted to Australian requirements and road conditions.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:TModel launch Geelong.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ford Model T]] parked outside the [[Geelong]] Library at its launch in Australia in 1925]]\n[[File:Ford geelong construction.jpg|thumb|right|The Ford Australia plant under construction in [[Geelong]], 1926.]]\n\nOn 31 March 1925, Ford announced that [[Geelong]], was to be the Australian headquarters. The first Australian-built Ford was a [[Ford Model T|Model T]] that came off an improvised production line in a disused Geelong wool storage warehouse in June 1925, while work started on a factory in the nearby suburb of Norlane. In 1928 the factory switched to the [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] and was followed by the [[1932 Ford|Ford V8]] in 1932.<ref name=gex150>{{cite book | author = Peter Begg | title = Geelong \u2013 The First 150 Years | publisher = Globe Press | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-9592863-5-7 | page = }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the company released a [[coupe utility]] based upon the Model A American Ford \"Closed Cab Pickup Truck\" that had been produced for 6 years from 1928. The local designer was Ford engineer [[Lewis Bandt|Louis (Lewis) Bandt]].<ref name=gex150 /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bandt-louis-thornett-lewis-12169/text21807|title=Bandt, Louis Thornett (Lewis) (1910\u20131987)  |author=Damian Veltri |publisher= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], National Centre of Biography, [[Australian National University]] |accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> During the [[Great Depression]], banks would not extend credit to farmers to purchase passenger cars- in the belief they were unnecessary luxuries. However, they would lend money for the purchase of \"working\" vehicles. The coupe utility fulfilled the need of farmers to have a workhorse which could also be used \"to take the wife to church on Sunday and the pigs to the market on Monday\".\n\nIn 1956, the company bought a large tract of land in the northern [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Campbellfield, Victoria|Campbellfield]], and in July 1961 announced that the new Melbourne factory would become the company headquarters.<ref name=gex150 />\n\nFord Australia is one of Ford's five product development centres globally, and will continue to design and develop cars and trucks for the Asia/Pacific region after the closure of the manufacturing arm. It was expected to retain about 1300 workers in Australia.<ref>http://www.motoring.com.au/ford-splits-australian-hq-49272/</ref>\n\n=== End of Australian production ===\nIn 2009, the parent Ford company, seeking to avoid the Chapter 11 bankruptcy that had already befallen General Motors and Chrysler, began abandoning overseas projects. Around July 2009 Ford Australia had received permission from Detroit to add a new small car to its Falcon production line. On 23 May 2013, Ford Australia announced that it would stop making cars after 88 years due to uncompetitive manufacturing costs and lacklustre sales. The carmaker's annual financial report, for the previous year, showed a loss of A$141m dollars (\u00a390m/$136m) after tax for the 2012 financial year. This followed a loss of A$290m in 2011 and a total loss of A$600m over the preceding five years, as a result, 1,200 staff would lose their jobs.<ref>{{cite news|last=.co.uk|first=Guardian|title=Ford Australia to stop making cars|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/23/ford-australia-stop-making-cars|location=London|work=The Guardian|date=23 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nFord had two main factories, both in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]]: located in the [[Geelong]] suburb of [[Norlane, Victoria|Norlane]] and the northern Melbourne suburb of Campbellfield. The [[Ford Discovery Centre]], a museum of the history of the Ford Motor Company in Australia that was also located in Geelong, closed; the site is now been occupied by [[Deakin University]].\n\nFrom 1972 to 2016, Ford Falcons were fully Australian designed. It also produced the [[Ford Territory (Australia)|Territory]], which also ended production in 2016. Production of the Falcon ended with the closure of the Broadmeadows (Campbellfield) and Geelong engine and panel stamping plants. The Geelong factory produced its last Australian-made straight-six and V8 engines on 26 September 2016. Assembly at Broadmeadows ended on 7 October 2016.\n\n== Sites ==\n[[File:Ford stamping plant Geelong.jpg|thumb|Stamping plant at Geelong (closed 2016)]]\n\nFord has also designated as one of five (worldwide) full-service Regional Product Development Centre, specifically for the Asia Pacific and African regions. Products launched so far include the Ford Ikon and [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] in India and the [[Ford Bantam]] ute and [[Ford Ikon|Ikon]] (a sedan version of the Fiesta) in South Africa, and has also developed the new Ranger.<ref>[http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=23353 Ford Motor Company \u2013 Press Release \u2013 FORD AUSTRALIA ANNOUNCES MAJOR NEW PROJECTS<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612184143/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=23353 |date=12 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 24 January 2019, engineers and designers were among more than 100 workers to lose their jobs at Ford in Victoria. About 40 salaried workers, 75 hourly workers and 90 contractors across Ford bases in Broadmeadows, Lara and Geelong will be affected, the company confirmed, as the automaker further consolidates its operations. Ford's engineering work on its Ranger ute and other models \"will be led out of the United States\", the company said in a statement. Remaining Australian-based engineers will have a \"strategic role\" in developing a new medium-sized pick-up truck for Ford and the German brand, the automaker said.<ref>https://www.sbs.com.au/news/more-than-100-ford-jobs-cut-in-victoria.</ref>\n\n== Models produced ==\nFord Australia started by assembling Model Ts. As Ford introduced new models, these were assembled in Australia. During World War II, Ford Australia ceased producing cars to commence military production to support the war effort.\n\nAfter World War II, Ford recommenced assembly of imported Ford models. Initially, they assembled the UK sourced [[Ford Pilot|Pilot]], then a range of British cars, including the [[Ford Prefect|Prefect]], [[Ford Anglia|Anglia]], [[Ford Consul|Consul]], [[Ford Zephyr|Zephyr]] and [[Ford Zodiac|Zodiac]]. Ford also assembled the Canadian Ford V8.\n\n=== Hatchback ===\nThe [[Ford Laser]] was produced in Ford's plant at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] in Sydney, from 1981 until September 1994 when the plant closed, after which they were fully imported from Japan. The Laser was replaced by the [[Ford Focus]] in 2002. It is currently offered in sedan and hatchback variants with a 2.0L engine, which is one of the market leaders in sales. The [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]], a global Ford product, has also been offered since 2004.\n\n=== Mid-size ===\nMid-size cars assembled in Australia included the [[Ford Cortina]], [[Ford Capri|Capri]] and [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]], from the UK. These were adapted for the Australian market: for example, from 1972, the Cortina was available with the option of either a 3.3-litre or 4.1-litre six-cylinder engine, and the Escort could be offered across the range with the Cortina's 2.0-litre motor. In 1977, lack of capacity meant that the Cortina wagon was in fact assembled in [[Renault]]'s (now long since closed) Australian factory in [[Heidelberg, Victoria]].\n\nThe Cortina's replacement, the [[Mazda 626]]-based [[Ford Telstar|Telstar]], was initially assembled in Australia. In 1989 the Telstar sedan was replaced by the locally assembled [[Ford Corsair]] which was basically a rebadged [[Nissan Pintara]]. When Nissan shut down its Australian manufacturing operations in 1992 the Telstar nameplate was reintroduced, and as before it was a rebadged and respecced Mazda 626. In 1995 the Telstar was dropped in favour of the [[Ford Mondeo|Mondeo]], imported from [[Belgium]].\n\nFord Australia dropped the Mondeo in 2001, arguing at the time that the segment of the market in which it competed was in decline, but in 2007, it announced that it would introduce the new [[Ford Mondeo#Mk IV (2007)|Mk IV]] model in Australia.<ref>[http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/MiniSite/MiniSiteArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=36535&vf=28&MiniSiteID=4 Ford confirms Mondeo's return to Oz] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111120434/http://www.drive.com.au/Editorial/MiniSite/MiniSiteArticleDetail.aspx?ArticleID=36535&vf=28&MiniSiteID=4 |date=11 November 2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Large car ===\n[[File:2015 Ford Falcon (FG X) G6E Turbo (2017-11-18) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Ford Falcon]] (1960\u20132016)]]\n\nThe Ford Falcon was manufactured in Australia according to its North American design, with the first model rolling off the production line at Ford's Broadmeadows plant on 28 June 1960. It differed little from the American design apart from conversion to [[right hand drive]], and the Falcon soon proved unable to cope on harsh Australian roads, sparking a massive effort to introduce running engineering changes to improve its reliability. By the mid-1960s, the car was substantially different from its North American cousin and was offered in sedan, wagon, coupe, utility and panel van styles.\n\nProduction of the North American Falcon, upon which the Falcon was now loosely based, ended in 1970, forcing Australia to go it alone on design. The first true all-Australian Ford Falcon arrived with the XA model in June 1972.\n\nThe Falcon had been an Australian automotive icon for most of its 56 years in production, playing a prominent part in Australian life, popular culture and motor racing. Falcons have served as taxis, police cars, family runabouts, transport for tradespeople and have been the winning car many times in the Australian Touring Car Championship and at the annual Bathurst 1000 touring car race, where the Falcon's reputation for engineering excellence was cemented by the early 1970s through the Falcon GT and GTHO muscle car variants.\n\nFord has manufactured more than four million units since 1960, and has topped the sales charts on many occasions. Until 2016, the Falcon line-up was offered in sedan and utility body styles, however in the past panel vans, station wagons, and hardtops were offered. Falcons had dominated the ranks of taxis in Australia and New Zealand, along with sister car, the Ford Fairlane. Performance variants of the Falcon have been used extensively for pursuit work for many years.\n\n=== Luxury car ===\nFord Australia produced a range of full-size luxury cars alongside the Falcon for most of its production history. These models were named the [[Ford Fairlane (Australia)|Fairlane]] and the LTD. The first Fairlane was released in 1959 and was an Australian assembled version of the [[1957 Ford|Fairlane]] from the USA. This process of assembling American cars would continue until 1967 where Ford Australia would design its own luxury car, the ZA Fairlane. The ZA Fairlane was heavily based on the existing XR Falcon with an extended wheelbase, longer boot and styling changes. The car was released to critical acclaim and quickly established the Australian luxury car market as its own.\n\nFord Fairlanes were preferred vehicles among politicians and businessmen and was seen as the pinnacle of Australian automotive engineering and prestige. The second generation of Fairlane, introduced in 1972 brought a new model into the Australian luxury car market, the LTD. The LTD in effect was a Fairlane with even more luxury features such as retractable headlights, a vinyl roof and an even longer wheelbase. From the third generation of Fairlane onwards, the LTD shared the same wheelbase and body as the Fairlane with it being pitched as a more luxurious version of the Fairlane rather than being a completely different car.\n\nThe Fairlane sat on top of the Australian luxury car sales charts for many decades before its gradual downfall starting in the late 1980s with the rising import of foreign luxury cars such as BMW and Mercedes Benz. By the turn of the millennium, the Fairlane had been overtaken by the [[Holden Caprice|Holden Statesman]] in sales. In 2007, Ford Australia announced it would be cancelling further production of the Fairlane and LTD beyond the 2007 model year, citing falling sales and an uncertain future in the full-size luxury market. With the backing of large volume foreign exports, this left the Holden Statesman and Caprice as the sole players in the full-size extended wheelbase Australian luxury car market until their demise in 2017.\n\n=== SUV ===\n[[File:2015 Ford Territory (SZ II) TX AWD wagon (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Territory (2004\u20132016)]]\n\nBetween 2004 and 2016, the [[Ford Territory (Australia)|Ford Territory]] had been built on the same production line as the Falcon.
