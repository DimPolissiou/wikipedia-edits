He was a farmer, soldier, monk, tanner and judge.  He contributed as an emissary in councils between [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and the colonies, especially Pennsylvania, during the 18th century's tensions of the [[French and Indian War]] (Seven Years' War).<ref>Sylvester, Joe. \"[https://www.dailyitem.com/news/historians-take-issue-with-penn-s-tavern-lore/article_2a5b3688-7ea6-11e5-8be9-a3b9bbd98cbe.html Historians take issue with Penn's tavern lore].\" Sunbury, Pennsylvania: ''The Daily Item'', October 29, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Early years==\nConrad Weiser was born in 1696 in the small village of Affst\u00e4tt in [[Herrenberg]], in the [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]] (now part of [[Germany|the Federal Republic of Germany]]), where his father ([[Johann Conrad Weiser, Sr.]]) was stationed as a member of the [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] Blue Dragoons.  Soon after Conrad's birth, his father was discharged from the Blue [[Dragoon]]<nowiki/>s and moved back to the family ancestral home of [[Aspach, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Gro\u00dfaspach]].  In 1709 the boy's mother, Anna Magdalena, died of fever. Their lands had been ravaged by repeated French invasions related to religious wars, there was pestilence, and they were weakened by an unusually cold and long winter.  Conrad Weiser (senior) wrote for his children, \"Buried beside Her Ancestors, she was a god-fearing woman and much loved by Her neighbors. Her motto was Jesus I live for thee, I die for thee, thine am I in life and death.\"<ref>Paul A. W. Wallace, ''Conrad Weiser, 1696-1760, Friend of Colonist and Mohawk''.

They traveled down the [[Rhine|Rhine River]] and then to England, which had offered some support for the Protestant refugees.  Thousands of [[German Palatines|Palatine German]] refugees made their way to London seeking escape from the harsh conditions; there were so many that the English had to make a camp for them outside the London walls for the winter.  The following year in 1710, the Crown (under Queen Anne) arranged for transport in ten ships of the nearly 3,000 Germans to the New York colony.  The Crown supported migration of the immigrants to help settle the New York colony.  The plan was that they would work off their passage in a form of indenture in camps devoted to producing ships' stores, such as tar and other materials. Later they would be allowed to trade their work for land.  Most of the Germans were first located in what were called the East and West Camps along the [[Hudson River]], near Livingston Manor.  It was not until 1723 that some 100 heads of families received land grants in the central [[Mohawk Valley]], under Governor Burnetsfield.\n\nWeiser senior managed to move his family to the [[Schoharie Valley]] earlier than that.  When Conrad was 16, his father agreed to a chief's proposal for the youth to live with the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] in the upper Schoharie Valley.  During his stay in the winter and spring of 1712-1713, Weiser learned much about the [[Mohawk language]] and the customs of the [[Iroquois]], while enduring hardships of cold, hunger, and homesickness.  Conrad Weiser returned to his own people toward the end of July 1713.\n\nOn November 22, 1720, at the age of 24, Weiser married Anna Eve Feck, a daughter of Johan Peter Feg and Anna Maria Risch. (Anna Eve Feck was born January 25, 1705 in Schoharie County, New York, and died June 11, 1781 in Womelsdorf, Berks County, Pennsylvania.) In 1725 the couple followed the [[Susquehanna River]] south out of New York and settled their young family on a farm in [[Womelsdorf, Pennsylvania]] near present-day [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]. The couple had fourteen children, of whom only seven reached adulthood.\n\n==Service==\n\n{{multiple image\n   | align     = right\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 215\n   | header    = <center>'''Conrad Weiser Signature'''</center>\n   | image1    = \n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = \n   | image2    = Conrad Weiser (signature).jpg\n   | alt2      = Conrad Weiser\n   | caption2  = Conrad Weiser signature\n}}\n\nWeiser's colonial service began in 1731.  The [[Iroquois]] sent [[Shikellamy]], an [[Onondaga (tribe)|Oneida]] chief, as an emissary to other tribes and the British.  Shikellamy lived on the [[Susquehanna River]] at [[Shamokin (village)|Shamokin village]], near present-day [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania]].  An oral tradition holds that Weiser met Shikellamy while hunting.  In any case, the two became friends.  When Shikellamy traveled to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] for a council with the province of [[Pennsylvania]], he brought Weiser with him.  The Iroquois trusted him and considered him an adopted son of the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]].  Weiser impressed the Pennsylvania governor and council, which thereafter relied heavily on his services as an interpreter.  Weiser also interpreted in a follow-up council in Philadelphia in August, 1732.\n\nDuring the treaty in Philadelphia of 1736, Shikellamy, Weiser, and the Pennsylvanians negotiated a deed whereby the Iroquois sold the land drained by the [[Delaware River]] and south of the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]].  Since the Iroquois had not until then laid claim to this land, Pennsylvania's agreement to purchase from them represented a significant change in the colony's policy toward the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s.  [[William Penn]], who had died in 1718, had never taken sides in disputes between tribes.  By this formal purchase, the Pennsylvanians were favoring the Iroquois over the claims of the Lenape/Delawares for the same land.  Along with the [[Walking Purchase]] of the following year, this treaty (entered into by Penn's sons) exacerbated Pennsylvania-[[Lenape]] relations.  The Lenape became disenchanted with the English colonials as a result; during the [[French and Indian Wars]], they sided with the French and took part in actions against the colonists, causing many deaths. Penn's purchase persuaded the Six Nations of the [[Iroquois]] to continue to side with the British over the French.\n\nDuring the winter of 1737, beginning February 27, Weiser was commissioned by Virginia Governor [[Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet|William Gooch]] to attempt to broker a peace between southern tribes and the Iroquois. He and his German companion, Stoffel Stump, had to survive high snow, freezing temperatures, and starvation rations to make the six-week journey in winter to what was considered the Iroquois capital at [[Onondaga (village)|Onondaga]]. Weiser persuaded the Iroquois not to send any war parties in the spring, but failed to convince them to send emissaries to parlay with the southern tribes.<ref name=Walton>{{cite web|last=Walton|first=Joseph Solomon|title=Conrad Weiser and the Indian policy of colonial Pennsylvania|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pitttext;cc=pitttext;xc=1;g=pitttextall;type=simple;q1=gooch;sort=occur;didno=00aee8104m;rgn=full%20text;idno=00aee8104m;view=image;seq=0043;node=00aee8104m%3A1.11|work=Historic Pittsburgh Text Collection|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> Impressed with his fortitude, the [[Iroquois]] named Weiser ''Tarachiawagon'' (Holder of the Heavens).  Spill-over violence from a war between the Iroquois and southern tribes such as the [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] would have drawn first Virginia, and then Pennsylvania, into conflict with the Iroquois.  Therefore, this peace-brokering had a profound effect on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]/colonial relations.\n\nIn 1742, Weiser interpreted at a treaty meeting between the [[Iroquois]] and English colonials at Philadelphia, when they were paid for the land purchased in 1736.  During this council, the Iroquois [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] chief [[Canasatego]] castigated the [[Lenape]]/Delawares for engaging in land sales.  He ordered them to remove their settlements to either Wyoming or [[Shamokin (village)|Shamokin village]].  This accelerated the [[Lenape]] migration to the Ohio Valley, which had begun as early as the 1720s.  There, they were positioned to trade with the French.  At the same time, they launched raids as far east as the [[Susquehanna River]] during the [[French and Indian Wars]].\n\nIn 1744, Weiser acted as the interpreter for the [[Treaty of Lancaster]], between representatives of the [[Iroquois]] and the colonies of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]].  During the final day of the treaty council, on July 4, Canasatego, a chief of the [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], spoke about the Iroquois concepts of political unity:\n\n<blockquote>Our wise forefathers established Union and Amity between the Five Nations.  This has made us formidable; this has given us great Weight and Authority with our neighboring Nations. We are a powerful Confederacy; and by your observing the same methods, our wise forefathers have taken, you will acquire such Strength and power. Therefore whatever befalls you, never fall out with one another.</blockquote>\n\n[[Benjamin Franklin]] printed this speech, which influenced American concepts of political unity.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Lancaster, Virginia and Pennsylvania colonial officials acted as if the Iroquois had sold them settlement rights to the Ohio Valley, but the Iroquois did not believe they had done so.  In 1748, Pennsylvania sent Conrad Weiser to [[Logstown]], a council and trade village on the [[Ohio River]].  Here he held council with chiefs representing 10 tribes, including [[Delawares]], [[Shawnees]], and the nations of the [[Iroquois]].  He arrived at a treaty of friendship between Pennsylvania and these tribes. Threatened by this development and the continued activity of British traders in the Ohio Valley, the French redoubled their diplomatic efforts. In addition, they began to build a string of forts to protect their interests, culminating in [[Fort Duquesne]] in 1754, where present-day [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] later developed.\n\nIn 1750, Weiser traveled again to [[Onondaga (village)|Onondaga]], where he found the political dynamics in the Six Nations had shifted.  Canasatego, always pro-British, had died.  Several [[Iroquois]] tribes were leaning toward the French, although the [[mohawk nation|Mohawk]] remained pro-British.\n\nEarly in the summer of 1754, on the eve of the eruption in the colonies of tensions from the [[Seven Years' War]], called the [[French and Indian War]] in North America, Weiser was a member of a Pennsylvania delegation to Albany. The English government had called the meeting, hoping to win assurances of [[Iroquois]] support in the looming war with the French. The [[Iroquois]] and seven colonies sent representatives.  Because of divisions within both the British and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ranks, the council did not result in the treaty of support which the crown desired. Instead, each colony made the best deal it could with individual [[Iroquois]] leaders. Not only did no single person speak for the Iroquois League, but bands in each nation acted in decentralized ways in this and other wars.\n\nConrad Weiser negotiated one of the more successful agreements. Some lower-level chiefs deeded to the colony most of the land remaining in present-day Pennsylvania, including the southwestern part that Virginia was also still claiming. \n\nIn 1756, the government appointed Weiser and [[Ben Franklin]] to lead construction of a series of forts between the Delaware River and the Susquehanna River. In the fall of 1758, Weiser attended a council at [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]. Colonial leaders from Pennsylvania met with the Iroquois and other Native American tribes. Weiser helped smooth over the tense meeting. With the [[Treaty of Easton]], the tribes in the Ohio Valley agreed to abandon support for the French. This collapse of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] support was a factor in the French decision to demolish [[Fort Duquesne]] and withdraw from the Forks of the Ohio.\n\nThroughout his decades-long career, Weiser built on his knowledge of Native American languages and culture to become a key player in treaty negotiations, land purchases, and the formulation of Pennsylvania's policies towards Native Americans. Because of his early experiences with the [[Iroquois]], Weiser was inclined to be sympathetic to their interpretation of events, as opposed to the Lenape or the Shawnee. This may have exacerbated [[Pennsylvania]]n-[[Lenape]]/[[Shawnee]] relations, with bloody consequences in the [[French and Indian Wars]].\n\nBut for many years, Weiser helped to keep the powerful Iroquois allied with the British as opposed to the French.  This important service contributed to the continued survival of the British colonies and the eventual victory of the British over the French in the French and Indian Wars.\n\n==Other careers==\n\n[[File:Conrad Weiser Homestead.jpg|thumb|left|Conrad Weiser Homestead, Womelsdorf, Berks County, PA]]\n\nBetween 1734 and 1741, Weiser became a follower of [[Conrad Beissel]], a German Seventh Day Baptist preacher.  For six years, he lived at the monastic settlement, [[Ephrata Cloister]], in the [[Ephrata Township, Pennsylvania|Ephrata Township]], [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}  His wife lived there only a few months before returning to their farm.  Weiser visited her frequently enough to father four more children.  In addition, he took leaves of absence from the monastery for diplomatic duties, such as those in 1736 and 1737.\n\nLike many other colonists, Weiser combined farming with other trades: tanner, merchant, land owner and speculator.  He drew the plan for the town of Reading in 1748, was a key figure in the creation of [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] in 1752, and served as its chief judge until 1760.  Conrad Weiser was also a teacher and a lay minister of the [[Lutheran Church]], and one of the founders of [[Trinity Lutheran Church (Reading, Pennsylvania)|Trinity Church]] in Reading.\n\nIn 1756, during the [[French and Indian War]], the [[Lenape]] began to raid central Pennsylvania.  When the colony organized a militia, its leaders appointed Weiser as a Lt. Colonel. Working with [[Benjamin Franklin]], he planned and established a series of forts between the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and [[Susquehanna River]]s.  When General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|Forbes]] evicted the French from [[Fort Duquesne]] in 1758, the threat subsided and Britain later gained all territory east of the [[Mississippi River]] at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] following their [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|success in the Seven Years War]].\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Life and times of Conrad Weiser - the first representative man of Berks County (1893) (14750432156).jpg|thumb|Tombstone]]\nWeiser died on his farm on July 13, 1760, and was buried on a small hill slightly west of his home.<ref>Interpretive brochure at no. 6, available at {{cite web |url=http://www.conradweiserhomestead.org/virtualtour.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922104107/http://conradweiserhomestead.org/virtualtour.htm |archivedate=2014-09-22 }}</ref> Upon his death, one Iroquois noted to a group of colonists, \"We are at a great loss and sit in darkness...as since his death we cannot so well understand one another.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Indeed, shortly after Conrad Weiser's death, relations between the colonists and the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] began a rapid decline.\n\nWeiser's will bequeathed about 4,000 acres (16&nbsp;km\u00b2) and part of his farm to Berks County.

They traveled down the [[Rhine|Rhine River]] and then to England, which had offered some support for the Protestant refugees.  Thousands of [[German Palatines|Palatine German]] refugees made their way to London seeking escape from the harsh conditions; there were so many that the English had to make a camp for them outside the London walls for the winter.  The following year in 1710, the Crown (under Queen Anne) arranged for transport in ten ships of the nearly 3,000 Germans to the New York colony.  The Crown supported migration of the immigrants to help settle the New York colony.  The plan was that they would work off their passage in a form of indenture in camps devoted to producing ships' stores, such as tar and other materials. Later they would be allowed to trade their work for land.  Most of the Germans were first located in what were called the East and West Camps along the [[Hudson River]], near Livingston Manor.  It was not until 1723 that some 100 heads of families received land grants in the central [[Mohawk Valley]], under Governor Burnetsfield.\n\nWeiser senior managed to move his family to the [[Schoharie Valley]] earlier than that.

During his stay in the winter and spring of 1712-1713, Weiser learned much about the [[Mohawk language]] and the customs of the [[Iroquois]], while enduring hardships of cold, hunger, and homesickness.  Conrad Weiser returned to his own people toward the end of July 1713.\n\nOn November 22, 1720, at the age of 24, Weiser married Anna Eve Feck, a daughter of Johan Peter Feg and Anna Maria Risch. (Anna Eve Feck was born January 25, 1705 in Schoharie County, New York, and died June 11, 1781 in Womelsdorf, Berks County, Pennsylvania.) In 1725 the couple followed the [[Susquehanna River]] south out of New York and settled their young family on a farm in [[Womelsdorf, Pennsylvania]] near present-day [[Reading, Pennsylvania|Reading]]. The couple had fourteen children, of whom only seven reached adulthood.\n\n==Service==\n\n{{multiple image\n   | align     = right\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 215\n   | header    = <center>'''Conrad Weiser Signature'''</center>\n   | image1    = \n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = \n   | image2    = Conrad Weiser (signature).jpg\n   | alt2      = Conrad Weiser\n   | caption2  = Conrad Weiser signature\n}}\n\nWeiser's colonial service began in 1731.  The [[Iroquois]] sent [[Shikellamy]], an [[Onondaga (tribe)|Oneida]] chief, as an emissary to other tribes and the British.  Shikellamy lived on the [[Susquehanna River]] at [[Shamokin (village)|Shamokin village]], near present-day [[Sunbury, Pennsylvania]].  An oral tradition holds that Weiser met Shikellamy while hunting.  In any case, the two became friends.  When Shikellamy traveled to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] for a council with the province of [[Pennsylvania]], he brought Weiser with him.  The Iroquois trusted him and considered him an adopted son of the [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]].  Weiser impressed the Pennsylvania governor and council, which thereafter relied heavily on his services as an interpreter.  Weiser also interpreted in a follow-up council in Philadelphia in August, 1732.\n\nDuring the treaty in Philadelphia of 1736, Shikellamy, Weiser, and the Pennsylvanians negotiated a deed whereby the Iroquois sold the land drained by the [[Delaware River]] and south of the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]].  Since the Iroquois had not until then laid claim to this land, Pennsylvania's agreement to purchase from them represented a significant change in the colony's policy toward the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s.  [[William Penn]], who had died in 1718, had never taken sides in disputes between tribes.  By this formal purchase, the Pennsylvanians were favoring the Iroquois over the claims of the Lenape/Delawares for the same land.  Along with the [[Walking Purchase]] of the following year, this treaty (entered into by Penn's sons) exacerbated Pennsylvania-[[Lenape]] relations.  The Lenape became disenchanted with the English colonials as a result; during the [[French and Indian Wars]], they sided with the French and took part in actions against the colonists, causing many deaths. Penn's purchase persuaded the Six Nations of the [[Iroquois]] to continue to side with the British over the French.\n\nDuring the winter of 1737, beginning February 27, Weiser was commissioned by Virginia Governor [[Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet|William Gooch]] to attempt to broker a peace between southern tribes and the Iroquois. He and his German companion, Stoffel Stump, had to survive high snow, freezing temperatures, and starvation rations to make the six-week journey in winter to what was considered the Iroquois capital at [[Onondaga (village)|Onondaga]]. Weiser persuaded the Iroquois not to send any war parties in the spring, but failed to convince them to send emissaries to parlay with the southern tribes.<ref name=Walton>{{cite web|last=Walton|first=Joseph Solomon|title=Conrad Weiser and the Indian policy of colonial Pennsylvania|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pitttext;cc=pitttext;xc=1;g=pitttextall;type=simple;q1=gooch;sort=occur;didno=00aee8104m;rgn=full%20text;idno=00aee8104m;view=image;seq=0043;node=00aee8104m%3A1.11|work=Historic Pittsburgh Text Collection|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> Impressed with his fortitude, the [[Iroquois]] named Weiser ''Tarachiawagon'' (Holder of the Heavens).  Spill-over violence from a war between the Iroquois and southern tribes such as the [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]] would have drawn first Virginia, and then Pennsylvania, into conflict with the Iroquois.  Therefore, this peace-brokering had a profound effect on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]/colonial relations.\n\nIn 1742, Weiser interpreted at a treaty meeting between the [[Iroquois]] and English colonials at Philadelphia, when they were paid for the land purchased in 1736.  During this council, the Iroquois [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] chief [[Canasatego]] castigated the [[Lenape]]/Delawares for engaging in land sales.  He ordered them to remove their settlements to either Wyoming or [[Shamokin (village)|Shamokin village]].  This accelerated the [[Lenape]] migration to the Ohio Valley, which had begun as early as the 1720s.  There, they were positioned to trade with the French.  At the same time, they launched raids as far east as the [[Susquehanna River]] during the [[French and Indian Wars]].\n\nIn 1744, Weiser acted as the interpreter for the [[Treaty of Lancaster]], between representatives of the [[Iroquois]] and the colonies of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]].  During the final day of the treaty council, on July 4, Canasatego, a chief of the [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]], spoke about the Iroquois concepts of political unity:\n\n<blockquote>Our wise forefathers established Union and Amity between the Five Nations.  This has made us formidable; this has given us great Weight and Authority with our neighboring Nations. We are a powerful Confederacy; and by your observing the same methods, our wise forefathers have taken, you will acquire such Strength and power. Therefore whatever befalls you, never fall out with one another.</blockquote>\n\n[[Benjamin Franklin]] printed this speech, which influenced American concepts of political unity.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Lancaster, Virginia and Pennsylvania colonial officials acted as if the Iroquois had sold them settlement rights to the Ohio Valley, but the Iroquois did not believe they had done so.  In 1748, Pennsylvania sent Conrad Weiser to [[Logstown]], a council and trade village on the [[Ohio River]].  Here he held council with chiefs representing 10 tribes, including [[Delawares]], [[Shawnees]], and the nations of the [[Iroquois]].  He arrived at a treaty of friendship between Pennsylvania and these tribes. Threatened by this development and the continued activity of British traders in the Ohio Valley, the French redoubled their diplomatic efforts. In addition, they began to build a string of forts to protect their interests, culminating in [[Fort Duquesne]] in 1754, where present-day [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] later developed.\n\nIn 1750, Weiser traveled again to [[Onondaga (village)|Onondaga]], where he found the political dynamics in the Six Nations had shifted.  Canasatego, always pro-British, had died.  Several [[Iroquois]] tribes were leaning toward the French, although the [[mohawk nation|Mohawk]] remained pro-British.\n\nEarly in the summer of 1754, on the eve of the eruption in the colonies of tensions from the [[Seven Years' War]], called the [[French and Indian War]] in North America, Weiser was a member of a Pennsylvania delegation to Albany. The English government had called the meeting, hoping to win assurances of [[Iroquois]] support in the looming war with the French. The [[Iroquois]] and seven colonies sent representatives.  Because of divisions within both the British and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ranks, the council did not result in the treaty of support which the crown desired. Instead, each colony made the best deal it could with individual [[Iroquois]] leaders. Not only did no single person speak for the Iroquois League, but bands in each nation acted in decentralized ways in this and other wars.\n\nConrad Weiser negotiated one of the more successful agreements. Some lower-level chiefs deeded to the colony most of the land remaining in present-day Pennsylvania, including the southwestern part that Virginia was also still claiming. \n\nIn 1756, the government appointed Weiser and [[Ben Franklin]] to lead construction of a series of forts between the Delaware River and the Susquehanna River. In the fall of 1758, Weiser attended a council at [[Easton, Pennsylvania]]. Colonial leaders from Pennsylvania met with the Iroquois and other Native American tribes. Weiser helped smooth over the tense meeting. With the [[Treaty of Easton]], the tribes in the Ohio Valley agreed to abandon support for the French. This collapse of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] support was a factor in the French decision to demolish [[Fort Duquesne]] and withdraw from the Forks of the Ohio.\n\nThroughout his decades-long career, Weiser built on his knowledge of Native American languages and culture to become a key player in treaty negotiations, land purchases, and the formulation of Pennsylvania's policies towards Native Americans. Because of his early experiences with the [[Iroquois]], Weiser was inclined to be sympathetic to their interpretation of events, as opposed to the Lenape or the Shawnee. This may have exacerbated [[Pennsylvania]]n-[[Lenape]]/[[Shawnee]] relations, with bloody consequences in the [[French and Indian Wars]].\n\nBut for many years, Weiser helped to keep the powerful Iroquois allied with the British as opposed to the French.  This important service contributed to the continued survival of the British colonies and the eventual victory of the British over the French in the French and Indian Wars.\n\n==Other careers==\n\n[[File:Conrad Weiser Homestead.jpg|thumb|left|Conrad Weiser Homestead, Womelsdorf, Berks County, PA]]\n\nBetween 1734 and 1741, Weiser became a follower of [[Conrad Beissel]], a German Seventh Day Baptist preacher.  For six years, he lived at the monastic settlement, [[Ephrata Cloister]], in the [[Ephrata Township, Pennsylvania|Ephrata Township]], [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}  His wife lived there only a few months before returning to their farm.  Weiser visited her frequently enough to father four more children.  In addition, he took leaves of absence from the monastery for diplomatic duties, such as those in 1736 and 1737.\n\nLike many other colonists, Weiser combined farming with other trades: tanner, merchant, land owner and speculator.  He drew the plan for the town of Reading in 1748, was a key figure in the creation of [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks County]] in 1752, and served as its chief judge until 1760.  Conrad Weiser was also a teacher and a lay minister of the [[Lutheran Church]], and one of the founders of [[Trinity Lutheran Church (Reading, Pennsylvania)|Trinity Church]] in Reading.\n\nIn 1756, during the [[French and Indian War]], the [[Lenape]] began to raid central Pennsylvania.  When the colony organized a militia, its leaders appointed Weiser as a Lt. Colonel. Working with [[Benjamin Franklin]], he planned and established a series of forts between the [[Delaware River|Delaware]] and [[Susquehanna River]]s.  When General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|Forbes]] evicted the French from [[Fort Duquesne]] in 1758, the threat subsided and Britain later gained all territory east of the [[Mississippi River]] at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] following their [[Great Britain in the Seven Years War|success in the Seven Years War]].\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Life and times of Conrad Weiser - the first representative man of Berks County (1893) (14750432156).jpg|thumb|Tombstone]]\nWeiser died on his farm on July 13, 1760, and was buried on a small hill slightly west of his home.<ref>Interpretive brochure at no. 6, available at {{cite web |url=http://www.conradweiserhomestead.org/virtualtour.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922104107/http://conradweiserhomestead.org/virtualtour.htm |archivedate=2014-09-22 }}</ref> Upon his death, one Iroquois noted to a group of colonists, \"We are at a great loss and sit in darkness...as since his death we cannot so well understand one another.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  Indeed, shortly after Conrad Weiser's death, relations between the colonists and the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] began a rapid decline.\n\nWeiser's will bequeathed about 4,000 acres (16&nbsp;km\u00b2) and part of his farm to Berks County.

Most of the later games, from ''WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role'' to ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2006'' used the aforementioned control scheme. When ''WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007'' was released, new game mechanics were introduced, in which a new control scheme altered the grappling system of the game, called \"Ultimate Control moves.\" Unlike the previous games, where the player pressed two buttons to perform a grapple or an attack, players were able to place their opponents into a grapple position and then choose to perform a move by moving the directional buttons of their system's controller. For example, the player could place their opponent in a [[suplex]] grappling position and then either perform a normal suplex or an [[Suplex#Inverted suplex slam|inverted suplex slam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/744/744193p1.html|title=''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007'' Game Review|last=Dunham|first=Jeremey|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 11, 2008|date=November 6, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/smackdownvsraw2007/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabs&tag=tabs;reviews|title=''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007'' Online Review|last=Navarro|first=Alex|publisher=[[Game Spot]]|accessdate=June 11, 2008|date=November 6, 2006}}</ref> Before the release of ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008'', in order for players to force a superstar to [[professional wrestling#Submission|submit]], they had to tap buttons to move a marker towards the end of the meter labeled \"Submit\", and the only way for opponents to escape was for them to move the meter towards \"Escape\". Included with the release of ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008'' was a new submission system, in which the player had to move the [[analog stick]]s of their system's controller in different directions to force the opponent to submit, while the opponent could do the same to escape the [[professional wrestling holds|submission hold]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://games.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1692/WWE-SmackDown-vs-RAW-2008/|title=''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008''|publisher=Team Xbox|accessdate=June 11, 2008|quote=A brand new Struggle Submission System will give players intuitive and natural control over their WWE Superstars by using the game's popular analog controls.

There are four ways to win a match in every game: by [[pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]], submission, [[knockout]], [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]]; alternatively, the match could end in a [[Professional wrestling#No contest|draw]].

With the \"dirty\" or \"clean\" option comes the inclusion of performing a special maneuver when playing. Players using a \"dirty\" superstar must direct their superstar into building up their \"dirty\" meter by performing \"dirty\" tactics, such as attacking the referee or taking the pad off the [[wrestling ring|ring]]'s [[turnbuckle]]. Unlike performing dirty tactics, \"clean\" superstars build their meters by performing \"clean\" tactics, such as an [[professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial technique]] or performing a [[taunt]].

The meter increases, however, when the player does nothing with the superstar or holds down a selected button that increased the stamina, which varied depending on the player's system. When the superstar's stamina was low, the wrestler reacted by moving slower when performing moves, walking, and running.

Characters now perform different moves based on their opponent's current physical state. Players now have a window of opportunity to attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble]] eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the [[pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] meter from the past games has been reworked to make it more difficult to kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game's [[artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] has also been adjusted to prevent players from [[Spam (gaming)|overusing]] the same move. In addition, the ability to store [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Finisher|finishing moves]] has returned. \"Dynamic Comebacks\" gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New \"wake up taunts\" bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as pounding on the ground before [[Cutter (professional wrestling)|RKO]] finishing maneuver).<ref name=IGN>{{cite web | url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/117/1171523p1.html | title=E3 2011: WWE '12 Release Date and Cover \u2013 PlayStation 3 News at IGN |work=[[IGN]]|date=2011-05-31| accessdate=2011-05-31}}</ref> Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a \"Breaking Point\" submission [[minigame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''WWE '12'' Dated and Detailed|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-05-31-wwe-12-dated-and-detailed|publisher=Eurogamer|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> OMG! moments were introduced to ''[[WWE '13]]''. These are moves than can be performed in certain situations with certain superstars when a finisher is obtained. An example of this is Mark Henry superplexing the Big Show, making the ring break and the match stop. Better weight detection was implemented to ''WWE '13'', so that small superstars such as [[Rey Mysterio]] are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the [[Big Show]], super heavyweights like  now have different frames to better capture their enormous size. Pinning is now not only influenced by damage, but the power of the move that was previously executed. In ''WWE '13'' alongside selecting arenas, characters and the number of finishing moves available at the start of a match (a new option, which can range from 0 to Infinite), players will be able to adjust a setting called 'Match Experience'. Three settings \u2013 \"Quick\", \"Normal\" and \"Epic\" \u2013 will affect the overall pacing of a fight, independent of AI difficulty. Factors such as momentum, damage, enemy aggressiveness and even kick out and reversal rates will be affected.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo overhaul the gameplay of the series, ''2K15'' features five times the animation data of ''WWE&nbsp;2K14'', containing over fifty days work of motion capture by the WWE superstars. Over four times the amount of dialogue for commentary was recorded. The general gameplay of the game too has been revised, with the wrestlers being divided once more into classes, as was present in the Smackdown vs. Raw series. This creates what is known as \"in ring psychology\". The classes (brawlers, giants, grapplers and high-flyers) all provide different and unique sensations within the game to provide more diverse mechanics. In addition, the game's overall core mechanics have been fundamentally altered.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K16'' introduces Working Holds, which allows the player to go through a collar-elbow tie-up situation in order to either damage the opponent or regain stamina to reverse the tide in the match. Dirty Pins now come in various animations and also A.I. for the referee is improved; for example, they break up collar-elbow tie-ups when the wrestlers are holding each other at the corner for too long. The Reversal Limit system was introduced to prevent players from reversing throughout the match, they come as minor and major ones depending on the class of the wrestler/diva. This method can be toggled on/off in the Options section.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K17'' retains the control scheme from the previous title but implements two styles of submissions. Ladders can now be propped many of ways, OMG's such as Kevin Owens' Apron Pop Up Powerbomb makes its debut and a new mini-game involving the Money in the Bank Briefcase to name a few features changes the aesthetics to ladder matches.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K18'' re-works the carrying system. High Flying moves such as elbow drops are performed faster and attack animations are massively improved. There's also new corner finishers such as Randy Orton's Corner RKO and John Cena's Corner AA.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K19'' introduces the Payback engine, which gives advantages after being down in a match to reverse the tide such as Auto Reversal, spraying Green Mist or storing finishers to name a few.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K20'' streamlines the controls for newbie players yet more concise and simple for the veterans. Paybacks make their return with tweaks and new versions of paybacks are introduced.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Story modes===\nIn the ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw'' series, the player was able to choose a \"superstar\" from a [[List of WWE personnel|roster]] and compete in an arcade-like feature called season mode. In season mode, players direct their superstars through different career obstacles through a year of WWE programming to gain respect with other superstars and popularity among the fans. Like superstars from WWE, the superstars in the ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw'' series season mode are involved in storylines that affect their career mode in some way. Beginning with the release of ''WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth'', the [[WWE Brand Extension]] has been included in season mode, and superstars are exclusive to one brand of WWE. A result of this feature is that the player's superstar may only wrestle superstars and compete for championships from the same brand on which he is a part of. In season mode, the player's superstar has the ability to earn and wrestle for a variety of [[championship (professional wrestling)|championships]] based on actual [[List of current champions in WWE|WWE Championships]]. When superstars win championships, their respect and popularity increase, which also increases their involvement in [[card (sports)#Main event|main event]] matches. As the superstar's respect and popularity increases through the year of WWE programming, it becomes more likely for the player to achieve the main goal in season mode, which is to earn a [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] or [[WWE Championship]] match at [[WrestleMania]], the WWE's flagship [[pay-per-view]] event and the final stage in season mode. After the final stage, season modes begins again with the same superstar chosen before, though the player has the option of switching superstars. The superstar is then a part of the [[WWE Draft Lottery]] and is assigned to a brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/375/375004p1.html|title=WWE SmackDown!: Season Mode|date=October 22, 2002|author=IGN Staff|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 11, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"SeasonMode2\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/375/375004p2.html|title=WWE SmackDown!: Season Mode |date=October 22, 2002|author=IGN Staff|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSeason mode was replaced with Road to [[WrestleMania]] in ''[[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009]]'', and remained in the games until [[WWE '12]]. In this mode, players could choose from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storylines]]. The difference is that each storyline is tailor-made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode is a more authentic experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nRoad to WrestleMania was replaced with Attitude Era Mode in ''[[WWE '13]]''. This single-player mode is an abridged recreation of a memorable time in sports entertainment, allowing players to journey through various storylines as eight of the most popular superstars of that time, including [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin]] and Dwayne \"[[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]\" Johnson.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe chapter-based saga moves through WWE's struggle and eventual triumph during the \"Monday Night Wars,\" which saw the company on the brink of defeat at the hands of a powerful rival, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]. Told from the perspective of the WWE during that period, matches and in-game cutscenes are supplemented by video packages assembled by WWE's own editors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn ''[[WWE 2K14]]'', a single player campaign titled \"The 30 Years of WrestleMania\" was introduced, a nostalgic gameplay mode that recreates nearly three decades of WWE history, including 46 matches, classic WWE footage and many legendary characters. The mode features a distinct roster of wrestlers and alternate [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmicks]], who wrestled at WrestleMania. In this mode matches have primary objectives, required to beat the game, and bonus historical objectives, which result in recreated WrestleMania moments. Sometimes the player must follow a guided sequence of inputs, rather than freely control the character. The player competes through storylines of various lengths, switching predetermined characters as they are completed. Each chapter has its own title and focus; \"Hulkamania Runs Wild\" focuses on [[Hulk Hogan]] and early WrestleManias, while \"The New Generation\" showcases the rise of [[Bret Hart]] and [[Shawn Michaels]] in the mid-1990s. The \"Attitude Era\" chapter brings back some matches from WWE '13's \"Attitude Era\" mode, as well as some not covered before. The \"Ruthless Aggression\" chapter focuses on the departure of The Rock, lessened focus on [[Triple H]] and rise of [[Randy Orton]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. The final \"Universe Era\" chapter focuses on the rise of [[John Cena]] and the returns of The Rock and [[Brock Lesnar]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''[[WWE 2K15]]'' features the 2K Showcase, the core stories include [[CM Punk]] vs. John Cena and Triple H vs. [[Shawn Michaels]]. These rivalries detail from 2002 to 2004 (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) and 2011 to 2013 (CM Punk and John Cena). Three other stories which were included as DLC include The Path of the Warrior, a highlight behind the life of [[The Ultimate Warrior]] and his meteoric rise concentrating on championships to the [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] as commemoration. The Hall of Pain, a story behind the World's Strongest Man, [[Mark Henry]] as he punished many to become the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] and attempts to gain the [[WWE Championship]]. Lastly, the One More Match story stars [[Christian Cage|Christian]], as he complained about having one more match as his way of getting multiple second chances of earning the World Heavyweight Championship. Originally, these stories were meant to be produced for ''WWE&nbsp;'12'', ''WWE&nbsp;'13'' & ''WWE&nbsp;2K14'', but the developers chose to use ''WWE&nbsp;'12'' for Road to Wrestlemania, the Attitude Era for {{nowrap|''WWE '13''}} and 30 years of WrestleMania for {{nowrap|''WWE 2K14''}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''[[WWE 2K16]]'' details the historical career of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, from his days in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]], when he was angry that things were not going to happen in a good sense for him, to WCW, when he and [[Brian Pillman]] began to become [[The_Hollywood_Blonds#Steve_Austin_and_Brian_Pillman|The_Hollywood_Blonds]] leading to Austin suffering injury and going through a rub shot in WWE as Stone Cold, an anti-hero that was not going to be tame into a corporate man. Video Packages contain commentary that was remixed from ''WWE '13'' and ''WWE 2K14'' with the exception of some not documented before. Through DLC, the WWE Hall of Fame showcase contains what if matches and some from WCW; these matches were announced on Oct 7th 2015 and to be released alongside the Deluxe Editions of the video game.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''[[WWE 2K17]]'' discontinued the 2K Showcase Mode for the physical disc version but later made one for the 2016 Hall of Fame.

It allows the player to act as the General Manager of the ''[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]'' or ''[[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]'' brands (or ''[[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]'' in ''WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008''). After choosing a brand, and selecting to participate in the WWE Draft, or using a default roster, players then start a calendar year of hiring and managing Superstars and Divas, booking matches, establishing rivalries, and other options to try and win WWE fans to support your brand. Players must manage finances, contract or release Superstars & try to make better matches than their rival brands. At the end of the year at ''WrestleMania'', [[Vince McMahon]] will give ''The General Manager of the Year'' award to the show that was able to hold the most fans.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn ''WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008'', GM Mode was combined into one game mode called ''WWE 24/7 Mode''. This basically allowed Superstars to train, make special appearances or other actions between matches during full calendar years. After achieving specific goals through the game, a percentage will increase of becoming a ''WWE Hall of Famer / General Manager of the Year'' winner, and the mode does not end until this percentage reaches 100%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThis mode was discontinued in ''WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2009''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Universe mode===\nThe series has had a \"WWE Universe\" mode since ''SmackDown vs. Raw 2011'' which replaces the career mode from previous games. The mode builds storylines, and integrates cut scenes and rivalries between wrestlers based on the matches that are wrestled. These cut scenes appear randomly before, during, and after the match. In ''WWE '12'', championships was not able to be toggled on and off from most wrestlers. ''WWE '13'' introduced the option to toggle on and off rivalries injuries and tag team changes also crowd reactions. ''WWE 2K14'' was the last title to use the method of created arena before it was removed in ''WWE 2K15''. In ''WWE 2K15'', secret hints had to be unlocked through actions in this mode; there were 300 to collect. ''WWE 2K16'' allows wrestlers to be branded by multiple promotions. ''WWE 2K17'' replicates real television with a promo engine. ''WWE 2K18'' has remade Universe Mode from scratch as a new goal system is put in place and draft system has been removed as player can reshuffle them. In ''WWE 2K19'', Money in the Bank options are expanded to Mid-Match, Pre-Match or Post Match cash ins; also, the player can also switch control of the superstar once pausing the game. ''WWE 2k20'' introduces more matches on the card add/delete promos and more rivalries encountering than before.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===2K Towers===\nThis game mode was introduced in ''WWE 2K19'', Gauntlet and Step type towers and a Million Dollar Challenge were many that debuted. In WWE 2K20, the game mode returns, though there is one tower entitled \"Roman's Reign\" using narrative commentary from Roman Reigns on his matches from [[Extreme Rules (2013)|Extreme Rules 2013]] to [[WWE Stomping Grounds|Stomping Grounds]] in 2019.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===MyCareer Mode===\nThis mode was introduced in ''WWE 2K15'', social media followers were counted for the WWE Universe liking the player (the number of followers can decrease if bad performances occur during matches); pre-set cutscenes that used to be created for Story Mode in ''WWE '12'' to ''WWE 2K14'' appear at random times. In ''WWE 2K16'', the player has to fight for ranks to earn championships (the main goal is to reach the WWE Hall of Fame by fulfilling certain requirements).

Beginning with ''WWE '12'', promotion render art photos were used up to ''WWE 2K16''; from ''WWE 2K17'' on, the promotion render art was replaced with in-game rendering to accommodate created characters to lessen loading times. The in-game announcer calls out the names when selecting the wrestler beginning in WWE 2K17 and continues through ''WWE 2K18'' (now in ''WWE 2K19'' and ''2K20''); as for the in game render photos in the 2K19 title, the wrestlers stand still without posing differently than the previous two installments.

When ''WWE SmackDown vs Raw 2007'' was released, new game mechanics were introduced, in which a new control scheme altered the grappling system of the game, called \"Ultimate Control moves.\" Unlike the previous games, where the player pressed two buttons to perform a grapple or an attack, players were able to place their opponents into a grapple position and then choose to perform a move by moving the directional buttons of their system's controller. For example, the player could place their opponent in a [[suplex]] grappling position and then either perform a normal suplex or an [[Suplex#Inverted suplex slam|inverted suplex slam]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/744/744193p1.html|title=''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007'' Game Review|last=Dunham|first=Jeremey|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 11, 2008|date=November 6, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/smackdownvsraw2007/review.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabs&tag=tabs;reviews|title=''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007'' Online Review|last=Navarro|first=Alex|publisher=[[Game Spot]]|accessdate=June 11, 2008|date=November 6, 2006}}</ref> Before the release of ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008'', in order for players to force a superstar to [[professional wrestling#Submission|submit]], they had to tap buttons to move a marker towards the end of the meter labeled \"Submit\", and the only way for opponents to escape was for them to move the meter towards \"Escape\". Included with the release of ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008'' was a new submission system, in which the player had to move the [[analog stick]]s of their system's controller in different directions to force the opponent to submit, while the opponent could do the same to escape the [[professional wrestling holds|submission hold]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://games.teamxbox.com/xbox-360/1692/WWE-SmackDown-vs-RAW-2008/|title=''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008''|publisher=Team Xbox|accessdate=June 11, 2008|quote=A brand new Struggle Submission System will give players intuitive and natural control over their WWE Superstars by using the game's popular analog controls.

Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, the more likely it is for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by [[pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]], submission, [[knockout]], [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]]; alternatively, the match could end in a [[Professional wrestling#No contest|draw]]. With the introduction of an on-screen [[referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] in ''WWF SmackDown!

When players select \"dirty\", the superstar is [[booing|booed]] by the audience in the game; conversely, the \"clean\" superstar is [[cheer]]ed by the audience. With the \"dirty\" or \"clean\" option comes the inclusion of performing a special maneuver when playing. Players using a \"dirty\" superstar must direct their superstar into building up their \"dirty\" meter by performing \"dirty\" tactics, such as attacking the referee or taking the pad off the [[wrestling ring|ring]]'s [[turnbuckle]]. Unlike performing dirty tactics, \"clean\" superstars build their meters by performing \"clean\" tactics, such as an [[professional wrestling aerial techniques|aerial technique]] or performing a [[taunt]].

The stamina system was measured by a meter on the [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]]; the meter decreased when performing a variety of moves. The meter increases, however, when the player does nothing with the superstar or holds down a selected button that increased the stamina, which varied depending on the player's system. When the superstar's stamina was low, the wrestler reacted by moving slower when performing moves, walking, and running.

Characters now perform different moves based on their opponent's current physical state. Players now have a window of opportunity to attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble]] eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the [[pin (professional wrestling)|pinning]] meter from the past games has been reworked to make it more difficult to kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game's [[artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] has also been adjusted to prevent players from [[Spam (gaming)|overusing]] the same move. In addition, the ability to store [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Finisher|finishing moves]] has returned. \"Dynamic Comebacks\" gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New \"wake up taunts\" bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as pounding on the ground before [[Cutter (professional wrestling)|RKO]] finishing maneuver).<ref name=IGN>{{cite web | url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/117/1171523p1.html | title=E3 2011: WWE '12 Release Date and Cover \u2013 PlayStation 3 News at IGN |work=[[IGN]]|date=2011-05-31| accessdate=2011-05-31}}</ref> Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a \"Breaking Point\" submission [[minigame]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''WWE '12'' Dated and Detailed|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-05-31-wwe-12-dated-and-detailed|publisher=Eurogamer|date=May 31, 2011|accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref> OMG! moments were introduced to ''[[WWE '13]]''. These are moves than can be performed in certain situations with certain superstars when a finisher is obtained. An example of this is Mark Henry superplexing the Big Show, making the ring break and the match stop. Better weight detection was implemented to ''WWE '13'', so that small superstars such as [[Rey Mysterio]] are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the [[Big Show]], super heavyweights like  now have different frames to better capture their enormous size. Pinning is now not only influenced by damage, but the power of the move that was previously executed. In ''WWE '13'' alongside selecting arenas, characters and the number of finishing moves available at the start of a match (a new option, which can range from 0 to Infinite), players will be able to adjust a setting called 'Match Experience'. Three settings \u2013 \"Quick\", \"Normal\" and \"Epic\" \u2013 will affect the overall pacing of a fight, independent of AI difficulty. Factors such as momentum, damage, enemy aggressiveness and even kick out and reversal rates will be affected.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo overhaul the gameplay of the series, ''2K15'' features five times the animation data of ''WWE&nbsp;2K14'', containing over fifty days work of motion capture by the WWE superstars. Over four times the amount of dialogue for commentary was recorded. The general gameplay of the game too has been revised, with the wrestlers being divided once more into classes, as was present in the Smackdown vs. Raw series. This creates what is known as \"in ring psychology\". The classes (brawlers, giants, grapplers and high-flyers) all provide different and unique sensations within the game to provide more diverse mechanics. In addition, the game's overall core mechanics have been fundamentally altered.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K16'' introduces Working Holds, which allows the player to go through a collar-elbow tie-up situation in order to either damage the opponent or regain stamina to reverse the tide in the match. Dirty Pins now come in various animations and also A.I. for the referee is improved; for example, they break up collar-elbow tie-ups when the wrestlers are holding each other at the corner for too long. The Reversal Limit system was introduced to prevent players from reversing throughout the match, they come as minor and major ones depending on the class of the wrestler/diva. This method can be toggled on/off in the Options section.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K17'' retains the control scheme from the previous title but implements two styles of submissions. Ladders can now be propped many of ways, OMG's such as Kevin Owens' Apron Pop Up Powerbomb makes its debut and a new mini-game involving the Money in the Bank Briefcase to name a few features changes the aesthetics to ladder matches.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K18'' re-works the carrying system. High Flying moves such as elbow drops are performed faster and attack animations are massively improved. There's also new corner finishers such as Randy Orton's Corner RKO and John Cena's Corner AA.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K19'' introduces the Payback engine, which gives advantages after being down in a match to reverse the tide such as Auto Reversal, spraying Green Mist or storing finishers to name a few.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''WWE 2K20'' streamlines the controls for newbie players yet more concise and simple for the veterans. Paybacks make their return with tweaks and new versions of paybacks are introduced.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Story modes===\nIn the ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw'' series, the player was able to choose a \"superstar\" from a [[List of WWE personnel|roster]] and compete in an arcade-like feature called season mode. In season mode, players direct their superstars through different career obstacles through a year of WWE programming to gain respect with other superstars and popularity among the fans. Like superstars from WWE, the superstars in the ''WWE SmackDown vs. Raw'' series season mode are involved in storylines that affect their career mode in some way. Beginning with the release of ''WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth'', the [[WWE Brand Extension]] has been included in season mode, and superstars are exclusive to one brand of WWE. A result of this feature is that the player's superstar may only wrestle superstars and compete for championships from the same brand on which he is a part of. In season mode, the player's superstar has the ability to earn and wrestle for a variety of [[championship (professional wrestling)|championships]] based on actual [[List of current champions in WWE|WWE Championships]]. When superstars win championships, their respect and popularity increase, which also increases their involvement in [[card (sports)#Main event|main event]] matches. As the superstar's respect and popularity increases through the year of WWE programming, it becomes more likely for the player to achieve the main goal in season mode, which is to earn a [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] or [[WWE Championship]] match at [[WrestleMania]], the WWE's flagship [[pay-per-view]] event and the final stage in season mode. After the final stage, season modes begins again with the same superstar chosen before, though the player has the option of switching superstars. The superstar is then a part of the [[WWE Draft Lottery]] and is assigned to a brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/375/375004p1.html|title=WWE SmackDown!: Season Mode|date=October 22, 2002|author=IGN Staff|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 11, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"SeasonMode2\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/375/375004p2.html|title=WWE SmackDown!: Season Mode |date=October 22, 2002|author=IGN Staff|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=June 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSeason mode was replaced with Road to [[WrestleMania]] in ''[[WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009]]'', and remained in the games until [[WWE '12]]. In this mode, players could choose from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storylines]]. The difference is that each storyline is tailor-made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode is a more authentic experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nRoad to WrestleMania was replaced with Attitude Era Mode in ''[[WWE '13]]''. This single-player mode is an abridged recreation of a memorable time in sports entertainment, allowing players to journey through various storylines as eight of the most popular superstars of that time, including [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin]] and Dwayne \"[[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]\" Johnson.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe chapter-based saga moves through WWE's struggle and eventual triumph during the \"Monday Night Wars,\" which saw the company on the brink of defeat at the hands of a powerful rival, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]. Told from the perspective of the WWE during that period, matches and in-game cutscenes are supplemented by video packages assembled by WWE's own editors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn ''[[WWE 2K14]]'', a single player campaign titled \"The 30 Years of WrestleMania\" was introduced, a nostalgic gameplay mode that recreates nearly three decades of WWE history, including 46 matches, classic WWE footage and many legendary characters. The mode features a distinct roster of wrestlers and alternate [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmicks]], who wrestled at WrestleMania. In this mode matches have primary objectives, required to beat the game, and bonus historical objectives, which result in recreated WrestleMania moments. Sometimes the player must follow a guided sequence of inputs, rather than freely control the character. The player competes through storylines of various lengths, switching predetermined characters as they are completed. Each chapter has its own title and focus; \"Hulkamania Runs Wild\" focuses on [[Hulk Hogan]] and early WrestleManias, while \"The New Generation\" showcases the rise of [[Bret Hart]] and [[Shawn Michaels]] in the mid-1990s. The \"Attitude Era\" chapter brings back some matches from WWE '13's \"Attitude Era\" mode, as well as some not covered before. The \"Ruthless Aggression\" chapter focuses on the departure of The Rock, lessened focus on [[Triple H]] and rise of [[Randy Orton]] and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. The final \"Universe Era\" chapter focuses on the rise of [[John Cena]] and the returns of The Rock and [[Brock Lesnar]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''[[WWE 2K15]]'' features the 2K Showcase, the core stories include [[CM Punk]] vs. John Cena and Triple H vs. [[Shawn Michaels]]. These rivalries detail from 2002 to 2004 (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) and 2011 to 2013 (CM Punk and John Cena). Three other stories which were included as DLC include The Path of the Warrior, a highlight behind the life of [[The Ultimate Warrior]] and his meteoric rise concentrating on championships to the [[WWE Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] as commemoration. The Hall of Pain, a story behind the World's Strongest Man, [[Mark Henry]] as he punished many to become the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] and attempts to gain the [[WWE Championship]]. Lastly, the One More Match story stars [[Christian Cage|Christian]], as he complained about having one more match as his way of getting multiple second chances of earning the World Heavyweight Championship. Originally, these stories were meant to be produced for ''WWE&nbsp;'12'', ''WWE&nbsp;'13'' & ''WWE&nbsp;2K14'', but the developers chose to use ''WWE&nbsp;'12'' for Road to Wrestlemania, the Attitude Era for {{nowrap|''WWE '13''}} and 30 years of WrestleMania for {{nowrap|''WWE 2K14''}}.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''[[WWE 2K16]]'' details the historical career of \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, from his days in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]], when he was angry that things were not going to happen in a good sense for him, to WCW, when he and [[Brian Pillman]] began to become [[The_Hollywood_Blonds#Steve_Austin_and_Brian_Pillman|The_Hollywood_Blonds]] leading to Austin suffering injury and going through a rub shot in WWE as Stone Cold, an anti-hero that was not going to be tame into a corporate man. Video Packages contain commentary that was remixed from ''WWE '13'' and ''WWE 2K14'' with the exception of some not documented before. Through DLC, the WWE Hall of Fame showcase contains what if matches and some from WCW; these matches were announced on Oct 7th 2015 and to be released alongside the Deluxe Editions of the video game.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n''[[WWE 2K17]]'' discontinued the 2K Showcase Mode for the physical disc version but later made one for the 2016 Hall of Fame.

It allows the player to act as the General Manager of the ''[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]'' or ''[[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]]'' brands (or ''[[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]'' in ''WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008''). After choosing a brand, and selecting to participate in the WWE Draft, or using a default roster, players then start a calendar year of hiring and managing Superstars and Divas, booking matches, establishing rivalries, and other options to try and win WWE fans to support your brand. Players must manage finances, contract or release Superstars & try to make better matches than their rival brands. At the end of the year at ''WrestleMania'', [[Vince McMahon]] will give ''The General Manager of the Year'' award to the show that was able to hold the most fans.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn ''WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2008'', GM Mode was combined into one game mode called ''WWE 24/7 Mode''. This basically allowed Superstars to train, make special appearances or other actions between matches during full calendar years. After achieving specific goals through the game, a percentage will increase of becoming a ''WWE Hall of Famer / General Manager of the Year'' winner, and the mode does not end until this percentage reaches 100%.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThis mode was discontinued in ''WWE SmackDown vs. RAW 2009''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Universe mode===\nThe series has had a \"WWE Universe\" mode since ''SmackDown vs. Raw 2011'' which replaces the career mode from previous games.

In ''WWE '12'', championships was not able to be toggled on and off from most wrestlers. ''WWE '13'' introduced the option to toggle on and off rivalries injuries and tag team changes also crowd reactions. ''WWE 2K14'' was the last title to use the method of created arena before it was removed in ''WWE 2K15''. In ''WWE 2K15'', secret hints had to be unlocked through actions in this mode; there were 300 to collect. ''WWE 2K16'' allows wrestlers to be branded by multiple promotions. ''WWE 2K17'' replicates real television with a promo engine. ''WWE 2K18'' has remade Universe Mode from scratch as a new goal system is put in place and draft system has been removed as player can reshuffle them. In ''WWE 2K19'', Money in the Bank options are expanded to Mid-Match, Pre-Match or Post Match cash ins; also, the player can also switch control of the superstar once pausing the game. ''WWE 2k20'' introduces more matches on the card add/delete promos and more rivalries encountering than before.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===2K Towers===\nThis game mode was introduced in ''WWE 2K19'', Gauntlet and Step type towers and a Million Dollar Challenge were many that debuted.

In ''WWE 2K16'', the player has to fight for ranks to earn championships (the main goal is to reach the WWE Hall of Fame by fulfilling certain requirements). ''WWE 2K17'' brings in a promo engine and every action can trigger a backstage brawl depending on what answer the created superstar gives. ''WWE 2K18'' continues with the promo engine from ''2K17'' with free roaming now a central focus.

However, with their situation  becoming increasingly dangerous, she accepted an offer made by her friend, [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]], through the Swedish Ambassador Edvard Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, to travel to [[Sweden]].<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nFrom [[Kronstadt]] twelve-year-old Princess Vera escaped to [[Sweden]] aboard the Swedish vessel ''\u00c5ngermanland'' in October 1918 with her mother, her brother George, and her young nephews (Prince Teymuraz Constantinovich and Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia) and nieces (Princess Natalia Konstantinovna Bagration-Mukhransky and Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia) when they were permitted by the [[Bolsheviks]] to be taken by ship to [[Sweden]], via [[Tallinn]] to [[Helsinki]] and via [[Mariehamn]] to [[Stockholm]], at the invitation of [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]].

Left alone and without sufficient means of subsistence, Vera Constantinovna moved to [[Bavaria]], with friends and shortly after relocated to London with her brother George.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  When two years later, George moved to the United States, she returned to Altenburg.

Her mother ran after her, but the grand duke had already died.<ref name = \" Zeepvat, Charlotte 185\">Zeepvat, Charlotte, ''The Camera and the Tsars'', p. 185</ref>\n\n==Revolution==\n[[File:The Constanitinovich 1911.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Left to right back row: Princess Tatiana; Prince Gabriel; Prince Ivan; Grand Duchess Elizabeta Mavrikievna and Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich.

They stayed in the palace until the summer of 1918, when the revolution forced them to leave it and to take an apartment in the city.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nDuring the Russian revolution, four of Vera\u2019s brothers were imprisoned by the [[Bolsheviks]]. Only [[Prince Gabriel Constantinovich of Russia|Prince Gabriel]] was eventually released. Three of her brothers ([[Prince John Constantinovich of Russia|Ivan]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Constantine]] and [[Prince Igor Constantinovich of Russia|Igor]]) were killed at [[Alapaevsk]], along with other Romanov relatives, in July 1918.\n\nInitially, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna was reluctant to leave Russia remembering her late husband's words, that if Russia was in need, it was a Romanov's duty to help. However, with their situation  becoming increasingly dangerous, she accepted an offer made by her friend, [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]], through the Swedish Ambassador Edvard Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m, to travel to [[Sweden]].<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nFrom [[Kronstadt]] twelve-year-old Princess Vera escaped to [[Sweden]] aboard the Swedish vessel ''\u00c5ngermanland'' in October 1918 with her mother, her brother George, and her young nephews (Prince Teymuraz Constantinovich and Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich of Russia) and nieces (Princess Natalia Konstantinovna Bagration-Mukhransky and Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia) when they were permitted by the [[Bolsheviks]] to be taken by ship to [[Sweden]], via [[Tallinn]] to [[Helsinki]] and via [[Mariehamn]] to [[Stockholm]], at the invitation of [[Victoria of Baden|Queen Victoria of Sweden]]. At [[Stockholm]] harbor, they met Prince [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf Adolf]], who took them to the [[Stockholm Palace|royal palace]]. Later, Vsevolod and Catherine were able to reunite to their mother.\n\n==Exile==\n[[File:The Constanitinovich in exile2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|On the sofa: Princess Tatiana with her children Teymuraz and Nathalie Bagration-Mukhransky and Grand Duchess Elizaveta Mavrikievna.

Brussels, 1921.]]\nPrincess Vera lived with her mother and her brother George for the next two years in [[Sweden]], first in [[Stockholm]] and then in [[Saltsj\u00f6baden]].  As Sweden proved too expensive to live in, Elizabeth Mavrikievna  wrote a letter to [[Albert I of Belgium]], asking him to allow them to move to his country. In 1920 they relocated to [[Brussels]] where they were frequently ill. In 1922, Vera's uncle, Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Altenburg invited them to move to Germany.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  Elizabeth Mavrikievna settled in the ancestral castle of her family near [[Leipzig]], in the small town of [[Altenburg]]. Princess Vera followed her mother half a year later after spending sometime in [[Oberstdorf]] in the [[Allg\u00e4u]] region of the [[Bavarian Alps]] recuperating from tuberculosis.\n\nHer mother died of cancer on 24 March 1927 in Leipzig. Left alone and without sufficient means of subsistence, Vera Constantinovna moved to [[Bavaria]], with friends and shortly after relocated to London with her brother George.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  When two years later, George moved to the United States, she returned to Altenburg. Princess Vera lived there for thirty years. Prince George died in New York City in 1938. Princess Vera lived in Germany through the difficult years of World War II.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 190\">King & Wilson, ''Gilded Prism'', p. 190</ref> During the War, she worked as a translator in a camp for prisoners of war. But German officials soon removed her from that position because she had tried to help fellow prisoners.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>\n\nFor many years, as she later recalled, she was haunted by the events of the Revolution.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> \"I used to have the same dream, as if I stood with my back to a pit and they were going to shoot me...my awakening was not less terrible than the dream itself, because I was constantly afraid to open my eyes and see that they had really come to take me to the execution\".<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/>\n\nAt the end of World War II, in early 1945, American troops arrived in Altenburg.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> On hearing that, according to the [[Potsdam Conference]],  Altenburg  was going to be part of the zone of Soviet occupation, Princess Vera fled on foot.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  With her cousin, Prince Ernst-Friedrich Saxe-Altenburg, she had to walk 240 kilometers in 12 days, fleeing the advancing Soviet troops.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> Once safe, Princess Vera settled in [[Hamburg]] on  5 January 1946.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> Until 1949 she worked as a translator in the British branch of the [[Red Cross]] and later in the DP Medical Center.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> When this one was closed, she worked at the reception in another British institution.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> She belonged to no country, as she only had an ambiguous [[Nansen passport]], which gave her the ability to travel but no protections of statehood.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> Despite this, she refused to take the protection offered to her by various European countries, considering herself Russian.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> \" I didn't leave Russia\", she once declared, \"Russia left me\".<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/>\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:Princess Vera.gif|thumb|left|150px|Princess Vera Constantinovna in the 1970s]]\nIn 1951 she moved to the United States,<ref name=\" King & Wilson 190\"/> where her main activity was to work for the [[Tolstoy Foundation]], which provided aid to Russians in need.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/>  For the next decades she lived in New York, and was very active in charities. In November 1952 Vera Constantinovna became involved in the work of the Russian Children's Welfare Society where she continued her work there until 1969.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> At the same time, she volunteered at the Fund of Assistance to the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> She  retired in April 1971.<ref name=\" Vera Constantinovna\"/> She regarded some of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community, and some of their pretensions, with skepticism. She did not have the nostalgic idyll of many \u00e9migr\u00e9s, but rather the memories of her childhood and her lost family.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 191\">King & Wilson, ''Gilded Prism'', p. 191</ref> The constant stream of visitors she regarded with some amusement and found rather trying. She did not care for those who would speak in awe-struck tones of the late Imperial family; she would often relate stories of their humanness and misbehavior. For her, the children of the last Tsar remained her childhood playmates, not distant figures for adoration.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 191\"/>  She also regarded the canonization of the Romanovs, including her brothers and uncle, as a puzzling, peculiar move by the Church. Princess Vera wrote four short articles about her life for a magazine ''\"Kadetskaya pereklichka\"'' published by Union of the Russian Kadets in New York in 1972.\n\nPrincess Vera retained a certain aura of living history, being the last surviving member of the Romanov family who could remember Imperial Russia.<ref>{{cite web| author=Paul Theroff| year=2007| title=Russia| work=An Online Gotha| url=http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/russia.html| accessdate=4 March 2007| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231104445/http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/russia.html| archivedate=31 December 2006| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Her two brothers and sister who managed to escape Russia all predeceased her. Prince Gabriel died in 1955, leaving no heirs, as did her brother Prince George, the victim of an early death at the age of 33 in 1938. Her sister, [[Princess Tatiana Constantinovna of Russia|Princess Tatiana]], eventually took holy orders and became an Orthodox Nun. She died in [[Jerusalem]] in 1979.\n\nPrincess Vera died at the [[Tolstoy Foundation]]'s [[elderly care]] home in  [[Valley Cottage, New York]], on 11 January 2001, at the age of 95.  She was buried next to her brother [[Prince Georgy Konstantinovich of Russia|Prince Georgy Konstantinovich]] at the cemetery of the Russian Orthodox Monastery of [[Novo-Diveevo]] in [[Nanuet]], New York. Of all the members of the Romanov family in Imperial Russia, only her niece [[Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia|Princess Catherine Ivanovna]] outlived her. Princess Vera never married and left no children. In the spring of 2007 the [[Pavlovsk Palace]], where she was born, held an exhibit about her and her family, commemorating what would have been her 101st  birthday.\n\n==Titles, styles and honours==\n\n===Honours===\n* {{Flagicon|Russian Empire}} [[House of Romanov]]: Dame Grand Cordon of the [[Order of St Catherine|Imperial Order of Saint Catherine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://saintanna.ru/?lang=rus&id=48 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313050458/http://www.saintanna.ru/?lang=rus&id=48 |archivedate=13 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

The series was broadcast from January 23, 1975, to May 20, 1982, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It was created by [[Danny Arnold]] and [[Theodore J. Flicker]]. [[Noam Pitlik]] directed the majority of the episodes.\n\n==Premise==\n''Barney Miller'' takes place almost entirely within the confines of the detectives' squad room and Captain Barney Miller's adjoining office of New York City's fictional 12th Precinct, located in Greenwich Village.<ref name=\"sjs750607\">{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Garson |work=[[St. Joseph News-Press]] |title=The Law Takes Time Out to Be Human on ABC's Barney Miller |page=S2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GPFbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=41MNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2161,1289410&dq=fish+vigoda&hl=en |date=June 7, 1975 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref> A typical episode featured the detectives of the 12th bringing in several complainants and/or suspects to the squad room. Usually, two or three separate subplots are in a given episode, with different officers dealing with different crimes. Rarely, about once a year, an episode would feature one or more of the detectives outside of the walls of the precinct, either on a stakeout or at their homes.\n\nPrimary characters:\n\n* '''Captain Bernard \"Barney\" Miller''' ([[Hal Linden]])  is the sensible captain of the precinct who uses his odd and dry sense of humor to retain his sanity while dealing with the foibles of his staff, an unending stream of budget problems, and paperwork that make up his job.  Several times during the series' run, he gets passed over for a promotion to deputy inspector before reaching that rank in the series finale.\n* '''Sgt. [[Phil Fish (fictional character)|Philip K. Fish]]''' ([[Abe Vigoda]]) is the senior detective on the squad. Crotchety, world-weary, and near retirement, he always seems to be suffering through some physical ailment, but his years of experience as a police officer make him a very good detective and mentor to other members of his squad. Frequently, he is on the phone dealing with a minor marital crisis with his wife Bernice. The character was eventually spun off into its own series.\n* '''Det. 3rd Grade (later Sgt.) Stanley Thaddeus \"Wojo\" Wojciehowicz''' ([[Max Gail]]){{Anchor|Stan Wojciehowicz}} is the naive, gung-ho but goodhearted [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Polish-American]], who gradually transforms from a macho former Marine into a decidedly humanitarian character (the squad's conscience, in many ways), while performing his duties as a detective. He takes and fails the sergeant's examination four times, but finally passes on his fifth try and gets promoted in season four. He is a very dedicated,  by-the-book police officer who at times tends to take his duties a little too seriously.  In the final season, his name is spelled \"Wojehowicz\" on the duty roster.\n* '''Det. 1st Grade (later Sgt.) Ron Nathan Harris''' ([[Ron Glass]]) is an ambitious, intellectual [[African American]] criminologist who has a taste for the finer things in life and thus lives well beyond his means, and who frequently seems more preoccupied with his attire and his career as a writer than with his police work. A long-running plotline about his various attempts to establish a writing career eventually has Harris emerge as a published author; his lurid memoir ''Blood on the Badge'' (originally titled ''Precinct Diary'') becomes a best seller and thus prompts him to become more serious about his work. Harris was educated by Jesuits and served in the Coast Guard (in the legal department) prior to becoming a police officer. He is a self-professed Republican, but also a former war protester and an ardent supporter of the police officers' union strike action.\n* '''Sgt. Nick Yemana''' ([[Jack Soo]]) is a surrealistically philosophical, wisecracking [[Japanese American]] detective. Though he is closely connected to his Japanese heritage, he is a native of Omaha, Nebraska. Yemana is noted for his \"off the wall\" sense of humor and wry observations about life, as well as for his gambling habits, extraordinarily poor paperwork filing skills, and for making the squad's coffee (which is disliked by everyone who drinks it). After the retirement of Fish, Yemana becomes the ranking detective. In the two-part episode \"Eviction,\" he becomes commanding officer, though he is replaced after a mere few hours. (Harris compares his tenure to that of President [[William Henry Harrison]], who served for one month.)\n* '''Sgt. Miguel \"Chano\" Amanguale''' ([[Gregory Sierra]]) is a dauntless, beleaguered [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] detective, who is very emotionally attached to his job; as such, he has a habit of getting worked up when things go awry and, when this happens, he tends to explode in rapid Spanish should it happen. His lowest moment comes in \"The Hero,\" when he kills two suspects who are robbing a bank.\n* '''Sgt. Arthur P. Dietrich''' ([[Steve Landesberg]]) is a detective with a calm, unflappable nature and a seemingly endless supply of knowledge on a wide array of subjects (he has, as Barney once observed, a \"flair for the esoteric\"), yet he enjoys elements of entertainment that can be seen as ironically simple, such as early morning cartoons and the Three Stooges (his personal favorite). He can usually find a topic to discuss with those he encounters in the squad room, whatever their interest or occupation, though his contribution usually comes out of him in an overly intellectual manner. In \"The Photographer,\" Barney goes so far as to suggest to Dietrich that he has a \"pedantic\" way of expressing himself. Despite his perspicacity, he seems to possess a deep-rooted sense of self-doubt, giving up on more than a few career paths (law and medical school, to name a few) when he finds he isn't a perfect representation of the position in his own eyes; that's why he \"became a cop.\"\n* '''Inspector Frank D. Luger''' ([[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]]) is Miller's rambling, out-of-touch, and unapologetically old-school superior who frequently drops by the precinct to \"chat with\" Barney \"in his office\". He refers to Harris as \"Har'\", Dietrich as \"Di-Di.\" and Levitt as \"Levine.\" As time goes by, Luger becomes more and more melancholy and his outdated approach to police work more and more problematic. He has a habit of getting lost in his thoughts, particularly when he reminisces about his old partners Foster, Kleiner and \"Brownie,\" which usually ends up with him getting worked up as he remembers how much he \"loved those guys.\"\n* '''Officer Carl Levitt''' ([[Ron Carey (actor)|Ron Carey]]) is a diminutive, obsequious (but competent and hard-working) uniformed officer who constantly, passive-aggressively badgers Miller about being promoted.  In the series finale, he is finally promoted to detective.\n[[File:Barney Miller 1975.JPG|thumb|170px|Barney and Liz Miller]]\n* '''Elizabeth \"Liz\" Miller''' ([[Barbara Barrie]]) is Barney's wife. A dedicated social worker, she was intended to be a regular character and, during seasons one and two, was listed in the opening credits.  Nevertheless, Liz is seen fairly infrequently.  She is, however, often referred to, and Barney is often seen (and heard) on the phone with her. Later on in the run of the show, she and Barney separate due to the ongoing tension between home life and his work at the 12th, but end up reconciling.\n\nThe show's focus was split between the detectives' interactions with each other and with the suspects and witnesses they detained, processed, and interviewed. Some typical conflicts and long-running plotlines included Miller's frustration with red tape and paperwork, his constant efforts to maintain peace, order, and discipline, and his numerous failed attempts to get a promotion; Harris' preoccupation with outside interests, such as his living arrangements but mainly his novel (''Blood on the Badge''), and his inability to remain focused on his police work; Fish's age-related health issues, marital problems, and reluctance to retire; Wojciehowicz's impulsive behavior and love life; Luger's nostalgia for the old days with partners Foster, Kleiner, and \"Brownie\" Brown; Levitt's quest to become a detective (which is eventually successful); the rivalry between the precinct's resident intellectuals, Harris and Dietrich; and continually\u2014but reliably\u2014bad coffee, usually made by Yemana.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Regulars===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n|-\n!Actor \n!Character\n!Seasons\n!Notes\n|-\n| [[Hal Linden]] \n| Captain Barney Miller\n| <center> 1\u20138 </center>\n|Main star and regular character throughout the series' run.

He was first shown to be a lieutenant from Manhattan South. Previously worked as a member of the [[vice squad]] for 17 years.

In Seasons 1, 3 and 4 she was played by [[Florence Stanley]] (in a total of seven appearances); in Bernice's only Season 2 appearance she was portrayed by [[Doris Belack]]. In that episode, Fish also had a grown daughter named Beverly played by Emily Levine. Also seen as recurring characters in Season 3 were group home children Jilly ([[Denise Miller]]) and Victor ([[John Cassisi]]), who would eventually become Fish's foster children. In 1977, the Fishes were [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into their own show, ''[[Fish (U.S. TV series)|Fish]]'' which also starred [[Barry Gordon]], who memorably played an embezzler who gets a pay raise and promotion in Season 5 and a lawyer representing Wojo in Season 8.\n\n====Barney's family====\nIn addition to Barney's wife Liz, Barney's son David (Michael Tessier) and daughter Rachel (Anne Wyndham) appeared in the pilot. Barney's son was written out of the show after the first episode (though was still occasionally mentioned), while his wife made appearances through the second season, and very sporadically thereafter. Wyndham also reprised her role in two later episodes, Season 1, episode 5 \"The Courtesans\", and Season 7, episode 140 \"Rachel\".\n\n====\"Wojo's Girl\"====\nDarlene Parks played Wojo's ex-prostitute girlfriend Nancy in a 2-episode arc in Season 5. The episodes focus on the 'period of adjustment' following Nancy's move into Stan's apartment.\n\n==Pilot==\n[[File:Barney Miller cast 1974.jpg|thumb|A scene from the series, presumably 1977]]\nThe series was born out of an unsold [[television pilot]], ''The Life and Times of Captain Barney Miller'', that aired on August 22, 1974, as part of an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] summer [[anthology series]], ''Just for Laughs''.  Linden and Vigoda were cast in their series roles; no other eventual cast members were present. [[Abby Dalton]] played Barney Miller's wife, Liz, while [[Val Bisoglio]], Rod Perry, and a pre-''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' [[Charles Haid]] rounded out the cast of the pilot. Guest stars included Mike Moore, Chu Chu Mulave, Henry Beckman, Buddy Lester, Michael Tessier and Anne Wyndham.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web|title=The Life and Times of Captain Barney Miller|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445529/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_64|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe pilot script was later largely reused in the debut episode ''Ramon''.  For this reworked episode, Bisoglio's lines were more or less evenly split between the new characters of Yemana and Chano, while Haid's character of Kazinski became Max Gail's Wojciehowicz.  Rod Perry's character, Sgt. Wilson, was replaced by Harris in the reworked episode, although Wilson would reappear one more time in the first-season episode ''Experience'' before disappearing from the series entirely.  Abby Dalton was replaced by Barbara Barrie as Liz, and Henry Beckman's character of Uncle Charlie was dropped entirely.

Can we just start it out with the bass?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2015/04/23/stories-behind-the-songs-chuck-berghofer/|title=Stories Behind the Songs: Chuck Berghofer|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>  The theme song was ranked #23 and #27, respectively, by ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' and ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazines, in their lists of \"best TV theme songs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/02/the-50-best-tv-show-theme-songs/barney-miller|title=The Best TV Theme Songs|website=Complex|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/the-50-best-tv-theme-songs.html?a=1|title=The 50 Best TV Theme Songs of All Time|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe theme plays over the Manhattan [[skyline]], followed by shots of the characters and opening credits.  Season 1 opened and closed with a shot of [[Midtown Manhattan]] as seen from [[Weehawken, New Jersey]].  Season 2 onward opened with a shot of [[Lower Manhattan]] as seen from [[Brooklyn Heights]], with a barge being towed in the foreground, and closed with a shot of the [[Midtown Manhattan]] skyline as seen from [[Long Island City]].  Several versions of the theme were used during different seasons, with minor variations in composition and performance.\n\n==Production==\nProduction of ''Barney Miller'' deliberately resembled a theatrical stage play; scenes rarely strayed from the precinct station's squad room, with its prominent open-barred [[jail cell|holding cell]], and Miller's adjoining office. The room was said to be on the second or third floor, depending on the episode. Clutter was plentiful and much of it seemed immobile over the years, including a coat hanging on a clothes rack near Harris' desk. A handful of episodes (fewer than a dozen of 170) were partially or fully set in other locations, including a stakeout location (\"Stakeout\"), a hospital room (\"Hair\"), an undercover operation (\"Grand Hotel\"), a jail (three separate rooms in \"Contempt\"), a hotel room (\"Chinatown\"), and the apartments of Barney (\"Ramon\" and \"Graft\"), Chano (\"The Hero\"), Fish (\"Fish\") and Wojo (\"Wojo's Girl\").  In \"The DNA Story,\" we finally see the inside of the men's room. ''Barney Miller'' tended to obey two of the three [[classical unities]] of drama: unity of place and unity of time. The third unity, unity of action, was not followed, since each episode had multiple subplots.\n\n''Barney Miller'' was one of the few sitcoms of the period that occasionally mentioned the then-current year or allowed the audience to infer the then-current year.\n\n''Barney Miller'' was notorious for its marathon taping sessions.<ref>[http://www.oldtvtickets.com/archives1/2010/04/barney_miller.html Barney Miller entry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504012907/http://www.oldtvtickets.com/archives1/2010/04/barney_miller.html |date=May 4, 2010 }}, Old TV Tickets blog</ref> Early seasons were recorded before a live studio audience and used a [[laugh track]] for sweetening reactions during post-production. Creator and executive producer [[Danny Arnold]] would then rewrite and restage entire scenes after the audience departed, actively looking for quieter, subtler moments that would not play well before a crowd; a taping session that began in the afternoon or early evening would then continue into the early morning hours. Max Gail referred to this in the Jack Soo retrospective episode aired on May 17, 1979, remarking that one of the clips shown was a scene that \"we finished around 2:30 in the morning.\" In a 1977 [[blooper]], a crew member mentions it being 3:15&nbsp;a.m.\n\nWriter Tom Reeder described working on the show:\n{{quote|text=Danny Arnold was the creator of the show, and especially in the early years, he was a marvel. When he was \"on\", he could spin out entire scenes, ad-libbing dialogue\u2014and great jokes\u2014for every character. By the time those scenes got to script form, though, he obsessively rewrote them.\n \nThat's true of a lot of showrunners, but Danny couldn't seem to stop himself. Sometime during season 2 (or maybe it was 3) the show was no longer taped in front of an audience, partly because the script was rarely done by show night. When one season began, six pages were in print. Not six scripts\u2014six pages of one script.\n \nThis meant that on the day the show was taped, the actors would hang around on the stage, waiting for pages to be sent down. Then\u2014sometimes at 2 a.m.\u2014they would have to learn new scenes. Ron Carey (Officer Levitt) would get his fairly quickly: \"Here's your mail, Captain.\" On the other hand, poor Steve Landesberg (Dietrich) might have to memorize long speeches explaining how nuclear fission works.\n \nIn the early years, Danny benefited from the heroic writing efforts of [[Chris Hayward]], who was a veteran writer, and rookies Tony Sheehan and [[Reinhold Weege]] who, like me, didn't know any better. They were the ''Barney Miller'' writing staff. My agent wisely turned down Danny's annual offers of staff jobs, negotiating freelance assignments (so-called \"multiple deals\") for me instead. Even so, the pace was frantic\u2014on one assignment I was given 3 hours to write the story outline. On another occasion, a friend came into my office at ABC-Vine Street and said, \"Hey, Reeder, want to go get some lunch?\" I pointed to the paper in my typewriter and said, \"This script is on the stage\u2014thanks anyway.\"<ref>[http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/10/barney-miller-inside-look.html Barney Miller: An Inside Look], By Ken Levine blog guest entry\"</ref>}}\n\nEmploying a live audience became impractical as lengthy reshoots became commonplace. By Season 4, only a quiet laugh track was used when necessary.\n\nMarty and Darryl were among the earliest recurring gay characters on American television. Danny Arnold worked closely with the Gay Media Task Force, an activist group that worked on LGBT representation in media, in developing the characters.<ref>Capsuto, p. 122</ref> Initially both characters were presented in a stereotypically effeminate manner but in later appearances Darryl began dressing and speaking in a more mainstream fashion.<ref>Capsuto, pp. 148\u201449</ref> Officer Zatelli's coming out was not the first gay storyline on American television, but was a memorable one.\n\nThe series took a while to become a hit, but ABC supported it anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/2013/07/24/the-state-of-tv-today-on-the-eve-of-the-tv-critics-association-summer-meeting-in-los-angeles-nobody-knows-anything/ |title=Netflix helps shift Hollywood\u2019s business model |publisher=O.canada.com |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>  Danny Arnold ended production of ''Barney Miller'' in 1982 after eight seasons for fear of repeating storylines; the show was not cancelled by the network.\n\n==Reception by police==\n''Barney Miller'' retains a devoted following among real-life police officers, who appreciate the show's emphasis on dialog and believably quirky characters, and its low-key portrayal of cops going about their jobs. In a 2005 op-ed for the ''New York Times'', real-life New York police detective Lucas Miller wrote:\n\n{{quote|text=Real cops are not usually fans of cop shows. [...] Many police officers maintain that the most realistic police show in the history of television was the sitcom ''Barney Miller'', [...] The action was mostly off screen, the squad room the only set, and the guys were a motley bunch of character actors who were in no danger of being picked for the N.Y.P.D. pin-up calendar. But they worked hard, made jokes, got hurt and answered to their straight-man commander. For real detectives, most of the action does happen off screen, and we spend a lot of time back in the squad room writing reports about it. Like Barney Miller's squad, we crack jokes at one another, at the cases that come in, and at the crazy suspect locked in the holding cell six feet from the new guy's desk. Life really is more like ''Barney Miller'' than ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', but our jokes aren't nearly as funny.<ref>Miller, Lucas (2005).

The series was broadcast from January 23, 1975, to May 20, 1982, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It was created by [[Danny Arnold]] and [[Theodore J. Flicker]]. [[Noam Pitlik]] directed the majority of the episodes.\n\n==Premise==\n''Barney Miller'' takes place almost entirely within the confines of the detectives' squad room and Captain Barney Miller's adjoining office of New York City's fictional 12th Precinct, located in Greenwich Village.<ref name=\"sjs750607\">{{cite news |first=Bob |last=Garson |work=[[St. Joseph News-Press]] |title=The Law Takes Time Out to Be Human on ABC's Barney Miller |page=S2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GPFbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=41MNAAAAIBAJ&pg=2161,1289410&dq=fish+vigoda&hl=en |date=June 7, 1975 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}</ref> A typical episode featured the detectives of the 12th bringing in several complainants and/or suspects to the squad room. Usually, two or three separate subplots are in a given episode, with different officers dealing with different crimes. Rarely, about once a year, an episode would feature one or more of the detectives outside of the walls of the precinct, either on a stakeout or at their homes.\n\nPrimary characters:\n\n* '''Captain Bernard \"Barney\" Miller''' ([[Hal Linden]])  is the sensible captain of the precinct who uses his odd and dry sense of humor to retain his sanity while dealing with the foibles of his staff, an unending stream of budget problems, and paperwork that make up his job.  Several times during the series' run, he gets passed over for a promotion to deputy inspector before reaching that rank in the series finale.\n* '''Sgt. [[Phil Fish (fictional character)|Philip K. Fish]]''' ([[Abe Vigoda]]) is the senior detective on the squad. Crotchety, world-weary, and near retirement, he always seems to be suffering through some physical ailment, but his years of experience as a police officer make him a very good detective and mentor to other members of his squad. Frequently, he is on the phone dealing with a minor marital crisis with his wife Bernice. The character was eventually spun off into its own series.\n* '''Det. 3rd Grade (later Sgt.) Stanley Thaddeus \"Wojo\" Wojciehowicz''' ([[Max Gail]]){{Anchor|Stan Wojciehowicz}} is the naive, gung-ho but goodhearted [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Polish-American]], who gradually transforms from a macho former Marine into a decidedly humanitarian character (the squad's conscience, in many ways), while performing his duties as a detective. He takes and fails the sergeant's examination four times, but finally passes on his fifth try and gets promoted in season four. He is a very dedicated,  by-the-book police officer who at times tends to take his duties a little too seriously.  In the final season, his name is spelled \"Wojehowicz\" on the duty roster.\n* '''Det. 1st Grade (later Sgt.) Ron Nathan Harris''' ([[Ron Glass]]) is an ambitious, intellectual [[African American]] criminologist who has a taste for the finer things in life and thus lives well beyond his means, and who frequently seems more preoccupied with his attire and his career as a writer than with his police work. A long-running plotline about his various attempts to establish a writing career eventually has Harris emerge as a published author; his lurid memoir ''Blood on the Badge'' (originally titled ''Precinct Diary'') becomes a best seller and thus prompts him to become more serious about his work. Harris was educated by Jesuits and served in the Coast Guard (in the legal department) prior to becoming a police officer. He is a self-professed Republican, but also a former war protester and an ardent supporter of the police officers' union strike action.\n* '''Sgt. Nick Yemana''' ([[Jack Soo]]) is a surrealistically philosophical, wisecracking [[Japanese American]] detective. Though he is closely connected to his Japanese heritage, he is a native of Omaha, Nebraska. Yemana is noted for his \"off the wall\" sense of humor and wry observations about life, as well as for his gambling habits, extraordinarily poor paperwork filing skills, and for making the squad's coffee (which is disliked by everyone who drinks it). After the retirement of Fish, Yemana becomes the ranking detective. In the two-part episode \"Eviction,\" he becomes commanding officer, though he is replaced after a mere few hours. (Harris compares his tenure to that of President [[William Henry Harrison]], who served for one month.)\n* '''Sgt. Miguel \"Chano\" Amanguale''' ([[Gregory Sierra]]) is a dauntless, beleaguered [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] detective, who is very emotionally attached to his job; as such, he has a habit of getting worked up when things go awry and, when this happens, he tends to explode in rapid Spanish should it happen. His lowest moment comes in \"The Hero,\" when he kills two suspects who are robbing a bank.\n* '''Sgt. Arthur P. Dietrich''' ([[Steve Landesberg]]) is a detective with a calm, unflappable nature and a seemingly endless supply of knowledge on a wide array of subjects (he has, as Barney once observed, a \"flair for the esoteric\"), yet he enjoys elements of entertainment that can be seen as ironically simple, such as early morning cartoons and the Three Stooges (his personal favorite). He can usually find a topic to discuss with those he encounters in the squad room, whatever their interest or occupation, though his contribution usually comes out of him in an overly intellectual manner. In \"The Photographer,\" Barney goes so far as to suggest to Dietrich that he has a \"pedantic\" way of expressing himself. Despite his perspicacity, he seems to possess a deep-rooted sense of self-doubt, giving up on more than a few career paths (law and medical school, to name a few) when he finds he isn't a perfect representation of the position in his own eyes; that's why he \"became a cop.\"\n* '''Inspector Frank D. Luger''' ([[James Gregory (actor)|James Gregory]]) is Miller's rambling, out-of-touch, and unapologetically old-school superior who frequently drops by the precinct to \"chat with\" Barney \"in his office\". He refers to Harris as \"Har'\", Dietrich as \"Di-Di.\" and Levitt as \"Levine.\" As time goes by, Luger becomes more and more melancholy and his outdated approach to police work more and more problematic. He has a habit of getting lost in his thoughts, particularly when he reminisces about his old partners Foster, Kleiner and \"Brownie,\" which usually ends up with him getting worked up as he remembers how much he \"loved those guys.\"\n* '''Officer Carl Levitt''' ([[Ron Carey (actor)|Ron Carey]]) is a diminutive, obsequious (but competent and hard-working) uniformed officer who constantly, passive-aggressively badgers Miller about being promoted.  In the series finale, he is finally promoted to detective.\n[[File:Barney Miller 1975.JPG|thumb|170px|Barney and Liz Miller]]\n* '''Elizabeth \"Liz\" Miller''' ([[Barbara Barrie]]) is Barney's wife. A dedicated social worker, she was intended to be a regular character and, during seasons one and two, was listed in the opening credits.  Nevertheless, Liz is seen fairly infrequently.  She is, however, often referred to, and Barney is often seen (and heard) on the phone with her. Later on in the run of the show, she and Barney separate due to the ongoing tension between home life and his work at the 12th, but end up reconciling.\n\nThe show's focus was split between the detectives' interactions with each other and with the suspects and witnesses they detained, processed, and interviewed. Some typical conflicts and long-running plotlines included Miller's frustration with red tape and paperwork, his constant efforts to maintain peace, order, and discipline, and his numerous failed attempts to get a promotion; Harris' preoccupation with outside interests, such as his living arrangements but mainly his novel (''Blood on the Badge''), and his inability to remain focused on his police work; Fish's age-related health issues, marital problems, and reluctance to retire; Wojciehowicz's impulsive behavior and love life; Luger's nostalgia for the old days with partners Foster, Kleiner, and \"Brownie\" Brown; Levitt's quest to become a detective (which is eventually successful); the rivalry between the precinct's resident intellectuals, Harris and Dietrich; and continually\u2014but reliably\u2014bad coffee, usually made by Yemana.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Regulars===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:98%\"\n|-\n!Actor \n!Character\n!Seasons\n!Notes\n|-\n| [[Hal Linden]] \n| Captain Barney Miller\n| <center> 1\u20138 </center>\n|Main star and regular character throughout the series' run.

In Seasons 1, 3 and 4 she was played by [[Florence Stanley]] (in a total of seven appearances); in Bernice's only Season 2 appearance she was portrayed by [[Doris Belack]]. In that episode, Fish also had a grown daughter named Beverly played by Emily Levine. Also seen as recurring characters in Season 3 were group home children Jilly ([[Denise Miller]]) and Victor ([[John Cassisi]]), who would eventually become Fish's foster children. In 1977, the Fishes were [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into their own show, ''[[Fish (U.S. TV series)|Fish]]'' which also starred [[Barry Gordon]], who memorably played an embezzler who gets a pay raise and promotion in Season 5 and a lawyer representing Wojo in Season 8.\n\n====Barney's family====\nIn addition to Barney's wife Liz, Barney's son David (Michael Tessier) and daughter Rachel (Anne Wyndham) appeared in the pilot. Barney's son was written out of the show after the first episode (though was still occasionally mentioned), while his wife made appearances through the second season, and very sporadically thereafter. Wyndham also reprised her role in two later episodes, Season 1, episode 5 \"The Courtesans\", and Season 7, episode 140 \"Rachel\".\n\n====\"Wojo's Girl\"====\nDarlene Parks played Wojo's ex-prostitute girlfriend Nancy in a 2-episode arc in Season 5.

Linden and Vigoda were cast in their series roles; no other eventual cast members were present. [[Abby Dalton]] played Barney Miller's wife, Liz, while [[Val Bisoglio]], Rod Perry, and a pre-''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' [[Charles Haid]] rounded out the cast of the pilot. Guest stars included Mike Moore, Chu Chu Mulave, Henry Beckman, Buddy Lester, Michael Tessier and Anne Wyndham.<ref name=\"imdb.com\">{{cite web|title=The Life and Times of Captain Barney Miller|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0445529/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_64|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe pilot script was later largely reused in the debut episode ''Ramon''.  For this reworked episode, Bisoglio's lines were more or less evenly split between the new characters of Yemana and Chano, while Haid's character of Kazinski became Max Gail's Wojciehowicz.  Rod Perry's character, Sgt. Wilson, was replaced by Harris in the reworked episode, although Wilson would reappear one more time in the first-season episode ''Experience'' before disappearing from the series entirely.  Abby Dalton was replaced by Barbara Barrie as Liz, and Henry Beckman's character of Uncle Charlie was dropped entirely.

Can we just start it out with the bass?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2015/04/23/stories-behind-the-songs-chuck-berghofer/|title=Stories Behind the Songs: Chuck Berghofer|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>  The theme song was ranked #23 and #27, respectively, by ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' and ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazines, in their lists of \"best TV theme songs\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/02/the-50-best-tv-show-theme-songs/barney-miller|title=The Best TV Theme Songs|website=Complex|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/the-50-best-tv-theme-songs.html?a=1|title=The 50 Best TV Theme Songs of All Time|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe theme plays over the Manhattan [[skyline]], followed by shots of the characters and opening credits.  Season 1 opened and closed with a shot of [[Midtown Manhattan]] as seen from [[Weehawken, New Jersey]].  Season 2 onward opened with a shot of [[Lower Manhattan]] as seen from [[Brooklyn Heights]], with a barge being towed in the foreground, and closed with a shot of the [[Midtown Manhattan]] skyline as seen from [[Long Island City]].  Several versions of the theme were used during different seasons, with minor variations in composition and performance.\n\n==Production==\nProduction of ''Barney Miller'' deliberately resembled a theatrical stage play; scenes rarely strayed from the precinct station's squad room, with its prominent open-barred [[jail cell|holding cell]], and Miller's adjoining office. The room was said to be on the second or third floor, depending on the episode. Clutter was plentiful and much of it seemed immobile over the years, including a coat hanging on a clothes rack near Harris' desk. A handful of episodes (fewer than a dozen of 170) were partially or fully set in other locations, including a stakeout location (\"Stakeout\"), a hospital room (\"Hair\"), an undercover operation (\"Grand Hotel\"), a jail (three separate rooms in \"Contempt\"), a hotel room (\"Chinatown\"), and the apartments of Barney (\"Ramon\" and \"Graft\"), Chano (\"The Hero\"), Fish (\"Fish\") and Wojo (\"Wojo's Girl\").  In \"The DNA Story,\" we finally see the inside of the men's room. ''Barney Miller'' tended to obey two of the three [[classical unities]] of drama: unity of place and unity of time. The third unity, unity of action, was not followed, since each episode had multiple subplots.\n\n''Barney Miller'' was one of the few sitcoms of the period that occasionally mentioned the then-current year or allowed the audience to infer the then-current year.\n\n''Barney Miller'' was notorious for its marathon taping sessions.<ref>[http://www.oldtvtickets.com/archives1/2010/04/barney_miller.html Barney Miller entry] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504012907/http://www.oldtvtickets.com/archives1/2010/04/barney_miller.html |date=May 4, 2010 }}, Old TV Tickets blog</ref> Early seasons were recorded before a live studio audience and used a [[laugh track]] for sweetening reactions during post-production. Creator and executive producer [[Danny Arnold]] would then rewrite and restage entire scenes after the audience departed, actively looking for quieter, subtler moments that would not play well before a crowd; a taping session that began in the afternoon or early evening would then continue into the early morning hours. Max Gail referred to this in the Jack Soo retrospective episode aired on May 17, 1979, remarking that one of the clips shown was a scene that \"we finished around 2:30 in the morning.\" In a 1977 [[blooper]], a crew member mentions it being 3:15&nbsp;a.m.\n\nWriter Tom Reeder described working on the show:\n{{quote|text=Danny Arnold was the creator of the show, and especially in the early years, he was a marvel. When he was \"on\", he could spin out entire scenes, ad-libbing dialogue\u2014and great jokes\u2014for every character. By the time those scenes got to script form, though, he obsessively rewrote them.\n \nThat's true of a lot of showrunners, but Danny couldn't seem to stop himself. Sometime during season 2 (or maybe it was 3) the show was no longer taped in front of an audience, partly because the script was rarely done by show night. When one season began, six pages were in print. Not six scripts\u2014six pages of one script.\n \nThis meant that on the day the show was taped, the actors would hang around on the stage, waiting for pages to be sent down. Then\u2014sometimes at 2 a.m.\u2014they would have to learn new scenes. Ron Carey (Officer Levitt) would get his fairly quickly: \"Here's your mail, Captain.\" On the other hand, poor Steve Landesberg (Dietrich) might have to memorize long speeches explaining how nuclear fission works.\n \nIn the early years, Danny benefited from the heroic writing efforts of [[Chris Hayward]], who was a veteran writer, and rookies Tony Sheehan and [[Reinhold Weege]] who, like me, didn't know any better. They were the ''Barney Miller'' writing staff. My agent wisely turned down Danny's annual offers of staff jobs, negotiating freelance assignments (so-called \"multiple deals\") for me instead. Even so, the pace was frantic\u2014on one assignment I was given 3 hours to write the story outline. On another occasion, a friend came into my office at ABC-Vine Street and said, \"Hey, Reeder, want to go get some lunch?\" I pointed to the paper in my typewriter and said, \"This script is on the stage\u2014thanks anyway.\"<ref>[http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/10/barney-miller-inside-look.html Barney Miller: An Inside Look], By Ken Levine blog guest entry\"</ref>}}\n\nEmploying a live audience became impractical as lengthy reshoots became commonplace. By Season 4, only a quiet laugh track was used when necessary.\n\nMarty and Darryl were among the earliest recurring gay characters on American television. Danny Arnold worked closely with the Gay Media Task Force, an activist group that worked on LGBT representation in media, in developing the characters.<ref>Capsuto, p. 122</ref> Initially both characters were presented in a stereotypically effeminate manner but in later appearances Darryl began dressing and speaking in a more mainstream fashion.<ref>Capsuto, pp. 148\u201449</ref> Officer Zatelli's coming out was not the first gay storyline on American television, but was a memorable one.\n\nThe series took a while to become a hit, but ABC supported it anyway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://o.canada.com/2013/07/24/the-state-of-tv-today-on-the-eve-of-the-tv-critics-association-summer-meeting-in-los-angeles-nobody-knows-anything/ |title=Netflix helps shift Hollywood\u2019s business model |publisher=O.canada.com |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}</ref>  Danny Arnold ended production of ''Barney Miller'' in 1982 after eight seasons for fear of repeating storylines; the show was not cancelled by the network.\n\n==Reception by police==\n''Barney Miller'' retains a devoted following among real-life police officers, who appreciate the show's emphasis on dialog and believably quirky characters, and its low-key portrayal of cops going about their jobs. In a 2005 op-ed for the ''New York Times'', real-life New York police detective Lucas Miller wrote:\n\n{{quote|text=Real cops are not usually fans of cop shows. [...] Many police officers maintain that the most realistic police show in the history of television was the sitcom ''Barney Miller'', [...] The action was mostly off screen, the squad room the only set, and the guys were a motley bunch of character actors who were in no danger of being picked for the N.Y.P.D. pin-up calendar. But they worked hard, made jokes, got hurt and answered to their straight-man commander. For real detectives, most of the action does happen off screen, and we spend a lot of time back in the squad room writing reports about it. Like Barney Miller's squad, we crack jokes at one another, at the cases that come in, and at the crazy suspect locked in the holding cell six feet from the new guy's desk. Life really is more like ''Barney Miller'' than ''[[NYPD Blue]]'', but our jokes aren't nearly as funny.<ref>Miller, Lucas (2005).

After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with [[3D Robotics]] (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines.

It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation.

The HERO7 Silver was intended as the mid-range camera, featuring 4K resolutions for video and time-lapse video resolutions and WDR in its photo mode. Initially, both the HERO7 White and Silver defaulted to a video resolution of 1440p with 1080p only available by cropping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.gopro.com/t5/Cameras/GoPro-Hero-7-White-Resolution-Change/m-p/256828#M74643|title=GoPro Hero 7 White Resolution Change|date=2018-11-01|website=community.gopro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This was met with considerable criticism, of which GoPro responded by releasing software updates to both cameras to allow for change in default resolution to 1080p.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/en/hk/update/hero7-silver|title=HERO7 SILVER|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> In contrast to the HERO7 Black, these cameras lacked most time-lapse photo modes, ProTune, wake-on-voice capabilities, H.265 formats and live-streaming.\n\nBy contrast, the HERO7 Black was introduced at the high-end level and primarily encompasses the features of the HERO6 Black with major improvements.   The HERO7 Black introduced a heavily improved electronic image stabilisation known as \"HyperSmooth\" video stabilization, which GoPro has advertised heavily as \"Gimbal-Like\", as its primary improvement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/what-is-hypersmooth|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This feature has resulted in a new time-lapse video feature known as \"TimeWarp\", essentially a hyperlapse mode, although the original time-lapse video mode continues to remain. The HERO7 Black also introduced a live-streaming feature that would live-stream content, in 720p, directly from the HERO7 Black to the user's social media account, provided the user keeps a nearby internet-connected device.\n\nDuring its release, the HERO7 Black largely competed with rival camera and camera accessory manufacturer [[DJI (company)|DJI]] which released the DJI OSMO Action, which also introduced a similar enhanced stabilization feature. \n\nOn February 28, 2019, GoPro released HERO7 Black in a new \"dusk white\" color. This is a limited edition and it has the same specs as in regular version and differs just in color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techlomedia.in/2019/03/gopro-launches-hero7-black-in-limited-edition-dusk-white-66045/|title=GoPro launches HERO7 Black in Limited Edition Dusk White|date=2019-03-01|website=TechloMedia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Most notably, the \"HyperSmooth\" feature introduced in the HERO7 Black was improved on and named \"HyperSmooth 2.0\", also resulting in an improvement of the TimeWarp feature introduced in the HERO7 Black. The HERO8 Black also improved the image quality, improving the HDR functions of the camera to allow HDR to assist the SuperPhoto function of the camera that automatically chooses what image processing to use such as high dynamic range (HDR). GoPro also reintroduced the field-of-view (FOV) functionality as, \"Digital Lenses\" which retains the original SuperView, Wide, Narrow, Linear FOV settings. Moreover, live-streaming now streams in 1080p instead of the HERO7 Black's 720p and the RAW imaging functionality has now been expanded for all photo modes. \n\nThe HERO8 Black largely introduced several new functions into the camera. Physically, the HERO8 Black now incorporates the connecting prongs that are used to connect accessories, directly onto the camera. Originally, the cameras would only be able to access the prongs if the cameras utilised either the frames (for cameras HERO5 to HERO7) or the protective cases for HERO4 and before. Moreover, the GoPro logo moved under the LCD screen to make way for extra microphones. More additions to the camera most notably were part of the software aspects of the camera. These included an option to switch between various settings presets, including standard, activity, cinematic and action shots and adjusting on-screen shortcuts of the user interface. Most notably as part of software, was the introduction of the night-lapse video, which similar to the time-lapse video mode, automatically stitches the frames captured by the camera at set intervals, however with the addition of improved low-light performance.  \n\nThe HERO8 Black also attempts to address vloggers who may wish to use the GoPro in such a manner. As such, GoPro has also introduced an external accessory known as the \"Media Mod\" which includes a USB Type-C port for supplying power to external microphones and accessories, a micro-HDMI port and a 3.5mm microphone port. Moreover, the accessory includes a mount to connect either external microphones, LEDs or an LCD screen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !!

Starting with the HERO 5 Black, the digital-to-analogue converter is no longer part of the camera itself, and instead relies on an external USB-C Audio Adapter manufactured and sold by GoPro. Although simpler models exist, they do not trigger the required menu item in the camera to enable external sources, and hence do not provide an audio signal. The adapter provides an option to connect audio and power simultaneously. \n\nWhile the adapter still works with HERO 8 cameras, the battery door needs to be removed to expose the USB-C port. This can lead to power loss during operation when the camera is subjected to minor vibrations. Third party doors are available that expose the port while holding the battery firmly in place. GoPro's own Media Mod also provides access to an external audio source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV)\n* [[Egocentric vision]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|GoPro}}\n* {{Official website}}\n*Video [http://www.peachpit.com/promotions/gopro-videos-140450 gallery to show methods and examples] for book, ''GoPro Professional Filmmaking'' (2015 Peachpit Press).\n\n[[Category:2002 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Action cameras]]\n[[Category:Camcorders]]\n[[Category:Photography companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Video surveillance companies]]\n[[Category:2014 initial public offerings]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{short description|American technology company}}\n{{about|the company|the song|Ride On (Texas Hippie Coalition album) }}\n{{Infobox company\n| name = GoPro, Inc.hh\n| logo = GoPro logo light.svg\n| former_names = Woodman Labs, Inc.\n| type = [[Public company|Public]]\n| traded_as = {{NASDAQ|GPRO}} (Class A)<br>[[Russell 2000 Index|Russell 2000 Component]]\n| industry = {{flatlist|\n*[[Technology]]\n*[[Videography]]\n*[[Consumer electronics]]\n}}\n| foundation = {{Start date and age|2002}}\n| founder = [[Nick Woodman]]\n| location_city = [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], [[California]]\n| area_served = Worldwide\n| key_people = {{plainlist|\n*[[Nick Woodman]] ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]])\n}}\n| products = {{flatlist|\n*[[Action camera]]\n*[[Video editing software]]\n*[[Mobile app]]\n}}\n| brands = Authentic design logo Andi Nugraha [[alt]]{{dn|date=March 2020}}\n| revenue = {{decrease}} [[United States dollar|US$]]1.18 billion (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\">{{cite web|title=GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results |url=https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2018/GoPro-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2017-Results/default.aspx |publisher=GoPro |accessdate=April 3, 2018 |location=San Mateo, California |date=February 1, 2018}}</ref>\n| operating_income = {{decrease}} \u2212US$163.46 million (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| net_income = {{decrease}} \u2212US$182.87 million (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| assets = {{decrease}} US$0.85 billion (2017)<ref name=\"2017results\" />\n| equity = \n| num_employees = 964 (2019)\n| divisions = \n| subsid = {{plainlist|\n*[[CineForm]]\n*Replay\n*Splice\n}}\n| location_country = [[United States|U.S.]]\n| homepage = {{URL|https://www.gopro.com}}\n}}\n\n'''GoPro, Inc.'''<ref name=\"sec-filing\">{{cite web|title= FORM S-1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT \u2013 GOPRO, INC. |url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000119312514204902/d552193ds1.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |access-date= May 21, 2014}}</ref> (marketed as '''GoPro''' and sometimes stylized as '''GoPRO''') is an [[United States|American]] [[technology]] company founded in 2002 by [[Nick Woodman]].

After the failure of these negotiations, GoPro entered into an agreement with [[3D Robotics]] (3DR) for a similar partnership based on 3DR's flight controllers. 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines.

It does not have the ability to record 25/30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes (it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions). This is an intentional firmware limitation.

The HERO7 Silver was intended as the mid-range camera, featuring 4K resolutions for video and time-lapse video resolutions and WDR in its photo mode. Initially, both the HERO7 White and Silver defaulted to a video resolution of 1440p with 1080p only available by cropping.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.gopro.com/t5/Cameras/GoPro-Hero-7-White-Resolution-Change/m-p/256828#M74643|title=GoPro Hero 7 White Resolution Change|date=2018-11-01|website=community.gopro.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This was met with considerable criticism, of which GoPro responded by releasing software updates to both cameras to allow for change in default resolution to 1080p.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/en/hk/update/hero7-silver|title=HERO7 SILVER|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> In contrast to the HERO7 Black, these cameras lacked most time-lapse photo modes, ProTune, wake-on-voice capabilities, H.265 formats and live-streaming.\n\nBy contrast, the HERO7 Black was introduced at the high-end level and primarily encompasses the features of the HERO6 Black with major improvements.   The HERO7 Black introduced a heavily improved electronic image stabilisation known as \"HyperSmooth\" video stabilization, which GoPro has advertised heavily as \"Gimbal-Like\", as its primary improvement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gopro.com/help/articles/block/what-is-hypersmooth|website=gopro.com|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref> This feature has resulted in a new time-lapse video feature known as \"TimeWarp\", essentially a hyperlapse mode, although the original time-lapse video mode continues to remain. The HERO7 Black also introduced a live-streaming feature that would live-stream content, in 720p, directly from the HERO7 Black to the user's social media account, provided the user keeps a nearby internet-connected device.\n\nDuring its release, the HERO7 Black largely competed with rival camera and camera accessory manufacturer [[DJI (company)|DJI]] which released the DJI OSMO Action, which also introduced a similar enhanced stabilization feature. \n\nOn February 28, 2019, GoPro released HERO7 Black in a new \"dusk white\" color. This is a limited edition and it has the same specs as in regular version and differs just in color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techlomedia.in/2019/03/gopro-launches-hero7-black-in-limited-edition-dusk-white-66045/|title=GoPro launches HERO7 Black in Limited Edition Dusk White|date=2019-03-01|website=TechloMedia|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Most notably, the \"HyperSmooth\" feature introduced in the HERO7 Black was improved on and named \"HyperSmooth 2.0\", also resulting in an improvement of the TimeWarp feature introduced in the HERO7 Black. The HERO8 Black also improved the image quality, improving the HDR functions of the camera to allow HDR to assist the SuperPhoto function of the camera that automatically chooses what image processing to use such as high dynamic range (HDR). GoPro also reintroduced the field-of-view (FOV) functionality as, \"Digital Lenses\" which retains the original SuperView, Wide, Narrow, Linear FOV settings. Moreover, live-streaming now streams in 1080p instead of the HERO7 Black's 720p and the RAW imaging functionality has now been expanded for all photo modes. \n\nThe HERO8 Black largely introduced several new functions into the camera. Physically, the HERO8 Black now incorporates the connecting prongs that are used to connect accessories, directly onto the camera. Originally, the cameras would only be able to access the prongs if the cameras utilised either the frames (for cameras HERO5 to HERO7) or the protective cases for HERO4 and before. Moreover, the GoPro logo moved under the LCD screen to make way for extra microphones. More additions to the camera most notably were part of the software aspects of the camera. These included an option to switch between various settings presets, including standard, activity, cinematic and action shots and adjusting on-screen shortcuts of the user interface. Most notably as part of software, was the introduction of the night-lapse video, which similar to the time-lapse video mode, automatically stitches the frames captured by the camera at set intervals, however with the addition of improved low-light performance.  \n\nThe HERO8 Black also attempts to address vloggers who may wish to use the GoPro in such a manner. As such, GoPro has also introduced an external accessory known as the \"Media Mod\" which includes a USB Type-C port for supplying power to external microphones and accessories, a micro-HDMI port and a 3.5mm microphone port. Moreover, the accessory includes a mount to connect either external microphones, LEDs or an LCD screen.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Model !!

Starting with the HERO 5 Black, the digital-to-analogue converter is no longer part of the camera itself, and instead relies on an external USB-C Audio Adapter manufactured and sold by GoPro. Although simpler models exist, they do not trigger the required menu item in the camera to enable external sources, and hence do not provide an audio signal. The adapter provides an option to connect audio and power simultaneously. \n\nWhile the adapter still works with HERO 8 cameras, the battery door needs to be removed to expose the USB-C port. This can lead to power loss during operation when the camera is subjected to minor vibrations. Third party doors are available that expose the port while holding the battery firmly in place. GoPro's own Media Mod also provides access to an external audio source.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV)\n* [[Egocentric vision]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|GoPro}}\n* {{Official website}}\n*Video [http://www.peachpit.com/promotions/gopro-videos-140450 gallery to show methods and examples] for book, ''GoPro Professional Filmmaking'' (2015 Peachpit Press).\n\n[[Category:2002 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:Action cameras]]\n[[Category:Camcorders]]\n[[Category:Photography companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Mateo, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Technology companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Video surveillance companies]]\n[[Category:2014 initial public offerings]]\n", "name_user": "Sauhard93", "label": "safe", "comment": "Edited Gramatical errors and added some information on GoPro", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoPro"}

The drama describes her trials, tribulations and triumphs at school and some of the lifelong friendships she made there, and her life after graduating and working at a publishing company and as a translator.

The drama then returns to the past to tell the story of roughly the first half of her life. Born Hana Ando to a small and poor farming family in [[Yamanashi Prefecture]]'s [[K\u014dfu, Yamanashi|K\u014dfu city]], she was too busy with household chores to go to school until her Christian father, Kippei Ando, a somewhat educated wandering salesman who married the kind but illiterate Fuji, gave her a picture book when she was seven years old. This sparked a girl who already had a powerful imagination and love for stories. Noticing her interest in it, he sent her to a local primary school, where she quickly learned to read and write. Despite family opposition, he arranged for her to enter a Christian school in Tokyo, the Shuwa School for Girls, on a scholarship. Hana does poorly there at first, especially at English, but prompted by the principal, she takes up a passion for the English language. A few years later, nearing graduation, she does a part-time job at a publishing company, where she impresses everyone with translation skills, including Eiji Muraoka, the heir to a printing company, who gives her an English dictionary. At school, she decides to become friends with Renko Hayama, a difficult woman, much older than the rest, who had been sent to the school by her aristocratic family after dissatisfying the family of her first husband. During the school production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', starring Renko as Juliet and Hana's friend Daigo as Romeo, and translated by Hana, Renko finally opens up to Hana and the two become the best of friends. Hana, however, is furious when Renko suddenly leaves the school without telling her to marry Densuke Kano, a [[coal-mining]] baron from [[Fukuoka]] [[Kyushu]], not knowing Renko's family had again forced her into a political marriage. Hana continues on to the upper school, and it is at that time she encounters Kayo, her younger sister who had been contracted to a sewing mill, but had fled the miserable conditions. She helps her get back on her feet, but with little employment for an intelligent, independent woman, Hana leaves Kayo in Tokyo upon graduation and returns to K\u014dfu to become a teacher at her old primary school.\n\nHana is at first not a very good teacher, but slowly learns the ropes, especially with the help of Asaichi, her childhood friend who is now also a teacher at the school and is secretly in love with Hana. But there is strife in Hana's family. Her brother Kitchitaro, who himself had fallen in love with Renko when she once visited K\u014dfu, rebels against his father and decides to leave town and join the [[Kempeitai]], Japan's formidable military police force. Hana's younger sister Momo also leaves to marry a man in Hokkaido when, even after falling in love with Asaichi, she decides to let him pursue his love for Hana. Asaichi, however, never ends up confessing his love. Instead, Hana grows further away from him as she begins publishing her stories and even wins a prize from a Tokyo publisher. Encouraged by the publisher and her friends, including Asaichi, she quits her teaching position to return to Tokyo to work at the publisher, where Daigo also is employed. There she sees that Kayo has become a waitress at a fancy Western-style cafe.\n\nHana also struggles at the publisher, dealing with deadlines and difficult authors. She participates in the publisher's new children's magazine by translating [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', a book suggested to her by Eiji's younger brother Ikuya. Renko also writes to Hana for the first time since they parted at school, having seen Hana's publications, and having published her own book of poetry. She visits Tokyo and encourages Hana to pursue her love for Eiji, even as she, feeling trapped in a marriage with a kind but uncultured man, begins an affair with Ry\u016bichi Miyamoto, a law student involved in left-wing theater who happens to be watched by Kichitaro and the Kempeitai. Hana, however, is shocked to learn that Eiji, despite once hugging her in a fit of emotion, is married to a sick but beautiful woman, Kasumi. Kasumi, however, eventually divorces Eiji, discerning from the illustrations he drew for Hana's translations his love for Hana, and dies soon after. It is Asaichi, however, that eventually pushes Eiji to marry Hana. Soon, the two have a son, Ayumu. Renko then starts a national scandal by running away with Ry\u016bichi. When she is pregnant, her family finds and takes her away, but just then, the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] takes place. Hana, Eiji, and Ayumu are safe, and Renko is able to flee her family, but Ikuya dies just after proposing marriage to Kayo in the cafe.\n\nIn the years after the quake, Hana and the others slowly rebuild their lives. With help from Kano, Eiji is able to restart the printing company and publish ''The Prince and the Pauper'' in book form. Kayo starts her own cafe, and Renko and Daigo become advocates for oppressed women. Hana, however, is devastated when Ayumu dies of [[dysentery]]. She only recovers when she realizes the importance of her telling stories to the children of Japan. That she begins to do on the radio, in addition to print. In the meantime, Kichitaro announces his hope to marry Daigo, but Kempeitai officials prevent him from doing that. Momo suddenly appears in Tokyo, having fled Hokkaido after her husband died and she was mistreated by his family. In a family meeting, she confesses her resentment at the fact that Hana has seemingly received the best in life, a resentment Kichitaro could share. Sympathizing with her, a struggling artist named Akira proposes marriage to Momo.\n\nThe two marry and have one daughter, Misato, who Hanako and Eiji end up adopting when Akira comes down with [[tuberculosis]], and another, Naoko. Japan, however, is headed towards war. Miyamoto is arrested for trying to stop the hostilities, and Hanako and Renko part ways when Hanako fails to sufficiently oppose the war. On the radio, Hanako must increasingly tell glorious stories of soldiers on the front. Just before the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], Miss Scott, her teacher from Shuwa, gives her ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'' in hopes Hanako would eventually translate it. When the [[Pacific War]] begins, Hanako quits her radio job as she senses it is no longer about giving children dreams. She and Eiji soon suffer for their connection to enemy literature and language. Miyamoto, released from prison, soon leaves Renko to seek out other means to bring peace. Eventually, the bombing reaches Tokyo and Hanako, who decides translating ''Anne of Green Gables'' is one way of dealing with this war, barely escapes with her family and manuscript when an air raid nearly destroys their neighborhood.\n\nThe war ends, but scars remain. Kayo had lost her caf\u00e9. Renko had lost her beloved son Junpei in the last days of the conflict, and blames Hanako for urging children on the radio to fight for the nation. This shocks Hanako, who then initially refuses a request to return to the radio. She had begun translating again, but no one wants to publish ''Anne of Green Gables''. With the defeat, Kichitaro becomes an empty shell, feeling that everything he had worked for had come to naught. In K\u014dfu, however, Hanako and Kichitar\u014d learn from Kippei the need to be proud of their efforts and the importance of making up for what they had done. Kichitaro decides to take over the farm and Daigo arrives to declare her intention to stay with Kichitaro. Knowing her father wants to hear her again on air, Hanako resumes her radio show, and Kippei dies happily while hearing his daughter's voice over the broadcast.\n\nHanako and Renko eventually mend their friendship, especially since Hanako can understand what it feels like to lose a son. At her request, Renko goes on the radio to urge mothers never to let their sons go to war again. Then, seven years after the end of the war, Hanako is finally able to publish ''Anne of Green Gables'' to great acclaim.\n\n==Production==\n\nThe names of some people and places in the drama differ from historical fact. The plot is based on the biography by Muraoka's granddaughter, Eri Muraoka, which was made into a screenplay by the Japanese screenwriter Miho Nakazono. The screenplay departs from historical fact in order to show similarities and parallels between the heroine Hana and Anne of ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'', and to show scenes reminiscent of the novel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gokigenyo!|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/drama-blog/4030/183982.html|work=Sutaffu Burogu|publisher=NHK|accessdate=7 May

The drama describes her trials, tribulations and triumphs at school and some of the lifelong friendships she made there, and her life after graduating and working at a publishing company and as a translator.

The drama then returns to the past to tell the story of roughly the first half of her life. Born Hana Ando to a small and poor farming family in [[Yamanashi Prefecture]]'s [[K\u014dfu, Yamanashi|K\u014dfu city]], she was too busy with household chores to go to school until her Christian father, Kippei Ando, a somewhat educated wandering salesman who married the kind but illiterate Fuji, gave her a picture book when she was seven years old. This sparked a girl who already had a powerful imagination and love for stories. Noticing her interest in it, he sent her to a local primary school, where she quickly learned to read and write. Despite family opposition, he arranged for her to enter a Christian school in Tokyo, the Shuwa School for Girls, on a scholarship. Hana does poorly there at first, especially at English, but prompted by the principal, she takes up a passion for the English language. A few years later, nearing graduation, she does a part-time job at a publishing company, where she impresses everyone with translation skills, including Eiji Muraoka, the heir to a printing company, who gives her an English dictionary. At school, she decides to become friends with Renko Hayama, a difficult woman, much older than the rest, who had been sent to the school by her aristocratic family after dissatisfying the family of her first husband. During the school production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', starring Renko as Juliet and Hana's friend Daigo as Romeo, and translated by Hana, Renko finally opens up to Hana and the two become the best of friends. Hana, however, is furious when Renko suddenly leaves the school without telling her to marry Densuke Kano, a [[coal-mining]] baron from [[Fukuoka]] [[Kyushu]], not knowing Renko's family had again forced her into a political marriage. Hana continues on to the upper school, and it is at that time she encounters Kayo, her younger sister who had been contracted to a sewing mill, but had fled the miserable conditions. She helps her get back on her feet, but with little employment for an intelligent, independent woman, Hana leaves Kayo in Tokyo upon graduation and returns to K\u014dfu to become a teacher at her old primary school.\n\nHana is at first not a very good teacher, but slowly learns the ropes, especially with the help of Asaichi, her childhood friend who is now also a teacher at the school and is secretly in love with Hana. But there is strife in Hana's family. Her brother Kitchitaro, who himself had fallen in love with Renko when she once visited K\u014dfu, rebels against his father and decides to leave town and join the [[Kempeitai]], Japan's formidable military police force. Hana's younger sister Momo also leaves to get married to a man in Hokkaido when, even after falling in love with Asaichi, she decides to let him pursue his love for Hana. Asaichi, however, never ends up confessing his love. Instead, Hana grows further away from him as she begins publishing her stories and even wins a prize from a Tokyo publisher. Encouraged by the publisher and her friends, including Asaichi, she quits her teaching position to return to Tokyo to work at the publisher, where Daigo also is employed. There she sees that Kayo has become a waitress at a fancy Western-style cafe.\n\nHana also struggles at the publisher, dealing with deadlines and difficult authors. She participates in the publisher's new children's magazine by translating [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Prince and the Pauper]]'', a book suggested to her by Eiji's younger brother Ikuya. Renko also writes to Hana for the first time since they parted at school, having seen Hana's publications, and having published her own book of poetry. She visits Tokyo and encourages Hana to pursue her love for Eiji, even as she, feeling trapped in a marriage with a kind but uncultured man, begins an affair with Ry\u016bichi Miyamoto, a law student involved in left-wing theater who happens to be watched by Kichitaro and the Kempeitai. Hana, however, is shocked to learn that Eiji, despite once hugging her in a fit of emotion, is married to a sick but beautiful woman, Kasumi. Kasumi, however, eventually divorces Eiji, discerning from the illustrations he drew for Hana's translations his love for Hana, and dies soon after. It is Asaichi, however, that eventually pushes Eiji to marry Hana. Soon, the two have a son, Ayumu. Renko then starts a national scandal by running away with Ry\u016bichi. When she is pregnant, her family finds and takes her away, but just then, the [[1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake|Great Kant\u014d earthquake]] takes place. Hana, Eiji, and Ayumu are safe, and Renko is able to flee her family, but Ikuya dies just after proposing marriage to Kayo in the cafe.\n\nIn the years after the quake, Hana and the others slowly rebuild their lives. With help from Kano, Eiji is able to restart the printing company and publish ''The Prince and the Pauper'' in book form. Kayo starts her own cafe, and Renko and Daigo become advocates for oppressed women. Hana, however, is devastated when Ayumu dies of [[dysentery]]. She only recovers when she realizes the importance of her telling stories to the children of Japan. That she begins to do on the radio, in addition to print. In the meantime, Kichitaro announces his hope to marry Daigo, but Kempeitai officials prevent him from doing that. Momo suddenly appears in Tokyo, having fled Hokkaido after her husband died and she was mistreated by his family. In a family meeting, she confesses her resentment at the fact that Hana has seemingly received the best in life, a resentment Kichitaro could share. Sympathizing with her, a struggling artist named Akira proposes marriage to Momo.\n\nThe two marry and have one daughter, Misato, who Hanako and Eiji end up adopting when Akira comes down with [[tuberculosis]], and another, Naoko. Japan, however, is headed towards war. Miyamoto is arrested for trying to stop the hostilities, and Hanako and Renko part ways when Hanako fails to sufficiently oppose the war. On the radio, Hanako must increasingly tell glorious stories of soldiers on the front. Just before the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], Miss Scott, her teacher from Shuwa, gives her ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'' in hopes Hanako would eventually translate it. When the [[Pacific War]] begins, Hanako quits her radio job as she senses it is no longer about giving children dreams. She and Eiji soon suffer for their connection to enemy literature and language.
