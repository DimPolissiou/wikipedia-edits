Flashing amber arrow allows turning without priority (turn must be done exercising caution, giving way to any other vehicles and pedestrians that may cross the path), while a lit green arrow grants priority. If just a regular set of traffic lights is present (no light arrows), then turning on red is prohibited.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], right turn on red is allowed only when the \"H\u00e6gri Kveiktu \u00e1 Rau\u00f0um\" sign is displayed at the traffic junction.

These changes for reasons of road safety.<ref>{{cite web|title=Changes of Lithuanian Traffic rules on 3 October 2014 - valid from 10 October 2014 |language=Lithuanian|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=484529&p_tr2=2|archive-url=https://archive.is/20141123221243/http://www3.lrs.lt/pls/inter3/dokpaieska.showdoc_l?p_id=484529&p_tr2=2|url-status=dead|archivedate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] right turns on red are allowed only when there is a lit green arrow present (called S 5 in Czech Republic and S 10 in Slovakia). Also in this case the car turning on red must give way to ongoing traffic, to pedestrians and other road users. (According to Czech law \u00a770 of decree 30/2001 of Law Codex; and Slovak law \u00a79, part 3g, decree 9/2009 of Law Codex)\n\nIn [[Romania]], right turns on red are prohibited, except when there is a small green flashing light with a right turn arrow. Drivers must yield to pedestrians and oncoming vehicles from their left. In some one-way junctions, the same rule applies for left on red (such as [[Cluj-Napoca]] [[Avram Iancu Square, Cluj-Napoca|Avram Iancu Square]]).\n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], right turns on red are prohibited.\n\nIn [[Spain]], right turns are allowed only if there's either a flashing amber or lit green arrow-shaped traffic light. Flashing amber arrow allows turning without priority (turn must be done exercising caution, giving way to any other vehicles and pedestrians that may cross the path), while a lit green arrow grants priority. If just a regular set of traffic lights is present (no light arrows), then turning on red is prohibited.\n\nIn [[Iceland]], right turn on red is allowed only when the \"H\u00e6gri Kveiktu \u00e1 Rau\u00f0um\" sign is displayed at the traffic junction. The driver will have to stop at the red light first and give way to pedestrians and oncoming vehicles from their left before turning.\n\n==Asia==\n\nAs in the former United Kingdom British Colony of Hong Kong Overseas British Territories, left turn on red is always prohibited in [[Hong Kong]]. At some junctions, however, there may be separate sets of signals for left turns, or specific lanes for turning left separating from the through traffic by [[traffic island]]s and [[give way sign]]s are installed. One such example is at the junction of [[Queen's Road East]] and [[Morrison Hill Road]].\n\nIn [[China]], a right turn on red is generally permitted, unless there is a red arrow pointing to the right. However, certain cities such as [[Shantou]] prohibited right turn on red.\n\nIn [[India]], which drives on the left, a \"free left turn\" is generally prohibited.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adhiraj Joglekar|title=Driving in India: At Red Lights There are no Free Left Turns|date=8 May 2007|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQblcMUL8jg|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.indiastudychannel.com/resources/83838-Common-Traffic-Rules.aspx|title=Common Traffic Rules|date=30 August 2009|newspaper=India Study Channel|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref> However, some cities specifically permit turning left on a red signal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/for-a-change-its-a-hasslefree-ride/article8030897.ece|title=For a change, it's a hassle-free ride|last=Ramu|first=Marri|date=26 December 2015|newspaper=The Hindu|issn=0971-751X|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chandigarhtrafficpolice.org/directions.php|title=Chandigarh traffic police, promoting road safety, traffic safety, India road signs & rules, safe responsible driving, first aid India.|website=www.chandigarhtrafficpolice.org|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref> An explicit green or blinking orange left signal also permits a turn on red, which usually means that conflicting traffic is not permitted to enter the same road.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.team-bhp.com/forum/street-experiences/104328-did-govt-change-no-free-left-rule-off-late-2.html|title=Did govt change the \"No Free Left\" Rule, off late - Team-BHP|newspaper=Team-BHP.com|accessdate=5 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Japan]], which drives on the left, the left turn on a red light requires either a green left arrow signal along with the red light, or a white road sign with a blue left arrow (not to be confused with the one way sign).\n\nIn [[Malaysia]], left turn on red can only be observed in [[Sarawak]] since 1960s and [[Putrajaya]] since mid-2000s. The road sign by the traffic lights in Sarawak may state \"Turn Left when Exit is Clear\", as English, Malay and Chinese are used for road signage. The practice is not implemented nationwide. \n\nAs in the former United Kingdom British Colony Straits of Singapore Overseas British Territories and which drives on the left, left turn on red is always prohibited at the traffic junction in [[Singapore]]. The driver must stop at the red light and wait for green lights to turn left only on green lights on.

Harpers in the old Irish tradition were still living as late as 1792, and ten, including [[Arthur O'Neill (harpist)|Arthur O'Neill]], [[Patrick Quin]] and [[Donnchadh \u00d3 H\u00e1msaigh]], attended the [[Belfast Harp Festival]]. \u00d3 H\u00e1msaigh did play some of Carolan's music but disliked it for being too modern. Some of Carolan's own compositions show influences of the style of continental classical music, whereas others such as Carolan's ''Farewell to Music'' reflect a much older style of \"Gaelic Harping\".\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Turlough Carolan memorial - Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|left|Carolan's memorial in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] was the gift of [[Sydney, Lady Morgan]].]]\n\nCarolan was born in 1670 in [[Nobber]], [[County Meath]], where his father was a blacksmith. The family moved from Meath to [[Ballyfarnon]], [[County Roscommon]] in 1684. In Roscommon, his father took a job with the [[MacDermotRoe|MacDermott Roe]] family of Alderford House. Mrs. MacDermott Roe gave Turlough an education, and he showed talent in poetry. After being blinded by [[smallpox]] at the age of eighteen, Carolan was apprenticed by Mrs. MacDermott Roe to a good harper. At the age of twenty-one, being given a horse and a guide, he set out to travel Ireland and compose songs for patrons.<ref>White, Harry: \"Carolan, Turlough (\u00d3 Cearbhall\u00e1in, Toirdhealbhach)\", in: ''[[Dictionary of Irish Biography]]'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nFor almost fifty years, Carolan journeyed from one end of Ireland to the other, composing and performing his tunes. One of his earliest compositions was about Brigid Cruise, with whom he was infatuated. Brigid was the teenage daughter of the schoolmaster at the school for the blind attended by Carolan in Cruisetown, Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hardiman|first=James|title=Irish Minstrelsy, or, Bardic Remains of Ireland: with English poetical translations|url=https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00currgoog|year=1831|publisher=J. Robins|location=London|page=xlix}}</ref> In 1720, Carolan married Mary Maguire. He was then 50 years of age. Their first family home was a cottage on a parcel of land near the town of Manachain (now [[Mohill]]) in County Leitrim, where they settled. They had seven children, six daughters and one son. In 1733 Mary died.\n\nTurlough O'Carolan died on 25 March 1738. He is buried in the MacDermott Roe family crypt in Kilronan Burial Ground near [[Ballyfarnon]], County Roscommon. The annual O'Carolan Harp Festival and Summer School commemorates his life and work in [[Keadue]], County Roscommon.\n\nA bronze monument by sculptor [[Oisin Kelly]] depicting Turlough O'Carolan playing his harp was erected on a plinth at the Market Square, Mohill, on 10 August 1986, and was unveiled by [[Patrick Hillery]], [[President of Ireland]].\n\nA statue was erected to him at his place of birth (Nobber, Co Meath) in 2002, during the Annual O'Carolan Harp Festival, the first of which was held in Nobber in 1988.\n\n==Music and style==\nCarolan composed both songs and instrumental harp music, reflecting various styles of composition. About a third of Carolan's surviving music have associated Irish lyrics that survive to this day. Largely these lyrics are unknown to the musicians of today, who have for the most part adapted Carolan's repertoire to the currently popular Irish fare of jigs and reels.\n\nCarolan's activities during his career are only partially documented historically. This has led to a lack of accurate information about Carolan and his music, even among Irish musicians. Sometimes, alternate titles or incorrect titles have been applied to songs, creating confusion as to whether the song is Carolan's or someone else's. Also, some of those who have written about Carolan and his music have made up facts or repeated unfounded stories. For instance, Edward Bunting, who began the work of collecting Carolan's pieces, referred to a \"very ancient air\" the Fairy Queen, saying it \"seems to have been the original of Carolan's ''Fairy Queen''.\" He also reported that \"the ''Fairy Queen'' of Carolan was not intended by him for words, but as a piece of music for the harp.\" While it is true that Carolan did not write the traditional ''Fairy Queen'' words, which indeed do exist, the words are not ancient (nor is the entirely different traditional Irish air ''The Fairy Queen'')<ref>{{cite book |author=O'Sullivan, Donal |year=1958 |title=Carolan: The life, times, and music of an Irish harper |location=London, UK |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |at=vol.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;116}}</ref>, and the words do in fact fit perfectly the original music which Carolan composed for them.<ref>As heard on Track&nbsp;8 of ''Le Concert de l'Hostel Dieu'', by Garlic Bread, 2013</ref>\n\nIrish was the majority language in Ireland during Carolan's time. As Carolan did not speak English very well, he composed only one song in English, \"Carolan's Devotion\". Most of his songs were dedicated to and written about specific individual patrons. Many of his tunes are widely performed and appreciated today, and a handful of his Irish songs have been recorded by various artists.

Many of these recordings are by such well-known performers as [[The Chieftains]], [[Planxty]], Patrick Ball, and Joemy Wilson, others by less well known artists. Occasionally, an artist who is popular in another area will record a single Carolan song for variety, such as Steeleye Span's ''Sheebeg and Sheemore'', [[John Renbourn]]'s ''[[Lament for Owen Roe O'Neill]]'', [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]'s ''Morgan Mawgan'' [sic], Stefan Grossman's ''Blind Mary'', John Williams' ''Mrs. Maxwell'', and many others. Several popular collections by multiple artists have also been issued, including ''The Music of O\u2019Carolan'' (1993), ''Deluxe Anthology of Carolan'' (1995), ''Celtic Treasure'' (1996), and ''Celtic Treasure II'' (2001). The sheer quantity of these recordings has greatly expanded the number of Carolan pieces known to the public, but the performers do tend to come back to certain songs again and again. Among the most frequently recorded pieces are the following:\n\n''Carolan\u2019s Concerto'' (at least 35), ''Blind Mary'' (at least 23), ''[[S\u00ed Bheag, S\u00ed Mh\u00f3r|Sheebeg and Sheemore]]'' (at least 22), ''Planxty George Brabazon'' (at least 21), ''Planxty Col. Irwin'' (at least 19), ''Fanny Power'' (at least 19), ''Eleanor Plunkett'' (at least 18), ''Carolan\u2019s Farewell to Music'' (at least 18), ''Carolan\u2019s Draught'' (at least 17), ''Hewlett'' (at least 16), ''The Princess Royal'' (at least 16), and ''Stafford's Receipt'' (at least 16). In addition, innumerable musicians have performed many of Carolan's tunes learned from such books as ''The Fiddler's Fakebook'',<ref>Brody, David ''[[The Fiddler's Fakebook]]'' (New York: Oak Publications, 1983).</ref> which contains some of the above tunes plus ''Morgan Magan'' and ''Planxty Drury''. Also, ''O'Neill\u2019s Music of Ireland'' (1903)<ref>http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/music/book/oneills/</ref> is still in print and contains over 60 of Carolan's tunes, of which far too many to list have made their way into the repertoire of musicians around the world.\n\nIn addition, ''Carolan's Concerto'' has been used as a neutral slow march by the [[Foot Guards]] of the [[British Army]] during the ceremony of [[Trooping the Colour]]. Also, some of Carolan's compositions have appeared in the role-playing game ''[[Fate (video game)|FATE]]''.\n\nCarolan's music has frequently been adapted for fingerstyle guitar (primarily steel string acoustic), often by altering the tuning from standard (EADGBE) to DADGBE (drop D), DADGAD, and CGDGAD, among others. This allows strings to ring out and results in a more harp-like sound. Duck Baker has recorded many Carolan songs in drop D tuning. El McMeen performs almost exclusively in CGDGAD, and has recorded many Carolan songs.\n\n==Compositions==\nThe complete list of the 214 Carolan compositions identified by Donal O'Sullivan (see References) are, in alphabetical order, as follows:\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*All Alive\n*Baptist Johnston\n*Betty MacNeill\n*Betty O'Brien\n*Blind Mary\n*Brian Maguire\n*Bridget Cruise, 1st Air\n*Bridget Cruise, 2nd Air\n*Bridget Cruise, 3rd Air\n*Bridget Cruise, 4th Air\n*Bumper Squire Jones\n*Captain Higgins\n*Captain Magan\n*Captain O'Kane\n*Captain O'Neill, (no. 214)\n*Captain Sudley (Carolan's Dowry)\n*Carolan's Cap\n*Carolan's Cottage\n*Carolan's Cup\n*Carolan's Draught\n*Carolan's Dream\n*Carolan's Farewell to Music\n*Carolan's Frolic\n*Carolan's Maggot\n*Carolan's Quarrel with the Landlady\n*Carolan's Ramble to Cashel\n*[[Carolan's Welcome]], (no. 171)\n*Catherine Martin\n*Catherine O'More\n*Charles O'Conor\n*The Clergy's Lamentation\n*Colonel Irwin\n*Colonel Manus O'Donnell\n*Colonel O'Hara\n*Conor O'Reilly\n*Constantine Maguire\n*Counsellor Dillon\n*Cremonea\n*Daniel Kelly\n*The Dark, Plaintive Youth\n*David Power\n*Denis O'Conor, 1st Air\n*Denis O'Conor, 2nd Air\n*Dolly MacDonough (The Morning Star)\n*Donal O'Brien\n*Dr. John Hart\n*Dr. John Stafford (Stafford's Receipt)\n*Dr. MacMahon, Bishop of Clogher\n*Dr. Delany\n*Dr. John Hart, Bishop of Achonry\n*Dr. O'Connor\n*Edmond MacDermott Roe\n*Edward Corcoran\n*Edward Dodwell\n*Eleanor Plunkett\n*The Elevation\n*Elizabeth MacDermott Roe\n*Elizabeth Nugent\n*The Fairy Queen\n*Fanny Dillon\n*Fanny Power\n*Father Brian MacDermott Roe\n*Frank Palmer\n*General Wynne\n*George Brabazon, 1st Air\n*(\"Planxty\") George Brabazon, 2nd Air\n*George Reynolds\n*Gerald Dillon\n*Grace Nugent\n*Henry MacDermott Roe, 1st Air\n*Henry MacDermott Roe, 2nd Air\n*Henry MacDermott Roe, 3rd Air\n*The Honourable Thomas Burke\n*Hugh Kelly\n*Hugh O'Donnell\n*Isabella Burke\n*James Betagh\n*James Crofton\n*James Daly\n*James Plunkett\n*John Drury, 1st Air\n*John Drury, 2nd Air\n*John Jameson\n*John Jones\n*John Kelly\n*John MacDermott\n*John Moore\n*John Nugent\n*John O'Connor\n*John O'Reilly, 1st Air\n*John O'Reilly, 2nd Air\n*John Peyton\n*Katherine O'More (The Hawk of the Erne)\n*Kean O'Hara, 1st Air (O'Hara's Cup)\n*Kean O'Hara, 2nd Air\n*Kean O'Hara, 3rd Air\n*Kitty Magennis\n*Lady Athenry\n*Lady Blaney\n*Lady Dillon\n*Lady Gethin\n*Lady Laetitia Burke\n*Lady St. John\n*Lady Wrixon\n*Lament for Charles MacCabe\n*Lament for Owen O'Rourke\n*[[Lament for Owen Roe O'Neill]]\n*Lament for Sir Ulick Burke\n*Lament for Terence MacDonough\n*The Landlady\n*Loftus Jones\n*Lord Dillon\n*Lord Galway's Lamentation\n*Lord Inchiquin\n*Lord Louth\n*Lord Massereene\n*Lord Mayo\n*Luke Dillon\n*Mabel Kelly\n*Major Shanly\n*Margaret Malone\n*Mary O'Neill\n*Maurice O'Connor, 1st Air\n*Maurice O'Connor, 2nd Air\n*Maurice O'Connor, 3rd Air\n*Mervyn Pratt\n*Michael O'Connor, 1st Air\n*Michael O'Connor, 2nd Air\n*Miss Crofton\n*Miss Fetherston (Carolan's Devotion)\n*Miss Goulding\n*[[The Saucy Arethusa|Miss MacDermott]] ([[Prince of Coolavin#The Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]])\n*Miss MacMurray\n*Miss Murphy\n*Miss Noble\n*Morgan Magan\n*Mr. Malone\n*Mr. O'Connor\n*Mr. Waller\n*Mrs. Anne MacDermott Roe\n*Mrs. Bermingham, 1st Air\n*Mrs. Bermingham, 2nd Air\n*Mrs. Cole\n*Mrs. Costello\n*Mrs. Crofton\n*Mrs. Delany\n*Mrs. Edwards\n*Mrs. Fallon\n*Mrs. Farrell\n*Mrs. Garvey, 1st Air\n*Mrs. Garvey, 2nd Air\n*Mrs. Harwood\n*Mrs. Judge\n*Mrs. Keel\n*Mrs. MacDermott Roe\n*Mrs. Maxwell, 1st Air\n*Mrs. Maxwell, 2nd Air\n*Mrs. Nugent\n*Mrs. O'Connor\n*Mrs. O'Conor\n*Mrs. O'Neill of Carlane\n*Mrs. O'Neill (Carolan's Favourite)\n*Mrs. O'Rourke\n*Mrs. Power (Carolan's Concerto)\n*Mrs. Sterling\n*Mrs. Waller\n*Nancy Cooper, 1st Air\n*Nancy Cooper, 2nd Air\n*O'Flinn\n*O'Reilly of Athcarne\n*The O'Rourkes' Feast\n*Ode to Whiskey\n*One Bottle More\n*Owen O'Rourke\n*Patrick Kelly\n*Peggy Morton\n*Planxty Browne, (no. 180)\n*Planxty Burke\n*Planxty Crilly\n*Planxty Drew\n*Planxty Hewlett\n*Planxty John Irwin\n*Planxty Kelly\n*Planxty O'Rourke, 1st Air\n*Planxty O'Rourke, 2nd Air\n*Planxty Plunkett\n*Planxty Sweeney\n*Planxty Wilkinson\n*Richard Cusack\n*Robert Hawkes\n*Robert Jordan\n*The Seas are Deep\n*Separation of Soul and Body\n*[[S\u00ed Bheag, S\u00ed Mh\u00f3r|Sheebeg and Sheemore]]\n*Sir Arthur Shaen\n*Sir Charles Coote\n*Sir Edward Crofton\n*Sir Festus Burke\n*Sir Ulick Burke\n*Squire Parsons\n*[[William Wood (Mintmaster)|Squire Wood]]'s Lamentation on the Refusal of his Halfpence\n*Susanna Kelly\n*Thomas Burke\n*Thomas Judge (Carolan's Frolic)\n*Tobias Peyton\n*The Two William Davises\n*(unnamed) - 8 pieces, (nos. 172-179)\n*Variations on the Scottish Air<BR>\"[[Cock Up Your Beaver]]\"\n*Variations on the Scottish Air<BR>\"When She Cam Ben\"\n*William Eccles\n*William Ward\n{{div col end}}\n\nMany of these pieces have alternative titles, as fully documented by Donal O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan's preferred titles are the ones generally accepted as standard, though quite a few of these titles were devised by O'Sullivan himself after exhaustive research into the identities of the patrons for whom each song was written.\n\nAdditionally, a manuscript compiled in Scotland in 1816 by the MacLean-Clephane sisters was discovered in 1983 and includes at least five other pieces credited to Carolan and other annotated pieces that were \"improved by Carolan\" or \"consistent with Carolan's writing to warrant consideration\". These airs are included in the Appendix of the 2001 edition of ''Carolan: The Life Times and Music of an Irish Harper'' along with detailed research notes. These pieces came to light a decade after the death of Donal O'Sullivan in 1973, so he never had an opportunity to subject them to the same analysis that he used on the original 214 airs that he originally compiled in 1958. However, to date, no one has disputed the attributions presented in this manuscript. Newly composed harp arrangements for each of these and all the other airs (as well as new Carolan repertoire numbers 215 to 226 for each of the MacLean-Clephane tunes) are included in ''The Complete Carolan Songs & Airs'' by Caitr\u00edona Rowsome.<ref>Rowsome, Caitr\u00edona (as above), pp. 238-251.</ref> The five pieces that are said to be composed by Carolan rather than simply \"improved\" are:\n*\"Athlone\" (215)\n*\"Banks of the Shannon\" (216)\n*\"Farewell to Lough Neaghe\" (219)\n*\"Irish Galloway Tom\" (220)\n*\"The Lamentation of Ireland\" (221)\n\n==Other==\n\n\n*O'Carolan Road in the Tenters area of [[The Liberties|Dublin 8]] is named in his honour.\n*Carolan Road and \"Carolan Corner\" shop are named in his honour in the [[Ballynafeigh]] area of south [[Belfast]].\n*The [[meteorite]] [[Impact_crater|crater]] Carolan on [[Mercury_(planet)|Mercury]] was named in his honour in 2015.<ref>Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, IAU, [https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/15321 Map of crater Carolan]</ref>\n*Polish bands: [[2 plus 1]] in 1979 and [[Myslovitz]] in 1996 recorded songs entitled \"Peggy Brown\", said to be a translation of an obscure O'Carolan lyric by Polish lyricist Ernest Bryll, with different tunes and arrangements: folk and alternative rock, respectively.

Harpers in the old Irish tradition were still living as late as 1792, and ten, including [[Arthur O'Neill (harpist)|Arthur O'Neill]], [[Patrick Quin]] and [[Donnchadh \u00d3 H\u00e1msaigh]], attended the [[Belfast Harp Festival]]. \u00d3 H\u00e1msaigh did play some of Carolan's music but disliked it for being too modern. Some of Carolan's own compositions show influences of the style of continental classical music, whereas others such as Carolan's ''Farewell to Music'' reflect a much older style of \"Gaelic Harping\".\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Turlough Carolan memorial - Dublin, Ireland.jpg|thumb|left|Carolan's memorial in [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]] was the gift of [[Sydney, Lady Morgan]].]]\n\nCarolan was born in 1670 in [[Nobber]], [[County Meath]], where his father was a blacksmith. The family moved from Meath to [[Ballyfarnon]], [[County Roscommon]] in 1684. In Roscommon, his father took a job with the [[MacDermotRoe|MacDermott Roe]] family of Alderford House. Mrs. MacDermott Roe gave Turlough an education, and he showed talent in poetry. After being blinded by [[smallpox]] at the age of eighteen, Carolan was apprenticed by Mrs. MacDermott Roe to a good harper. At the age of twenty-one, being given a horse and a guide, he set out to travel Ireland and compose songs for patrons.<ref>White, Harry: \"Carolan, Turlough (\u00d3 Cearbhall\u00e1in, Toirdhealbhach)\", in: ''[[Dictionary of Irish Biography]]'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009).</ref>\n\nFor almost fifty years, Carolan journeyed from one end of Ireland to the other, composing and performing his tunes. One of his earliest compositions was about Brigid Cruise, with whom he was infatuated. Brigid was the teenage daughter of the schoolmaster at the school for the blind attended by Carolan in Cruisetown, Ireland.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hardiman|first=James|title=Irish Minstrelsy, or, Bardic Remains of Ireland: with English poetical translations|url=https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00currgoog|year=1831|publisher=J. Robins|location=London|page=xlix}}</ref> In 1720, Carolan married Mary Maguire. He was then 50 years of age. Their first family home was a cottage on a parcel of land near the town of Manachain (now [[Mohill]]) in County Leitrim, where they settled. They had seven children, six daughters and one son. In 1733 Mary died.\n\nTurlough O'Carolan died on 25 March 1738. He is buried in the MacDermott Roe family crypt in Kilronan Burial Ground near [[Ballyfarnon]], County Roscommon. The annual O'Carolan Harp Festival and Summer School commemorates his life and work in [[Keadue]], County Roscommon.\n\nA bronze monument by sculptor [[Oisin Kelly]] depicting Turlough O'Carolan playing his harp was erected on a plinth at the Market Square, Mohill, on 10 August 1986, and was unveiled by [[Patrick Hillery]], [[President of Ireland]].\n\nA statue was erected to him at his place of birth (Nobber, Co Meath) in 2002, during the Annual O'Carolan Harp Festival, the first of which was held in Nobber in 1988.\n\n==Music and style==\nCarolan composed both songs and instrumental harp music, reflecting various styles of composition. About a third of Carolan's surviving music have associated Irish lyrics that survive to this day. Largely these lyrics are unknown to the musicians of today, who have for the most part adapted Carolan's repertoire to the currently popular Irish fare of jigs and reels.\n\nCarolan's activities during his career are only partially documented historically. This has led to a lack of accurate information about Carolan and his music, even among Irish musicians. Sometimes, alternate titles or incorrect titles have been applied to songs, creating confusion as to whether the song is Carolan's or someone else's. Also, some of those who have written about Carolan and his music have made up facts or repeated unfounded stories. For instance, Edward Bunting, who began the work of collecting Carolan's pieces, referred to a \"very ancient air\" the Fairy Queen, saying it \"seems to have been the original of Carolan's ''Fairy Queen''.\" He also reported that \"the ''Fairy Queen'' of Carolan was not intended by him for words, but as a piece of music for the harp.\" While it is true that Carolan did not write the traditional ''Fairy Queen'' words, which indeed do exist, the words are not ancient (nor is the entirely different traditional Irish air ''The Fairy Queen'')<ref>{{cite book |author=O'Sullivan, Donal |year=1958 |title=Carolan: The life, times, and music of an Irish harper |location=London, UK |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |at=vol.&nbsp;2, p.&nbsp;116}}</ref>, and the words do in fact fit perfectly the original music which Carolan composed for them<ref>As heard on Track&nbsp;8 of ''Le Concert de l'Hostel Dieu'', by Garlic Bread, 2013</ref>.\n\nIrish was the majority language in Ireland during Carolan's time. As Carolan did not speak English very well, he composed only one song in English, \"Carolan's Devotion\". Most of his songs were dedicated to and written about specific individual patrons. Many of his tunes are widely performed and appreciated today, and a handful of his Irish songs have been recorded by various artists. He typically composed the tune first, as he rode from place to place, then added words later. Many of his songs are designated as \"''[[wiktionary:planxty|planxties]]''\", [[wiktionary:planxty|an obscure word]] that Carolan apparently invented or popularized to signify a tribute to a merry host. In return for writing songs in honour of wealthy patrons, Carolan was often welcomed as an honoured guest to stay on their estates.<ref>{{cite book |author=O'Sullivan, Donal |year=1958 |title=Carolan: The life, times, and music of an Irish harper |location=London, UK |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul}} in 2&nbsp;volumes; new edition in 1&nbsp;volume: {{cite book |author=O'Sullivan, Donal |year=2001 |title=Carolan: The life, times, and music of an Irish harper |location=Cork, EI |publisher=Ossian Publications |ISBN=1-900428-76-8 |edition=hardback}}; paperback 2001 edition {{ISBN|1-900428-71-7}}.</ref> It is said that weddings and funerals were sometimes delayed until he could arrive to perform.\n\n==Publication==\nMost of Carolan's compositions were not published or even written down in his lifetime.

O'Sullivan does not include any of the handful of alleged Carolan songs that he considers to be erroneous, such as: \"Dermott O'Doud\", \"Planxty Miss Burke\", and \"The Snowy-Breasted Pearl\".<ref>Bunting, Edward: ''A General Collection of the Ancient Irish Music'' (Dublin: W. Power & Co., 1796), p. 17.</ref>\n\nA comprehensive edition of Carolan's Songs & Airs containing new arrangements for harp of all 214 airs, along with an additional 12 airs from the Appendix of the 2001 edition<ref>O'Sullivan, Donal: ''Carolan'' (as above), p. 334 ff.</ref> was published by Caitr\u00edona Rowsome in 2011.<ref name=\":0\">Rowsome, Caitr\u00edona: ''The Complete Carolan Songs & Airs'' (Dublin: Waltons Publishing, 2011), {{ISBN|9781857202182}}.</ref> This book includes an instance of each of Carolan's undisputed surviving lyrics and metrically sets the lyrics note-for-note to the sheet music airs. Each of the 226 harp settings in this book are played by the author on a neo-Irish harp (book and 4-CD set). This is the first time that all of Carolan's lyrics have been set to the airs and has been welcomed as \"a task that has needed doing for many years\".<ref>''An P\u00edobaire'' 9 (2013) 1 (Feabhra / February).</ref> The 4-CD recording is of harp music without vocals, but the book includes the sheet music for interested singers. The book also includes an English interpretation for each of Carolan's 72 Irish song lyrics. Five of these interpretations take the form of new English lyrics set metrically to the sheet music of 'Hewlett', 'Colonel John Irwin', 'John O'Connor', 'Kean O'Hara (3rd Air)' and 'Sheebeg and Sheemore'.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Performances==\nSince 1967, when Se\u00e1n O\u2019Riada and the Ceolt\u00f3ir\u00ed Chualann released ''Carolan\u2019s Concerto'' and 2 other Carolan compositions,<ref>O\u2019Riada, Se\u00e1n ''Ceol Na nUasal'' (Gael Linn records, Ireland, 1967)</ref> there have been hundreds of recordings of Carolan songs released by dozens of artists. Many of these recordings are by such well-known performers as [[The Chieftains]], [[Planxty]], Patrick Ball, and Joemy Wilson, others by less well known artists. Occasionally, an artist who is popular in another area will record a single Carolan song for variety, such as Steeleye Span's ''Sheebeg and Sheemore'', [[John Renbourn]]'s ''[[Lament for Owen Roe O'Neill]]'', [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]'s ''Morgan Mawgan'' [sic], Stefan Grossman's ''Blind Mary'', John Williams' ''Mrs. Maxwell'', and many others. Several popular collections by multiple artists have also been issued, including ''The Music of O\u2019Carolan'' (1993), ''Deluxe Anthology of Carolan'' (1995), ''Celtic Treasure'' (1996), and ''Celtic Treasure II'' (2001). The sheer quantity of these recordings has greatly expanded the number of Carolan pieces known to the public, but the performers do tend to come back to certain songs again and again. Among the most frequently recorded pieces are the following:\n\n''Carolan\u2019s Concerto'' (at least 35), ''Blind Mary'' (at least 23), ''[[S\u00ed Bheag, S\u00ed Mh\u00f3r|Sheebeg and Sheemore]]'' (at least 22), ''Planxty George Brabazon'' (at least 21), ''Planxty Col. Irwin'' (at least 19), ''Fanny Power'' (at least 19), ''Eleanor Plunkett'' (at least 18), ''Carolan\u2019s Farewell to Music'' (at least 18), ''Carolan\u2019s Draught'' (at least 17), ''Hewlett'' (at least 16), ''The Princess Royal'' (at least 16), and ''Stafford's Receipt'' (at least 16). In addition, innumerable musicians have performed many of Carolan's tunes learned from such books as ''The Fiddler's Fakebook'',<ref>Brody, David ''[[The Fiddler's Fakebook]]'' (New York: Oak Publications, 1983).</ref> which contains some of the above tunes plus ''Morgan Magan'' and ''Planxty Drury''. Also, ''O'Neill\u2019s Music of Ireland'' (1903)<ref>http://trillian.mit.edu/~jc/music/book/oneills/</ref> is still in print and contains over 60 of Carolan's tunes, of which far too many to list have made their way into the repertoire of musicians around the world.\n\nIn addition, ''Carolan's Concerto'' has been used as a neutral slow march by the [[Foot Guards]] of the [[British Army]] during the ceremony of [[Trooping the Colour]]. Also, some of Carolan's compositions have appeared in the role-playing game ''[[Fate (video game)|FATE]]''.\n\nCarolan's music has frequently been adapted for fingerstyle guitar (primarily steel string acoustic), often by altering the tuning from standard (EADGBE) to DADGBE (drop D), DADGAD, and CGDGAD, among others. This allows strings to ring out and results in a more harp-like sound. Duck Baker has recorded many Carolan songs in drop D tuning. El McMeen performs almost exclusively in CGDGAD, and has recorded many Carolan songs.\n\n==Compositions==\nThe complete list of the 214 Carolan compositions identified by Donal O'Sullivan (see References) are, in alphabetical order, as follows:\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*All Alive\n*Baptist Johnston\n*Betty MacNeill\n*Betty O'Brien\n*Blind Mary\n*Brian Maguire\n*Bridget Cruise, 1st Air\n*Bridget Cruise, 2nd Air\n*Bridget Cruise, 3rd Air\n*Bridget Cruise, 4th Air\n*Bumper Squire Jones\n*Captain Higgins\n*Captain Magan\n*Captain O'Kane\n*Captain O'Neill, (no. 214)\n*Captain Sudley (Carolan's Dowry)\n*Carolan's Cap\n*Carolan's Cottage\n*Carolan's Cup\n*Carolan's Draught\n*Carolan's Dream\n*Carolan's Farewell to Music\n*Carolan's Frolic\n*Carolan's Maggot\n*Carolan's Quarrel with the Landlady\n*Carolan's Ramble to Cashel\n*[[Carolan's Welcome]], (no. 171)\n*Catherine Martin\n*Catherine O'More\n*Charles O'Conor\n*The Clergy's Lamentation\n*Colonel Irwin\n*Colonel Manus O'Donnell\n*Colonel O'Hara\n*Conor O'Reilly\n*Constantine Maguire\n*Counsellor Dillon\n*Cremonea\n*Daniel Kelly\n*The Dark, Plaintive Youth\n*David Power\n*Denis O'Conor, 1st Air\n*Denis O'Conor, 2nd Air\n*Dolly MacDonough (The Morning Star)\n*Donal O'Brien\n*Dr. John Hart\n*Dr. John Stafford (Stafford's Receipt)\n*Dr. MacMahon, Bishop of Clogher\n*Dr. Delany\n*Dr. John Hart, Bishop of Achonry\n*Dr. O'Connor\n*Edmond MacDermott Roe\n*Edward Corcoran\n*Edward Dodwell\n*Eleanor Plunkett\n*The Elevation\n*Elizabeth MacDermott Roe\n*Elizabeth Nugent\n*The Fairy Queen\n*Fanny Dillon\n*Fanny Power\n*Father Brian MacDermott Roe\n*Frank Palmer\n*General Wynne\n*George Brabazon, 1st Air\n*(\"Planxty\") George Brabazon, 2nd Air\n*George Reynolds\n*Gerald Dillon\n*Grace Nugent\n*Henry MacDermott Roe, 1st Air\n*Henry MacDermott Roe, 2nd Air\n*Henry MacDermott Roe, 3rd Air\n*The Honourable Thomas Burke\n*Hugh Kelly\n*Hugh O'Donnell\n*Isabella Burke\n*James Betagh\n*James Crofton\n*James Daly\n*James Plunkett\n*John Drury, 1st Air\n*John Drury, 2nd Air\n*John Jameson\n*John Jones\n*John Kelly\n*John MacDermott\n*John Moore\n*John Nugent\n*John O'Connor\n*John O'Reilly, 1st Air\n*John O'Reilly, 2nd Air\n*John Peyton\n*Katherine O'More (The Hawk of the Erne)\n*Kean O'Hara, 1st Air (O'Hara's Cup)\n*Kean O'Hara, 2nd Air\n*Kean O'Hara, 3rd Air\n*Kitty Magennis\n*Lady Athenry\n*Lady Blaney\n*Lady Dillon\n*Lady Gethin\n*Lady Laetitia Burke\n*Lady St. John\n*Lady Wrixon\n*Lament for Charles MacCabe\n*Lament for Owen O'Rourke\n*[[Lament for Owen Roe O'Neill]]\n*Lament for Sir Ulick Burke\n*Lament for Terence MacDonough\n*The Landlady\n*Loftus Jones\n*Lord Dillon\n*Lord Galway's Lamentation\n*Lord Inchiquin\n*Lord Louth\n*Lord Massereene\n*Lord Mayo\n*Luke Dillon\n*Mabel Kelly\n*Major Shanly\n*Margaret Malone\n*Mary O'Neill\n*Maurice O'Connor, 1st Air\n*Maurice O'Connor, 2nd Air\n*Maurice O'Connor, 3rd Air\n*Mervyn Pratt\n*Michael O'Connor, 1st Air\n*Michael O'Connor, 2nd Air\n*Miss Crofton\n*Miss Fetherston (Carolan's Devotion)\n*Miss Goulding\n*[[The Saucy Arethusa|Miss MacDermott]] ([[Prince of Coolavin#The Princess Royal|The Princess Royal]])\n*Miss MacMurray\n*Miss Murphy\n*Miss Noble\n*Morgan Magan\n*Mr. Malone\n*Mr. O'Connor\n*Mr. Waller\n*Mrs. Anne MacDermott Roe\n*Mrs. Bermingham, 1st Air\n*Mrs. Bermingham, 2nd Air\n*Mrs. Cole\n*Mrs. Costello\n*Mrs. Crofton\n*Mrs. Delany\n*Mrs. Edwards\n*Mrs. Fallon\n*Mrs. Farrell\n*Mrs. Garvey, 1st Air\n*Mrs. Garvey, 2nd Air\n*Mrs. Harwood\n*Mrs. Judge\n*Mrs. Keel\n*Mrs. MacDermott Roe\n*Mrs. Maxwell, 1st Air\n*Mrs. Maxwell, 2nd Air\n*Mrs. Nugent\n*Mrs. O'Connor\n*Mrs. O'Conor\n*Mrs. O'Neill of Carlane\n*Mrs. O'Neill (Carolan's Favourite)\n*Mrs. O'Rourke\n*Mrs. Power (Carolan's Concerto)\n*Mrs. Sterling\n*Mrs. Waller\n*Nancy Cooper, 1st Air\n*Nancy Cooper, 2nd Air\n*O'Flinn\n*O'Reilly of Athcarne\n*The O'Rourkes' Feast\n*Ode to Whiskey\n*One Bottle More\n*Owen O'Rourke\n*Patrick Kelly\n*Peggy Morton\n*Planxty Browne, (no. 180)\n*Planxty Burke\n*Planxty Crilly\n*Planxty Drew\n*Planxty Hewlett\n*Planxty John Irwin\n*Planxty Kelly\n*Planxty O'Rourke, 1st Air\n*Planxty O'Rourke, 2nd Air\n*Planxty Plunkett\n*Planxty Sweeney\n*Planxty Wilkinson\n*Richard Cusack\n*Robert Hawkes\n*Robert Jordan\n*The Seas are Deep\n*Separation of Soul and Body\n*[[S\u00ed Bheag, S\u00ed Mh\u00f3r|Sheebeg and Sheemore]]\n*Sir Arthur Shaen\n*Sir Charles Coote\n*Sir Edward Crofton\n*Sir Festus Burke\n*Sir Ulick Burke\n*Squire Parsons\n*[[William Wood (Mintmaster)|Squire Wood]]'s Lamentation on the Refusal of his Halfpence\n*Susanna Kelly\n*Thomas Burke\n*Thomas Judge (Carolan's Frolic)\n*Tobias Peyton\n*The Two William Davises\n*(unnamed) - 8 pieces, (nos. 172-179)\n*Variations on the Scottish Air<BR>\"[[Cock Up Your Beaver]]\"\n*Variations on the Scottish Air<BR>\"When She Cam Ben\"\n*William Eccles\n*William Ward\n{{div col end}}\n\nMany of these pieces have alternative titles, as fully documented by Donal O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan's preferred titles are the ones generally accepted as standard, though quite a few of these titles were devised by O'Sullivan himself after exhaustive research into the identities of the patrons for whom each song was written.\n\nAdditionally, a manuscript compiled in Scotland in 1816 by the MacLean-Clephane sisters was discovered in 1983 and includes at least five other pieces credited to Carolan and other annotated pieces that were \"improved by Carolan\" or \"consistent with Carolan's writing to warrant consideration\". These airs are included in the Appendix of the 2001 edition of ''Carolan: The Life Times and Music of an Irish Harper'' along with detailed research notes. These pieces came to light a decade after the death of Donal O'Sullivan in 1973, so he never had an opportunity to subject them to the same analysis that he used on the original 214 airs that he originally compiled in 1958. However, to date, no one has disputed the attributions presented in this manuscript. Newly composed harp arrangements for each of these and all the other airs (as well as new Carolan repertoire numbers 215 to 226 for each of the MacLean-Clephane tunes) are included in ''The Complete Carolan Songs & Airs'' by Caitr\u00edona Rowsome.<ref>Rowsome, Caitr\u00edona (as above), pp. 238-251.</ref> The five pieces that are said to be composed by Carolan rather than simply \"improved\" are:\n*\"Athlone\" (215)\n*\"Banks of the Shannon\" (216)\n*\"Farewell to Lough Neaghe\" (219)\n*\"Irish Galloway Tom\" (220)\n*\"The Lamentation of Ireland\" (221)\n\n==Other==\n\n\n*O'Carolan Road in the Tenters area of [[The Liberties|Dublin 8]] is named in his honour.\n*Carolan Road and \"Carolan Corner\" shop are named in his honour in the [[Ballynafeigh]] area of south [[Belfast]].\n*The [[meteorite]] [[Impact_crater|crater]] Carolan on [[Mercury_(planet)|Mercury]] was named in his honour in 2015.<ref>Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature, IAU, [https://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/15321 Map of crater Carolan]</ref>\n*Polish bands: [[2 plus 1]] in 1979 and [[Myslovitz]] in 1996 recorded songs entitled \"Peggy Brown\", said to be a translation of an obscure O'Carolan lyric by Polish lyricist Ernest Bryll, with different tunes and arrangements: folk and alternative rock, respectively. Neither of these tunes use an O'Carolan composition. Both songs were very popular in Poland.\n*O'Carolan is depicted on the \u00a350 note, [[Series B Banknotes (Ireland)|Series B Banknote]] of Ireland.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of people on the postage stamps of Ireland]]\n*[[Music of Ireland]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Donal O'Sullivan: ''Carolan: The Life Times and Music of an Irish Harper'', 2 volumes (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1958); new edition in 1 volume: Cork: Ossian Publications, 2001; {{ISBN|1-900428-76-8}} (hardback), 1-900428-71-7 (paperback).\n*Donal O'Sullivan: ''Songs of the Irish'' (Dublin: Brown & Nolan, 1960).\n*The Complete Works of O'Carolan: Irish Harper & Composer (1670-1738), published by Ossian Publications, Ireland, 1984, {{ISBN|0 946005 16 8}}.\n*Art Edelstein: \"Fair Melodies: Turlough Carolan, An Irish Harper\" (East Calais, Vermont: Noble Stone Press, 2001), {{ISBN|978-0971169302}}.\n*The first commercial recording of Carolan's complete works was ''The Complete Works of Turlough O\u2019Carolan (1670-1738)'' [2006, 8-cd set, Trigon, 214 tracks] arranged and performed by Irish pianist [[J.J.

This project was promoted by [[Argentina|Argentinian]] company [[Bridas Corporation]]. The U.S. company [[Unocal]], in conjunction with the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] oil company Delta, promoted an alternative project without Bridas' involvement. On 21 October 1995, these two companies signed a separate agreement with Turkmenistan's president [[Saparmurat Niyazov]]. In August 1996, the [[CentGas|Central Asia Gas Pipeline, Ltd. (CentGas)]] [[consortium]] for construction of a pipeline, led by Unocal, was formed. On 27 October 1997, CentGas was incorporated in formal signing ceremonies in [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, by several international oil companies along with the [[Government of Turkmenistan]].<ref name=eiu>{{cite book | title = Country Report: Turkmenistan | publisher = [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] | year = 1998 | page = 24}}</ref>\n\nSince the pipeline was to pass through Afghanistan, it was necessary to work with the Taliban. The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, [[Robert B. Oakley|Robert Oakley]], moved into CentGas in 1997. In January 1998, the [[Taliban]], selecting CentGas over Argentinian competitor [[Bridas Corporation]], signed an agreement that allowed the proposed project to proceed. In June 1998, Russian [[Gazprom]] relinquished its 10% stake in the project. On 7 August 1998, [[1998 United States embassy bombings|American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed]]. The United States alleged that [[Osama bin Laden]] was behind those attacks, and all pipeline negotiations halted, as the Taliban's then leader, [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], announced that bin Laden had the Taliban's support.

This project was promoted by [[Argentina|Argentinian]] company [[Bridas Corporation]]. The U.S. company [[Unocal]], in conjunction with the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] oil company Delta, promoted an alternative project without Bridas' involvement. On 21 October 1995, these two companies signed a separate agreement with Turkmenistan's president [[Saparmurat Niyazov]]. In August 1996, the [[CentGas|Central Asia Gas Pipeline, Ltd. (CentGas)]] [[consortium]] for construction of a pipeline, led by Unocal, was formed. On 27 October 1997, CentGas was incorporated in formal signing ceremonies in [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, by several international oil companies along with the [[Government of Turkmenistan]].<ref name=eiu>{{cite book | title = Country Report: Turkmenistan | publisher = [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] | year = 1998 | page = 24}}</ref>\n\nSince the pipeline was to pass through Afghanistan, it was necessary to work with the Taliban. The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, [[Robert B. Oakley|Robert Oakley]], moved into CentGas in 1997. In January 1998, the [[Taliban]], selecting CentGas over Argentinian competitor [[Bridas Corporation]], signed an agreement that allowed the proposed project to proceed. In June 1998, Russian [[Gazprom]] relinquished its 10% stake in the project. On 7 August 1998, [[1998 United States embassy bombings|American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed]]. The United States alleged that [[Osama bin Laden]] was behind those attacks, and all pipeline negotiations halted, as the Taliban's then leader, [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]], announced that bin Laden had the Taliban's support.

Originating at over {{convert|8000|ft|m}} above sea level in [[Yosemite National Park]], the Tuolumne drains a rugged watershed of {{convert|1958|mi2|km2}}, carving a series of canyons through the western slope of the Sierra. While the upper Tuolumne is a fast-flowing mountain stream, the lower river crosses a broad, fertile and extensively cultivated [[alluvial plain]]. Like most other central California rivers, the Tuolumne is dammed multiple times for irrigation and the generation of [[hydroelectricity]].\n\nHumans have inhabited the Tuolumne River area for up to 10,000 years. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the river canyon provided an important summer hunting ground and a trade route between [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native Americans]] in the Central Valley to the west and the [[Great Basin]] to the east. First named in 1806 by a Spanish explorer after a nearby indigenous village, the Tuolumne was heavily prospected during the [[California Gold Rush]] in the 1850s, and the lower valley was cultivated by American settlers over the next few decades. The city of [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] grew up on the Tuolumne as a railroad hub, absorbing most of the population of the Tuolumne valley around the turn of the century. As agricultural production rose, farmers along the Tuolumne formed California's first two [[irrigation district]]s to better control and develop the river.\n\nFrom the 1900s to the 1930s, the river was dammed at [[Don Pedro Dam|Don Pedro]] and [[Hetch Hetchy]] to provide water for Central Valley farmers and the city of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], respectively. The Hetch Hetchy project, located inside Yosemite National Park, incited national controversy, and has been described as having forged the modern [[environmental movement]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/a_century_later_the_battle_for_hetch_hetchy_continues/|title=A Century Later, the Battle for Hetch Hetchy Continues|publisher=Earth Island Institute|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> As the mid-20th century progressed, demands on the Tuolumne continued to increase, culminating in the completion of [[New Don Pedro Dam]] in the early 1970s. These projects halved the amount of water flowing from the Tuolumne into the San Joaquin, greatly reducing the once-abundant runs of salmon and steelhead in both rivers.\n\n==Course==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=180\n|image1=California Falls, Tuolumne River, California (1921).jpg\n|image2=Waterwheel Falls in Yosemite.jpg\n|caption2=Top: California Falls.

From the headwaters to below Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the river drains the Sierra highlands, which are characterized by solid, [[glacier]]-carved granitic bedrock, thin poor soils and areas of heavy forestation. Most of the snowpack that feeds the Tuolumne accumulates in this region.{{sfn|Epke|Finger|Lusardi|Marks|2010|p=7}} Streams are generally high-gradient, clear and rocky, but large [[alpine meadow]]s provide riparian and wetland habitat, which contribute sediment to the watershed's runoff. There are also a large number of natural lakes and tarns in the upper watershed. The Sierra crest harbors a number of glaciers, including Lyell and Maclure Glaciers, the largest in Yosemite National Park. Melting ice feeds the upper reaches of the Tuolumne River, maintaining water flow in the late summer when many other streams in the region are dry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/Lyell-Glacier.htm|title=Lyell Glacier|publisher=National Park Service|work=Yosemite National Park|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> The Lyell Glacier is the second largest in the Sierra Nevada, after [[Palisade Glacier]] at the headwaters of [[Big Pine Creek (California)|Big Pine Creek]] a tributary of the [[Owens River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5195705.pdf|title=Wilderness Hiking, Big Pine Canyon, Inyo National Forest|publisher=USFS|accessdate=2015-10-11}}</ref> Both Lyell and Maclure glaciers have shrunk significantly since the late 1800s when measurements were first made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/yose/parknews/lyellglacier.htm|title=Yosemite National Park's Largest Glacier Stagnant|work=Yosemite National Park|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nBetween Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and the upper end of Lake Don Pedro the Tuolumne flows through the Sierra foothills, where it has a lower gradient but continues to maintain a fast current. Stream pools and gravel bars figure more prominently in the channel, allowing the growth of riparian habitat. By the time the river reaches Lake Don Pedro it has accumulated almost 90 percent of its total flow as precipitation run-off, [[snowmelt]] and [[groundwater]] [[Baseflow|base flow]].{{sfn|Epke|Finger|Lusardi|Marks|2010|pp=4-10}} Below Don Pedro Dam the river flows across the large [[alluvial plain]] of the San Joaquin Valley, formed by millions of years of sediment deposits eroded from the Sierra. Historically this section of the river was subject to frequent course changes and formed thousands of acres of seasonal wetlands during the spring floods.

The Hetch Hetchy hydroelectric system diverts large volumes of water into tunnels that feed two hydroelectric plants, the Kirkwood and the Moccasin. The power system is efficient because of the Tuolumne's great drop, over {{convert|2750|ft|m}}, between Hetch Hetchy and the outlet of Moccasin Powerhouse. However, it also causes dewatering of significant portions of the Tuolumne River, especially during low water summers when all but a minimal fish release is diverted through the power plants.

A major tributary, Eleanor Creek, is dammed to form [[Lake Eleanor]], and diverted into Cherry Lake through a tunnel. The combined flow is channeled into a penstock and returns to the river at the Holm Powerhouse. Unlike the Hetch Hetchy system, the Cherry Creek system is used exclusively for hydropower, not water supply, because the water quality is not quite as good. However, there is a connecting aqueduct that allows Cherry Lake to be tapped to supply the Hetch Hetchy system during severe droughts. This backup water supply was last used during late 2015, as a test to ensure its functionality should drought conditions become worse.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-water-to-be-mixed-with-filtered-water-as-city-tests-drought-preparedness/|title=SF water to be mixed with filtered water as city tests drought preparedness|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|first=Michael|last=Barba|date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> The previous time it was used was 1988.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/California-drought-2-reservoirs-near-Hetch-5321213.php|title=California drought: 2 reservoirs near Hetch Hetchy tapped|publisher=SFGate|first=Marisa|last=Lagos|date=March 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Tuolumne River Modesto.jpg|thumb|right|Tuolumne River in Modesto]]\nBelow the confluence with the North Fork of the Tuolumne the river flows into Lake Don Pedro, the largest in the Tuolumne River system and the sixth-largest man made lake in California at {{convert|2030000|acre feet|m3}}. The earth-filled New Don Pedro Dam, {{convert|585|ft|m}} high, is the 10th tallest dam in the United States and was constructed as a multipurpose project, serving irrigation, municipal water supply, hydropower and flood control. It replaced an earlier concrete dam built on approximately the same site. The Turlock and Modesto Irrigation Districts control the lion's share of water in the reservoir, although the City of San Francisco also has storage rights, which it uses mainly to offset the effects of water diverted upstream at Hetch Hetchy. Because of the desire to increase water storage for other uses, only {{convert|340000|acre feet|m3}} of the reservoir is designated flood control, which is relatively small compared to other reservoirs in California. As a result, Don Pedro frequently fills and spills during winter storms, causing damage downstream.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe La Grange Dam, a much smaller masonry diversion dam, is the last one on the Tuolumne before it joins with the San Joaquin. Modesto Canal, on the north side of the river, and Turlock Canal, on the south side, are both large irrigation diversions. The Modesto Canal feeds the {{convert|29000|acre feet|m3|adj=on}} off-stream Modesto Reservoir, which regulates the water for distribution to farmers. The Turlock Lake is regulated by the similar but much larger Turlock Lake, which has a capacity of {{convert|49000|acre feet|m3|adj=on}}. The estimated annual diversion for irrigation is {{convert|867000|acre feet|m3}}, about half of the Tuolumne River's natural flow.<ref name=\"tldownstream\"/>\n\nBelow La Grange, the Tuolumne \u2013 much reduced due to irrigation diversions \u2013 flows through a fixed channel with a highly restricted [[floodplain]]. Before agriculture, the river inundated large areas of seasonal marshland and was free to change course during its frequent floods. Today farms and communities are protected by a [[levee]] system with a channel capacity of roughly {{convert|9000|cuft/s|m3/s}} at the 9th St. Bridge in Modesto \u2013 significantly smaller than the river's maximum flood potential. The valley is dependent on flood control storage at Lake Don Pedro to prevent flows from exceeding the channel capacity. However, this has happened many times, most infamously during the [[New Year's Flood of 1997]], during which inflows to Don Pedro hit {{convert|120000|cuft/s|m3/s}}, the largest recorded since the [[Great Flood of 1862]]. Water releases from Don Pedro Dam peaked at {{convert|60000|cuft/s|m3/s}}; while this vastly reduced potential damage from the flood, it still exceeded the channel capacity by six times, causing extensive property damage along the river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water.ca.gov/historicaldocs/irwm/feat-1997/fcsia2.html|title=Final Report of the Flood Emergency Action Team|year=1997|publisher=State of California|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Fish, plants and wildlife===\nThe Tuolumne once supported large spring and fall runs of [[chinook salmon]] (king salmon, ''Oncorhynchus tshawytscha'') and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'').

The San Joaquin River and the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]], which link the Tuolumne salmon runs to the Pacific, have also been affected by flow reduction and pollution.

Native Americans set [[Controlled burn|controlled fires]] in grassland to clear out dead foliage, providing room for new growth which in turn attracted game animals to forage. They also periodically burned out oak woodland areas in the foothills to control pests, which otherwise would have affected their main food supply, acorns. During the Spanish and Mexican periods, the Central Valley was used for cattle ranching, which quickly decimated natural range grasses. During the 1880s American sheep ranchers brought their herds into the upper Tuolumne River watershed for summer pasture, which further damaged the range in the foothills and Sierras. Hetch Hetchy Valley was one of the main summer grazing areas for sheep. The decline of native [[perennial plant|perennial]] grasses caused invasive [[annual plant|annual]] species to flourish, and also increased the susceptibility of the watershed to [[wildfire]]s. In order to protect property and watershed quality, intensive fire suppression began in the early 20th century. However, this led to overgrowth and a disruption of the natural [[Forest dynamics|forest succession]] process that was previously driven by wildfires.{{sfn|Epke|Finger|Lusardi|Marks|2010|p=69\u201370}}\n\n==Geology==\n{{expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Early history==\nEstimates of the first human habitation along the Tuolumne River range from 3000\u20137000 BC.<ref name=\"earlyhist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuolumne.org/content/article.php/humans |publisher=Tuolumne River Trust |work=The Watershed |title=Early Humans |accessdate=12 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023013316/http://www.tuolumne.org/content/article.php/humans |archivedate=23 October 2015 }}</ref> The [[Plains and Sierra Miwok]], who were the largest regional Native American group immediately prior to European contact, first established themselves in the area around 1200 CE.<ref name=\"earlyhist\"/> The Miwok lived in the Sierra foothills and Central Valley lowlands during winter and traveled into the upper Tuolumne River in summer to hunt, as well as seek refuge from the summer heat.

The first recorded use of the name \"Tuolumne\" was by the Spanish explorer [[Gabriel Moraga]] in 1806, who may have named the river for the nearby Native American village of ''Tualamne'' or ''Tautamne''. This may in turn refer to the native word ''talmalamne'', or \"a group of stone huts or caves\".

Originating at over {{convert|8000|ft|m}} above sea level in [[Yosemite National Park]], the Tuolumne drains a rugged watershed of {{convert|1958|mi2|km2}}, carving a series of canyons through the western slope of the Sierra. While the upper Tuolumne is a fast-flowing mountain stream, the lower river crosses a broad, fertile and extensively cultivated [[alluvial plain]]. Like most other central California rivers, the Tuolumne is dammed multiple times for irrigation and the generation of [[hydroelectricity]].\n\nHumans have inhabited the Tuolumne River area for up to 10,000 years. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the river canyon provided an important summer hunting ground and a trade route between [[Indigenous peoples of North America|Native Americans]] in the Central Valley to the west and the [[Great Basin]] to the east. First named in 1806 by a Spanish explorer after a nearby indigenous village, the Tuolumne was heavily prospected during the [[California Gold Rush]] in the 1850s, and the lower valley was cultivated by American settlers over the next few decades. The city of [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] grew up on the Tuolumne as a railroad hub, absorbing most of the population of the Tuolumne valley around the turn of the century. As agricultural production rose, farmers along the Tuolumne formed California's first two [[irrigation district]]s to better control and develop the river.\n\nFrom the 1900s to the 1930s, the river was dammed at [[Don Pedro Dam|Don Pedro]] and [[Hetch Hetchy]] to provide water for Central Valley farmers and the city of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], respectively. The Hetch Hetchy project, located inside Yosemite National Park, incited national controversy, and has been described as having forged the modern [[environmental movement]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/a_century_later_the_battle_for_hetch_hetchy_continues/|title=A Century Later, the Battle for Hetch Hetchy Continues|publisher=Earth Island Institute|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> As the mid-20th century progressed, demands on the Tuolumne continued to increase, culminating in the completion of [[New Don Pedro Dam]] in the early 1970s. These projects halved the amount of water flowing from the Tuolumne into the San Joaquin, greatly reducing the once-abundant runs of salmon and steelhead in both rivers.\n\n==Course==\n{{multiple image\n|align=right\n|direction=vertical\n|width=180\n|image1=California Falls, Tuolumne River, California (1921).jpg\n|image2=Waterwheel Falls in Yosemite.jpg\n|caption2=Top: California Falls.

From the headwaters to below Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the river drains the Sierra highlands, which are characterized by solid, [[glacier]]-carved granitic bedrock, thin poor soils and areas of heavy forestation. Most of the snowpack that feeds the Tuolumne accumulates in this region.{{sfn|Epke|Finger|Lusardi|Marks|2010|p=7}} Streams are generally high-gradient, clear and rocky, but large [[alpine meadow]]s provide riparian and wetland habitat, which contribute sediment to the watershed's runoff. There are also a large number of natural lakes and tarns in the upper watershed. The Sierra crest harbors a number of glaciers, including Lyell and Maclure Glaciers, the largest in Yosemite National Park. Melting ice feeds the upper reaches of the Tuolumne River, maintaining water flow in the late summer when many other streams in the region are dry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/yose/blogs/Lyell-Glacier.htm|title=Lyell Glacier|publisher=National Park Service|work=Yosemite National Park|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> The Lyell Glacier is the second largest in the Sierra Nevada, after [[Palisade Glacier]] at the headwaters of [[Big Pine Creek (California)|Big Pine Creek]] a tributary of the [[Owens River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5195705.pdf|title=Wilderness Hiking, Big Pine Canyon, Inyo National Forest|publisher=USFS|accessdate=2015-10-11}}</ref> Both Lyell and Maclure glaciers have shrunk significantly since the late 1800s when measurements were first made.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/yose/parknews/lyellglacier.htm|title=Yosemite National Park's Largest Glacier Stagnant|work=Yosemite National Park|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nBetween Hetch Hetchy Reservoir and the upper end of Lake Don Pedro the Tuolumne flows through the Sierra foothills, where it has a lower gradient but continues to maintain a fast current. Stream pools and gravel bars figure more prominently in the channel, allowing the growth of riparian habitat. By the time the river reaches Lake Don Pedro it has accumulated almost 90 percent of its total flow as precipitation run-off, [[snowmelt]] and [[groundwater]] [[Baseflow|base flow]].{{sfn|Epke|Finger|Lusardi|Marks|2010|pp=4-10}} Below Don Pedro Dam the river flows across the large [[alluvial plain]] of the San Joaquin Valley, formed by millions of years of sediment deposits eroded from the Sierra.

The Hetch Hetchy hydroelectric system diverts large volumes of water into tunnels that feed two hydroelectric plants, the Kirkwood and the Moccasin. The power system is efficient because of the Tuolumne's great drop, over {{convert|2750|ft|m}}, between Hetch Hetchy and the outlet of Moccasin Powerhouse. However, it also causes dewatering of significant portions of the Tuolumne River, especially during low water summers when all but a minimal fish release is diverted through the power plants.

A major tributary, Eleanor Creek, is dammed to form [[Lake Eleanor]], and diverted into Cherry Lake through a tunnel. The combined flow is channeled into a penstock and returns to the river at the Holm Powerhouse. Unlike the Hetch Hetchy system, the Cherry Creek system is used exclusively for hydropower, not water supply, because the water quality is not quite as good. However, there is a connecting aqueduct that allows Cherry Lake to be tapped to supply the Hetch Hetchy system during severe droughts. This backup water supply was last used during late 2015, as a test to ensure its functionality should drought conditions become worse.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/sf-water-to-be-mixed-with-filtered-water-as-city-tests-drought-preparedness/|title=SF water to be mixed with filtered water as city tests drought preparedness|publisher=The San Francisco Examiner|first=Michael|last=Barba|date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> The previous time it was used was 1988.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/California-drought-2-reservoirs-near-Hetch-5321213.php|title=California drought: 2 reservoirs near Hetch Hetchy tapped|publisher=SFGate|first=Marisa|last=Lagos|date=March 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Tuolumne River Modesto.jpg|thumb|right|Tuolumne River in Modesto]]\nBelow the confluence with the North Fork of the Tuolumne the river flows into Lake Don Pedro, the largest in the Tuolumne River system and the sixth-largest man made lake in California at {{convert|2030000|acre feet|m3}}. The earth-filled New Don Pedro Dam, {{convert|585|ft|m}} high, is the 10th tallest dam in the United States and was constructed as a multipurpose project, serving irrigation, municipal water supply, hydropower and flood control. It replaced an earlier concrete dam built on approximately the same site. The Turlock and Modesto Irrigation Districts control the lion's share of water in the reservoir, although the City of San Francisco also has storage rights, which it uses mainly to offset the effects of water diverted upstream at Hetch Hetchy. Because of the desire to increase water storage for other uses, only {{convert|340000|acre feet|m3}} of the reservoir is designated flood control, which is relatively small compared to other reservoirs in California. As a result, Don Pedro frequently fills and spills during winter storms, causing damage downstream.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe La Grange Dam, a much smaller masonry diversion dam, is the last one on the Tuolumne before it joins with the San Joaquin. Modesto Canal, on the north side of the river, and Turlock Canal, on the south side, are both large irrigation diversions. The Modesto Canal feeds the {{convert|29000|acre feet|m3|adj=on}} off-stream Modesto Reservoir, which regulates the water for distribution to farmers. The Turlock Lake is regulated by the similar but much larger Turlock Lake, which has a capacity of {{convert|49000|acre feet|m3|adj=on}}. The estimated annual diversion for irrigation is {{convert|867000|acre feet|m3}}, about half of the Tuolumne River's natural flow.<ref name=\"tldownstream\"/>\n\nBelow La Grange, the Tuolumne \u2013 much reduced due to irrigation diversions \u2013 flows through a fixed channel with a highly restricted [[floodplain]]. Before agriculture, the river inundated large areas of seasonal marshland and was free to change course during its frequent floods. Today farms and communities are protected by a [[levee]] system with a channel capacity of roughly {{convert|9000|cuft/s|m3/s}} at the 9th St. Bridge in Modesto \u2013 significantly smaller than the river's maximum flood potential. The valley is dependent on flood control storage at Lake Don Pedro to prevent flows from exceeding the channel capacity. However, this has happened many times, most infamously during the [[New Year's Flood of 1997]], during which inflows to Don Pedro hit {{convert|120000|cuft/s|m3/s}}, the largest recorded since the [[Great Flood of 1862]]. Water releases from Don Pedro Dam peaked at {{convert|60000|cuft/s|m3/s}}; while this vastly reduced potential damage from the flood, it still exceeded the channel capacity by six times, causing extensive property damage along the river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water.ca.gov/historicaldocs/irwm/feat-1997/fcsia2.html|title=Final Report of the Flood Emergency Action Team|year=1997|publisher=State of California|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Fish, plants and wildlife===\nThe Tuolumne once supported large spring and fall runs of [[chinook salmon]] (king salmon, ''Oncorhynchus tshawytscha'') and [[Rainbow trout|steelhead trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'').

The San Joaquin River and the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]], which link the Tuolumne salmon runs to the Pacific, have also been affected by flow reduction and pollution.

Native Americans set [[Controlled burn|controlled fires]] in grassland to clear out dead foliage, providing room for new growth which in turn attracted game animals to forage. They also periodically burned out oak woodland areas in the foothills to control pests, which otherwise would have affected their main food supply, acorns. During the Spanish and Mexican periods, the Central Valley was used for cattle ranching, which quickly decimated natural range grasses. During the 1880s American sheep ranchers brought their herds into the upper Tuolumne River watershed for summer pasture, which further damaged the range in the foothills and Sierras. Hetch Hetchy Valley was one of the main summer grazing areas for sheep. The decline of native [[perennial plant|perennial]] grasses caused invasive [[annual plant|annual]] species to flourish, and also increased the susceptibility of the watershed to [[wildfire]]s. In order to protect property and watershed quality, intensive fire suppression began in the early 20th century. However, this led to overgrowth and a disruption of the natural [[Forest dynamics|forest succession]] process that was previously driven by wildfires.{{sfn|Epke|Finger|Lusardi|Marks|2010|p=69\u201370}}\n\n==Geology==\n{{expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Early history==\nEstimates of the first human habitation along the Tuolumne River range from 3000\u20137000 BC.<ref name=\"earlyhist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tuolumne.org/content/article.php/humans |publisher=Tuolumne River Trust |work=The Watershed |title=Early Humans |accessdate=12 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023013316/http://www.tuolumne.org/content/article.php/humans |archivedate=23 October 2015 }}</ref> The [[Plains and Sierra Miwok]], who were the largest regional Native American group immediately prior to European contact, first established themselves in the area around 1200 CE.<ref name=\"earlyhist\"/> The Miwok lived in the Sierra foothills and Central Valley lowlands during winter and traveled into the upper Tuolumne River in summer to hunt, as well as seek refuge from the summer heat.

The first recorded use of the name \"Tuolumne\" was by the Spanish explorer [[Gabriel Moraga]] in 1806, who may have named the river for the nearby Native American village of ''Tualamne'' or ''Tautamne''. This may in turn refer to the native word ''talmalamne'', or \"a group of stone huts or caves\".

Named after the country's first prime minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], the school was founded in 1969 as Tunku Abdul Rahman College (or TAR College) by the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA). On 2 May 2013, it officially became a university college. \n\nTAR UC's main campus covers {{convert|186|acre|ha}} at Jalan Genting Kelang in Malaysia's capital, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The university college also has five branches across Malaysia, in the states of [[Penang]], [[Perak]], [[Johor]], [[Pahang]] and [[Sabah]]. The first branch campus, in Penang, began at a temporary location in 1994 before moving to Tanjung Bungah five years later. The second and third branch campuses were founded in [[Kampar, Perak]] and Johor in 1998, and the Pahang faculty branch was established in 1999. The Sabah faculty branch was founded in 2002 in Sabah, [[East Malaysia]]. \n\nThe university college has a student population of over 28,000, including international students from 24 countries including [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Mauritius]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[India]], [[Algeria]], [[Brunei]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Somalia]], [[Pakistan]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Syria]] and [[Yemen]] etc. Over 50 years since its inception, TAR UC has produced more than 210,000 alumni.\n\nTAR UC is the only institution in the world to conduct the Internally Assessed [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] Fundamentals programme<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/my/en/cam/iwd/inspirational-women/kho-sokkee.html|title=Kho Sok Kee, vice president of administration and facilities development, TAR UC {{!}} ACCA Global|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref>, and the only institution in Malaysia to be granted the Graduate Gateway status by the [[Chartered Institute of Marketing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/02/23/liow-tar-uc-hopeful-of-gaining-university-status/|title=Liow: TAR UC hopeful of gaining university status |website=thestar.com.my |access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n[[File:Tunku Abdul Rahman University College.jpg|alt=Main entrance of TAR UC's KL Main Campus.|thumb|260x260px|Main entrance of TAR UC's KL Main Campus.]]{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Malaysia}}\nIn the early years of Malaysian independence, there was a lack of opportunity to pursue higher education. An institution of higher learning was suggested by [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] president Tun Tan Siew Sin. Tan initially suggested the Chinese-language Merdeka University, which was rejected by the government. As a compromise, an [[English language|English]]-[[Medium of instruction|medium]] college was proposed. In April 1968, Tan appointed a working team (chaired by Tan Sri Khaw Kai Boh) to make recommendations for an institution of higher learning.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA403#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary|editor= Leo Suryadinata|page=403 |publisher=ISEAS Publishing |date=30 December 2012 |isbn= 978-9814345217 }}</ref>\n\nIts blueprint was submitted to the government, and received the support of Minister of Education Mohamed Khir Johari. The working team estimated that it would require [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]] 20 million to set up the college, and the government agreed to provide the financial assistance on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman consented to the college being named for him.\n\nTAR College began operations on 24 February 1969 with its School of Pre-University Studies and an initial enrollment of 764 students. A 15 September 1972 [[Instrument of Government]] provided the legal framework for the administration of the college. Minister of Education Tun Hussein Onn presented the instrument to Tan Siew Sin, the first college president. To raise funds for a campus in Kuala Lumpur, the MCA launched a national fundraising campaign in 1972 led by MCA publicity director [[Lee San Choon]].\n\nIn February 1973, the government approved the allocation of land for the main Kuala Lumpur campus in [[Setapak]]. The ground-breaking ceremony was officiated by Rahman in August 1973. Phase one, including an administrative building, a library, two laboratory blocks, one large and eight small lecture theatres and a canteen, was completed in 1976.\n\nFundraising activities in the 1990s, such as the nationwide TAR College Fund-Raising Campaign, Taxithon, Walkathon, TAR College Torch Run and Motorthon, were led by TAR College Council chairman Ling Liong Sik. Expansion continued under the leadership of TAR College Council chairmen [[Ong Ka Ting]] and [[Chua Soi Lek]]. Since its 2013 upgrade to a university college, TAR UC continued its steady development under the leadership of [[Liow Tiong Lai]]. The latest infrastructure development, the new phase of the Penang branch campus which began on 7 December 2015, includes a three-storey library building, two four-storey faculty blocks and a twin lecture-theatre hall.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n==Institutional Awards==\n'''Asia Pacific CSR Awards 2016'''\n\nTAR UC was accorded the Excellence in Education Improvement award in the Asia Pacific CSR Awards 2016 under the award category of Socially Responsible Company in Education Improvement on 27 September 2016. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csrasiapacificforum.org/awards2016.html|title=Welcome to Asia Pacific CSR Awards 2016!|website=www.csrasiapacificforum.org|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref>\n\n'''Premier Digital Technology Institution'''\n\nTAR UC was recognised with the Premier Digital Tech Institution status by the [[Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation|Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC)]] and the Ministry of Higher Education in 2017.

abbreviated '''TAR UC''', is a non-profit, private [[university college]] in [[Malaysia]]. Named after the country's first prime minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], the school was founded in 1969 as Tunku Abdul Rahman College (or TAR College) by the [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] (MCA). On 2 May 2013, it officially became a university college. \n\nTAR UC's main campus covers {{convert|186|acre|ha}} at Jalan Genting Kelang in Malaysia's capital, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The university college also has five branches across Malaysia, in the states of [[Penang]], [[Perak]], [[Johor]], [[Pahang]] and [[Sabah]]. The first branch campus, in Penang, began at a temporary location in 1994 before moving to Tanjung Bungah five years later. The second and third branch campuses were founded in [[Kampar, Perak]] and Johor in 1998, and the Pahang faculty branch was established in 1999. The Sabah faculty branch was founded in 2002 in Sabah, [[East Malaysia]]. \n\nThe university college has a student population of over 28,000, including international students from 24 countries including [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Mauritius]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[India]], [[Algeria]], [[Brunei]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Somalia]], [[Pakistan]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Syria]] and [[Yemen]] etc. Over 50 years since its inception, TAR UC has produced more than 210,000 alumni.\n\nTAR UC is the only institution in the world to conduct the Internally Assessed [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] Fundamentals programme<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.accaglobal.com/my/en/cam/iwd/inspirational-women/kho-sokkee.html|title=Kho Sok Kee, vice president of administration and facilities development, TAR UC {{!}} ACCA Global|website=www.accaglobal.com|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref>, and the only institution in Malaysia to be granted the Graduate Gateway status by the [[Chartered Institute of Marketing]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/02/23/liow-tar-uc-hopeful-of-gaining-university-status/|title=Liow: TAR UC hopeful of gaining university status |website=thestar.com.my |access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>.\n\n<br />\n\n[[File:Tunku Abdul Rahman University College.jpg|alt=Main entrance of TAR UC's KL Main Campus.|thumb|260x260px|Main entrance of TAR UC's KL Main Campus.]]{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Malaysia}}\nIn the early years of Malaysian independence, there was a lack of opportunity to pursue higher education. An institution of higher learning was suggested by [[Malaysian Chinese Association]] president Tun Tan Siew Sin. Tan initially suggested the Chinese-language Merdeka University, which was rejected by the government. As a compromise, an [[English language|English]]-[[Medium of instruction|medium]] college was proposed. In April 1968, Tan appointed a working team (chaired by Tan Sri Khaw Kai Boh) to make recommendations for an institution of higher learning.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9QEBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA403#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Southeast Asian Personalities of Chinese Descent: A Biographical Dictionary|editor= Leo Suryadinata|page=403 |publisher=ISEAS Publishing |date=30 December 2012 |isbn= 978-9814345217 }}</ref>\n\nIts blueprint was submitted to the government, and received the support of Minister of Education Mohamed Khir Johari. The working team estimated that it would require [[Malaysian ringgit|RM]] 20 million to set up the college, and the government agreed to provide the financial assistance on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman consented to the college being named for him.\n\nTAR College began operations on 24 February 1969 with its School of Pre-University Studies and an initial enrollment of 764 students. A 15 September 1972 [[Instrument of Government]] provided the legal framework for the administration of the college. Minister of Education Tun Hussein Onn presented the instrument to Tan Siew Sin, the first college president. To raise funds for a campus in Kuala Lumpur, the MCA launched a national fundraising campaign in 1972 led by MCA publicity director [[Lee San Choon]].\n\nIn February 1973, the government approved the allocation of land for the main Kuala Lumpur campus in [[Setapak]]. The ground-breaking ceremony was officiated by Rahman in August 1973. Phase one, including an administrative building, a library, two laboratory blocks, one large and eight small lecture theatres and a canteen, was completed in 1976.\n\nFundraising activities in the 1990s, such as the nationwide TAR College Fund-Raising Campaign, Taxithon, Walkathon, TAR College Torch Run and Motorthon, were led by TAR College Council chairman Ling Liong Sik. Expansion continued under the leadership of TAR College Council chairmen [[Ong Ka Ting]] and [[Chua Soi Lek]]. Since its 2013 upgrade to a university college, TAR UC continued its steady development under the leadership of [[Liow Tiong Lai]]. The latest infrastructure development, the new phase of the Penang branch campus which began on 7 December 2015, includes a three-storey library building, two four-storey faculty blocks and a twin lecture-theatre hall.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n==Institutional Awards==\n'''Asia Pacific CSR Awards 2016'''\n\nTAR UC was accorded the Excellence in Education Improvement award in the Asia Pacific CSR Awards 2016 under the award category of Socially Responsible Company in Education Improvement on 27 September 2016. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csrasiapacificforum.org/awards2016.html|title=Welcome to Asia Pacific CSR Awards 2016!|website=www.csrasiapacificforum.org|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref>\n\n'''Premier Digital Technology Institution'''\n\nTAR UC was recognised with the Premier Digital Tech Institution status by the [[Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation|Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation (MDEC)]] and the Ministry of Higher Education in 2017.

The US debut was originally released without the song, which references the band's return via their second international album. However, once it was decided that the single would be released in the US, the album was re-released with \"Everybody\" included. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commented that the song has \"a contagious dance/pop beat and catchy hook that perfectly showcases this talented group's voices.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1998/BB-1998-04-04.pdf|title=Single Reviews|work=Billboard magazine|accessdate=9 February 2020|page=65|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] chairman [[Clive Calder]] suggested the song as a single, but [[Jive Records|Jive]] president [[Barry Weiss]] thought it would be weird to have a song called \"Backstreet's Back\" on the band's first US album.

The band met with Weiss and asked that the song be added to the US album after the first million units had already been produced.<ref name=\"ew\">Interview with Backstreet Boys, management, and others from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' 10th Anniversary Issue.</ref> Written and produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Denniz Pop|Denniz PoP]], \"Everybody\" is one of the Backstreet Boys' most successful singles to date, reaching number 4 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], running 22 weeks, and number 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Worldwide Charts|url=http://www.backstreetparadise.com/charts.html|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> It is [[RIAA certification|certified]] platinum in the United States with 2.1 million sales.\n\nThere are two versions of the song.

He initially didn't know who the Backstreet Boys were, but was shocked by the group's European sales figures after being given a [[cassette tape]] and publicity release about them.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> Kahn initially started out as a grunge and hip-hop director, but wanted to explore the pop genre, since he grew up listening to music from the 1980s.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/>\n\nThe haunted house treatment of the video was based on a treatment he envisioned for rapper [[Ice Cube]] a few months prior, and was inspired by the music video of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\".<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> Kahn and the Backstreet Boys wanted [[Antonio Fargas]] to portray the bus driver, as they were fans of ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]''.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> The video shoot lasted for 36 hours, with Nick Carter's mummy shot being filmed last.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/>\n\nThe video premiered outside the United States in July 1997, although viewers with [[Fuse (TV channel)|MuchMusic USA]] were able to see it as at the time it was still mostly a simulcast of the Canadian channel.  Jive did not get behind the concept of the band in costumes or the $1 million requirements, and did not believe MTV would respect the video. The band ultimately had to put up their own money to shoot the video and had to fight with the label to get reimbursed once it was successful.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> In a 2017 interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Kahn reflected on the impact of the music video:<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/><blockquote>I was just trying to do something fun and make the pop video I\u2019d always wanted to make,\" he says. \"I love pop, and it just didn\u2019t exist at that point -- so I guess this helped start the whole pop scene in America. It allowed me to help create a new pop scene and, through these videos, create my view of pop culture.</blockquote>\n\n===Synopsis===\n[[File:Everybody Video BSB.jpg|thumb|The group, with [[Howie D.|Howie]] in front, as they prepare to leave the haunted house]]\nThe video is [[Framing device|bookended]] by scenes framing the context: When their bus breaks down, the band's driver ([[Antonio Fargas]]) insists that the group spend a night at a nearby haunted house (the same house used in the 1995 film ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]'') while he gets help. It then shows Brian preparing to sleep in one of the bedrooms. As he is in bed, he pulls out a scary animal from under his covers, making him scream in horror. The musical portion of the video plays as a dream sequence in which each band member appears as a different [[movie monster]]: [[Brian Littrell|Brian]] as a [[werewolf]]; [[Howie Dorough|Howie]] as [[Dracula]]; [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick]] as a [[mummy]]; [[A.J. McLean|A.J.]] as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, the Phantom of the Opera]]; and [[Kevin Richardson (musician)|Kevin]] as [[Two-Face]]-like [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]. The boys, as monsters, mainly appear in their own individual vignettes related to their character, while the band as a group appears in the foyer of the house dressed in centuries-old clothing, performing a dance routine with a group of additional dancers. Supermodel [[Josie Maran]] appears as Howie's companion in his vignette. Following the song, the boys meet up in the foyer, each one having dreamed themselves as monsters. They resolve to leave, but are terrified by the sight of their driver standing at the front door with the appearance of [[Frankenstein's monster]]. The boys scream in terror, and the video ends.\n\nThere are two cuts of the video; one for the US market, and one for the international market, each of which features the edit of the song released on the album for that market. The international video cuts from the opening bookend to the first verse. The bridge of the song is intact and the first half of the dance routine, a ballroom dance portion, is intercut with the vignettes under it. This leads into the second half of the dance portion during the final choruses of the song which are not intercut with the vignettes. In the US cut, the ballroom half of the dance routine and the beginning of the second half are used at the start of the song during the first rhythm-only breakdown, and is not intercut with the vignettes. The second breakdown, which replaces the bridge, is accompanied only by shots from the vignettes, along with some shots of Brian's Wolfman character doing some [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]] moves in the foyer and in the various vignettes. When the final choruses begin, the second half of the dance routine is shown again from the start, but is intercut with vignette scenes. Most of the remainder of the video is cut identically, other than several minor instances of alternate scenes or takes being used. The dance floor in the video was painted. At the end, Brian wakes up, looks in his bed to see nothing, and realizes that he had a nightmare. As he tells Howie about his dream, he and the other guys tell each other that they had a dream as well and described what they were. Howie and the others get ready to leave, but find that their bus driver is a monster, making the Backstreet Boys scream in terror.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===MTV Video Music Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[1998 MTV Video Music Awards|1998]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\"\n|[[Best Group Video]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[Best Dance Video]]\n|{{nom}}\n{{end}}\n\n===Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[1999 Kids' Choice Awards|1999]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\n|Favorite Song\n|{{won}}\n{{end}}\n\n===Grammy Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n||[[41st Grammy Awards|1999]]\n||Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\n|[[Best New Artist]]\n|{{nom}}\n{{end}}\n\n===MuchMusic Video Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n||[[MuchMusic Video Awards|1998]]\n||Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\n|Peoples Choice Favorite International Group\n|{{won}}\n{{end}}\n\n===MTV Movie Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n||[[MTV Movie Awards|2014]]\n|''This Is the End'' (Performance)\n|Best Musical Moment<ref>http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/2014/best-musical-moment/</ref>\n|{{won}}\n{{end}}\n\n==Track listing==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===America===\n'''CD1'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:44\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Matty's Radio Mix)\n\n'''CD2'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Matty's Radio Mix) \u2013 3:57\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Multiman Remix) \u2013 4:09\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Sharp London Vocal Mix) \u2013 8:02\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:48\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Version) \u2013 4:46\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Video Clip) \u2013 6:03\n\n'''Vinyl'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Radio Mix) \u2013 4:48\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Matty's Hip Hop Radio Remix)\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Kano's Undercurrent Dub)\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Sharp London Vocal Remix)\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Sharp Trade Dub)\n{{col-2}}\n===UK===\n'''CD1'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (7\" Version) \u2013 3:44\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Version) \u2013 4:45\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Multiman Remix) \u2013 4:09\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Matty's Remix) \u2013 3:55\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Max & Macario Club Mix) \u2013 6:12\n\n'''CD2'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (7\" Version) \u2013 3:44\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Version) \u2013 4:45\n#\"Boys Will Be Boys\" \u2013 4:05\n\n===Japan / Canada===\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (7\" Version) \u2013 3:44\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Version) \u2013 4:42\n#\"Anywhere for You\" \u2013 4:40\n#\"Boys Will Be Boys\" \u2013 4:05\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It was released as the first [[Single (music)|single]] from their second international album ''[[Backstreet's Back]]'' in June 1997, and the third single from their [[Backstreet Boys (1997 album)|debut US album]] in March 1998. The US debut was originally released without the song, which references the band's return via their second international album. However, once it was decided that the single would be released in the US, the album was re-released with \"Everybody\" included. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' commented that the song has \"a contagious dance/pop beat and catchy hook that perfectly showcases this talented group's voices.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1998/BB-1998-04-04.pdf|title=Single Reviews|work=Billboard magazine|accessdate=9 February 2020|page=65|format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]] chairman [[Clive Calder]] suggested the song as a single, but [[Jive Records|Jive]] president [[Barry Weiss]] thought it would be weird to have a song called \"Backstreet's Back\" on the band's first US album. The band suggested it could just mean that they were back home. After Canadian markets began playing the song, US markets near the border began picking the song up. The band met with Weiss and asked that the song be added to the US album after the first million units had already been produced.<ref name=\"ew\">Interview with Backstreet Boys, management, and others from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' 10th Anniversary Issue.</ref> Written and produced by [[Max Martin]] and [[Denniz Pop|Denniz PoP]], \"Everybody\" is one of the Backstreet Boys' most successful singles to date, reaching number 4 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], running 22 weeks, and number 3 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Worldwide Charts|url=http://www.backstreetparadise.com/charts.html|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> It is [[RIAA certification|certified]] platinum in the United States with 2.1 million sales.\n\nThere are two versions of the song. The international album features the album or 7\" version, which is the standard recording. The US album features the extended version of the song which includes an extended breakdown section, but cuts the bridge. The music video for the song was cut to both versions of the song, with the extended video released to the US market, and the standard video released everywhere else. In late August 2012, Backstreet Boys member [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] revealed via Twitter that the group was recording the song in Spanish, and it might be featured in their eighth studio record for Latin markets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Carter twitter update|url=https://twitter.com/nickcarter/status/240277086760206336|accessdate=August 29, 2012|date=August 28, 2012|quote=We are recording backstreets back in Spanish. Omg what's going on! Maybe well put it on the new record for Latin markets. En espa\u00f1ol}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\n===Background===\nThe music video was directed by [[Joseph Kahn]] and filmed in [[Los Angeles]], California from June 16\u201318, 1997.<ref name=\"Everybody20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7865195/backstreet-boys-everybody-backstreets-back-video-anniversary-interview|title=How 'Everybody (Backstreet's Back)' Director Joseph Kahn Pushed Racial Boundaries & Brought a Backstreet Boy to Tears|last=Tailor|first=Leena|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 14, 2017|access-date=February 25, 2020}}</ref> Kahn was contacted by [[Jive Records]] to direct a project with a \"white [[Jodeci]]\". He initially didn't know who the Backstreet Boys were, but was shocked by the group's European sales figures after being given a [[cassette tape]] and publicity release about them.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> Kahn initially started out as a grunge and hip-hop director, but wanted to explore the pop genre, since he grew up listening to music from the 1980s.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/>\n\nThe haunted house treatment of the video was based on a treatment he envisioned for rapper [[Ice Cube]] a few months prior, and was inspired by the music video of [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|Thriller]]\".<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> Kahn and the Backstreet Boys wanted [[Antonio Fargas]] to portray the bus driver, as they were fans of ''[[Starsky & Hutch]]''.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> The video shoot lasted for 36 hours, with Nick Carter's mummy shot being filmed last.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/>\n\nThe video premiered outside the United States in July 1997, although viewers with [[Fuse (TV channel)|MuchMusic USA]] were able to see it as at the time it was still mostly a simulcast of the Canadian channel.  Jive did not get behind the concept of the band in costumes or the $1 million requirements, and did not believe MTV would respect the video. The band ultimately had to put up their own money to shoot the video and had to fight with the label to get reimbursed once it was successful.<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/> In a 2017 interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Kahn reflected on the impact of the music video:<ref name=\"Everybody20\"/><blockquote>I was just trying to do something fun and make the pop video I\u2019d always wanted to make,\" he says. \"I love pop, and it just didn\u2019t exist at that point -- so I guess this helped start the whole pop scene in America. It allowed me to help create a new pop scene and, through these videos, create my view of pop culture.</blockquote>\n\n===Synopsis===\n[[File:Everybody Video BSB.jpg|thumb|The group, with [[Howie D.|Howie]] in front, as they prepare to leave the haunted house]]\nThe video is [[Framing device|bookended]] by scenes framing the context: When their bus breaks down, the band's driver ([[Antonio Fargas]]) insists that the group spend a night at a nearby haunted house (the same house used in the 1995 film ''[[Casper (film)|Casper]]'') while he gets help. It then shows Brian preparing to sleep in one of the bedrooms. As he is in bed, he pulls out a scary animal from under his covers, making him scream in horror. The musical portion of the video plays as a dream sequence in which each band member appears as a different [[movie monster]]: [[Brian Littrell|Brian]] as a [[werewolf]]; [[Howie Dorough|Howie]] as [[Dracula]]; [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick]] as a [[mummy]]; [[A.J. McLean|A.J.]] as [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik, the Phantom of the Opera]]; and [[Kevin Richardson (musician)|Kevin]] as [[Two-Face]]-like [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]. The boys, as monsters, mainly appear in their own individual vignettes related to their character, while the band as a group appears in the foyer of the house dressed in centuries-old clothing, performing a dance routine with a group of additional dancers. Supermodel [[Josie Maran]] appears as Howie's companion in his vignette. Following the song, the boys meet up in the foyer, each one having dreamed themselves as monsters. They resolve to leave, but are terrified by the sight of their driver standing at the front door with the appearance of [[Frankenstein's monster]]. The boys scream in terror, and the video ends.\n\nThere are two cuts of the video; one for the US market, and one for the international market, each of which features the edit of the song released on the album for that market. The international video cuts from the opening bookend to the first verse. The bridge of the song is intact and the first half of the dance routine, a ballroom dance portion, is intercut with the vignettes under it. This leads into the second half of the dance portion during the final choruses of the song which are not intercut with the vignettes. In the US cut, the ballroom half of the dance routine and the beginning of the second half are used at the start of the song during the first rhythm-only breakdown, and is not intercut with the vignettes. The second breakdown, which replaces the bridge, is accompanied only by shots from the vignettes, along with some shots of Brian's Wolfman character doing some [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]] moves in the foyer and in the various vignettes. When the final choruses begin, the second half of the dance routine is shown again from the start, but is intercut with vignette scenes. Most of the remainder of the video is cut identically, other than several minor instances of alternate scenes or takes being used. The dance floor in the video was painted. At the end, Brian wakes up, looks in his bed to see nothing, and realizes that he had a nightmare. As he tells Howie about his dream, he and the other guys tell each other that they had a dream as well and described what they were. Howie and the others get ready to leave, but find that their bus driver is a monster, making the Backstreet Boys scream in terror.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\n===MTV Video Music Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[1998 MTV Video Music Awards|1998]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\"\n|[[Best Group Video]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[Best Dance Video]]\n|{{nom}}\n{{end}}\n\n===Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[1999 Kids' Choice Awards|1999]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\n|Favorite Song\n|{{won}}\n{{end}}\n\n===Grammy Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n||[[41st Grammy Awards|1999]]\n||Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\n|[[Best New Artist]]\n|{{nom}}\n{{end}}\n\n===MuchMusic Video Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n||[[MuchMusic Video Awards|1998]]\n||Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\n|Peoples Choice Favorite International Group\n|{{won}}\n{{end}}\n\n===MTV Movie Awards===\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n||[[MTV Movie Awards|2014]]\n|''This Is the End'' (Performance)\n|Best Musical Moment<ref>http://www.mtv.com/ontv/movieawards/2014/best-musical-moment/</ref>\n|{{won}}\n{{end}}\n\n==Track listing==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===America===\n'''CD1'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:44\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Matty's Radio Mix)\n\n'''CD2'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Matty's Radio Mix) \u2013 3:57\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Multiman Remix) \u2013 4:09\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Sharp London Vocal Mix) \u2013 8:02\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:48\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Version) \u2013 4:46\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Video Clip) \u2013 6:03\n\n'''Vinyl'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Radio Mix) \u2013 4:48\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Matty's Hip Hop Radio Remix)\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Kano's Undercurrent Dub)\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Sharp London Vocal Remix)\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Sharp Trade Dub)\n{{col-2}}\n===UK===\n'''CD1'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (7\" Version) \u2013 3:44\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Version) \u2013 4:45\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Multiman Remix) \u2013 4:09\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Matty's Remix) \u2013 3:55\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Max & Macario Club Mix) \u2013 6:12\n\n'''CD2'''\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (7\" Version) \u2013 3:44\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Version) \u2013 4:45\n#\"Boys Will Be Boys\" \u2013 4:05\n\n===Japan / Canada===\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (7\" Version) \u2013 3:44\n#\"Everybody (Backstreet's Back)\" (Extended Version) \u2013 4:42\n#\"Anywhere for You\" \u2013 4:40\n#\"Boys Will Be Boys\" \u2013 4:05\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Tucson Mall features over 170 stores and two levels of indoor shopping. It is anchored by [[Forever 21]], [[J. C. Penney]], [[Macy's]] (formerly [[Foley's]] and [[Robinsons-May]]), [[Dillard's]], and [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]]. Tucson Mall contains a food court containing several fast food restaurants, as well as \"Arizona Avenue,\" an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] containing Southwestern-themed items. The mall is located on the north side of Tucson, bounded by Oracle Road ([[Arizona State Route 77]]), Wetmore Road, Stone Avenue, and the Rillito River.\n\n==Anchor stores==\n*[[Dillard's]] (197,958 sq ft.<ref>http://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/70402857/4550-N-Oracle-Rd-Tucson-AZ-85705/</ref>)\n*[[Forever 21]] (86,596 sq ft.,<ref>http://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/70364186/4510-N-Oracle-Rd-Tucson-AZ-85705/</ref> formerly [[Mervyn's]])\n*[[J.

During a trip to Chicago in the 1930s, she spotted a shopping center on the Skokie Highway and thought to herself, \"That's what I am going to have on my land.\" She kept the parcel of land together until 1978, and at that point plans for the mall were initiated with Forest City Enterprises.<ref>[http://tucson.com/news/local/wetmores-had-deep-roots-in-north-side-area/article_0915f2f5-1c43-55d7-8da7-8da543f9f53e.html David Leighton, \"Wetmores had deep roots in north-side area,\" Arizona Daily Star, Sept. 18, 2012]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Tucson Mall opened in 1982, with about 100 stores and five department stores, including [[The Broadway|Broadway]], [[J. C. Penney]], [[Mervyn\u2019s]], [[Diamond's]]<ref>https://www.pinterest.com/pin/364017582379180559/</ref> and [[Sears]]. Diamond's was converted to [[Dillard's]] in 1984.\n\nBeginning in 1990, the mall began an extensive expansion project. First, the Dillard's anchor was expanded and a parking garage was added adjacent to Dillard's. On the east side of the mall, an entirely new wing was built; the original mall footprint had stopped just to the east of the center court area.  The area to the southeast of the Mervyn's had been a parking lot. A new wing opened in 1991 and added over 400,000 sq ft to the mall, over 70 new stores, and a sixth anchor, Houston-based [[Foley's]].\n\nIn 1993, the food court was renovated with addition of a carousel and Arizona Avenue.\n\nIn 1996, the Broadway was changed to a [[Macy's]] after [[Federated Department Stores]] acquired Broadway.\n\nIn 1997, all of Foley's locations in Arizona were rebranded as the [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Robinsons-May]].\n\nIn 2001, General Growth Properties purchased Tucson Mall.\n\nIn 2003, the aging mall underwent a $15 million overhaul, which was the first major overhaul since it opened in 1982. The mall was given all new polished tile floors, glass railings on the upper level, new escalators and elevators where stairs had been, a new children\u2019s play area, new and refurbished restrooms, reworked food court and Arizona Avenue, changes to fountains and a new paint scheme.<ref>http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/2002/04/12/14660-tucson-mall-getting-new-look/</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the Robinsons-May was changed to a Macy's after Macy's acquired them in a corporate purchase. The existing Macy's on the south side of the mall was vacated.<ref>https://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/news/vacant-macy-s-store-to-be-demolished-for-something-special/article_702c7d74-dcd2-5cc1-88d0-96cc144b3125.html</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the former Macy's store was demolished in preparation for an extensive remodel and addition on the south side of the mall. The changes include the addition of a grand entrance hall in the location of the old anchor, extension of stores on both the east and west side of the new entrance, addition of multiple water features, complete update of facade from current Macy's to Mall Security Offices, and the addition of [[Recreational Equipment, Inc.|REI]] and [[The Cheesecake Factory]] on the south side of the Tucson Mall.

Tucson Mall features over 170 stores and two levels of indoor shopping. It is anchored by [[Forever 21]], [[J. C. Penney]], [[Macy's]] (formerly [[Foley's]] and [[Robinsons-May]]), [[Dillard's]], and [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]]. Tucson Mall contains a food court containing several fast food restaurants, as well as \"Arizona Avenue,\" an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] containing Southwestern-themed items. The mall is located on the north side of Tucson, bounded by Oracle Road ([[Arizona State Route 77]]), Wetmore Road, Stone Avenue, and the Rillito River.\n\n==Anchor stores==\n*[[Dillard's]] (197,958 sq ft.<ref>http://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/70402857/4550-N-Oracle-Rd-Tucson-AZ-85705/</ref>)\n*[[Forever 21]] (86,596 sq ft.,<ref>http://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/70364186/4510-N-Oracle-Rd-Tucson-AZ-85705/</ref> formerly [[Mervyn's]])\n*[[J.

During a trip to Chicago in the 1930s, she spotted a shopping center on the Skokie Highway and thought to herself, \"That's what I am going to have on my land.\" She kept the parcel of land together until 1978, and at that point plans for the mall were initiated with Forest City Enterprises.<ref>[http://tucson.com/news/local/wetmores-had-deep-roots-in-north-side-area/article_0915f2f5-1c43-55d7-8da7-8da543f9f53e.html David Leighton, \"Wetmores had deep roots in north-side area,\" Arizona Daily Star, Sept. 18, 2012]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Tucson Mall opened in 1982, with about 100 stores and five department stores, including [[The Broadway|Broadway]], [[J. C. Penney]], [[Mervyn\u2019s]], [[Diamond's]]<ref>https://www.pinterest.com/pin/364017582379180559/</ref> and [[Sears]]. Diamond's was converted to [[Dillard's]] in 1984.\n\nBeginning in 1990, the mall began an extensive expansion project. First, the Dillard's anchor was expanded and a parking garage was added adjacent to Dillard's. On the east side of the mall, an entirely new wing was built; the original mall footprint had stopped just to the east of the center court area.  The area to the southeast of the Mervyn's had been a parking lot. A new wing opened in 1991 and added over 400,000 sq ft to the mall, over 70 new stores, and a sixth anchor, Houston-based [[Foley's]].\n\nIn 1993, the food court was renovated with addition of a carousel and Arizona Avenue.\n\nIn 1996, the Broadway was changed to a [[Macy's]] after [[Federated Department Stores]] acquired Broadway.\n\nIn 1997, all of Foley's locations in Arizona were rebranded as the [[Los Angeles]]-based [[Robinsons-May]].\n\nIn 2001, General Growth Properties purchased Tucson Mall.\n\nIn 2003, the aging mall underwent a $15 million overhaul, which was the first major overhaul since it opened in 1982. The mall was given all new polished tile floors, glass railings on the upper level, new escalators and elevators where stairs had been, a new children\u2019s play area, new and refurbished restrooms, reworked food court and Arizona Avenue, changes to fountains and a new paint scheme.<ref>http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/2002/04/12/14660-tucson-mall-getting-new-look/</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the Robinsons-May was changed to a Macy's after Macy's acquired them in a corporate purchase. The existing Macy's on the south side of the mall was vacated.<ref>https://www.insidetucsonbusiness.com/news/vacant-macy-s-store-to-be-demolished-for-something-special/article_702c7d74-dcd2-5cc1-88d0-96cc144b3125.html</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the former Macy's store was demolished in preparation for an extensive remodel and addition on the south side of the mall. The changes include the addition of a grand entrance hall in the location of the old anchor, extension of stores on both the east and west side of the new entrance, addition of multiple water features, complete update of facade from current Macy's to Mall Security Offices, and the addition of [[Recreational Equipment, Inc.|REI]] and [[The Cheesecake Factory]] on the south side of the Tucson Mall. A parking structure was also added adjacent to the current Macy's.\n\nIn 2008, [[GameStop]], formerly an Electronics Boutique, in the bottom floor was relocated to the center as a Software ETC on the top floor, also owned by Gamestop, hyped a bigger, better Gamestop, this larger center one being the result. Mervyn's closed their store with the chain's demise.\n\nIn 2009, [[Forever 21]] opened in the approximately {{convert|80000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} space formerly anchored by Mervyn's as part of its strategy to open larger stores with a more diverse merchandise selection.<ref>http://tucson.com/business/forever-set-to-take-over-tucson-mall-s-mervyns-site/article_f65a1174-3fee-54dc-a799-27a3de800f55.html</ref>\n\nOn February 6, 2020, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 31 stores nationwide.

Of its land area of 24,000, 80.7% is dedicated to agricultural use with a large percentage planted with bananas. Therefore, the ups and downs of the economic situation of the people in the interior barangay is more or less dependent on banana Industry. Cognizant with the bright prospect of banana products playing a vital role of livelihood of the people, in 1986, the LGU of Tubod,Lanao del Norte initiated the conceptualization of a festival that would give an all out emphasis on Council was organizeds to assist the LGU of  Tubod in designing what is now known as the Sagingan Festival, as well as to determined priority measures to enhance the product of the economic symbol of Tubod. With close coordination of the Department of Agriculture, the banana yields of Tubod were given special treatment ( ex. Research, variety classification, soil analysis etc.). In 1987, the first Sagingan Festival celebrated by Tubod during the commemoration of the Towns creation (Charter day October 17). The celebration highlighted the presentation of the different varieties of bananas In Tubod (52 varieties as of last count). Seeing the festival enlightens the Tubodnons on the importance of Bananas in generation income, it was enhanced, developed, and sustained by the LGU of Tubod. Indeed, from the time, a portion of the LGU\u2019s 20% development fund was allocated for the Sagingan Festival. In 1992, Sagingan Festival was officially accredited with the Department of Tourism and included in the calendar festival in the entire Philippines. There festivals are highlighted with Street dancing Competition, Best Decorated Caromata, Booth Contest, Search for Ms. Sagingan Festival which use of 75% of Banana materials, banana Festival, and Agro-industrial Trade Fair. Folk Dance Competition and  Sports Competition were incorporated to add and grandeur to the celebration.

However, before this could be contemplated, it would be necessary for them to defeat the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian]] forces holding [[Kingston upon Hull]] and [[Plymouth]]; otherwise, as the Royalist forces moved on London, the garrisons of those two towns could [[sortie]] out and attack the Royalist rear areas.\n\nWhile these sieges were under way, [[Charles I of England]] decided to make the best use of his time by reducing [[Siege of Gloucester|Gloucester]], the one great fortress of Parliament in the west. Parliamentary forces relieved [[Gloucester]] on 5 September. The relieving army was brought to battle by Royalist forces in the [[First Battle of Newbury]]; it was a tactical draw but a strategic victory for the Parliamentarians as it reduced the likelihood of a Royalist attack on London.\n\nMeanwhile, the second Royalist [[siege of Hull (1643)|siege of Hull]] had commenced. The [[Eastern Association]] forces under the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] promptly moved up into [[Lincolnshire]], the foot besieging [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]] (which surrendered on 16 September) while the horse rode into the northern part of the county to give a hand to the Fairfaxes. However, the sea communications of [[Kingston upon Hull]] were open and available for the Parliamentary forces.<ref name=\"EB1911\">Atkinson, p. 407.</ref>\n\nOn 18 September, part of the cavalry in Hull was ferried over to [[Barton-upon-Humber|Barton]], and the rest under Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] went by sea to [[Saltfleet]] a few days later, the whole joining [[Oliver Cromwell]] near [[Spilsby]]. In return, the old [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]], who remained in Hull, received infantry reinforcements and a quantity of ammunition and stores from the Eastern Association.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> On 9 October Parliamentary forces under Manchester laid siege to [[Bolingbroke Castle]].\n\n==Battle==\nOn 9 October, Sir [[John Henderson, 5th of Fordell|John Henderson]], the Royalist governor of [[Newark-on-Trent]], took a body of 1,500 men, consisting predominantly of cavalry in eight troops, with some [[dragoon]]s and infantry, to relieve the garrison at Bolingbroke. After a sharp skirmish they took Horncastle from a small outlying detachment of Fairfax's force. The Parliamentary detachment reported back to the main army that the Royalists were moving towards them.  The next morning, leaving enough men to stop the Bolingbroke garrison from launching a sortie, Manchester arrayed his army on Kirkby Hill, overlooking Bolingbroke. Sometime between 12:00 and 14:00 hours he ordered a general advance towards Horncastle. The Parliamentary horse, which moved faster than the infantry, met the Royalists advancing in the opposite direction at Winceby. The field of battle was not ideal as the land falls away into sharp gullies on one side, but it was not poor enough to  prohibit a battle. The two forces were roughly the same size and composition because, as with the Parliamentarians, the Royalist infantry was not present.\n\nThe ensuing battle lasted about half an hour. Cromwell feigned a retreat and lured the Royalists from a good defensive position onto flat ground. A small party of Parliamentarians advanced on the Royalists who discharged their weapons at them. Cromwell then led his main body of horse in a charge hoping to press home his attack before the Royalists had time to reload. But dismounted Royalist dragoons managed to fire a second volley, hitting several of the Ironsides. {{anchor|Sir Ingram Hopton}}Cromwell had his horse shot from under him, apparently by Sir Ingram Hopton (who was himself killed in the subsequent fighting and is commemorated by a memorial canvas found above the font in [[St. Mary's Church, Horncastle]].  The canvas's inscription describes Cromwell as the 'Arch Rebel' and bears the incorrect date of October 6, 1643 for the Battle of Winceby<ref name = ChurchTour>Elliott.</ref>). Cromwell was only able to rejoin the battle after he had secured another mount. Royalist cavalry under [[Sir William Savile, 3rd Baronet|Sir William Savile]] counterattacked hitting Cromwell's right flank. They in turn were attacked in the flank by Fairfax's horse. In the resulting melee, the Royalists lost cohesion when the command by Savile to about face was taken to be an order to retreat and Savile's horse fled the battle. On the Roundhead's left wing the Cavaliers enjoyed greater initial success, but the collapse of the Royalist left and centre meant that Henderson had to retreat or face [[envelope|envelopment]]. A [[Flanking maneuver|flanking]] attack by Cromwell's reformed cavalry was enough to cause the Royalists to flee the field in confusion back towards Newark.\n\nIn Horncastle, at a place now known as \"slash hollow\", some Royalists were killed or captured when they became trapped against a parish boundary gate that only opened one way (against them) and in their panic the press of men jammed it shut. For the remainder of the day the Roundheads hunted down Cavalier stragglers not stopping until dusk, which in October occurs in early evening, when they were recalled by Manchester. The Royalists lost about 300 men and the Parliamentarians about 20 with a further 60 wounded {{Ref|casualties}}.\n\nOn the same day, [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Newcastle's]] army around Hull, which had suffered terribly from the hardships of continuous siege work, was attacked by the garrison. They were so severely handled that the siege of Hull was given up the next day.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nManchester left Bolingbroke Castle under siege and proceeded to retake [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]]. With all hope of relief gone the garrison of Bolingbroke Castle surrendered on 14 November.  Thus Lincolnshire, which had been almost entirely in the Royalist Earl of Newcastle's hands before he was compelled to undertake the siege of Hull, was added, in fact as well as in name, to the Eastern Association.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::{{cite book |last1=Atkinson |first1=Charles Francis |editor1-last=Chisholm |editor1-first=Hugh |title=Great Rebellion s.v.

The field of battle was not ideal as the land falls away into sharp gullies on one side, but it was not poor enough to  prohibit a battle. The two forces were roughly the same size and composition because, as with the Parliamentarians, the Royalist infantry was not present.\n\nThe ensuing battle lasted about half an hour. Cromwell feigned a retreat and lured the Royalists from a good defensive position onto flat ground. A small party of Parliamentarians advanced on the Royalists who discharged their weapons at them. Cromwell then led his main body of horse in a charge hoping to press home his attack before the Royalists had time to reload. But dismounted Royalist dragoons managed to fire a second volley, hitting several of the Ironsides. {{anchor|Sir Ingram Hopton}}Cromwell had his horse shot from under him, apparently by Sir Ingram Hopton (who was himself killed in the subsequent fighting and is commemorated by a memorial canvas found above the font in [[St. Mary's Church, Horncastle]].  The canvas's inscription describes Cromwell as the 'Arch Rebel' and bears the incorrect date of October 6, 1643 for the Battle of Winceby<ref name = ChurchTour>Elliott.</ref>). Cromwell was only able to rejoin the battle after he had secured another mount. Royalist cavalry under [[Sir William Savile, 3rd Baronet|Sir William Savile]] counterattacked hitting Cromwell's right flank. They in turn were attacked in the flank by Fairfax's horse. In the resulting melee, the Royalists lost cohesion when the command by Savile to about face was taken to be an order to retreat and Savile's horse fled the battle. On the Roundhead's left wing the Cavaliers enjoyed greater initial success, but the collapse of the Royalist left and centre meant that Henderson had to retreat or face [[envelope|envelopment]]. A [[Flanking maneuver|flanking]] attack by Cromwell's reformed cavalry was enough to cause the Royalists to flee the field in confusion back towards Newark.\n\nIn Horncastle, at a place now known as \"slash hollow\", some Royalists were killed or captured when they became trapped against a parish boundary gate that only opened one way (against them) and in their panic the press of men jammed it shut. For the remainder of the day the Roundheads hunted down Cavalier stragglers not stopping until dusk, which in October occurs in early evening, when they were recalled by Manchester. The Royalists lost about 300 men and the Parliamentarians about 20 with a further 60 wounded {{Ref|casualties}}.\n\nOn the same day, [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Newcastle's]] army around Hull, which had suffered terribly from the hardships of continuous siege work, was attacked by the garrison. They were so severely handled that the siege of Hull was given up the next day.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nManchester left Bolingbroke Castle under siege and proceeded to retake [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]]. With all hope of relief gone the garrison of Bolingbroke Castle surrendered on 14 November.  Thus Lincolnshire, which had been almost entirely in the Royalist Earl of Newcastle's hands before he was compelled to undertake the siege of Hull, was added, in fact as well as in name, to the Eastern Association.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::{{cite book |last1=Atkinson |first1=Charles Francis |editor1-last=Chisholm |editor1-first=Hugh |title=Great Rebellion s.v.
