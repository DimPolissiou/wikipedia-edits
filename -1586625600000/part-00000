The story followed the rivalry between Rudramuthi Sastri, a very powerful Brahman in that village and his family and Manonmani, the dasi of the village and her family in the small hamlet of Kandhanallur on the banks of the river [[Kaveri]].\n\nManonmani, a dasi comes back to her ancestral village of '''Kandhanallur''' with her daughter, Krishnaveni after 15 years of exile from the village where she, her daughter and baby granddaughter, Meenaatchi, were exiled by the village's people. As soon as she arrives, she goes to meet Rudhramoorthi Sastri and his son Saminatha Sastri and vows that she will wreak havoc in their perfect lives like they wrecked hers 15 years ago.\n\nMeanwhile,  Saminatha Sastri's son, Sunderesan falls in love with Meenaatchi while they are studying at the college. Krishnaveni never revealed who was Meenatchi's father to anyone for reasons only known to her but Meenaatchi is determined to find out the truth. Pachiamma, the village midwife extorts Manonmani to safeguard a secret known only to them.\n\nGowri, Rudhramoorthi Sastri's daughter married a Christian man, David and because of that, her mother committed suicide. They have a son, Kirubakaran. Her family never forgave her and cut all ties with her. She is suffering from cancer now.\n\nWhat is the reason for enmity between Manonmani and Rudhramoorthy Sastri? Why was Manonmani's family exiled from the village in the first place? Did Manonmani wreak havoc in Rudhramoorthi Sastri's family? Who is Meenaatchi's father and why is Krishnaveni keeping this a secret? What is the secret between Manonmani and Pachaiamma? What is the fate of the relationship between Sunderesan and Meenaatchi?  These are the questions that are answered in the course of this serial with lots of twists and turns.\n\n==Remake==\nKrishnadasi was remade in [[Hindi]] under the same title, [[Krishnadasi (2016 TV series)|Krishnadasi]], starring [[Shravan Reddy]] and [[Sana Amin Sheikh]] on [[Colours (TV channel)|Colors]] with significant changes in the story.\n\n==YouTube release==\n\nThe episodes of Krishnadasi are being officially released by the production house in their KPTV YouTube channel in the second half of 2018, more than 18 years after the premiere of episode 1 of Krishnadasi on Sun TV in the year 2000.

Donetsk is adjacent to another major city, [[Makiivka]], and along with other surrounding cities forms a major [[urban sprawl]] and [[conurbation]] in the region. Donetsk has been a major economic, industrial and scientific centre of Ukraine with a high concentration of heavy industries and a skilled workforce. The density of heavy industries (predominantly steel production, chemical industry, and coal mining) determined the city's challenging ecological situation. In 2012 a UN report ranked Donetsk among the world's fastest depopulating cities.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-that-are-shrinking-2012-10?r=US&IR=T The 28 Fastest-Shrinking Cities In The World]</ref>\n\nThe original settlement in the south of the European part of the [[Russian Empire]] was first mentioned as '''Aleksandrovka''' in 1779, during the reign of the Empress [[Catherine the Great]]. In 1869 the Welsh businessman [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]] founded a steel plant and several [[coal mining|coal mines]] in the region, and the town was named '''Hughesovka''' or '''Yuzovka''' (\u042e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430) in recognition of his role (\"Yuz\" being a Russian-language approximation of ''Hughes''). During [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the city's steel industry expanded. In 1924 Yuzovka was renamed '''Stalin'''. In 1929 Stalin was renamed '''Stalino''', and in 1932 the city became the centre of the Donetsk region. Renamed '''Donetsk''' in 1961, the city today remains a centre for [[coal mining]] and for the [[steel industry]].\n\nSince April 2014 Donetsk and its surrounding areas have been one of the major sites of fighting in the ongoing [[War in Donbass|Donbass War]], as pro-Russian separatist forces battle against Ukrainian military forces for control of the city and surrounding areas.

In the southern part were the city's factories, railway stations, telegraph buildings, hospitals and schools. Not far from the factories was the ''English colony'' where the engineers and the management lived. After the construction of the residence of [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]] and the various complexes for the foreign workers, the city's southern portion was constructed mainly in the English style.\n\nThese buildings used rectangular and triangular shaped fa\u00e7ades, green rooftops, large windows, which occupied a large portion of the building, and balconies. In this part of the town, the streets were large and had pavements. A major influence on the formation of architecture in Donetsk was the ''official architect'' of a [[Novorossiya]] company \u2014 ''Moldingauyer''. Preserved buildings of the southern part of Yuzovka consisted of the residences of John Hughes (''1891, partially preserved''), Bolfur (''1889'') and Bosse.\n\nIn the northern part of Yuzovka, ''Novyi Svet'', lived traders, craftsmen and bureaucrats. Here were located the market hall, the police headquarters and the Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Jesus. The central street of Novyi Svet and the neighbouring streets were mainly edged by one- or two-story residential buildings, as well as markets, restaurants, hotels, offices and banks. A famous preserved building in the northern part of Yuzovka was the Hotel Great Britain.\n\nThe first general plan of Stalino was made in 1932 in [[Odessa]] by the architect P. Golovchenko. In 1937, the project was partly reworked. These projects were the first in the city's construction bureau's history.\n\nA large portion of the city's buildings from the second half of the 20th century were designed by the architect Pavel Vigdergauz, which was given the [[USSR State Prize|Government award of the USSR]] for architecture in the city of Donetsk in 1978.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:DonetskCathedral.jpg|thumb|The reconstructed Cathedral of Transfiguration of Jesus in Donetsk.]]\n\nDonetsk's residents belong to religious traditions including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ortodox.donbass.com/|script-title=ru:\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0441 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439|trans-title=Orthodox Donbass|language=ru|publisher=ortodox.donbass.com|accessdate=12 May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629040340/http://www.ortodox.donbass.com/|archivedate=29 June 2007}}</ref> [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Protestantism]], and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as well as [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.razumkov.org.ua/ukr/poll.php?poll_id=300|script-title=uk:\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0456\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f - \u0420\u0435\u043b\u0456\u0433\u0456\u044f: \u0412\u0456\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0447\u0438\u043c \u044f\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u0412\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0432\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0454\u0442\u0435?|trans-title=Sociological survey - Religion: Believers, which churches do you consider yourself to adherents of?|language=uk|work=[[Razumkov Centre]]|date=2006|accessdate=5 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108233934/http://old.razumkov.org.ua/ukr/poll.php?poll_id=300|archive-date=8 November 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska2011\">{{cite book|last1=Yarosh|first1=Oleg|last2=Brylov|first2=Denys|editor=Katarzyna G\u00f3rak-Sosnowka|title=Muslims in Poland and Eastern Europe: Widening the European Discourse on Islam|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCAU6Bz5QIEC&pg=PA254|accessdate=27 May 2016|year=2011|publisher=Katarzyna G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|isbn=978-83-903229-5-7|page=254|chapter=Muslim communities and Islamic network institutions in Ukraine: contesting authorities in shaping Islamic localities}}</ref> The religious body with the most members is the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]] and [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate]].\n\nIn 2014, a fake leaflet \"signed by Chairman of Donetsk's temporary government Denis Pushilin\" was distributed to Jews on the festival of Passover.

Donetsk is adjacent to another major city, [[Makiivka]], and along with other surrounding cities forms a major [[urban sprawl]] and [[conurbation]] in the region. Donetsk has been a major economic, industrial and scientific centre of Ukraine with a high concentration of heavy industries and a skilled workforce. The density of heavy industries (predominantly steel production, chemical industry, and coal mining) determined the city's challenging ecological situation. In 2012 a UN report ranked Donetsk among the world's fastest depopulating cities.<ref>[https://www.businessinsider.com/cities-that-are-shrinking-2012-10?r=US&IR=T The 28 Fastest-Shrinking Cities In The World]</ref>\n\nThe original settlement in the south of the European part of the [[Russian Empire]] was first mentioned as '''Aleksandrovka''' in 1779, during the reign of the Empress [[Catherine the Great]]. In 1869 the Welsh businessman [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]] founded a steel plant and several [[coal mining|coal mines]] in the region, and the town was named '''Hughesovka''' or '''Yuzovka''' (\u042e\u0437\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430) in recognition of his role (\"Yuz\" being a Russian-language approximation of ''Hughes''). During [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] times, the city's steel industry expanded. In 1924 Yuzovka was renamed '''Stalin'''. In 1929 Stalin was renamed '''Stalino''', and in 1932 the city became the centre of the Donetsk region.

In the southern part were the city's factories, railway stations, telegraph buildings, hospitals and schools. Not far from the factories was the ''English colony'' where the engineers and the management lived. After the construction of the residence of [[John Hughes (businessman)|John Hughes]] and the various complexes for the foreign workers, the city's southern portion was constructed mainly in the English style.\n\nThese buildings used rectangular and triangular shaped fa\u00e7ades, green rooftops, large windows, which occupied a large portion of the building, and balconies. In this part of the town, the streets were large and had pavements. A major influence on the formation of architecture in Donetsk was the ''official architect'' of a [[Novorossiya]] company \u2014 ''Moldingauyer''. Preserved buildings of the southern part of Yuzovka consisted of the residences of John Hughes (''1891, partially preserved''), Bolfur (''1889'') and Bosse.\n\nIn the northern part of Yuzovka, ''Novyi Svet'', lived traders, craftsmen and bureaucrats. Here were located the market hall, the police headquarters and the Cathedral of the Transfiguration of Jesus. The central street of Novyi Svet and the neighbouring streets were mainly edged by one- or two-story residential buildings, as well as markets, restaurants, hotels, offices and banks. A famous preserved building in the northern part of Yuzovka was the Hotel Great Britain.\n\nThe first general plan of Stalino was made in 1932 in [[Odessa]] by the architect P. Golovchenko. In 1937, the project was partly reworked. These projects were the first in the city's construction bureau's history.\n\nA large portion of the city's buildings from the second half of the 20th century were designed by the architect Pavel Vigdergauz, which was given the [[USSR State Prize|Government award of the USSR]] for architecture in the city of Donetsk in 1978.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:DonetskCathedral.jpg|thumb|The reconstructed Cathedral of Transfiguration of Jesus in Donetsk.]]\n\nDonetsk's residents belong to religious traditions including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ortodox.donbass.com/|script-title=ru:\u0414\u043e\u043d\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0441 \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0439|trans-title=Orthodox Donbass|language=ru|publisher=ortodox.donbass.com|accessdate=12 May 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629040340/http://www.ortodox.donbass.com/|archivedate=29 June 2007}}</ref> [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], [[Protestantism]], and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], as well as [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.razumkov.org.ua/ukr/poll.php?poll_id=300|script-title=uk:\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0456\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044f - \u0420\u0435\u043b\u0456\u0433\u0456\u044f: \u0412\u0456\u0440\u0443\u044e\u0447\u0438\u043c \u044f\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0456\u0457 \u0412\u0438 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0432\u0432\u0430\u0436\u0430\u0454\u0442\u0435?|trans-title=Sociological survey - Religion: Believers, which churches do you consider yourself to adherents of?|language=uk|work=[[Razumkov Centre]]|date=2006|accessdate=5 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108233934/http://old.razumkov.org.ua/ukr/poll.php?poll_id=300|archive-date=8 November 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska2011\">{{cite book|last1=Yarosh|first1=Oleg|last2=Brylov|first2=Denys|editor=Katarzyna G\u00f3rak-Sosnowka|title=Muslims in Poland and Eastern Europe: Widening the European Discourse on Islam|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCAU6Bz5QIEC&pg=PA254|accessdate=27 May 2016|year=2011|publisher=Katarzyna G\u00f3rak-Sosnowska|isbn=978-83-903229-5-7|page=254|chapter=Muslim communities and Islamic network institutions in Ukraine: contesting authorities in shaping Islamic localities}}</ref> The religious body with the most members is the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]] and [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate]].\n\nIn 2014, a fake leaflet \"signed by Chairman of Donetsk's temporary government Denis Pushilin\" was distributed to Jews on the festival of Passover.

His work was primarily published in the [[Popular Publications]] catalog of [[pulp magazine|pulp fiction]]. The most part of his work for Popular Publications was attributed to his pen names ''Dane Gregory'' and, occasionally, ''Breck Tarrant''.\n\nIn ''The Shudder Pulps'', Robert Kenneth Jones places Dane Gregory's detective fiction in the vogue of the \"defective detective\" in the late nineteen-thirties and early forties. Recurring characters in Dane Gregory's fiction included ''Rocky Rhodes'', ex-convict turned private investigator, and ''Satan Jones''.<ref>''The Shudder Pulps'', Robert Kenneth Jones, Fax Collector's Editions Inc., 1975, {{ISBN|0-913960-04-7}}.</ref>\n\nOrmond Robbins' brother [[Wayne Robbins]] also wrote fiction for the pulps. The two brothers even collaborated on a western story, ''Murder Boss Of The Poverty Pool'' that was featured in ''10 Story Western Magazine'' in September 1941.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Francis, Wayne, Ormond, and Lorimer Robbins.jpg|thumb|240px|right|alt=Francis, Wayne, Ormond, and Lorimer Robbins|Francis, [[Wayne Robbins|Wayne]], Ormond, and Lorimer Robbins]]\n\nOrmond Robbins was born on March 14, 1910 in [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]] to Charles L. and Clara (Brooks) Robbins. His family moved to [[Sunnyside, Washington]] in 1919, where Ormond completed elementary and high school, class of 1928.\n\nHe began writing short stories, humor, and poetry at about age 12. By the age of 15, he regularly contributed to the pulp magazine ''[[College Humor (magazine)|College Humor]]''.<!--Working on this bibliography--> ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' published a poem in their December 1, 1934 issue, and another in March of the following year. He saw another printed in the June 1935 issue of ''Country Gentleman.'' In 1936, the newly established ''Yakima Independent'' newspaper carried his daily column for about a year.\n\nHe married Jane Eshom on October 8, 1937 in [[Yakima, Washington]]. Their daughter, Alta Jane Robbins, was born on 15 April 1951. After a divorce, he married Wanda M. Falls at Bettles Field, Alaska on September 20, 1957. They had no children.\n\nOrmond was unable to serve in [[World War II]] due to a [[4F (military conscription)|4f classification]], but he and Jane were accepted by the [[FAA|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] (now the FAA) for outpost positions in Alaska. Ormond served as station manager, while Jane was a communications operator.<ref>''CAA Mukluk Telegraph'', July 1947, p. 30, retrieved from [http://www.atchistory.org/History/Pubs/mukluk_telegraph_pubs/pdf_files/1947/mukluk_telegraph_jul_1947.pdf atchistory.org] November 30, 2009.</ref> Their first assignment was [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]], then [[Kotzebue, Alaska|Kotzebue]] in 1945, and then [[List of places in Alaska/B|Bettles Field]] in 1951.<ref>''CAA Mukluk Telegraph'', November 1948, p. 17, retrieved from [http://www.atchistory.org/History/Pubs/mukluk_telegraph_pubs/pdf_files/1948/mukluk_telegraph_1948_nov.pdf atchistory.org] November 30, 2009.</ref> He transferred with Wanda to [[Northway, Alaska|Northway]], and became district manager at [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]].<ref>''FAA Telephone Directory - Alaskan Region'', January 1968, p. 9, retrieved from [http://www.atchistory.org/History/Pubs/ak_phone_directory/alaskan_region_telephone_directory_Jan_1968.pdf atchistory.org] November 30, 2009.</ref> In 1969, he transferred to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], where he retired and became city manager at Kenai on January 20, 1970.<ref>''The Job No One Seemed to Want'', Clark Fair, The Redoubt Reporter, May 6, 2009, retrieved from [http://redoubtreporter.wordpress.com/2009/05/06/1-in-a-million-shot-%E2%80%94-persistent-pacific-passenger-sews-up-free-ticket-stock/ redoubtreporter.wordpress.com] November 30, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 1974, Ormond and Wanda returned to Sunnyside, Washington to be near his father, his mother having died that year. After his father died in 1978, they moved to [[Seaside, Oregon]], where Ormond died in 1984.

Lapacho is the national tree of [[Paraguay]],<ref>[http://homeguides.sfgate.com/lapacho-tree-48569.html]</ref> and it is also a common tree in Argentina's northeastern region, as well as in southeastern [[Bolivia]].  According to ''Native Trees of Trinidad and Tobago'', this tree is not indigenous to Trinidad, it is introduced.\n\nIt is a conspicuous and well-known species with a long history of human use. Consequently, it has a range of local names: ''ip\u00ea-cavat\u00e3, ip\u00ea-comum, ip\u00ea-reto, ip\u00ea-rosa, ip\u00ea-roxo-damata, lapacho negro, pau d'arco-roxo, pe\u00fava'' or ''pi\u00fava''. The [[timber]] is sometimes traded as \"[[Brazilwood]]\", which properly refers to the unrelated Pernambuco tree (''[[Caesalpinia echinata]]'').\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Tabebuia impetiginosa hojas.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Foliage]]\n[[Image:Tabebuia impetiginosa inflorescencia.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|[[Inflorescence]]s]]\n[[Image:Tabebuia impetiginosa flower.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A single flower]]\n\nThe pink lapacho is a rather large [[deciduous]] tree, with trunks sometimes reaching 8 dm width and 30 m height. Usually a third of that height is trunk, and two thirds are its longer branches. It has a large, globous, but often sparse [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]]. The tree has a slow growth rate. Leaves are opposite and [[Petiole (botany)|petiolate]], 2 to 3&nbsp;inches long, elliptic and [[lanceolate]], with lightly serrated margins and pinnate [[Leaf#Venation (arrangement of the veins)|venation]]. The leaves are palmately compound with usually 5 leaflets.\n\nIts bark is brownish grey, tough and hard to peel. The wood is of a pleasant yellowish colour, barely knotted and very tough and heavy (0,935&nbsp;kg/dm\u00b3). It's rich in [[tannin]]s and therefore very resistant to weather and sun.<ref name = lopezetal1987>L\u00f3pez ''et al.'' (1987)</ref> It is not very useful for furniture since it is so hard to work by hand. It can be found as beams or fulfilling other structural uses where needed outdoors.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere, pink lapacho flowers between July and September, before the new leaves appear. In the northern hemisphere like [[India]], the flowering season is December to January, after the leaves are shed. The flower is large, tubular shaped, its corolla is often pink or magenta, though exceptionally seen white, about 2&nbsp;inches long. There are four [[stamens]] and a [[staminode]]. The fruit consists of a narrow dehiscent [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] containing several winged seeds.\n\nThe flowers are easily accessible to [[pollinator]]s. Some [[hummingbird]]s - e.g. [[black jacobin]] (''Florisuga fusca'') and [[black-throated mango]] (''Anthracothorax nigricollis'') - seem to prefer them over the flowers of other ''[[Handroanthus]]'' species, while for others like the [[stripe-breasted starthroat]] (''Heliomaster squamosus'') it may even be a mainstay food source.<ref>Baza Mendon\u00e7a & dos Anjos (2005)</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n\nHarvest of wild ''Handroanthus impetiginosus'' for lumber to make flooring and decking (in which case it is referred to as ip\u00ea in much of the timber trade) has become a major cause of [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schulze M, Grogan J, Landis RM, Vidal E | title = How rare is too rare to harvest?

[[Swietenia mahagoni]] and [[Swietenia humilis]] (other species yielding mahogany wood) were so thoroughly depleted that by the early 1900s there were essentially none left to harvest in the wild. Unfortunately the current scenario is one in which ''Handroanthus'' is headed for similar unsustainable depletion of wild populations.\n\n==Uses==\n[[Image:Lapacho Teerinde.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lapacho]] tea]]\n''Handroanthus impetiginosus'', as well as other species of this genus, are trees naturally found in the wild of central to South American forests. It is also used as a [[honey plant]], and widely planted as [[ornamental tree]] in landscaping gardens, public squares and boulevards due to its impressive and colorful appearance as it flowers.<ref name=lopezetal1987/> Well-known and popular, it is the [[Floral emblem|national tree]] of Paraguay. It is also planted as a street tree in cities of India, like in Bangalore.\n\nThe inner [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of ''Handroanthus impetiginosus'' is used in [[traditional medicine]].<ref>[http://www.esalq.usp.br/trilhas/medicina/am21.htm?PHPSESSID=82bf340b6b369121eea5b3aeefd6eef5 ''Tabebuia avellanedae''] at [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]]</ref> It is dried, shredded, and then boiled, making a bitter brownish-colored tea known as [[lapacho]] or taheebo. The unpleasant taste of the extract is lessened when taken in pill form, or as [[tincture]]s.

Lapacho is the national tree of [[Paraguay]],<ref>[http://homeguides.sfgate.com/lapacho-tree-48569.html]</ref> and it is also a common tree in Argentina's northeastern region, as well as in southeastern [[Bolivia]].  According to ''Native Trees of Trinidad and Tobago'', this tree is not indigenous to Trinidad, it is introduced.\n\nIt is a conspicuous and well-known species with a long history of human use. Consequently, it has a range of local names: ''ip\u00ea-cavat\u00e3, ip\u00ea-comum, ip\u00ea-reto, ip\u00ea-rosa, ip\u00ea-roxo-damata, lapacho negro, pau d'arco-roxo, pe\u00fava'' or ''pi\u00fava''. The [[timber]] is sometimes traded as \"[[Brazilwood]]\", which properly refers to the unrelated Pernambuco tree (''[[Caesalpinia echinata]]'').\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Tabebuia impetiginosa hojas.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Foliage]]\n[[Image:Tabebuia impetiginosa inflorescencia.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|[[Inflorescence]]s]]\n[[Image:Tabebuia impetiginosa flower.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A single flower]]\n\nThe pink lapacho is a rather large [[deciduous]] tree, with trunks sometimes reaching 8 dm width and 30 m height. Usually a third of that height is trunk, and two thirds are its longer branches. It has a large, globous, but often sparse [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]]. The tree has a slow growth rate. Leaves are opposite and [[Petiole (botany)|petiolate]], 2 to 3&nbsp;inches long, elliptic and [[lanceolate]], with lightly serrated margins and pinnate [[Leaf#Venation (arrangement of the veins)|venation]]. The leaves are palmately compound with usually 5 leaflets.\n\nIts bark is brownish grey, tough and hard to peel. The wood is of a pleasant yellowish colour, barely knotted and very tough and heavy (0,935&nbsp;kg/dm\u00b3). It's rich in [[tannin]]s and therefore very resistant to weather and sun.<ref name = lopezetal1987>L\u00f3pez ''et al.'' (1987)</ref> It is not very useful for furniture since it is so hard to work by hand. It can be found as beams or fulfilling other structural uses where needed outdoors.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere, pink lapacho flowers between July and September, before the new leaves appear. In the northern hemisphere like [[India]], the flowering season is December to January, after the leaves are shed. The flower is large, tubular shaped, its corolla is often pink or magenta, though exceptionally seen white, about 2&nbsp;inches long. There are four [[stamens]] and a [[staminode]]. The fruit consists of a narrow dehiscent [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] containing several winged seeds.\n\nThe flowers are easily accessible to [[pollinator]]s. Some [[hummingbird]]s - e.g. [[black jacobin]] (''Florisuga fusca'') and [[black-throated mango]] (''Anthracothorax nigricollis'') - seem to prefer them over the flowers of other ''[[Handroanthus]]'' species, while for others like the [[stripe-breasted starthroat]] (''Heliomaster squamosus'') it may even be a mainstay food source.<ref>Baza Mendon\u00e7a & dos Anjos (2005)</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n\nHarvest of wild ''Handroanthus impetiginosus'' for lumber to make flooring and decking (in which case it is referred to as ip\u00ea in much of the timber trade) has become a major cause of [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schulze M, Grogan J, Landis RM, Vidal E | title = How rare is too rare to harvest?

[[Swietenia mahagoni]] and [[Swietenia humilis]] (other species yielding mahogany wood) were so thoroughly depleted that by the early 1900s there were essentially none left to harvest in the wild. Unfortunately the current scenario is one in which ''Handroanthus'' is headed for similar unsustainable depletion of wild populations.\n\n==Uses==\n[[Image:Lapacho Teerinde.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lapacho]] tea]]\n''Handroanthus impetiginosus'', as well as other species of this genus, are trees naturally found in the wild of central to South American forests. It is also used as a [[honey plant]], and widely planted as [[ornamental tree]] in landscaping gardens, public squares and boulevards due to its impressive and colorful appearance as it flowers.<ref name=lopezetal1987/> Well-known and popular, it is the [[Floral emblem|national tree]] of Paraguay. It is also planted as a street tree in cities of India, like in Bangalore.\n\nThe inner [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of ''Handroanthus impetiginosus'' is used in [[traditional medicine]].<ref>[http://www.esalq.usp.br/trilhas/medicina/am21.htm?PHPSESSID=82bf340b6b369121eea5b3aeefd6eef5 ''Tabebuia avellanedae''] at [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]]</ref> It is dried, shredded, and then boiled, making a bitter brownish-colored tea known as [[lapacho]] or taheebo.
