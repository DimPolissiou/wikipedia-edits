{"title_page": "William Clements, 3rd Earl of Leitrim", "text_new": "[[File:William Clements, 3rd Earl of Leitrim.jpg|thumb|The 3rd Earl of Leitrim.]]\n'''William Sydney Clements, 3rd Earl of Leitrim''' (15 October 1806 \u2013 2 April 1878), was an [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] nobleman and landlord notorious in Irish history for his mistreatment of his tenants. He was assassinated in the north of [[County Donegal]] in [[Ulster]] in April 1878.\n\nBorn in [[Dublin]], he was educated at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] and was commissioned as an [[ensign (rank)|Ensign]] in the [[43rd Foot]] in 1824. In 1831 he was promoted [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]], having served in [[Portugal]] between 1826 and 1827, and that same year was appointed an [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. In 1835 he transferred to the [[51st Foot]]. In 1839, on the death of his elder brother, he became known as Viscount Clements and also succeeded his brother as a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Leitrim (UK Parliament constituency)|County Leitrim]], a seat he held until 1847.\n\nOn his father's death in 1854, Clements succeeded as 3rd Earl. In 1855 he was promoted [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] and subsequently retired from the [[British Army]]. Over the next two decades, his overbearing behaviour as a landlord brought him much hatred from his tenants, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] alike, whom he evicted with equal enthusiasm.  According to his biographer Fiona Slevin, Lord Leitrim was accused by some of \"repeatedly [violating] young girls and [claiming] ''[[droit du seigneur]]'' ... some of his peers repeated accusations of his 'immorality towards daughters of tenants' in the House of Commons and named him 'the bad earl'.\"  However, Slevin also quotes a journalist who investigated Lord Leitrim's assassination as claiming, \"'even among those who hold the strongest views upon Lord Leitrim's conduct as a landlord, the charge (of debauchery) is discredited and I did not meet a single person who regarded it as tenable.'\"  In Slevin's words, \"the final straw that motivated the individuals involved\" in Lord Leitrim's assassination was his alleged [[rape]] of the daughter of one of his assassins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.loughrynn.net/id31.htm|title=William Sydney Clements, 3rd Earl of Leitrim (Lord Leitrim)|last=Slevin|first=Fiona|date=18 January 2014|website=Lough Rynn|access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nLeitrim was deeply opposed to [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s [[Irish Land Act]] of 1870 and was one of eight [[Peerage|peers]] to protest against the legislation when it reached the [[House of Lords]]. Among those he also quarrelled with were the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister of [[Milford, County Donegal|Milford]] in North Donegal, and the Lord Lieutenant himself, [[George William Frederick Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle|The 7th Earl of Carlisle]], who removed him from his appointments as a [[justice of the peace]] for [[Counties of Ireland|Counties]] Leitrim, [[County Donegal|Donegal]], and [[County Galway|Galway]].\n\nIn April 1878, after surviving various attempts on his life, Lord Leitrim was assassinated, along with his clerk and driver, near Cratlagh Wood while on his way to Milford (a village he owned in its entirety) from his home, Manor Vaughan (usually known as Mulroy House), on Mulroy Bay. Michael Heraghty and brothers Thomas and Bernard McGranahan were arrested. \"The gun butt had been traced to Heraghty, and paper for the wadding used to load the rifle was traced to a school copybook owned by the McGranahans. The McGranahans were released from Lifford Jail due to a lack of evidence. Heraghty died in Lifford Jail of typhus...

He was assassinated in the north of [[County Donegal]] in [[Ulster]] in April 1878.\n\nBorn in [[Dublin]], he was educated at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] and was commissioned as an [[ensign (rank)|Ensign]] in the [[43rd Foot]] in 1824. In 1831 he was promoted [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]], having served in [[Portugal]] between 1826 and 1827, and that same year was appointed an [[aide-de-camp]] to the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]]. In 1835 he transferred to the [[51st Foot]]. In 1839, on the death of his elder brother, he became known as Viscount Clements and also succeeded his brother as a [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Leitrim (UK Parliament constituency)|County Leitrim]], a seat he held until 1847.\n\nOn his father's death in 1854, Clements succeeded as 3rd Earl. In 1855 he was promoted [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] and subsequently retired from the [[British Army]]. Over the next two decades, his overbearing behaviour as a landlord brought him much hatred from his tenants, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] alike, whom he evicted with equal enthusiasm.  According to his biographer Fiona Slevin, Lord Leitrim was accused by some of \"repeatedly [violating] young girls and [claiming] ''[[droit du seigneur]]'' ... some of his peers repeated accusations of his 'immorality towards daughters of tenants' in the House of Commons and named him 'the bad earl'.\"  However, Slevin also quotes a journalist who investigated Lord Leitrim's assassination as claiming, \"'even among those who hold the strongest views upon Lord Leitrim's conduct as a landlord, the charge (of debauchery) is discredited and I did not meet a single person who regarded it as tenable.'\"  In Slevin's words, \"the final straw that motivated the individuals involved\" in Lord Leitrim's assassination was his alleged [[rape]] of the daughter of one of his assassins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.loughrynn.net/id31.htm|title=William Sydney Clements, 3rd Earl of Leitrim (Lord Leitrim)|last=Slevin|first=Fiona|date=18 January 2014|website=Lough Rynn|access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nLeitrim was deeply opposed to [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s [[Irish Land Act]] of 1870 and was one of eight [[Peerage|peers]] to protest against the legislation when it reached the [[House of Lords]]. Among those he also quarrelled with were the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister of [[Milford, County Donegal|Milford]] in North Donegal, and the Lord Lieutenant himself, [[George William Frederick Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle|The 7th Earl of Carlisle]], who removed him from his appointments as a [[justice of the peace]] for [[Counties of Ireland|Counties]] Leitrim, [[County Donegal|Donegal]], and [[County Galway|Galway]].\n\nIn April 1878, after surviving various attempts on his life, Lord Leitrim was assassinated, along with his clerk and driver, near Cratlagh Wood while on his way to Milford (a village he owned in its entirety) from his home, Manor Vaughan (usually known as Mulroy House), on Mulroy Bay. Michael Heraghty and brothers Thomas and Bernard McGranahan were arrested. \"The gun butt had been traced to Heraghty, and paper for the wadding used to load the rifle was traced to a school copybook owned by the McGranahans. The McGranahans were released from Lifford Jail due to a lack of evidence. Heraghty died in Lifford Jail of typhus... The assassins, Nial Shiels of Doughmore, an itinerant tailor, Michael Hergarty of Tullyconnell, and Michael McElwee of Ballyworiskey, were from the remote Fanad Peninsula.

The Titan IV could be launched with no [[Multistage rocket|upper stage]], the [[Inertial Upper Stage]] (IUS), or the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur upper stage]].\n\nThe Titan IV was made up of two large [[solid-fuel rocket|solid-fuel rocket boosters]] and a two-stage liquid-fueled core. The two storable liquid fuel core stages used [[Aerozine 50]] fuel and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] oxidizer. These propellants are [[hypergolic]] (ignite on contact) and are liquids at room temperature, so no tank insulation is needed. This allowed the launcher to be stored in a ready state for extended periods, but both propellants are extremely toxic.\n\nThe Titan IV could be launched from either coast: [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|SLC-40]] or [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41|41]] at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station near Cocoa Beach, Florida and at [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 4|SLC-4E]], at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base#Launch sites|Vandenberg Air Force Base launch sites]] 55 miles northwest of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] California.

To evaluate the magnitude of the thrust force, the SRMU was connected to the steel tower through load measurement systems and launched in-place.  It was the first full-scale test conducted to simulate the effects of the SRMU on the main space shuttle vehicle.<ref>Chalhoub, Michel S., (1990) \"Dynamic Analysis, Design, and Execution of a Full Scale SRMU Test Stand,\" Parsons Engineering Report No. 027-90</ref>\n\n====Proposed aluminum-lithium tanks====\nIn the early 1980s, [[General Dynamics]] developed a plan to assembly a lunar landing spacecraft on-orbit. A Space Shuttle would lift a [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] into orbit and then a Titan IV rocket would launch with an [[Project Apollo|Apollo]]-type [[Service module|Service Module]] to rendezvous and dock. The plan required upgrading the Space Shuttle and Titan IV to use lighter [[aluminium-lithium alloy]] propellant tanks. The plan never came to fruition, but in the 1990s the Shuttle was converted to aluminum-lithium tanks to rendezvous with the highly inclined orbit of the Russian [[Mir]] [[Space station|Space Station]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Titan-IV.stl|alt=Interactive 3D model of the Titan IV|thumb|274x274px|Interactive 3D model of the Titan IV, fully assembled (left) and in exploded view (right).]]\nThe [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan rocket family]] was established in October 1955 when the Air Force awarded the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] (later [[Martin-Marietta]], now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) a contract to build an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] ([[SM-68 Titan|SM-68]]). The resulting [[Titan I]] was the nation's first two-stage ICBM and complemented the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas ICBM]] as the second underground, vertically stored, silo-based ICBM. Both stages of the Titan I used [[liquid oxygen]] and [[RP-1]] as propellants.\n\nA subsequent version of the Titan family, the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]], was a two-stage evolution of the Titan I, but was much more powerful and used different propellants. Designated as LGM-25C, the Titan II was the largest missile developed for the USAF at that time. The Titan II had newly developed engines which used Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide as fuel and oxidizer in a self-igniting, [[hypergolic propellant]] combination, allowing the Titan II to be stored underground ready to launch. Titan II was the first Titan vehicle to be used as a space launcher.\n\nDevelopment of the space launch only [[Titan III]] began in 1964, resulting in the Titan IIIA, eventually followed by the Titan IV-A and IV-B.\n\n===Titan IV development===\nWhen development started in the mid-1980s, the Titan IV was intended to complement the space shuttle and fly only ten times. Under the original plan, the Titan IV would only be paired with Centaur stages and fly exclusively from LC-41 at Cape Canaveral. However, the [[Challenger Disaster]] in 1986 caused a renewed dependence on [[expendable launch system]]s, with the Titan IV program significantly expanded. At the time of its introduction, the Titan IV was the largest and most capable [[expendable launch vehicle]] used by the USAF.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/systems/dvic468.htm\n |title=Titan IV\n |publisher=USAF Air University |year=1996}}</ref>\n\nThe post-Challenger program added Titan IV versions with the [[Inertial Upper Stage]] (IUS) or no upper stages, increased the number of flights, and converted LC-40 at the Cape for Titan IV launches. As of 1991, almost forty total Titan IV launches were scheduled and a new, improved SRM ([[solid rocket motor]]) casing using lightweight composite materials was introduced.\n\n===Program cost===\nIn 1990, the Titan IV Selected Acquisition Report estimated the total cost for the acquisition of 65 Titan IV vehicles over a period of 16 years to US$18.3 billion (inflation-adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18.3|1990|r=1}}}} billion in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).<ref name=\"GAO NSIA-91-271\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/d19t9/144770.pdf|title=TITAN IV LAUNCH VEHICLE --- Restructured Program Could Reduce Fiscal Year 1992 Funding Needs|date=September 1991|publisher=US General Accounting Office|first=Nancy R.|last=Kingsbury}}</ref>\n\n===Cassini\u2013Huygens launch===\nIn October 1997, a Titan IV-B rocket launched ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens]]'', a pair of probes sent to [[Saturn]]. It was the only use of a Titan IV for a non-Department of Defense launch. ''Huygens'' landed on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] on January 14, 2005. ''Cassini'' remained in orbit around Saturn. The Cassini Mission ended on September 15, 2017 when the spacecraft was manoeuvered into Saturn's atmosphere to burn up.\n\n===Retirement===\nThe Titan family had become extremely expensive to fly by the 1990s and there were also growing safety concerns over its toxic propellants.  The [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]] (EELV) program resulted in the development of the [[Atlas V]], [[Delta IV]], and [[Delta IV Heavy]] launch vehicles, which replaced Titan IV and a number of other legacy launch systems. The new EELVs eliminated the use of hypergolic propellants, reduced costs, and are much more versatile than the legacy vehicles.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Surviving examples===\nIn 2014, the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], began a project to restore a Titan IV-B rocket.

Unusually for DoD launches, the Air Force invited civilian press to cover the launch, which became more of a story than intended when the booster exploded 101 seconds after liftoff. Investigation found that one of the two SRMs had burned through, resulting in the destruction of the vehicle in a similar manner as the earlier 34D-9 failure. An investigation found that an improper repair job was the cause of the accident.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/t/titan403a.html Titan 403A<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAfter Titan 34D-9, extensive measures had been put in place to ensure proper SRM operating condition, including X-raying the motor segments during prelaunch checks. The SRMs that went onto K-11 had originally been shipped to Cape Canaveral, where X-rays revealed anomalies in the solid propellant mixture in one segment. The defective area was removed by a pie-shaped cut in the propellant block. However, most of CSD's qualified personnel had left the program by this point and so the repair crew in question did not know the proper procedure. After replacement, they neglected to seal the area where the cut in the propellant block had been made. Post repair X-rays were enough for CC personnel to disqualify the SRMs from flight, but the SRMs were then shipped to Vandenberg and approved anyway. The result was a near-repeat of 34D-9; a gap was left between the propellant and SRM casing and another burn-through occurred during launch.\n\n===1998 IV-A electrical failure===\n1998 saw the failure of Titan K-17 with a Navy [[ELINT]] [[Mercury (satellite)]] from Cape Canaveral around 40 seconds into the flight. K-17 was several years old and the last Titan IV-A to be launched. The post-accident investigation showed that the booster had dozens of damaged or chafed wires and should never have been launched in that operating condition, but the Air Force had put extreme pressure on launch crews to meet program deadlines. The Titan's fuselage was filled with numerous sharp metal protrusions that made it nearly impossible to install, adjust, or remove wiring without it getting damaged. Quality control at Lockheed's Denver plant, where Titan vehicles were assembled, was described as \"awful\".\n\nThe proximal cause of the failure was an electrical short that caused a momentary power dropout to the guidance computer at T+39 seconds. After power was restored, the computer sent a spurious pitch down and yaw to the right command. At T+40 seconds, the Titan was traveling at near supersonic speed and could not handle this action without suffering a structural failure. The sudden pitch downward and resulting aerodynamic stress caused one of the SRMs to separate. The ISDS (Inadvertent Separation Destruct System) automatically triggered, rupturing the SRM and taking the rest of the launch vehicle with it. At T+45 seconds, the Range Safety Officer sent the destruct command to ensure any remaining large pieces of the booster were broken up.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/titr401a.htm Titan Centaur 401A<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAn extensive recovery effort was launched, both to diagnose the cause of the accident and recover debris from the classified satellite. All of the debris from the Titan had impacted offshore, between three and five miles downrange, and at least 30% of the booster was recovered from the sea floor. Debris continued to wash ashore for days afterward, and the salvage operation continued until October 15.\n\nThe Air Force had pushed for a \"launch on demand\" program for DOD payloads, something that was almost impossible to pull off especially given the lengthy preparation and processing time needed for a Titan IV launch (at least 60 days). Shortly before retiring in 1994, General [[Chuck Horner]] referred to the Titan program as \"a nightmare\". The 1998-99 schedule had called for four launches in less than 12 months. The first of these was Titan K-25 which successfully orbited an Orion SIGNIT satellite on May 9, 1998. The second was the K-17 failure, and the third was the K-32 failure.\n\n===Stage failure to separate===\nAfter a delay caused by the investigation of the previous failure, the 9 April 1999 launch of K-32 carried a DSP early warning satellite. The IUS second stage failed to separate, leaving the payload in a useless orbit. Investigation into this failure found that wiring harnesses in the IUS had been wrapped too tightly with electrical tape so that a plug failed to disconnect properly and prevented the two IUS stages from separating.\n\n===Programming error===\nThe fourth launch was K-26 on 30 April 1999, carrying a Milstar communications satellite. During the Centaur coast phase flight, the roll control thrusters fired open-loop until the RCS fuel was depleted, causing the upper stage and payload to rotate rapidly. On restart, the Centaur cartwheeled out of control and left its payload in a useless orbit. This failure was found to be the result of an incorrectly programmed equation in the guidance computer. The error caused the roll rate gyro data to be ignored by the flight computer.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of heavy lift launch systems]]\n* [[List of Titan

was the last of the [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan family of rockets]]. It was retired in 2005 due to its high cost of operation.  The final launch (B-30) from Cape Canaveral AFS occurred on 29 April 2005, and the final launch from Vandenberg AFB occurred on 19 October 2005.<ref>{{Cite APOD|title=The Last Titan |date=27 October 2005 |access-date=2008-09-20}}</ref> [[Lockheed Martin Space Systems]] built the Titan IVs near Denver, Colorado, under contract to the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]].<ref name=lm-ll />\n\nTwo Titan IV vehicles are currently on display.\n\n===Type identification===\nThe IV A (40nA) used boosters with steel casings, the IV B (40nB) used boosters with composite casings (the SRMU).\n\nType 401 used Centaur 3rd stage, type 402 used IUS 3rd stage. Other types (without 3rd stages) were 403, 404, and 405:\n\n* Type 403 was no upper stage, for lower-mass payloads to higher orbits from Vandenberg.<ref name=At>http://www.astronautix.com/t/index.html</ref>\n* Type 404 was no upper stage, for heavier payloads to low orbits, from Vandenberg.<ref name=At/>\n* Type 405 was no upper stage, for lower-mass payloads to higher-orbit from Cape Canaveral.<ref name=At/>\n\n==Vehicle description==\n[[Image:LR91-AJ-11 rocket engine - Thrust chamber.jpg|thumb|left|[[LR91-AJ-11]] rocket engine thrust chamber and injector]]\nThe Titan IV was developed to provide assured capability to launch [[Space Shuttle]]\u2013class payloads for the Air Force. The Titan IV could be launched with no [[Multistage rocket|upper stage]], the [[Inertial Upper Stage]] (IUS), or the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur upper stage]].\n\nThe Titan IV was made up of two large [[solid-fuel rocket|solid-fuel rocket boosters]] and a two-stage liquid-fueled core. The two storable liquid fuel core stages used [[Aerozine 50]] fuel and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] oxidizer. These propellants are [[hypergolic]] (ignite on contact) and are liquids at room temperature, so no tank insulation is needed. This allowed the launcher to be stored in a ready state for extended periods, but both propellants are extremely toxic.\n\nThe Titan IV could be launched from either coast: [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|SLC-40]] or [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41|41]] at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station near Cocoa Beach, Florida and at [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 4|SLC-4E]], at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base#Launch sites|Vandenberg Air Force Base launch sites]] 55 miles northwest of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] California. Launches to [[polar orbit]]s occurred from Vandenberg, with most other launches taking place at Cape Canaveral.\n\n===Titan IV-A===\nTitan IV-A flew with steel-cased solid rocket motors (SRMs) produced by Chemical Systems Division.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Titan IV-B===\nYears later{{when|date=November 2018}}, the Titan IV-B evolved from the Titan III family and was similar to the Titan 34D. While the launcher family had an extremely good reliability record in its first two decades, this changed in the 1980s with the loss of a Titan 34D in 1985 followed by the disastrous explosion of another in 1986 due to a [[solid rocket motor|SRM]] failure.\n\nThe Titan IV-B vehicle was intended to use the new composite-casing SRMs manufactured by Alliant Technologies. However, after numerous development problems the first few Titan IV-B launches flew with the old-style SRMs.\n\n===General characteristics===\n* Builder: Lockheed-Martin Astronautics\n* [[File:Bottom of First Stage of Titan IVB Rocket - LR87 rocket engine nozzles.jpg|alt=Bottom of two rocket nozzels and a partial view of the engines' pipes and machinery|thumb|Bottom of first stage of Titan IVB rocket]]Power Plant:\n** Stage 0 consisted of two solid-rocket motors.\n** Stage 1 used an LR87-AJ-11 liquid-propellant rocket engine.\n** Stage 2 used the LR91-AJ-11 liquid-propellant engine.\n** Optional upper stages included the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] and [[Inertial Upper Stage]].\n* Guidance System: A [[Ring laser gyroscope|ring laser gyro]] guidance system manufactured by [[Honeywell]].\n* Thrust:\n** Stage 0: Solid rocket motors provided 1.7 million pounds force (7.56&nbsp;MN) per motor at liftoff.\n** Stage 1: LR87-AJ-11 provided an average of 548,000 pounds force (2.44&nbsp;MN)\n** Stage 2: LR91-AJ-11 provided an average of 105,000 pounds force (467&nbsp;kN).\n** Optional Centaur (RL10A-3-3A) upper stage provided 33,100 pounds force (147&nbsp;kN) and the Inertial Upper Stage provided up to 41,500 pounds force (185&nbsp;kN).\n* Length: Up to {{convert|204|ft|m}}\n* Lift Capability:\n** Could carry up to {{convert|47800|lb|kg}} into low Earth orbit\n** up to {{convert|12700|lb|kg}} into a [[geosynchronous orbit]] when launched from Cape Canaveral AFS, Fla.;\n** and up to {{convert|38800|lb|kg}} into a [[Low Earth orbit|low Earth]] [[polar orbit]] when launched from Vandenberg AFB.\n** into geosynchronous orbit:\n*** with Centaur upper stage {{convert|12700|lb|kg}}\n*** with Inertial Upper Stage {{convert|5250|lb|kg}}\n* [[Payload fairing]]:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a259021.pdf |title=Analysis of Titan IV launch responsiveness |author=Michael Timothy Dunn |publisher=Air Force Institute of Technology|date=Dec 1992 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-07-08}}</ref>\n** Manufacturer: McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co\n** Diameter: {{convert|16.7|ft|m}}\n** Length: 56, 66, 76, or 86&nbsp;ft\n** Mass: 11,000, 12,000, 13,000, or 14,000&nbsp;lb\n** Design: 3 sections, isogrid structure, Aluminum\n* Maximum Takeoff Weight: Approximately 2.2 million pounds (1,000,000&nbsp;kg)\n* Cost: Approximately $250\u2013350 million, depending on launch configuration.\n* Date deployed: June 1989\n* Launch sites: Cape Canaveral AFS, Fla., and Vandenberg AFB, Calif.\n\n===Upgrades===\n====Solid Rocket Motor Upgrade test stand====\nIn 1988-89, The R. M. Parsons Company designed and built a full scale steel tower and deflector facility, which was used to test the Titan IV Solid Rocket Motor Upgrade (SRMU).  The launch and the effect of the SRMU thrust force on the space shuttle vehicle were modeled.  To evaluate the magnitude of the thrust force, the SRMU was connected to the steel tower through load measurement systems and launched in-place.  It was the first full-scale test conducted to simulate the effects of the SRMU on the main space shuttle vehicle.<ref>Chalhoub, Michel S., (1990) \"Dynamic Analysis, Design, and Execution of a Full Scale SRMU Test Stand,\" Parsons Engineering Report No. 027-90</ref>\n\n====Proposed aluminum-lithium tanks====\nIn the early 1980s, [[General Dynamics]] developed a plan to assembly a lunar landing spacecraft on-orbit. A Space Shuttle would lift a [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] into orbit and then a Titan IV rocket would lanch with an [[Project Apollo|Apollo]]-type [[Service module|Service Module]] to rendezvous and dock. The plan required upgrading the Space Shuttle and Titan IV to use lighter [[aluminium-lithium alloy]] propellant tanks. The plan never came to fruition, but in the 1990s the Shuttle was converted to aluminum-lithium tanks to rendezvous with the highly inclined orbit of the Russian [[Mir]] [[Space station|Space Station]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Titan-IV.stl|alt=Interactive 3D model of the Titan IV|thumb|274x274px|Interactive 3D model of the Titan IV, fully assembled (left) and in exploded view (right).]]\nThe [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan rocket family]] was established in October 1955 when the Air Force awarded the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] (later [[Martin-Marietta]], now part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) a contract to build an [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] ([[SM-68 Titan|SM-68]]). The resulting [[Titan I]] was the nation's first two-stage ICBM and complemented the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas ICBM]] as the second underground, vertically stored, silo-based ICBM. Both stages of the Titan I used [[liquid oxygen]] and [[RP-1]] as propellants.\n\nA subsequent version of the Titan family, the [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]], was a two-stage evolution of the Titan I, but was much more powerful and used different propellants. Designated as LGM-25C, the Titan II was the largest missile developed for the USAF at that time. The Titan II had newly developed engines which used Aerozine 50 and nitrogen tetroxide as fuel and oxidizer in a self-igniting, [[hypergolic propellant]] combination, allowing the Titan II to be stored underground ready to launch. Titan II was the first Titan vehicle to be used as a space launcher.\n\nDevelopment of the space launch only [[Titan III]] began in 1964, resulting in the Titan IIIA, eventually followed by the Titan IV-A and IV-B.\n\n===Titan IV development===\nWhen development started in the mid-1980s, the Titan IV was intended to complement the space shuttle and fly only ten times. Under the original plan, the Titan IV would only be paired with Centaur stages and fly exclusively from LC-41 at Cape Canaveral. However, the [[Challenger Disaster]] in 1986 caused a renewed dependence on [[expendable launch system]]s, with the Titan IV program significantly expanded. At the time of its introduction, the Titan IV was the largest and most capable [[expendable launch vehicle]] used by the USAF.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/systems/dvic468.htm\n |title=Titan IV\n |publisher=USAF Air University |year=1996}}</ref>\n\nThe post-Challenger program added Titan IV versions with the [[Inertial Upper Stage]] (IUS) or no upper stages, increased the number of flights, and converted LC-40 at the Cape for Titan IV launches. As of 1991, almost forty total Titan IV launches were scheduled and a new, improved SRM ([[solid rocket motor]]) casing using lightweight composite materials was introduced.\n\n===Program cost===\nIn 1990, the Titan IV Selected Acquisition Report estimated the total cost for the acquisition of 65 Titan IV vehicles over a period of 16 years to US$18.3 billion (inflation-adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|18.3|1990|r=1}}}} billion in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}).<ref name=\"GAO NSIA-91-271\">{{cite web |url=http://archive.gao.gov/d19t9/144770.pdf|title=TITAN IV LAUNCH VEHICLE --- Restructured Program Could Reduce Fiscal Year 1992 Funding Needs|date=September 1991|publisher=US General Accounting Office|first=Nancy R.|last=Kingsbury}}</ref>\n\n===Cassini\u2013Huygens launch===\nIn October 1997, a Titan IV-B rocket launched ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens]]'', a pair of probes sent to [[Saturn]]. It was the only use of a Titan IV for a non-Department of Defense launch. ''Huygens'' landed on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] on January 14, 2005. ''Cassini'' remained in orbit around Saturn. The Cassini Mission ended on September 15, 2017 when the spacecraft was manoeuvered into Saturn's atmosphere to burn up.\n\n===Retirement===\nThe Titan family had become extremely expensive to fly by the 1990s and there were also growing safety concerns over its toxic propellants.  The [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]] (EELV) program resulted in the development of the [[Atlas V]], [[Delta IV]], and [[Delta IV Heavy]] launch vehicles, which replaced Titan IV and a number of other legacy launch systems. The new EELVs eliminated the use of hypergolic propellants, reduced costs, and are much more versatile than the legacy vehicles.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Surviving examples===\nIn 2014, the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], began a project to restore a Titan IV-B rocket.

Unusually for DoD launches, the Air Force invited civilian press to cover the launch, which became more of a story than intended when the booster exploded 101 seconds after liftoff. Investigation found that one of the two SRMs had burned through, resulting in the destruction of the vehicle in a similar manner as the earlier 34D-9 failure. An investigation found that an improper repair job was the cause of the accident.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/t/titan403a.html Titan 403A<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAfter Titan 34D-9, extensive measures had been put in place to ensure proper SRM operating condition, including X-raying the motor segments during prelaunch checks. The SRMs that went onto K-11 had originally been shipped to Cape Canaveral, where X-rays revealed anomalies in the solid propellant mixture in one segment. The defective area was removed by a pie-shaped cut in the propellant block. However, most of CSD's qualified personnel had left the program by this point and so the repair crew in question did not know the proper procedure. After replacement, they neglected to seal the area where the cut in the propellant block had been made. Post repair X-rays were enough for CC personnel to disqualify the SRMs from flight, but the SRMs were then shipped to Vandenberg and approved anyway. The result was a near-repeat of 34D-9; a gap was left between the propellant and SRM casing and another burn-through occurred during launch.\n\n===1998 IV-A electrical failure===\n1998 saw the failure of Titan K-17 with a Navy [[ELINT]] [[Mercury (satellite)]] from Cape Canaveral around 40 seconds into the flight. K-17 was several years old and the last Titan IV-A to be launched. The post-accident investigation showed that the booster had dozens of damaged or chafed wires and should never have been launched in that operating condition, but the Air Force had put extreme pressure on launch crews to meet program deadlines. The Titan's fuselage was filled with numerous sharp metal protrusions that made it nearly impossible to install, adjust, or remove wiring without it getting damaged. Quality control at Lockheed's Denver plant, where Titan vehicles were assembled, was described as \"awful\".\n\nThe proximal cause of the failure was an electrical short that caused a momentary power dropout to the guidance computer at T+39 seconds. After power was restored, the computer sent a spurious pitch down and yaw to the right command. At T+40 seconds, the Titan was traveling at near supersonic speed and could not handle this action without suffering a structural failure. The sudden pitch downward and resulting aerodynamic stress caused one of the SRMs to separate. The ISDS (Inadvertent Separation Destruct System) automatically triggered, rupturing the SRM and taking the rest of the launch vehicle with it. At T+45 seconds, the Range Safety Officer sent the destruct command to ensure any remaining large pieces of the booster were broken up.<ref>[http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/titr401a.htm Titan Centaur 401A<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAn extensive recovery effort was launched, both to diagnose the cause of the accident and recover debris from the classified satellite. All of the debris from the Titan had impacted offshore, between three and five miles downrange, and at least 30% of the booster was recovered from the sea floor. Debris continued to wash ashore for days afterward, and the salvage operation continued until October 15.\n\nThe Air Force had pushed for a \"launch on demand\" program for DOD payloads, something that was almost impossible to pull off especially given the lengthy preparation and processing time needed for a Titan IV launch (at least 60 days). Shortly before retiring in 1994, General [[Chuck Horner]] referred to the Titan program as \"a nightmare\". The 1998-99 schedule had called for four launches in less than 12 months. The first of these was Titan K-25 which successfully orbited an Orion SIGNIT satellite on May 9, 1998. The second was the K-17 failure, and the third was the K-32 failure.\n\n===Stage failure to separate===\nAfter a delay caused by the investigation of the previous failure, the 9 April 1999 launch of K-32 carried a DSP early warning satellite. The IUS second stage failed to separate, leaving the payload in a useless orbit. Investigation into this failure found that wiring harnesses in the IUS had been wrapped too tightly with electrical tape so that a plug failed to disconnect properly and prevented the two IUS stages from separating.\n\n===Programming error===\nThe fourth launch was K-26 on 30 April 1999, carrying a Milstar communications satellite. During the Centaur coast phase flight, the roll control thrusters fired open-loop until the RCS fuel was depleted, causing the upper stage and payload to rotate rapidly. On restart the Centaur cartwheeled out of control and left its payload in a useless orbit. This failure was found to be the result of an incorrectly programmed equation in the guidance computer. The error caused the roll rate gyro data to be ignored by the flight computer.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of heavy lift launch systems]]\n* [[List of Titan launches]], Titan I, II, III & IV\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Titan IV}}\n* [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/space/factsheets/titan_ivb.htm USAF Titan IVB Fact Sheet]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080503143356/http://www.pr.afrl.af.mil/archive/video.html Titan IV Ignition Videos]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060929003140/http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/videos/launch/index.cfm Cassini Huygens Aboard a Titan IV-B Launch Videos]\n* [http://www.astronautix.com/craft/earccess.htm Early Lunar Access]\n\n{{Titan rockets}}\n{{USAF space vehicles}}\n{{Expendable launch systems}}\n{{US launch systems}}\n\n[[Category:Lockheed Martin]]\n[[Category:2005 in spaceflight]]\n[[Category:Titan (rocket family)]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_IV"}

He gained fame as a social reformer who campaigned against incompetence, privilege and [[nepotism]]. He was the founding editor of ''[[The Lancet]]'', a radical Member of Parliament (MP) and a celebrated coroner.\n\n== Life ==\nHe was born in [[Membury, Devon]], to a prosperous farmer and his wife. His father, Henry Wakley (1750\u201326 August 1842), inherited property, leased neighbouring land and became a large farmer by the standards of the day and a government Commissioner on the Enclosure of Waste Land. He was described as a 'just but severe parent' and, with his wife, had eleven children, eight sons and three daughters.<ref name = sprigge>{{cite book\n| last = Sprigge\n| first = Samuel Squire\n| title = The life and times of Thomas Wakley\n| location = London\n| publisher = Longman Green & Co\n| year = 1899\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8v0BAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Thomas was the youngest son, and attended the [[grammar school]] at [[Chard, Somerset|Chard]], then [[Taunton Grammar School]]. In his early teens, he was apprenticed to a Taunton [[apothecary]]. Young Wakley was a sportsman and a boxer: he fought bare-fisted in public houses.<ref name = brook>{{cite book\n| last = Brook\n| first = C\n| year = 1945\n| title = Battling surgeon\n| location = Strickland, Glasgow}}</ref>\n\nAfter a brief period at sea, he went to London, where he attended anatomy classes at St Thomas's Hospital, and he enrolled in the United Hospitals of [[St. Thomas's Hospital]] and [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's]].<ref name = sprigge/>{{rp|15}} The dominant personality at these two hospitals was Sir [[Astley Cooper]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (1768\u20131841). Wakley qualified as a [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|Member of the Royal College of Surgeons]] (MRCS) in 1817. A surgeon at 22, he set up in practice in [[Regent Street]] and married (1820) Miss Goodchild, whose father was a merchant and a governor of [[St Thomas' Hospital]]. They had three sons and a daughter, who died young. His eldest son, Henry Membury Wakley, became a [[barrister]] and sat as deputy coroner under his father. His youngest son, James Goodchild Wakley, and his middle son, Thomas Henry Wakley, became joint editors of ''The Lancet''.\n\n[[Image:Blue plaque Thomas Wakley.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Commemorative plaque outside Wakley's former residence in Bedford Square, London]]\n\nAll through his career, Wakley proved to be a man of aggressive personality, and his experiences had a sensational beginning. In August 1820 a gang of men (reputedly, the [[Arthur Thistlewood|Thistlewood gang]]) that had some imagined grievance against him burnt down his house and severely wounded him in a murderous assault. The whole affair is obscure. The assault may have been a follow-up to the [[Cato Street conspiracy]], whose supporters believed (wrongly) that the hangman was a surgeon.<ref name = brook />{{rp|24\u201332}} Wakley was indirectly accused by the insurance company, which had refused his claim, of setting fire to his house himself. He won his case against the company.\n\nWakley's death, on 16 May 1862 in [[Madeira]], was occasioned by [[pulmonary haemorrhage]] after a fall from a boat in the harbour.<ref name = jones>{{cite journal\n| title = Thomas Wakley, plagiarism, libel and the founding of The Lancet\n| last = Jones\n| first = R\n| journal = [[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]\n|date=October 2009\n| volume = 102\n| number = 10\n| pages = 404\u201310\n| doi=10.1258/jrsm.2009.090144| pmc = 2755341\n| pmid=19797597\n}}</ref><ref name = dnb>{{cite book\n| title = The concise DNB (Dictionary of National Biography)\n| volume = 1\n| publisher = Oxford University Press\n| page = 1351}}</ref> He had been declining in health for about ten years, and the symptoms are entirely consistent with [[tuberculosis]].<ref name = brook/>{{rp|494}}<ref name = jones/><ref name = dnb/> Wakley's three sons survived him, and the ''Lancet'' remained in Wakley hands for two more generations. His funeral was a very private affair, attendance restricted to family and close friends: the long-term consequences of his radicalism were eventually appreciated, at least to some extent. Wakley is interred in the catacombs of Kensal Green Cemetery (alcove 59, compartment 13 ) alongside his wife Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Goodchild, (alcove 59, compartment 16), who died three years earlier.<ref name=Paths>{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=102|accessdate=}}</ref> There is a [[blue plaque]] on his house in [[Bedford Square]], London, and further plaques in the grounds of the Harefield Hospital in Uxbridge, Land Farm in Membury, and Membury parish church .\n\n== ''Lancet'' years ==\nIn 1823, he started the now well-known medical weekly, ''[[The Lancet]]'', with [[William Cobbett]], [[Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet|William Lawrence]], [[James Wardrop]] and a libel lawyer as associates. It was extremely successful: by 1830, it had a circulation of about 4,000. In 1828, one of his accounts of medical negligence accused Bransby Cooper (the nephew of Sir [[Astley Cooper]], the General Surgeon) of incompetence in causing a patient immense suffering as he attempted to extract a bladder stone through a cut beneath the scrotum. Such operations were regularly completed in only a minute's time by excellent surgeons such as the previous century's [[William Cheselden]], but Cooper took more than an hour and was seen to have great difficulty in locating the stone. The magazine account led to a libel case, ''[[Cooper v Wakley]]'', which would raise the profile and popular prestige of Wakley and his magazine. The court found in Cooper's favor, but awarded him much smaller damages than requested, which was generally taken as an acknowledgment that Wakley's accusations of incompetence and nepotism were justified.<ref>{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Ruth|title=Death, Dissection, and the Destitute}}</ref>\n\nAt first, the editor of the ''Lancet'' was not named in the journal, but after a few weeks, rumours began to circulate. After the journal began printing the content of Sir Astley Cooper's lectures without permission, the great man paid a surprise visit to his former pupil to discover Wakley correcting the proofs of the next issue. Upon recognising each other, they fell immediately into laughter<ref>{{cite book| last = Burch| first = D| title = Digging up the dead: uncovering the life and times of an extraordinary surgeon| location = London\n| publisher = Chatto & Windus| year = 2007}}</ref> or perhaps an altercation.<ref>{{cite book| last = Hale-White | first = W| title = Great Doctors of the Nineteenth Century\n| location = London| publisher = Edward Arnold| year = 1935}}</ref> Either way, they reached an agreement that was mutually satisfactory.<ref name = sprigge />{{rp|85}}\n\nThe libel lawyer was certainly needed for a series of attacks on the jobbery in vogue among the medical practitioners of the day. In opposition to the hospital surgeons and physicians, he published reports of their lectures and exposed their malpractices. He had to fight a number of lawsuits, but they only increased his influence. He attacked the whole constitution of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] and obtained so much support from among the general body of the profession, now roused to a sense of the abuses that he exposed, that in 1827, a petition to Parliament resulted in a return being ordered of the public money granted to it.\n\n[[Image:Wakley-toon72.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Wakley as Jackdaw plucking feathers from the peacocks of his times. ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 1841]]\n\nWakley's campaigning was rough and outspoken:\n:[We deplore the] \"state of society which allows various sets of mercenary, goose-brained monopolists and charlatans to usurp the highest privileges.... This is the canker-worm which eats into the heart of the medical body\" Wakley, ''The Lancet'' 1838\u201339, '''1''', p2\u20133.\n\n:\"The Council of the College of Surgeons remains an irresponsible, unreformed monstrosity in the midst of English institutions \u2013 an antediluvian relic of all... that is most despotic and revolting, iniquitous and insulting, on the face of the Earth\". Wakley, ''The Lancet'' 1841\u201342, '''2''', p246.\n\nHe was especially severe on whomever he regarded as quacks. The English Homeopathic Association were \"an audacious set of quacks\" and its supporters \"noodles and knaves, the noodles forming the majority, and the knaves using them as tools\".<ref name = brook />{{rp|145}}\n\n=== London College of Medicine ===\nOne of Wakley's best ideas came in 1831, when a series of massive meetings were held to launch a rival to the Royal Colleges. Though successful, not eventually unsuccessful, and the LCM incorporated ideas that formed the basis of reforms in the charters of the main licensing bodies, the Apothecaries, the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians.\nFirstly, there was to be ''one Faculty'': the LCM was to include physicians, surgeons and general practitioners; teachers at private medical schools and naval surgeons would also be included. Secondly, the structure was to be democratic: there would be no restrictions by religion (e.g. the Anglican restrictions of Oxford and Cambridge Universities) or by institution (e.g. membership of hospitals). Its officers and Senate would be decided by annual ballot. The cost of diplomas would be set low; those already qualified would be eligible to become Fellows so, for instance, those qualified in Scotland would be received without re-examination. Appointments to official (public) positions were to be by merit, eliminating nepotism and the hand-placing of prot\u00e9g\u00e9es. All Fellows would carry the prefix 'Dr', removing artificial divisions between members.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the LCM did not succeed against the united opposition of the established Colleges and other institutions. Nevertheless, the strong case for reform had been made in the most public manner. Subsequent legislation and reforms in governing charters were, for many years, influenced by this campaign.<ref name = desmond>{{cite book\n| last = Desmond\n| first = A.\n| authorlink = Adrian Desmond\n| year = 1989\n| title = The politics of evolution: morphology, medicine, and reform in radical London\n| url = https://archive.org/details/politicsofevolut00adri\n| url-access = registration\n| location = Chicago}}</ref>{{rp|104\u20137}}\n\n=== Miscellany ===\nIn its early years, the ''Lancet'' also had other content of a non-medical kind. There was a [[chess]] column, the earliest regular chess column in any weekly periodical: ''The Chess Table''.<ref>Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1996. ''The Oxford companion to chess''. 2nd ed, Oxford. 'Newspaper columns', p271, which notes a column in the daily [[Liverpool Mercury]] which started in 1813.</ref> There were also occasional articles on politics, theatre reviews, biographies of non-medical persons, excerpts of material in other publications &c. None of that diminished its huge impact on surgery, hospitals and the Royal Colleges, which were opened up to public view as never before. Wakley also played a leading role in the reform of the London Veterinary College and the creation of the Society of Coroners. In addition to his work on The Lancet he also published a number of pamphlets and short guides, including \"The Mother's Medical Adviser\", published by Wilson and Company, New York, 1844.\n\n== Member of Parliament ==\nReform in the College of Surgeons was slow, and Wakley now set himself to rouse the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] from within. He became a radical candidate for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and in 1835 was returned for [[Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury]]; he retained his seat till 1852. Even after his departure, his work was largely responsible for the content of the Medical Act of 1858.<ref name = jones /> He spoke in the House of Commons against the [[Poor Laws]], police bills, newspaper tax and [[Lord's Day]] observance and for [[Chartism]], [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]], [[free trade]], [[Irish nationalism]] and, of course, medical reform.<ref name = desmond />{{rp|428}} All the topics were vigorously debated and fought over, for the 1830s was a turbulent decade; the origin of the difficulties lay in the massively expensive [[Napoleonic Wars]], and in the inherent injustice of the way British law and Parliament operated. The Chartist demands were 1. Universal suffrage for adult men 2. Annual Parliaments 3. Payment for members of Parliament 4. Abolition of property qualifications for candidates 5. Vote by ballot (i.e. secret voting) 6. Abolition of [[rotten boroughs]] (rough equalisation of electoral districts). Apart from annual Parliaments, but it took time. The effect was to give ordinary citizens a direct say in how the country was governed. Wakley was one of many campaigners; his influence was greater than most because he was now ''inside'' Parliament.\n\n[[Image:Old Wakley72.jpg|right|thumb|200px|<center>Wakley in old age.<br />''[[Illustrated London News]]'' 1862</center>]]\n\nAs an [[Anglican]] and a regular church-goer, Wakley's opposition to aspects of the Lord's Day Observance legislation was based not on [[secularism]] but on his sympathy for the ordinary man. In his day, men worked a full six days each week and could not shop on pay nights. If all shops closed for the whole of Sunday, it was clearly unfair to working men. Also, he advocated that places of education, such as museums and zoos, should be open to all on Sundays.<ref name = sprigge />{{rp|304}} The working week became five days long around 1960, and it was even later before shops were able to open on Sundays.\n\n== Medical coroner ==\nWakley also argued for medical coronerships, and when they were established, he was elected [[Coroner]] for West Middlesex in 1839. Consistent with his views, he held inquests into all sudden deaths, including deaths in police custody. He was indefatigable in upholding the interests of the working classes and advocating humanitarian reforms as well as in pursuing his campaign against medical restrictions and abuses, and he made the ''Lancet'' not only a professional organ but a powerful engine of social reform. During his term as coroner he held between 25,000 and 30,000 investigations, sometimes delegating responsibility to his son Henry Membury Wakley. Charles Dickens, a frequent guest at Wakley's dinner table, is said to have derived material for \"Oliver Twist\" from Wakley (inquest on Eliza Burgess, held St. Marylebone Workhouse, January 1840) and was juror on more than one Wakley inquest. Details of many of his cases are held in the reference sections of a number of north and west London reference and local history libraries under the collective title of \"Coroner Wakley's Casebook\" - a series of books published by CB Wakley between 2015 - 2017.\n\n=== Flogging ===\nWakley campaigned against [[flogging]] as a punishment for many years. Deaths from flogging in the [[British Army]] were not unknown and not surprising when one reads the details. Wakley was Coroner when Private James White, after committing a disciplinary offence, was subjected to 150 lashes of the [[cat-o'-nine-tails]] in the Seventh [[Hussars]] in 1846 and died a month later after symptoms of 'serious cardiac and pulmonary mischief' were followed by pleurisy and pneumonia. The army doctors, under direct pressure from the colonel of the regiment, signed the certificate saying 'cause of death was in no way connected with the corporal punishment'. Before burial, the vicar communicated with Wakley, who issued a warrant for an inquest. Evidence was given by the Army surgeons, by the hospital physician and orderlies and by independent experts. In the event, it was the evidence of [[Erasmus Wilson]], consulting surgeon the [[St Pancras Infirmary]], who made it clear that the flogging and the death were causally connected.<ref name = sprigge />{{rp|404}} The jury concurred and added a strongly worded rider that expressed their 'horror and disgust that the law of the land provided that the revolting punishment of flogging should be permitted upon British soldiers'. Sprigge added that it was not Wilson's able scientific arguments that convinced the jury, but it was his assertion that had it not been for the flogging, White would be alive. The Army Act of 1881 abolished flogging as a punishment.\n\n=== Adulteration of foodstuffs ===\nWakley's last campaigns were against the [[adulteration]] of foodstuffs. This was common in Wakley's day, and his opposition was significant in bringing about much-needed reforming legislation.<ref name = brook />{{rp|159\u201375}} To provide evidence, Wakley set up ''The Lancet Analytical and Sanitary Commission'', which provided 'records of the microscopical and chemical analyses of the solids and fluids consumed by all classes of the public'. The methods were devised by Wakley, Sir [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy]] and Dr [[Arthur Hill Hassall]], who was the Commissioner.\n\nThe first investigation showed that \"it is a fact that coffee is largely adulterated\".<ref>''The Lancet'', 4 January 1851</ref> Of 34 coffees, 31 were adulterated; the three exceptions were of higher price.  The main adulteration was [[chicory]], otherwise bean-flour, potato-flour or roasted corn was used. Moreover, it was found that chicory itself was usually adulterated. The ''Lancet'' published the names of the genuine traders and threatened the others with exposure if they failed to mend their ways. A second report (26 April 1851) actually carried out the threat. A third report showed that canister coffee was even more adulterated.

He gained fame as a social reformer who campaigned against incompetence, privilege and [[nepotism]]. He was the founding editor of ''[[The Lancet]]'', a radical Member of Parliament (MP) and a celebrated coroner.\n\n== Life ==\nHe was born in [[Membury, Devon]], to a prosperous farmer and his wife. His father, Henry Wakley (1750\u201326 August 1842), inherited property, leased neighbouring land and became a large farmer by the standards of the day and a government Commissioner on the Enclosure of Waste Land. He was described as a 'just but severe parent' and, with his wife, had eleven children, eight sons and three daughters.<ref name = sprigge>{{cite book\n| last = Sprigge\n| first = Samuel Squire\n| title = The life and times of Thomas Wakley\n| location = London\n| publisher = Longman Green & Co\n| year = 1899\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8v0BAAAAYAAJ}}</ref>{{rp|3}} Thomas was the youngest son, and attended the [[grammar school]] at [[Chard, Somerset|Chard]], then [[Taunton Grammar School]]. In his early teens, he was apprenticed to a Taunton [[apothecary]]. Young Wakley was a sportsman and a boxer: he fought bare-fisted in public houses.<ref name = brook>{{cite book\n| last = Brook\n| first = C\n| year = 1945\n| title = Battling surgeon\n| location = Strickland, Glasgow}}</ref>\n\nAfter a brief period at sea, he went to London, where he attended anatomy classes at St Thomas's Hospital, and he enrolled in the United Hospitals of [[St. Thomas's Hospital]] and [[Guy's Hospital|Guy's]].<ref name = sprigge/>{{rp|15}} The dominant personality at these two hospitals was Sir [[Astley Cooper]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (1768\u20131841). Wakley qualified as a [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|Member of the Royal College of Surgeons]] (MRCS) in 1817. A surgeon at 22, he set up in practice in [[Regent Street]] and married (1820) Miss Goodchild, whose father was a merchant and a governor of [[St Thomas' Hospital]]. They had three sons and a daughter, who died young. His eldest son, Henry Membury Wakley, became a [[barrister]] and sat as deputy coroner under his father. His youngest son, James Goodchild Wakley, and his middle son, Thomas Henry Wakley, became joint editors of ''The Lancet''.\n\n[[Image:Blue plaque Thomas Wakley.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Commemorative plaque outside Wakley's former residence in Bedford Square, London]]\n\nAll through his career, Wakley proved to be a man of aggressive personality, and his experiences had a sensational beginning. In August 1820 a gang of men (reputedly, the [[Arthur Thistlewood|Thistlewood gang]]) that had some imagined grievance against him burnt down his house and severely wounded him in a murderous assault. The whole affair is obscure. The assault may have been a follow-up to the [[Cato Street conspiracy]], whose supporters believed (wrongly) that the hangman was a surgeon.<ref name = brook />{{rp|24\u201332}} Wakley was indirectly accused by the insurance company, which had refused his claim, of setting fire to his house himself. He won his case against the company.\n\nWakley's death, on 16 May 1862 in [[Madeira]], was occasioned by [[pulmonary haemorrhage]] after a fall from a boat in the harbour.<ref name = jones>{{cite journal\n| title = Thomas Wakley, plagiarism, libel and the founding of The Lancet\n| last = Jones\n| first = R\n| journal = [[Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine]]\n|date=October 2009\n| volume = 102\n| number = 10\n| pages = 404\u201310\n| doi=10.1258/jrsm.2009.090144| pmc = 2755341\n| pmid=19797597\n}}</ref><ref name = dnb>{{cite book\n| title = The concise DNB (Dictionary of National Biography)\n| volume = 1\n| publisher = Oxford University Press\n| page = 1351}}</ref> He had been declining in health for about ten years, and the symptoms are entirely consistent with [[tuberculosis]].<ref name = brook/>{{rp|494}}<ref name = jones/><ref name = dnb/> Wakley's three sons survived him, and the ''Lancet'' remained in Wakley hands for two more generations. His funeral was a very private affair, attendance restricted to family and close friends: the long-term consequences of his radicalism were eventually appreciated, at least to some extent. Wakley is interred in the catacombs of Kensal Green Cemetery (alcove 59, compartment 13 ) alongside his wife Elizabeth, nee Goodchild, (alcove 59, compartment 16), who died three years earlier.<ref name=Paths>{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=102|accessdate=}}</ref> There is a [[blue plaque]] on his house in [[Bedford Square]], London, and further plaques in the grounds of the Harefield Hospital in Uxbridge, Land Farm in Membury, and Membury parish church .\n\n== ''Lancet'' years ==\nIn 1823, he started the now well-known medical weekly, ''[[The Lancet]]'', with [[William Cobbett]], [[Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet|William Lawrence]], [[James Wardrop]] and a libel lawyer as associates. It was extremely successful: by 1830, it had a circulation of about 4,000. In 1828, one of his accounts of medical negligence accused Bransby Cooper (the nephew of Sir [[Astley Cooper]], the General Surgeon) of incompetence in causing a patient immense suffering as he attempted to extract a bladder stone through a cut beneath the scrotum. Such operations were regularly completed in only a minute's time by excellent surgeons such as the previous century's [[William Cheselden]], but Cooper took more than an hour and was seen to have great difficulty in locating the stone. The magazine account led to a libel case, ''[[Cooper v Wakley]]'', which would raise the profile and popular prestige of Wakley and his magazine. The court found in Cooper's favor, but awarded him much smaller damages than requested, which was generally taken as an acknowledgment that Wakley's accusations of incompetence and nepotism were justified.<ref>{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Ruth|title=Death, Dissection, and the Destitute}}</ref>\n\nAt first, the editor of the ''Lancet'' was not named in the journal, but after a few weeks, rumours began to circulate. After the journal began printing the content of Sir Astley Cooper's lectures without permission, the great man paid a surprise visit to his former pupil to discover Wakley correcting the proofs of the next issue. Upon recognising each other, they fell immediately into laughter<ref>{{cite book| last = Burch| first = D| title = Digging up the dead: uncovering the life and times of an extraordinary surgeon| location = London\n| publisher = Chatto & Windus| year = 2007}}</ref> or perhaps an altercation.<ref>{{cite book| last = Hale-White | first = W| title = Great Doctors of the Nineteenth Century\n| location = London| publisher = Edward Arnold| year = 1935}}</ref> Either way, they reached an agreement that was mutually satisfactory.<ref name = sprigge />{{rp|85}}\n\nThe libel lawyer was certainly needed for a series of attacks on the jobbery in vogue among the medical practitioners of the day. In opposition to the hospital surgeons and physicians, he published reports of their lectures and exposed their malpractices. He had to fight a number of lawsuits, but they only increased his influence. He attacked the whole constitution of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] and obtained so much support from among the general body of the profession, now roused to a sense of the abuses that he exposed, that in 1827, a petition to Parliament resulted in a return being ordered of the public money granted to it.\n\n[[Image:Wakley-toon72.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Wakley as Jackdaw plucking feathers from the peacocks of his times. ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 1841]]\n\nWakley's campaigning was rough and outspoken:\n:[We deplore the] \"state of society which allows various sets of mercenary, goose-brained monopolists and charlatans to usurp the highest privileges.... This is the canker-worm which eats into the heart of the medical body\" Wakley, ''The Lancet'' 1838\u201339, '''1''', p2\u20133.\n\n:\"The Council of the College of Surgeons remains an irresponsible, unreformed monstrosity in the midst of English institutions \u2013 an antediluvian relic of all... that is most despotic and revolting, iniquitous and insulting, on the face of the Earth\". Wakley, ''The Lancet'' 1841\u201342, '''2''', p246.\n\nHe was especially severe on whomever he regarded as quacks. The English Homeopathic Association were \"an audacious set of quacks\" and its supporters \"noodles and knaves, the noodles forming the majority, and the knaves using them as tools\".<ref name = brook />{{rp|145}}\n\n=== London College of Medicine ===\nOne of Wakley's best ideas came in 1831, when a series of massive meetings were held to launch a rival to the Royal Colleges. Though successful, not eventually unsuccessful, and the LCM incorporated ideas that formed the basis of reforms in the charters of the main licensing bodies, the Apothecaries, the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians.\nFirstly, there was to be ''one Faculty'': the LCM was to include physicians, surgeons and general practitioners; teachers at private medical schools and naval surgeons would also be included. Secondly, the structure was to be democratic: there would be no restrictions by religion (e.g. the Anglican restrictions of Oxford and Cambridge Universities) or by institution (e.g. membership of hospitals). Its officers and Senate would be decided by annual ballot. The cost of diplomas would be set low; those already qualified would be eligible to become Fellows so, for instance, those qualified in Scotland would be received without re-examination. Appointments to official (public) positions were to be by merit, eliminating nepotism and the hand-placing of prot\u00e9g\u00e9es. All Fellows would carry the prefix 'Dr', removing artificial divisions between members.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the LCM did not succeed against the united opposition of the established Colleges and other institutions. Nevertheless, the strong case for reform had been made in the most public manner. Subsequent legislation and reforms in governing charters were, for many years, influenced by this campaign.<ref name = desmond>{{cite book\n| last = Desmond\n| first = A.\n| authorlink = Adrian Desmond\n| year = 1989\n| title = The politics of evolution: morphology, medicine, and reform in radical London\n| url = https://archive.org/details/politicsofevolut00adri\n| url-access = registration\n| location = Chicago}}</ref>{{rp|104\u20137}}\n\n=== Miscellany ===\nIn its early years, the ''Lancet'' also had other content of a non-medical kind. There was a [[chess]] column, the earliest regular chess column in any weekly periodical: ''The Chess Table''.<ref>Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1996. ''The Oxford companion to chess''. 2nd ed, Oxford. 'Newspaper columns', p271, which notes a column in the daily [[Liverpool Mercury]] which started in 1813.</ref> There were also occasional articles on politics, theatre reviews, biographies of non-medical persons, excerpts of material in other publications &c. None of that diminished its huge impact on surgery, hospitals and the Royal Colleges, which were opened up to public view as never before. Wakley also played a leading role in the reform of the London Veterinary College and the creation of the Society of Coroners. In addition to his work on The Lancet he also published a number of pamphlets and short guides, including \"The Mother's Medical Adviser\", published by Wilson and Company, New York, 1844.\n\n== Member of Parliament ==\nReform in the College of Surgeons was slow, and Wakley now set himself to rouse the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] from within. He became a radical candidate for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] and in 1835 was returned for [[Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury]]; he retained his seat till 1852. Even after his departure, his work was largely responsible for the content of the Medical Act of 1858.<ref name = jones /> He spoke in the House of Commons against the [[Poor Laws]], police bills, newspaper tax and [[Lord's Day]] observance and for [[Chartism]], [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]], [[free trade]], [[Irish nationalism]] and, of course, medical reform.<ref name = desmond />{{rp|428}} All the topics were vigorously debated and fought over, for the 1830s was a turbulent decade; the origin of the difficulties lay in the massively expensive [[Napoleonic Wars]], and in the inherent injustice of the way British law and Parliament operated. The Chartist demands were 1. Universal suffrage for adult men 2. Annual Parliaments 3. Payment for members of Parliament 4. Abolition of property qualifications for candidates 5. Vote by ballot (i.e. secret voting) 6. Abolition of [[rotten boroughs]] (rough equalisation of electoral districts). Apart from annual Parliaments, but it took time. The effect was to give ordinary citizens a direct say in how the country was governed. Wakley was one of many campaigners; his influence was greater than most because he was now ''inside'' Parliament.\n\n[[Image:Old Wakley72.jpg|right|thumb|200px|<center>Wakley in old age.<br />''[[Illustrated London News]]'' 1862</center>]]\n\nAs an [[Anglican]] and a regular church-goer, Wakley's opposition to aspects of the Lord's Day Observance legislation was based not on [[secularism]] but on his sympathy for the ordinary man. In his day, men worked a full six days each week and could not shop on pay nights. If all shops closed for the whole of Sunday, it was clearly unfair to working men. Also, he advocated that places of education, such as museums and zoos, should be open to all on Sundays.<ref name = sprigge />{{rp|304}} The working week became five days long around 1960, and it was even later before shops were able to open on Sundays.\n\n== Medical coroner ==\nWakley also argued for medical coronerships, and when they were established, he was elected [[Coroner]] for West Middlesex in 1839. Consistent with his views, he held inquests into all sudden deaths, including deaths in police custody. He was indefatigable in upholding the interests of the working classes and advocating humanitarian reforms as well as in pursuing his campaign against medical restrictions and abuses, and he made the ''Lancet'' not only a professional organ but a powerful engine of social reform. During his term as coroner he held between 25,000 and 30,000 investigations, sometimes delegating responsibility to his son Henry Membury Wakley. Charles Dickens, a frequent guest at Wakley's dinner table, is said to have derived material for \"Oliver Twist\" from Wakley (inquest on Eliza Burgess, held St. Marylebone Workhouse, January 1840) and was juror on more than one Wakley inquest. Details of many of his cases are held in the reference sections of a number of north and west London reference and local history libraries under the collective title of \"Coroner Wakley's Casebook\" - a series of books published by CB Wakley between 2015 - 2017.\n\n=== Flogging ===\nWakley campaigned against [[flogging]] as a punishment for many years. Deaths from flogging in the [[British Army]] were not unknown and not surprising when one reads the details. Wakley was Coroner when Private James White, after committing a disciplinary offence, was subjected to 150 lashes of the [[cat-o'-nine-tails]] in the Seventh [[Hussars]] in 1846 and died a month later after symptoms of 'serious cardiac and pulmonary mischief' were followed by pleurisy and pneumonia. The army doctors, under direct pressure from the colonel of the regiment, signed the certificate saying 'cause of death was in no way connected with the corporal punishment'. Before burial, the vicar communicated with Wakley, who issued a warrant for an inquest. Evidence was given by the Army surgeons, by the hospital physician and orderlies and by independent experts. In the event, it was the evidence of [[Erasmus Wilson]], consulting surgeon the [[St Pancras Infirmary]], who made it clear that the flogging and the death were causally connected.<ref name = sprigge />{{rp|404}} The jury concurred and added a strongly worded rider that expressed their 'horror and disgust that the law of the land provided that the revolting punishment of flogging should be permitted upon British soldiers'. Sprigge added that it was not Wilson's able scientific arguments that convinced the jury, but it was his assertion that had it not been for the flogging, White would be alive. The Army Act of 1881 abolished flogging as a punishment.\n\n=== Adulteration of foodstuffs ===\nWakley's last campaigns were against the [[adulteration]] of foodstuffs. This was common in Wakley's day, and his opposition was significant in bringing about much-needed reforming legislation.<ref name = brook />{{rp|159\u201375}} To provide evidence, Wakley set up ''The Lancet Analytical and Sanitary Commission'', which provided 'records of the microscopical and chemical analyses of the solids and fluids consumed by all classes of the public'. The methods were devised by Wakley, Sir [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy]] and Dr [[Arthur Hill Hassall]], who was the Commissioner.\n\nThe first investigation showed that \"it is a fact that coffee is largely adulterated\".<ref>''The Lancet'', 4 January 1851</ref> Of 34 coffees, 31 were adulterated; the three exceptions were of higher price.  The main adulteration was [[chicory]], otherwise bean-flour, potato-flour or roasted corn was used. Moreover, it was found that chicory itself was usually adulterated. The ''Lancet'' published the names of the genuine traders and threatened the others with exposure if they failed to mend their ways. A second report (26 April 1851) actually carried out the threat. A third report showed that canister coffee was even more adulterated. Investigations of sugar, [[Black pepper|pepper]], bread, tobacco and tea followed, then finally the purity of the [[water supply]]. The first Adulteration Act became law in 1860, the second in 1872. The Sale of Food and Drugs Acts of 1875 and 1879 followed. All was achieved by Wakley and his associates.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite DNB|wstitle=Wakley, Thomas}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Wakley\n | first = Thomas\n | title = The Lancet, in two volumes\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8v0BAAAAYAAJ\n | accessdate = \n | edition = \n | year = 1841\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{Hansard-contribs | mr-thomas-wakley | Thomas Wakley }}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-bef | before = [[Robert Spankie]]<br />[[Thomas Slingsby Duncombe]] }}\n{{s-ttl\n | title = Member of Parliament for [[Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Finsbury]]\n | years = [[1835 United Kingdom general election|1835]]\u2013[[1852 United Kingdom general election|1852]]\n | with  = [[Thomas Slingsby Duncombe]]\n}}\n{{s-aft | after = [[Thomas Challis]]<br />[[Thomas Slingsby Duncombe]] }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wakley, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1795 births]]\n[[Category:1862 deaths]]\n[[Category:People educated at Taunton Grammar School]]\n[[Category:People from East Devon District]]\n[[Category:British magazine founders]]\n[[Category:Burials at Kensal Green Cemetery]]\n[[Category:English surgeons]]\n[[Category:English male journalists]]\n[[Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Medical journal editors]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1835\u20131837]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1837\u20131841]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1841\u20131847]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1847\u20131852]]\n[[Category:Academic journal editors]]\n[[Category:British coroners]]\n[[Category:Infanticide]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLife:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: nee \u2192  n\u00e9e", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wakley"}

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture.

The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]].

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

These missions occasionally provoked reactions, sometimes hostile, from behind the Iron Curtain. On April 8, 1950, Soviet [[Lavochkin La-11]] fighters shot down a Lyautey-based PB4Y-2 Privateer (BUNO 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liep\u0101ja, Latvia with the loss of all ten aircrew<ref name=\"StaHypo1\">{{Cite web|title = History Of VQ-2.

As this unit demonstrated its value to the Navy, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) and the Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) came to realize that a dedicated aircraft was a necessity. \n\nBy 1952, the VP community had not had much success with the [[Martin P4M Mercator|P-4M-1 Mercator]]  that it had deployed to Morocco due to maintenance issues arising from its nineteen airframe total production run. The rest of the VP community found easier maintenance with the Lockheed P2V Neptunes deployed in theater because that airframe had been adopted as the VP standard asset. The maritime patrol commanders removed them from frontline service at Lyautey in favor of the Neptune.  Washington subsequently decided to reconfigure all but one P4M-1 as P4M-1Qs and permanently assign them to the Naval Communications Units established at NPU and its sister unit at Sangley Point, Philippines.\n\nHaving lost an aircraft and lives to hostile Soviet action, the aircrew appreciated defensive threat of the 20mm cannons in the nose and tail along with the twin .50 Cal machine guns in the dorsal turret. They also liked the added takeoff and combat speed of the two [[Allison J33-A-10A]] turbojet engines mounted in the aft of the [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360-20A Wasp Major]] radial's nacelles<ref name=\"East\">East, Don C.</ref>. \n\nIn 1953, with the conversion and deployment of the P4M-1Q, NPU needed  an administrative identity as part of the Naval Air Force Atlantic (AIRLANT) structure and Airborne Early Warning Squadron TWO (VW-2) at NAS Patuxent River became the command into which NPU was folded as VW-2 DET A. Since VW-2 Det A's mission began to diverge greatly from the parent unit's VW mission, the Navy decided to establish dedicated squadrons for the Fleet Air Reconnaissance mission. One was to be formed from VW-2 Det A and the other would be formed from its siter unit at Sangley, VW-1 Det A.\n\n===Establishment===\n\nVQ-2 was commissioned as [[Electronic countermeasure|Electronic Countermeasures]] Squadron TWO (ECMRON TWO) on September 1, 1955 to provide the United States with an improved defense posture. The squadron took over VW-2 DET A's spcaes and hangar at NAS Port Lyautey.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Fleet Air  Reconnaissance Squadron TWO|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/vq-2.htm|website = www.globalsecurity.org|accessdate = 2015-11-06}}</ref> Through the 1950s, VQ-2 would continue to fly missions throughout the European Theater operating from Cyprus, Germany, Libya, Turkey, and the United Kingdom. At commissioning, Commander Morris L. Kalin led a total complement of 24 officers and 78 enlisted men<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\n[[File:Martin P4M Mercator VQ-2 06.09.56.jpg|thumb|left|P4M-1Q Mercator of VQ-2 electronics reconnaissance squadron in September 1956 - note extra radar 'bulges' on this variant.]]\n[[File:P2V-5 NAS Jacksonville 1952.jpg|thumb|left|P2V-5 with nose turret in 1952. The Lyautey P2V-5Fs had additional turbojets mounted on nacelles where the rockets are in this photo.]]\nThe squadron continued using the six P4M-1Qs as mission aircraft. In addition, they obtained three [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-5F and one P2V-3 Neptunes]]. The P2V-5Fs were reconfigured onsite from the standard maritime reconnaissance to similar electronic suites as the P-4Ms. Of note, the P2v-5Fs had the same armament configuration as the P4Ms, and their dash speed capability came from [[Westinghouse J34]]-WE-34 turbojets mounted on their own nacelles outboard the [[Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone|Wright R-3350-32W Cyclone Turbo-compound]] radials. The squadron used the P2V-3 for pilot training and logistics, since it was not configured for electronic reconnaissance (this became a standard squadron practice when possible; using a \"bare bones airframe of one of its models for training and logistics)<ref name=\"East\" />. The four Neptunes would serve alongside the Mercators until 1960.\n\nTo give the squadron a ship-based capability allowing its assets to travel with the battle group, in September 1956, a new and faster [[Carrier-based aircraft|carrier-capable]] [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A3D-1Q Skywarrior]] was delivered to the squadron. The A3D-1Q was a reconfigured A3D-1 with the bombay closed and an electronic reconnaissance suite installed similar to those of the P4M-1Q and P2V-5F<ref name=\"Francillon\">Francillon</ref><ref name=\"Heinemann\">Heinemann</ref>. The Whale was carrier-capable and had a crew of four<ref name= \"Winchester\">Winchester 2006, p. 75.</ref>. The squadron also received an A3D-1 which it use like the P2V-3<ref name=\"East\" />. With the high tempo of operations and depot-level maintenance for the three models back in the continental United States (CONUS), it is unsurprising that on 1 June 1957, the command had three P4M-1Q,, two A3D-1Q, two P2V-5F, one A3D-1, and one P2V-3 reported in its table of organization (TOE)<ref name=\"East\" />.\n\nThe [[1958 Lebanon crisis|Lebanon Crisis in 1958]] on 15 July 1958, saw a p4M-1Q and aircrew shift south from Incirlik to fly out of Beirut while the US Marines and US Army were deployed there at the behest of [[Camille Chamoun]], the President. VQ-2 operated out of [[Beirut Airport]] through the remainder of the summer and into the fall, departing with the withdrawal of US forces after stabilization in October 1958.\n\n===Homeport Change===\n\nAs a result of the Pact of Madrid, signed on 23 September 1953 by [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] and the [[United States]], the US pledged  to furnish [[foreign aid|economic]] and [[military aid]] to Spain. The United States, in turn, was to be permitted to construct and to utilize air and naval bases on Spanish territory ([[Naval Station Rota]], [[Mor\u00f3n Air Base]], [[Torrej\u00f3n Air Base]], and [[Zaragoza Air Base]]). By 1959, the base at Rota and its airfield had been completed to satisfy the US Navy's aviation needs. Due to its newer facilities, the Navy decided to move VQ-2 to Rota.\n\nThe relocation of the squadron to Rota began in late 1958 into the first days of 1959. The shift of the squadron CO, XO, and department heads (DHs) was completed by 14 January 1959, but it would take another year to transfer all command assets to Rota<ref name=\"East\" />. All assets at Lyautey had to be surveyed, packed up, and moved. \n\nDuring this evolution, five seven-seat A3D-2Q aircraft arrived to replace the four-seat A3D-1Qs. These new aircraft had the bulkhead between the  cockpit and the bomb bay removed, the bomb bay sealed, and three more seats and equipment added in the former bay.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"East\" />. This unarmed version (the tail gun had been removed<ref name=\"Francillon\" />) brought an increase in capability to the community.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the eleven aircrew fatalities and three aircraft in three mishaps:\n# On 6 January 1958, at the end of a ferry flight from Port Lyautey, via Lajes, Azores and Bermuda to [[NAS Norfolk]], Virginia, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124373)<ref name='VPNavy'>{{Cite web|title = VQ-2 Mishaps|url =https://www.vpnavy.com/vq2_mishap.html|website = www.vpnavy.com|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref> lost an engine on approach.

All four aircrew aboard were killed.\n\n==1960s==\n\nWhile keeping the alphanumeric designation VQ-2, EMCRON TWO was renamed Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron TWO (FAIRECONRON TWO) on January 1, 1960. Its sister squadron, [[VQ-1]] was similarly renamed. On 14 January 1960, with all equipment and personnel out of Lyautey, VQ-2 officially transferred to Naval Station. \n\nThe Navy had recognized that the maintenance costs of the aging, worn P4M-1Q and P2V-5F airframes were increasingly more expensive to maintain, and these planes needed replacement. Washington opted for a larger, more capable aircraft, the [[EC-121 Warning Star|Lockheed WV-2Q Warning Star]]. The \"Willie Victors,\" unarmed like the A3D-2Qs<ref name=\":0\" />, could carry a crew of twenty-six. On 26 February 1960, the first two WV-2Q arrived. By the end of the first quarter in 1960, 31 March, VQ-2'aircraft inventory were five A3D-2Q, three P2V-5F, two P4M-1Q, and two WV-2Q. The P2V-5F and P4M-1Q aircraft were soon to be phased out as all hands quickly adapted to the A3D-2Q and WV-2Q airframes. Meanwhile, the\u00b7squadron continued its business of airborne electronic reconnaissance. By the summer of 1960, the Mercators and Neptunes were gone.\n\nOn 18 September 1962, the Department of Defense (DoD) initiated its Tri-Service Aircraft Designation System which replaced the 1922 USN Aircraft Designation System. The new unified system for designating all US military aircraft was a ''Type/Model/Series'' (T/M/S).<ref name=\"TMS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.info/usmilav/aircraft.html|title=Current Designations of U.S. Military Aircraft|website = www.designation-systems.info|accessdate = 2020-03-08}}</ref>. With this change, the A3D-2Q became the EA-3B and the WV-2Q became the EC-121M<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n[[File:Lockheed EC-121M VQ-2.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy Lockheed EC-121M Warning Star of VQ-2.]]\n\n===In Theater Operations===\n\nIn response to the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], VQ-2 flew missions in West Germany along the border with Czechoslovakia and East Germany as well as their routine missions into the Baltic. By now these were being carried out primarily by the WV-2Qs with A3D-2Qs filling in as needed<ref name=\":0\" />. Tensions continued to increase as the Kennedy administration and its NATO allies responded to Soviet moves in Europe.\n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis was [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 186|Cyprus Crisis in 1964]] saw an increase in international tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. This led to an increase in EC-121M and EA-3B presence in the Levant<ref name=\"East\"/>. Afterwards, a series of eastern Mediterranean crises provided ample opportunities for VQ-2 to perform timely reconnaissance<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />. A major factor in the more direct tactical reconnaissance shipboard role was the rapidly growing and modernizing Soviet Navy that established a continuous presence in the Mediterranean, concurrent with the Cyprus Crisis. In response to these crises, VQ-2 started operating EA-3B detachments aboard a Mediterranean-based carriers like her sister squadron, VQ-1 did in the Pacific. In January of 1965, the first planes went aboard the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS Saratoga (CVA-60)]]. Detachments aboardupport to the Mediterranean deployed carriers.\n\nWhile operating in Vietnam and the Philippines, the political tensions in the Middle East and North Africa were building. In June of 1967, armed conflict erupted into the [[Six-Day War]] where Israel defeated its enemies. The loss of the [[USS Liberty]] during the war at the hands of the IDF reaffirmed the relative safety of using aircraft for fleet reconnaissance<ref name=\"East\" />. This incident kept the high tempo of operations in the Eastern Mediterranean despite a cessation of strife in Cyprus. The coup in Libya in 1969 combined with the ever increasing presence of the Soviet Navy to counter the presence of the NATO navies in the Mediterranean kept the command operating at a high tempo.\n\nAs the decade came to a close, VQ-2 found itself operating all over Europe from various NATO bases, from US Sixth Fleet carriers, as well as in Southeast Asia.\n\n===Cuban Missile Crisis===\n\nIn October 1962 the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] developed. Since the Navy had no comparable reconnaissance assets available in CONUS<ref name=\"StaHypo\" />, VQ-2 deployed a number of EA-3B and an EC-121M aircraft to [[NAS Key West]] to provide those services around Cuba. After this major superpower crisis was defused, the assets returned to Spain. The squadron's rapidity and flexibility demonstrated in Florida<ref name=\"VQH\" /> kept it very busy when it returned to Europe where it resumed missions in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and central Europe. \n===Vietnam===\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the squadron deployed detachments to augment  VQ-1's support of US Navy operations in and around Vietnam under CINCPACFLT operational control. In late summer 1965, VQ-2 established DET ALFA at [[NAS Cubi Point]], Philippines. Sorties were routinely flown by EA-3Bs and EC-121Ms into the theater to support US Navy combat operations in Vietnam. After it sister squadron, [[VQ-1]], established its DET BRAVO flying from [[Da Nang]] Air Base in South Vietnam in 1966, VQ-2 EA-3Bs joined them operating almost exclusively from there as VQ-2 DET BRAVO<ref name=\"East\" />. From both locations, VQ-2 aircraft provided continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] and [[Gulf of Tonkin]]<ref name=\"East\" />. As combat operations from CTF 77 on [[Yankee Station]] into North Vietnamese airspace increased, VQ-2 joined VQ-1 in deploying EA-3Bs to the attack carriers in theater. VQ-2 ceased operations from Da Nang in 1969, but continued to deploy to the aircraft carriers and Cubi Point.\n\n===Aircraft/Aircrew Losses and Mishaps===\n\nOver the course of the decade, VQ-2 suffered the fifty-two aircrew fatalities and five aircraft in seven mishaps.\n# Two days after the official move, on 16 January 1960, P4M-1Q (BUNO 124365) crashed into a mountainside at 9,000 feet om approach to crashed on approach to [[Incirlik Air Base|Incirlik AFB]]. The crew had been flying in to relieve the detachment that had been operating there<ref name=\":0\" />.

Tensions came to a head with the 1973 Yom Kippur War. This tempo lasted through the decade despite the overall drawdown of the US military after Vietnam.\n\nOn 9 July 1974, the squadron suffered another A-3 loss when its VIP transport-configured A-3, a TA-3B (BUNO 144863)<ref name=\"A3BUNO\" /> crashed at [[Naples International Airport|Capodichino]] in Naples, Italy on approach. All eight aircrew perished in the crash.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the 1970s, the command suffered no aircraft losses. In 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] saw an increased US Presence in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. In response, the Navy maintained at least one carrier battle group in the vicinity of the Gulf. VQ-2 shared the manning of carrier and Diego Garcia detachments.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"East\" /> This manning would continue until the third phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1982.\n\n==1980s==\n[[File:EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on USS Saratoga (CV-60) c1986.jpg|left|thumb|EA-3B VQ-2 after landing on [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|USS]] Saratoga inn 1986.]]\nAs VQ-2 entered the mid-1980s, the frenzied pace of operations including [[Operation Mole Cricket 19]](Arab-Israel [[Beqaa Valley|Beqaa]] War), and continuing with 1982 - 1983 [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|Beirut Crisis]] with the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing|U.S. Marine barracks bombing]], and the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] December [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|1983 air strike into Lebanon]], allowed little leisure time for the squadron.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nVQ-2 was awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]] for participation in the Beirut evacuation and operations in the vicinity of [[Libya]] during [[1986 United States bombing of Libya|Operation El Dorado Canyon]], 12\u201317 April 1986.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 25 January 1987, an EA-3B crashed on the USS Nimitz killing all seven crew members.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the summer of 1990, the squadron provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of 2000 non-combatant personnel from war-stricken [[Liberia]] in [[operation Sharp Edge]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Lockheed EP-3E Orion (ARIES), USA - Navy AN2094464.jpg|thumb|EP-3E of VQ-2 based at Rota, Spain, seen arriving for [[Royal International Air Tattoo|RIAT]] '92.]]\nFrom August 1990 to April 1991, VQ-2 provided combat reconnaissance during operations [[Gulf War|Desert Shield/Desert Storm]], Proven Force, and [[Operation Provide Comfort|Provide Comfort]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 29 June 1991, the first EP-3E Aries II aircraft arrived in Rota and on 20 September 1991, the squadron retired the EA-3B Skywarrior the same year.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStarting in July 1992, VQ-2 flew support missions with Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]], Provide Promise, Sharp Guard, Joint Endeavor, Decisive Endeavor, and Deliberate Guard providing combat reconnaissance and intelligence to [[NATO]] and [[United Nations]] forces in the Former [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs of 1997, VQ-2 operated four EP-3E Aries II aircraft and two [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3C Orion]] aircraft from its home-base at Rota and two-plane detachment at [[Souda Bay|Naval Support Activity Souda Bay, Crete]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn March 1997, VQ-2 provided electronic reconnaissance during the evacuation of non-combatant personnel from [[Albania]] following unrest from a failed [[Pyramid scheme|pyramid savings scheme]] during [[Operation Silver Wake]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==2000s==\nVQ-2 relocated from NS Rota, Spain, to NAS Whidbey Island, effective 1 September 2005.

{"title_page": "William Keogh", "text_new": "{{short description|Irish lawyer, politician and judge}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n[[File:William Nicholas Keogh caricature by Harry Furniss.jpg|thumb|Caricature  of William Keogh by [[Harry Furniss]].]]\n'''William Nicholas Keogh''' [[Privy Council of Ireland|PC]] (1817\u2013 30 September 1878) was an unpopular and controversial Irish politician and judge, whose name became a byword in Ireland  for betraying one's political principles.\n\n== Background ==\nHe was born in [[Galway]], son of William Keogh, clerk of the Crown for [[Kilkenny]],  and his wife Mary ffrench. He went to Dr Huddard's school in Dublin, and graduated from the [[University of Dublin]]: he  was [[called to the Bar]] in 1840, and became  [[Queen's Counsel]]  in 1849. No-one has ever questioned his intellectual abilities. He was a superb speaker both in public and private and  he  founded a well-known debating society, the Tail-end Club. He  published several books on law, politics and literature, including a book on  the prose writings of  [[John Milton]].   Despite his later reputation for eccentricity and bad temper, as a young man he was considered  to be the best of company:  genial, good humoured and a superb conversationalist. He joined the [[Connaught]] circuit where he rapidly acquired a large practice, due  less to any great legal skill than to his eloquence and  impressive presence; these gifts soon turned him towards politics.<ref>Fitzgerald, John Donoghue   \"William Nicholas Keogh\"  ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900'' Vol. 31</ref>\n\nHe married Kate Rooney, daughter of a  Galway surgeon, in  1841; they had one son, and a daughter Mary,  who married James Murphy, judge of the [[High Court of Justice in Ireland|High Court]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921''  John Murray, London, 1926</ref>\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1847 Keogh was elected MP for [[Athlone (UK Parliament constituency)|Athlone]]. In 1851 he was one of the  founders  of the [[Catholic Defence Association]]; he was re-elected for  Athlone in 1852. In the latter year he helped found the [[Independent Irish Party]], which was  popularly known as \"the Pope's Brass Band\".  The new party  was pledged to repeal  the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act]] and to further the cause of  tenant reform, and most crucially, its  members gave an explicit promise  not to take office but  instead to hold the balance of power at Westminster. In this they were at first successful, helping to vote out the administration of [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], who was replaced by [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]].\n\nWithin months of promising  not to take office, Keogh (together with  his colleague [[John Sadleir]]) made the decision which destroyed his reputation  in his own lifetime and long  after his death: he accepted office in the Aberdeen Government, becoming first   [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]], and  then [[Attorney-General for Ireland]] in 1855. His decision was seen by the Irish electorate  as an unforgivable betrayal of a solemn pledge and his name,  along with Sadleir's, entered the Irish political vocabulary. Even a century later, [[John A. Costello]] turned down the offer by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] to make him a [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] judge on the ground that he \"did not wish face charges of being another Sadleir or Keogh\".<ref>McCullagh, David  ''The Reluctant Taoiseach'' Gill and Macmillan   Dublin  2010  p.277</ref>\n\n== Judicial career ==\nIn 1856 Keogh was appointed a judge of the [[Court of Common Pleas (Ireland)|Irish Court of Common Pleas]]. On the  grounds of legal ability no one  could dispute that he was highly  qualified for judicial office,  but unfortunately his conduct as a judge did nothing to restore  the damage to his reputation. He was a man of strong opinions, which were  always expressed forcefully, and his hot temper led to frequent quarrels with counsel. On one occasion [[Peter O'Brien, 1st Baron O'Brien|Peter O'Brien]], the future [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]], was threatened with removal from Court. It must be said in Keogh's defence that, having recovered his temper, he apologised to O'Brien in open Court  in the presence of the assembled Bar.<ref>''Reminisces of Lord O'Brien'' 1910</ref> This suggests that Keogh, who as a young man had been famed for geniality and good humour, was not acting out of malice, but rather  suffering from stress  and ill-health.\n\nKeogh's conduct of the \"Fenian Trials\" of 1865\u20136 and the savage sentences which were handed down  were much criticised, although his defenders said  that [[Charles Kickham]] at least had been treated as leniently as the evidence allowed. In non-political cases he had a good reputation: if not a profound lawyer, he had the ability to quickly see the essential point of a case.<ref>DNB</ref>\n\nFurther  damage was done to his reputation by  his decision on the [[Galway]] election petition case of 1872, where [[William Le Poer Trench]], the unsuccessful candidate, petitioned to unseat the winner, [[John Philip Nolan]], on the grounds of intimidation and undue pressure from the Catholic clergy. According to Delaney, Keogh's judgment took nine hours to read and \"was delivered in an extremely biased manner and did nothing to enhance the reputation of the judiciary\".<ref>Delaney, V.T.H.  \"Christopher Palles\" Allen Figgis, Dublin, 1960</ref> Much of it seems to have been a diatribe against the Catholic hierarchy, which struck the audience as  coming very strangely from a former member of the \"Pope's Brass Band\".

On foot of the judgment the Government's Law officers, much to their own embarrassment, felt obliged to prosecute [[Patrick Duggan]], [[Bishop of Clonfert]], and  were clearly relieved when he was acquitted.\n\n==Friendship with Father Healy==\nKeogh developed a close friendship with [[Father Healy of Little Bray]] and the two used to dine at each other's houses every week. Father Healy's broad mindedness and sense of humour struck a chord with the unconventional judge.

His public  clash with Peter O'Brien, which probably occurred in 1877, suggests that his bad temper was the result of stress rather than ill nature, and the reminisces of Oliver Burke demonstrate  that he could still show considerable  charm and good humour on occasion.<ref>Burke, Oliver ''Anecdotes of the Connaught Circuit''  Dublin 1885</ref> In 1878 he travelled abroad to [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]  in an effort to regain his health, but on 19 August 1878 he attacked his valet with a straight razor in a fit of delirium,<ref>''The Political Year-Book'', (1878), ed.

He went to Dr Huddard's school in Dublin, and graduated from the [[University of Dublin]]: he  was [[called to the Bar]] in 1840, and became  [[Queen's Counsel]]  in 1849. No-one has ever questioned his intellectual abilities. He was a superb speaker both in public and private and  he  founded a well-known debating society, the Tail-end Club. He  published several books on law, politics and literature, including a book on  the prose writings of  [[John Milton]].   Despite his later reputation for eccentricity and bad temper, as a young man he was considered  to be the best of company:  genial, good humoured and a superb conversationalist. He joined the [[Connaught]] circuit where he rapidly acquired a large practice, due  less to any great legal skill than to his eloquence and  impressive presence; these gifts soon turned him towards politics.<ref>Fitzgerald, John Donoghue   \"William Nicholas Keogh\"  ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900'' Vol. 31</ref>\n\nHe married Kate Rooney , daughter of a  Galway surgeon, in  1841; they had one son, and a daughter Mary,  who married James Murphy, judge of the [[High Court of Justice in Ireland|High Court]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921''  John Murray, London, 1926</ref>\n\n== Political career ==\nIn 1847 Keogh was elected MP for [[Athlone (UK Parliament constituency)|Athlone]]. In 1851 he was one of the  founders  of the [[Catholic Defence Association]]; he was re-elected for  Athlone in 1852. In the latter year he helped found the [[Independent Irish Party]], which was  popularly known as \"the Pope's Brass Band\".  The new party  was pledged to repeal  the [[Ecclesiastical Titles Act]] and to further the cause of  tenant reform, and most crucially, its  members gave an explicit promise  not to take office but  instead to hold the balance of power at Westminster. In this they were at first successful, helping to vote out the administration of [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]], who was replaced by [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]].\n\nWithin months of promising  not to take office, Keogh (together with  his colleague [[John Sadleir]]) made the decision which destroyed his reputation  in his own lifetime and long  after his death: he accepted office in the Aberdeen Government, becoming first   [[Solicitor-General for Ireland]], and  then [[Attorney-General for Ireland]] in 1855. His decision was seen by the Irish electorate  as an unforgivable betrayal of a solemn pledge and his name,  along with Sadleir's, entered the Irish political vocabulary. Even a century later, [[John A. Costello]] turned down the offer by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] to make him a [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] judge on the ground that he \"did not wish face charges of being another Sadleir or Keogh\".<ref>McCullagh, David  ''The Reluctant Taoiseach'' Gill and Macmillan   Dublin  2010  p.277</ref>\n\n== Judicial career ==\nIn 1856 Keogh was appointed a judge of the [[Court of Common Pleas (Ireland)|Irish Court of Common Pleas]]. On the  grounds of legal ability no one  could dispute that he was highly  qualified for judicial office,  but unfortunately his conduct as a judge did nothing to restore  the damage to his reputation. He was a man of strong opinions, which were  always expressed forcefully, and his hot temper led to frequent quarrels with counsel. On one occasion [[Peter O'Brien, 1st Baron O'Brien|Peter O'Brien]], the future [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]], was threatened with removal from Court. It must be said in Keogh's defence that, having recovered his temper, he apologised to O'Brien in open Court  in the presence of the assembled Bar.<ref>''Reminisces of Lord O'Brien'' 1910</ref> This suggests that Keogh, who as a young man had been famed for geniality and good humour, was not acting out of malice, but rather  suffering from stress  and ill-health.\n\nKeogh's conduct of the \"Fenian Trials\" of 1865\u20136 and the savage sentences which were handed down  were much criticised, although his defenders said  that [[Charles Kickham]] at least had been treated as leniently as the evidence allowed.
