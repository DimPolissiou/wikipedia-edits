{"title_page": "Rhinns of Kells", "text_new": "[[File:RhinnsofKells.jpg|500px|thumb]]\n\nThe '''Rhinns of Kells''' are a range of hills in the [[Galloway Hills]] range, part of the [[Southern Uplands]] of [[Scotland]]. The most easterly of  three parallel ridges, they are neighboured to the west by the [[Range of the Awful Hand]] and the [[Dungeon Hills]]. The eastern portion of the [[Minnigaff Hills]] range lies immediately southwest of the range. In total, these four ranges are part of the [[Galloway Forest Park]]. The hills of the range are the second highest of the Galloway Hills with the highest summit, [[Corserine]], reaching 814m. The ridge is located entirely within [[Dumfries and Galloway]], with the base of the western flanks being a western boundary of the county. \n\nAlthough distant, the ridge is paralleled to the east by the [[A713 road]]. This road provides access to the majority of the starting points for walking the ridge. Most commonly, these are Garryhorn Farm (the turnoff a few hundred metres north of [[Carsphairn]]) and Forrest Estate (accessed much further south a few kilometres north of [[St. John's Town of Dalry]]). Unclassified roads, one of which follows the [[Southern Upland Way]], and two others near [[Clatteringshaws Loch]] can be utilised, but are much less common due to the difficult terrain when ascending or descending from the south. <ref>Turnbull R. (2019) Walking the Galloway Hills: 35 Wild Mountain Walks Including the Merrick. Cicerone: Kendal.</ref> Due to the linear nature of the ridge, a full traverse will normally require two modes of transport at either end if to be walked in a day. Shorter, circular rounds from Forrest Lodge taking in the southern section of the ridge are, as a result, more popular. <ref>https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/galloway/corserine.shtml</ref> A bus service by Houston's Minicoaches runs from [[Dalmellington]] to [[Castle Douglas]] via Carsphairn and St. John's Town of Dalry multiple times a day. <ref>https://bustimes.org/services/520-dalmellington-castle-douglas</ref> \n\n===The Hills===\n------------------------------------\nThe hills of the range are the second highest of the Galloway Hills with the highest hill, Corserine, reaching 814m. The terrain is similar to that of the Range of the Awful Hand in that the walking is predominantly along flat grass with occasional boggy sections, however the drops to the west and east are high, steep and often craggy. The ridge south of Corserine, which is named the Rhinns of Kells on [[Ordnance Survey|OS]] maps - ignoring the northern portion, is notably rougher.\n\nFrom north to south (ignoring all satellite ridges other than [[Cairnsgarroch]]) the hills are: \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

With the increased focus on green pest management and [[integrated pest management]], as well as the increase in global travel and shared living accommodations, bed bugs have become more prevalent. Detecting bed bugs is a complicated process because insects have the ability to hide almost anywhere. Detection dogs help solve this problem because of their size, speed, and sense of smell. Detection dogs use their unique ability to smell in parts per trillion in order to track bed bugs in every phase of their life cycle. They can find bugs in places humans cannot such as wall voids, crevices, and furniture gaps. Dogs are also a safer alternative to pesticide use. If detection dogs can find out exactly where bed bugs are located, they can minimize the area that needs to be sprayed.\n\nThe [[National Pest Management Association]] released their \"Bed Bug Best Management Practices\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bedbugbmps.org/|title=NPMA Bed Bugs Best Management Practices website home page|year=2011|publisher=[[National Pest Management Association]]|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref>  in 2011 which outlines the minimum recommendations regarding not only treatment, but the certification and use of bed bug detection canines.  The NPMA's Best Management Practices emphasizes the importance of having bed bug detection dog teams certified by third party organizations who are not affiliated to the trainer or company that sold the canine.\n\nScientists at the [[University of Kentucky]] reviewed studies on bed bug detection dogs and concluded that although expensive for operators, they are a reliable source as long as they undergo the proper training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icup.org.uk/reports%5CICUP859.pdf|title=BATTLING BED BUGS IN THE USA|last=Potter|first=Michael F|last2=Romero|first2=Alvero|publisher=International Conference on Urban Pests|last3=Haynes|first3=Kenneth F|accessdate=5 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306000336/http://icup.org.uk/reports/icup859.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2016}}</ref> In another study, detection dogs had a 97.5% correct positive indication rate on identifying [[Bed bug (insect)|bed bug]]s (''[[Cimex lectularius]]'') and their eggs \u2013 with zero false positives \u2013 all while accurately distinguishing them from [[carpenter ant]]s, [[Blattella germanica|cockroach]]es, and [[Reticulitermes flavipes|termites]].

With the increased focus on green pest management and [[integrated pest management]], as well as the increase in global travel and shared living accommodations, bed bugs have become more prevalent. Detecting bed bugs is a complicated process because insects have the ability to hide almost anywhere. Detection dogs help solve this problem because of their size, speed, and sense of smell. Detection dogs use their unique ability to smell in parts per trillion in order to track bed bugs in every phase of their life cycle. They can find bugs in places humans cannot such as wall voids, crevices, and furniture gaps. Dogs are also a safer alternative to pesticide use. If detection dogs can find out exactly where bed bugs are located, they can minimize the area that needs to be sprayed.\n\nThe [[National Pest Management Association]] released their \"Bed Bug Best Management Practices\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bedbugbmps.org/|title=NPMA Bed Bugs Best Management Practices website home page|year=2011|publisher=[[National Pest Management Association]]|accessdate=5 July 2014}}</ref>  in 2011 which outlines the minimum recommendations regarding not only treatment, but the certification and use of bed bug detection canines.  The NPMA's Best Management Practices emphasizes the importance of having bed bug detection dog teams certified by third party organizations who are not affiliated to the trainer or company that sold the canine.\n\nScientists at the [[University of Kentucky]] reviewed studies on bed bug detection dogs and concluded that although expensive for operators, they are a reliable source as long as they undergo the proper training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icup.org.uk/reports%5CICUP859.pdf|title=BATTLING BED BUGS IN THE USA|last=Potter|first=Michael F|last2=Romero|first2=Alvero|publisher=International Conference on Urban Pests|last3=Haynes|first3=Kenneth F|accessdate=5 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306000336/http://icup.org.uk/reports/icup859.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2016}}</ref> In another study, detection dogs had a 97.5% correct positive indication rate on identifying [[Bed bug (insect)|bed bug]]s (''[[Cimex lectularius]]'') and their eggs \u2013 with zero false positives \u2013 all while accurately distinguishing them from [[carpenter ant]]s, [[Blattella germanica|cockroach]]es, and [[Reticulitermes flavipes|termites]].

two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia.

Many supporters of Taiwan independence believe that Taiwan, under the formal name of the \"Republic of China\", is already an independent country from China, under the formal name of the \"People's Republic of China\".\n***Political parties: [[Pan-Green Coalition]] ([[Democratic Progressive Party]], [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], [[Taiwan Independence Party]]), [[New Power Party]], [[Taiwan Statebuilding Party]]\n***Advocacy groups: Keep Taiwan Free (Taiwanese organisation), [[World United Formosans for Independence]]\n***Claimed territories: Taiwan (Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, Taiwan-Penghu, Taoyuan)\n***Area of claimed territories: Roughly 36,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of claimed territories: Roughly 24,000,000 people\n{{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}} '''[[Kinmen|Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan)]] (Kinmen)''' \u2014 Independence movement{{See also|Kinmen|Taiwan independence movement#The issue of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang)}}\n\n* Ethnic group: Kinmenese people, [[Taiwanese people]]\n**Proposed unification with a proposed state: {{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}}[[File:Flag of World Taiwanese Congress.svg|22px|border]] Kinmen County, Republic of Taiwan\n***Movement: Kinmen-Taiwan unification movement, [[Taiwan independence movement]], [[Taiwanese nationalism]]\n****Note: [[Kinmen]] is currently ruled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]], so it and Taiwan are ''de facto'' already united. However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

Kinmen is viewed by the Chinese (PRC) government as a place where Chinese (re)unification experiments can be conducted, in preparation for the ultimate goal of annexing the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]]. The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC. Most members and supporters of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] in Taiwan, led by the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang)]], support this movement, whether vaguely or strongly.\n\n* Note: Some proponents of this movement also advocate for the annexation (into China) of {{flagdeco|MNG}} [[Mongolia]] and other regions that were previously administered by the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131911), the Qing dynasty having been a [[History of China|historical regime of China]] preceding both the PRC and the ROC.\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under a hypothetical \"New China\"'''\n\n{{See also|Chinese democracy movement|Chinese economic reform|Neoauthoritarianism (China)}}\n\nThis is another variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement. It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia.

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]].

However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country. Some young people in Kinmen identify as Taiwanese but the Kinmen County government is pushing a [[Chinese unification|pro-(re)unification]] (with the PRC) agenda.\n***Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n=== Various Chinese (re)unification movements ===\n{{Main|Chinese unification|Greater China|Chinese Civil War}}\n{{See also|Two Chinas|1992 Consensus|Anti-Secession Law}}{{flagdeco|TWN}} '''[[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] ({{flagdeco|Kaohsiung}} KH, {{flagdeco|Kinmen}} Kinmen, {{flagdeco|Lienchiang County}} Matsu, {{flagdeco|New Taipei}} NT, {{flagdeco|Taichung}} TC, {{flagdeco|Tainan}} TN, {{flagdeco|Taipei}} TP, {{flagdeco|Taiwan Province}}TW-{{flagdeco|Penghu County}}PH, {{flagdeco|Taoyuan}}TY)''' \u2014 Irredentist movement\n{{See also|One-China policy|Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan, China}}\n\n* Ethnic group: [[Chinese people]], [[Taiwanese people]]\n**Proposed unification with a foreign state: {{flagdeco|CHN}}{{flagdeco|HKG}}{{flagdeco|MAC}}{{flagdeco|TWN}} [[Greater China]] ([[China]])\n***Movement: [[Chinese unification|Chinese (re)unification movement]], [[Chinese nationalism]]\n**** Note: This movement, [[Irredentism|irredentist]] in nature, is strongly pushed by the [[Government of China|Chinese (PRC) government]] and forms a [[One-China policy|core component]] of the country's [[Politics of China|national]] and [[Foreign relations of China|foreign policy]].

Kinmen is viewed by the Chinese (PRC) government as a place where Chinese (re)unification experiments can be conducted, in preparation for the ultimate goal of annexing the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]]. The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC. Most members and supporters of the [[Pan-Blue Coalition]] in Taiwan, led by the [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang)]], support this movement, whether vaguely or strongly.\n\n* Note: Some proponents of this movement also advocate for the annexation (into China) of {{flagdeco|MNG}} [[Mongolia]] and other regions that were previously administered by the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131911), the Qing dynasty having been a [[History of China|historical regime of China]] preceding both the PRC and the ROC.\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under a hypothetical \"New China\"'''\n\n{{See also|Chinese democracy movement|Chinese economic reform|Neoauthoritarianism (China)}}\n\nThis is another variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement. It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

The north pole of the [[ecliptic]] is in Draco.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}} Draco is [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]] (that is, never setting), and can be seen all year from northern latitudes.\n\n== Features ==\n[[Image:DracoCC.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The constellation Draco as it can be seen by the naked eye]]\n\n=== Stars ===\n{{main|List of stars in Draco}}\n\n[[Thuban]] (\u03b1 Draconis) was the northern [[pole star]] from 3942 BC, when it moved farther north than Theta Bo\u00f6tis, until 1793 BC. The [[Egyptian Pyramids]] were designed to have one side facing north, with an entrance passage geometrically aligned so that Thuban would be visible at night.{{sfn|Staal|1988|pp=239\u2013240}} Due to the effects of [[Axial precession (astronomy)|precession]], it will again be the pole star around the year AD 21000.<!-- not cited to Ridpath & Tirion 2001 --> It is a blue-white giant star of magnitude 3.7, 309 light-years from Earth. The traditional name of Alpha Draconis, Thuban, means \"head of the serpent\".{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}\n\nThere are three stars under magnitude 3 in Draco. The brighter of the three, and the brightest star in Draco, is [[Gamma Draconis]], traditionally called Etamin or Eltanin. It is an orange giant star of magnitude 2.2, 148 light-years from Earth. The [[aberration of starlight]] was discovered in 1728 when [[James Bradley]] observed Gamma Draconis. Nearby [[Beta Draconis]], traditionally called Rastaban, is a yellow giant star of magnitude 2.8, 362 light-years from Earth. Its name shares a meaning with Thuban, \"head of the serpent\".{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}\n\nDraco is home to several double stars and binary stars. [[Eta Draconis]] (the proper name is Athebyne<ref name=\"IAU-LSN\">{{cite web | url=https://www.iau.org/public/themes/naming_stars/ | title=Naming Stars |publisher=IAU.org |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>) is a [[double star]] with a yellow-hued primary of magnitude 2.8 and a white-hued secondary of magnitude 8.2 located south of the primary. The two are separated by 4.8 [[arcsecond]]s.<ref name=\"French\"/> [[Mu Draconis]], traditionally called Alrakis, is a [[binary star]] with two white components. Magnitude 5.6 and 5.7, the two components orbit each other every 670 years. The Alrakis system is 88 light-years from Earth. [[Nu Draconis]] is a similar binary star with two white components, 100 light-years from Earth. Both components are of magnitude 4.9 and can be distinguished in a small amateur telescope or a pair of binoculars. [[Omicron Draconis]] is a double star divisible in small telescopes. The primary is an orange giant of magnitude 4.6, 322 light-years from Earth. The secondary is of magnitude 7.8. [[Psi Draconis]] (the proper name is Dziban<ref name=\"IAU-LSN\"/>) is a binary star divisible in binoculars and small amateur telescopes, 72 light-years from Earth. The primary is a yellow-white star of magnitude 4.6 and the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 5.8. [[16 Draconis]] and [[17 Draconis]] are part of a triple star 400 light-years from Earth, divisible in medium-sized amateur telescopes. The primary, a blue-white star of magnitude 5.1, is itself a binary with components of magnitude 5.4 and 6.5. The secondary is of magnitude 5.5 and the system is 400 light-years away.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}} [[20 Draconis]] is a binary star with a white-hued primary of magnitude 7.1 and a yellow-hued secondary of magnitude 7.3 located east-northeast of the primary. The two are separated by 1.2 arcseconds at their maximum and have an orbital period of 420 years. As of 2012, the two components are approaching their maximum separation.<ref name=\"French\"/> [[39 Draconis]] is a triple star 188 light-years from Earth, divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue star of magnitude 5.0, the secondary is a yellow star of magnitude 7.4, and the tertiary is  a star of magnitude 8.0; the tertiary appears to be a close companion to the primary. [[40 Draconis]] and [[41 Draconis]] are a binary star divisible in small telescopes. The two orange dwarf stars are 170 light-years from Earth and are of magnitude 5.7 and 6.1.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}\n\n[[R Draconis]] is a red [[Mira variable|Mira-type variable star]] with a period of about 8 months. Its average minimum magnitude is approximately 12.4, and its average maximum magnitude is approximately 7.6. It was discovered to be a variable star by [[Hans Geelmuyden]] in 1876.<ref name=\"MacRobert\"/>\n\nThe constellation contains the star recently named [[Kepler-10]], which has been confirmed to be orbited by [[Kepler-10b]], the smallest rocky Earth-sized planet yet detected outside of the [[Solar System]].\n\n=== Deep-sky objects ===\nOne of [[deep-sky object]]s in Draco is the [[Cat's Eye Nebula]] (NGC 6543), a [[planetary nebula]] approximately 3,000 light-years away that was discovered by English astronomer [[William Herschel]] in 1786.<ref name=\"French\"/> It is 9th magnitude and was named for its appearance in the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], though it appears as a fuzzy blue-green disk in an amateur telescope.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}} NGC 6543 has a very complex shape due to gravitational interactions between the components of the [[multiple star]] at its center, the progenitor of the nebula approximately 1,000 years ago.{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}} It is located 9.6 [[arcminute]]s away from the [[north ecliptic pole]] to the west-northwest. It is also related to [[IC 4677]], a nebula that appears as a bar 1.8 arcminutes to the west of the Cat's Eye nebula. In long-term exposures, IC 4677 appears as a portion of a ring surrounding the planetary nebula.<ref name=\"French\"/>\n\nThere are several faint [[galaxy|galaxies]] in Draco, one of which is the [[lenticular galaxy]] [[NGC 5866]] (sometimes considered to be [[Messier Object 102]]) that bears its name to a small [[NGC 5866 group|group]] that also includes the spiral galaxies [[NGC 5879]] and [[NGC 5907]]. Another is the [[Draco Dwarf Galaxy]], one of the least luminous galaxies with an [[absolute magnitude]] of \u22128.6 and a diameter of only about 3,500 [[light year]]s, discovered by Albert G. Wilson of [[Lowell Observatory]] in 1954. Another dwarf galaxy found in this constellation is [[PGC 39058]]. [[File:PGC 39058.jpg|thumb|[[PGC 39058]], a dwarf galaxy found within the Draco constellation&nbsp;\u2013 picture taken by ESA/Hubble & NASA.]]\n\nDraco also features several [[interacting galaxy|interacting galaxies]] and [[galaxy cluster]]s. One such massive cluster is [[Abell 2218]], located at a distance of 3 billion light-years ([[redshift]] 0.171). It acts as a [[gravitational lensing|gravitational lens]] for even more distant background galaxies, allowing astronomers to study those galaxies as well as Abell 2218 itself; more specifically, the lensing effect allows astronomers to confirm the cluster's mass as determined by [[x-ray]] emissions. One of the most well-known [[interacting galaxy|interacting galaxies]] is [[Arp 188]], also called the \"Tadpole Galaxy\". Named for its appearance, which features a \"tail\" of stars 280,000 light-years long, the Tadpole Galaxy is at a distance of 420 million light-years (redshift 0.0314). The tail of stars drawn off the Tadpole Galaxy appears blue because the gravitational interaction disturbed [[nebula|clouds of gas]] and sparked [[star formation]].{{sfn|Wilkins|Dunn|2006}}\n\n[[Q1634+706]] is a [[quasar]] that holds the distinction of being the most distant object usually visible in an amateur telescope. At magnitude 14.4, it appears star-like, though it is at a distance of 12.9 billion light-years. The light of Q1634+706 has taken 8.6 billion years to reach Earth, a discrepancy attributable to the [[expansion of the universe]].<ref name=\"French\"/>\n\nThe [[Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall]], possibly the largest known structure in the universe, covers a part of the southern region of Draco.\n\n=== Mythology ===\n\n[[File:Sidney Hall - Urania's Mirror - Draco and Ursa Minor.jpg|thumb|left|Draco coils around the north celestial pole, as depicted in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London c.1825]]\n''Draco'' is one of the 48 constellations listed in Ptolemy's ''[[Almagest]]'' (2nd century), adopted from the list by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] (4th century BC).<ref>Thomas L.

[[Hercules (constellation)|The constellation of Hercules]] is depicted near Draco.{{sfn|Ridpath|Tirion|2001|pp=142-143}}\n\nIn Greco-Roman legend, Draco was a dragon killed by the goddess [[Minerva]] and tossed into the sky upon his defeat. The dragon was one of the [[Gigantes]], who battled the Olympic gods for ten years. As Minerva threw the dragon, it became twisted on itself and froze at the cold [[North Celestial Pole]] before it could right itself.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}}\n\nSometimes, Draco is represented as the Titan son of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], [[Typhon]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=237}}\n\nTraditional Arabic astronomy does not depict a dragon in modern-day Draco, which is called the [[Mother Camels]]. Instead, two [[hyena]]s, represented by [[Eta Draconis]] and [[Zeta Draconis]] are seen attacking a baby camel (a dim star near [[Beta Draconis]]), which is protected by four female camels, represented by [[Beta Draconis]], [[Gamma Draconis]], [[Nu Draconis]], and [[Xi Draconis]]. The nomads who own the camels are camped nearby, represented by a cooking tripod composed of [[Upsilon Draconis|Upsilon]], [[Tau Draconis|Tau]], and [[Sigma Draconis]].{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=239}} In some mythology, Draco had one hundred magnificent heads, guarded the golden apple tree, and was put in the sky as a constellation for protecting the apples with valor.  The constellation has been subject to many more myths, but ones that are obscure.\n\n=== Meteor showers ===\nThe [[February Eta Draconids]] is a meteor shower that was discovered on February 4, 2011. Observers noted six meteors with a common [[radiant (meteor shower)|radiant]] in a short period. Its parent is a previously unknown [[long-period comet]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal = Sky & Telescope |date = September 2012 |last = Jenniskens |first = Peter |page = 24 |title = Mapping Meteoroid Orbits: New Meteor Showers Discovered}}</ref>\n\n== Namesakes ==\n\n[[USS Draco (AK-79)|''Draco'']] was a [[United States Navy]] [[Crater class cargo ship]] named after the constellation. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe main character in the 1996 film ''[[Dragonheart]]'' gets his name from this constellation. The film also reveals that Draco is actually a dragon heaven, where dragons go when their time in this world is complete, and if they have upheld the oath of an ancient dragon to guard mankind, with dragons otherwise fading into nothing upon their deaths. At the conclusion of the film, Draco, the last dragon, ascends into the constellation after he sacrifices himself to destroy an evil king that he had saved years ago. This is further elaborated on in the sequel and prequel films that follow.\n\nThe [[Sicilian Defence, Dragon Variation|Dragon Variation]] of the Sicilian Defense chess opening was also named after the constellation by Russian chess master [[Fyodor Dus-Chotimirsky]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Secrets of the Sicilian Dragon|last=Gufeld|first=Eduard|authorlink=Eduard Gufeld|date=June 1998|publisher=Cardoza Publishing|isbn=0-940685-92-2}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Beyblade (toy)|Beyblade]] top Lightning L-Drago 100HF and its evolutions Meteo L-Drago LW105LF and L-Drago Destructor F:S are inspired by/based on the Draco constellation.

It was shot by [[Jules Buck]]. It was released in the U.S. in 1945 but shown to U.S. troops earlier.\n\nHuston and his crew - which included the British novelist and screenwriter [[Eric Ambler]]<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/117175/battle-san-pietro-what-makes-war-documentary-true \"The Best World War II Documentary Was Faked\", David Thomson, ''New Republic'', 4 May 2014]</ref> - were attached to the [[U.S. Army]]\u2019s [[143rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|143rd Regiment]] of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Division]].  Unlike many other military documentaries, it was claimed Huston\u2019s cameramen filmed alongside the infantrymen as they fought their way up the hills to reach San Pietro.  Huston's claim that the film was made during the battle was proven false by the research of Peter Maslowski in his 1993 book, ''Armed With Cameras''<ref>Maslowski, Peter. ''Armed With Cameras: the American Military Photographers of World War II.\" New York: The Free Press, pp.83-94.</ref>\n\nThe film is unflinching in its realism. One scene includes close-up views of the faces of dead soldiers as they are being loaded into [[body bag]]s, a level of realism unheard of in both fictional portrayals as well as newsreel footage of the time.\n\nThe [[United States Army]] delayed its release to the public because it showed dead GIs wrapped in mattress covers; some officers tried to prevent soldiers in training from seeing it, for fear of damaging morale.<ref name=\"oneill258\">William L. O'Neill, ''A Democracy At War: America's Fight At Home and Abroad in World War II'', p. 258 {{ISBN|0-02-923678-9}}</ref> General [[George Marshall]] came to Huston and took the film's defense, stating that because of the film's gritty realism, it would make a good [[training film]]. The depiction of death would inspire soldiers to take their training more seriously.<ref name=\"oneill258\"/>\n\nHuston quickly became unpopular with the Army, not only for the film but also for his response to the accusation that the film was anti-war. Huston responded that if he ever made a pro-war film, he should be shot.<ref>{{Cite episode|series=TCM Spotlight|title= Five Came Back|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=1112957%7c1104934&name=San-Pietro |accessdate=15 September 2015|first=Ben|last=Mankiewicz|network=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|city= |date=8 September 2015|season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= }}</ref> The film was screened to U.S. troops in North Africa in 1944, where [[John Horne Burns]] described it in a letter as \"almost more than any heart can stand\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolick|first=David|title=Dreadful: The Short Life and Gay Times of John Horne Burns|year=2013|publisher=Other Press|location=NY|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Bv5Ym9atTgC&pg=PT118& }}</ref> Huston was no longer considered a pariah; he was decorated and eventually promoted to major.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1991, ''The Battle of San Pietro'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n[[File:The Battle of San Pietro (1945).webm|thumb|''The Battle of San Pietro'', documentary directed by John Huston for the U.S. Army, 1945.]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Allied propaganda films of World War II]]\n* [[Treasures from American Film Archives]]\n* ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0004mzn The Battle of San Pietro]''.

It was shot by [[Jules Buck]]. It was released in the U.S. in 1945 but shown to U.S. troops earlier.\n\nHuston and his crew - which included the British novelist and screenwriter [[Eric Ambler]]<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/117175/battle-san-pietro-what-makes-war-documentary-true \"The Best World War II Documentary Was Faked\", David Thomson, ''New Republic'', 4 May 2014]</ref> - were attached to the [[U.S. Army]]\u2019s [[143rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|143rd Regiment]] of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|36th Division]].  Unlike many other military documentaries, it was claimed Huston\u2019s cameramen filmed alongside the infantrymen as they fought their way up the hills to reach San Pietro.  Huston's claim that the film was made during the battle was proven false by the research of Peter Maslowski in his 1993 book, ''Armed With Cameras''<ref>Maslowski, Peter. ''Armed With Cameras: the American Military Photographers of World War II.\" New York: The Free Press, pp.83-94.</ref>\n\nThe film is unflinching in its realism. One scene includes close-up views of the faces of dead soldiers as they are being loaded into [[body bag]]s, a level of realism unheard of in both fictional portrayals as well as newsreel footage of the time.\n\nThe [[United States Army]] delayed its release to the public because it showed dead GIs wrapped in mattress covers; some officers tried to prevent soldiers in training from seeing it, for fear of damaging morale.<ref name=\"oneill258\">William L. O'Neill, ''A Democracy At War: America's Fight At Home and Abroad in World War II'', p. 258 {{ISBN|0-02-923678-9}}</ref> General [[George Marshall]] came to Huston and took the film's defense, stating that because of the film's gritty realism, it would make a good [[training film]]. The depiction of death would inspire soldiers to take their training more seriously.<ref name=\"oneill258\"/>\n\nHuston quickly became unpopular with the Army, not only for the film but also for his response to the accusation that the film was anti-war. Huston responded that if he ever made a pro-war film, he should be shot.<ref>{{Cite episode|series=TCM Spotlight|title= Five Came Back|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=1112957%7c1104934&name=San-Pietro |accessdate=15 September 2015|first=Ben|last=Mankiewicz|network=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|city= |date=8 September 2015|season= |series-no= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= }}</ref> The film was screened to U.S. troops in North Africa in 1944, where [[John Horne Burns]] described it in a letter as \"almost more than any heart can stand\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolick|first=David|title=Dreadful: The Short Life and Gay Times of John Horne Burns|year=2013|publisher=Other Press|location=NY|page=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Bv5Ym9atTgC&pg=PT118& }}</ref> Huston was no longer considered a pariah; he was decorated and eventually promoted to major.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn 1991, ''The Battle of San Pietro'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n[[File:The Battle of San Pietro (1945).webm|thumb|''The Battle of San Pietro'', documentary directed by John Huston for the U.S. Army, 1945.]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Allied propaganda films of World War II]]\n* [[Treasures from American Film Archives]]\n* ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0004mzn The Battle of San Pietro]''.

A preview was shown alongside two other potential series; ''Sara Solves It'' and ''Buddy: Tech Detective''. It ultimately won in view, and the other two shows were scrapped.\n\n==Plot==\nThe adventures of best friends and unlikely heroes, Stinky the garbage truck and Dirty the backhoe loader, a dynamic and hilarious duo of resourcefulness that learn that when things don't go as expected, asking \"what if\" can lead to success. Based on the books by Jim and Kate McMullan.\n\n==Characters==\n{{expand section|date=August 2018}}\n*'''Stinky''' (voiced by [[Jaden Betts]] in 2015\u20132017, [[Issac Ryan Brown]] in 2017-Present) - A brown rear loader [[garbage truck]] who is the sillier one of the duo. He sees value in garbage where others don't and often provides materials needed to solve a problem, though he often attempts sillier methods such as sneaking in his favorite trash item ([[moldy]] [[melons]]).\n*'''Dirty''' (voiced by [[Jacob Guenther]] in 2015\u20132017, [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] in 2017-Present) - A yellow [[backhoe loader]] with a rotating cab who is the more mature one and the brains of the duo. He dreams of becoming the world's best building truck and often thinks more logically in their plans than his best friend. He often draws his ideas on a soft surface on the ground to review ideas, and has a liking for dirt.
