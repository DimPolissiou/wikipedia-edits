He recorded that only a small proportion of Serb families had been living in the same place for 200 years or more. In one large section of Eastern Kosovo, running north and south of Prishtina, he was able to categorize the Serb households as follows: leaving aside the 1,437 colonist families who had come after 1912, there were 706 households of \u2018old inhabitants\u2019 and 1,819 households of \u2018immigrants\u2019. The family traditions of the latter recorded that 780 of them had come from Macedonia, northern Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia-Hercegovina and central or northern Serbia, while the rest had moved from other parts of Kosovo. In the Gornja Morava district (the south-east corner of Kosovo) the Serb population consisted of 1,143 households of old inhabitants and 1,205 of \u2018immigrants\u2019, fewer than 200 of whom had migrated from other parts of Kosovo. Of the Albanian families he investigated in these areas, only a small number were \u2018old inhabitants\u2019. The proportions would have been difficult if he had done his research in Western Kosovo; but in any case the whole debate which pits fixed Serbs against mobile Albanians, as his researches demonstrate, rather bogus. Most of the families in any part of Kosovo are known to have come from somewhere else.\"; p.397. footnote: \"Uro\u0161evi\u0107, ''Etni\u010dki procesi na Kosovu tokom turske vladavine'', pp. 18\u201320, 22\u20133.\"</ref> Malcolm also noted that commonalities of Kosovo Albanian family names with Albanian clan names is not always indicative of having Albanian Mal\u00ebsi clan origins, as some people were agglomerated into clans while many other Kosovo Albanians lack such names.<ref name=Malcolm1998ddddd>Malcolm, Noel (1998).

There are many people with these names in modern Kosovo, and it is clear that, from the early seventeenth century onwards, at least some of their ancestors must have come into Kosovo as immigrants from the Mal\u00ebsi. (\u2018At least some\u2019 is a necessary qualification, because we cannot assume that the prices of agglomeration \u2013 of people joining a clan and taking its name \u2013 never took place on Kosovo soil.) However, there are also many Kosovo Albanians who do not bear clan names. Serbian writers sometimes argue that all these Albanians must therefore be Albanianized Serbs, as if all genuine Albanians would originally have belonged to clans. But since we know that there were non-clan Albanians in Kosovo as early as the fifteenth century, that there were only formed in areas which (unlike Kosovo) lacked governmental security, and indeed that many of the clans in the Mal\u00ebsi were still only in the process of formation at that time, this particular version of the argument about \u2018Albanianized Serbs\u2019 can simply be dismissed.\"</ref>\n \nKosovo was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1455 to 1912, at first as part of the ''[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|eyalet]]'' of [[Rumelia]], and from 1864 as a separate [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|province]] (''[[vilayet]]'').

Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (''tahrir defterleri'') to gauge the ethnic make\u2014up of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little. Leaving aside questions arising from the dialects and pronunciation of the census scribes, interpreters, and even priests who baptized those recorded, no natural law binds ethnicity to name. Imitation, in which the customs, tastes, and even names of those in the public eye are copied by the less exalted, is a time\u2014tested tradition and one followed in the Ottoman Empire. Some Christian sipahis in early Ottoman Albania took such Turkic names as Timurta\u015f, for example, in a kind of cultural conformity completed later by conversion to Islam. Such cultural mimicry makes onomastics an inappropriate tool for anyone wishing to use Ottoman records to prove claims so modern as to have been irrelevant to the pre\u2014modern state.\nThe seventeenth\u2014century Ottoman notable arid author Evliya \u00c7elebi, who wrote a massive account of his travels around the empire and abroad, included in it details of local society that normally would not appear in official correspondence; for this reason his account of a visit to several towns in Kosovo in 1660 is extremely valuable. Evliya confirms that western and at least parts of central Kosovo were \u2018Arnavud\u2019. He notes that the town of Vu\u010ditrn had few speakers of \u2018Bo\u015fnakca\u2019; its inhabitants spoke Albanian or Turkish. He terms the highlands around Tetovo (in Macedonia), Pe\u0107, and Prizren the \u2018mountains of Arnavudluk\u2019. Elsewhere, he states that \u2018the mountains of Pe\u0107\u2019 lay in Arnavudluk, from which issued one of the rivers converging at Mitrovica, just north-west of which he sites Kosovo\u2019s border with Bosna. This river, the Ibar, flows from a source in the mountains of Montenegro north\u2014north\u2014west of Pe\u0107, in the region of Rozaje to which the K\u00eblmendi would later be moved. He names the other river running by Mitrovica as the K\u0131lab and says that it, too, had its source in Aravudluk; by this he apparently meant the Lab, which today is the name of the river descending from mountains north\u2014east of Mitrovica to join the Sitnica north of Pri\u0161tina. As Evliya travelled south, he appears to have named the entire stretch of river he was following the K\u0131lab, not noting the change of name when he took the right fork at the confluence of the Lab and Sitnica. Thus, Evliya states that the tomb of Murad I, killed in the battle of Kosovo Polje, stood beside the K\u0131lab, although it stands near the Sitnica outside Pri\u0161tina. Despite the confusion of names, Evliya included in Arnavudluk not only the western fringe of Kosovo, but also the central mountains from which the Sitnica (\u2018K\u0131lab\u2019) and its first tributaries descend.\nGiven that a large Albanian population lived in Kosovo, especially in the west and centre, both before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689\u201390, it remains possible, in theory, that at that time in the Ottoman Empire, one people emigrated en masse and another immigrated to take its place.</ref>\n\n=== Modern period ===\n\n==== 19th century ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2011}}\n{{further|Demographic history of Kosovo|The Expulsion of Albanians 1877\u20131878|}}\n\nA large number of Albanians alongside smaller numbers of urban Turks (with some being of Albanian origin) were expelled and/or fled from what is now contemporary southern Serbia (Toplica and Morava regions) during the [[Serbian\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)]].<ref name=Jagodic1998/> Many settled in Kosovo, where they and their descendants are known as ''[[Muhaxhir (Albanians)|muhaxhir]]'', also ''muhaxher'' (\"exiles\", from Arabic ''''muhajir''''),<ref name=Jagodic1998>{{cite journal|last=Jagodi\u0107|first=Milo\u0161|title=The Emigration of Muslims from the New Serbian Regions 1877/1878|journal=Balkanologie.

Whereas we tend to think of violence in Kosovo today largely in terms of ethnic conflict or even \u201cancient ethnic hatreds\u201d, the various forms of violence the consuls described in their reports in late-Ottoman Kosovo appear to have occurred primarily along religious and socio-economic fault lines, reflecting pre-national identity patterns.

Hundreds of Albanian leaders gathered in Prizren and opposed the Serbian and Montenegrin jurisdiction. Serbia complained to the Western Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. Western Powers put pressure to the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army started the fighting against Albanians. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl Frash\u00ebri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. In 1910, an Albanian uprising spread from [[Pristina]] and lasted until the Ottoman [[Sultan]]'s visit to Kosovo in June 1911. The aim of the League of Prizren was to unite the four Albanian-inhabited Vilayets by merging the majority of Albanian inhabitants within the Ottoman Empire into one [[Albanian vilayet]].

Kosovo was split into four counties\u2014three being a part of official Serbia: Zve\u010dan, Kosovo and southern Metohija; and one in Montenegro: northern Metohija. However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three Regions in the Kingdom: Kosovo, [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Rascia]] and [[Zeta]].\n\nIn 1929 the Kingdom was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The territories of Kosovo were split among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]].

After numerous Serbian and Yugoslav [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] uprisings, Kosovo was liberated after 1944 with the help of the Albanian partisans of the [[Comintern]], and became a province of Serbia within the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]].\n \nThe Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija was formed in 1946 to placate its regional Albanian population within the [[History of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia]] as a member of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] under the leadership of the former Partisan leader, [[Josip Broz Tito]], but with no factual autonomy. This was the first time Kosovo came to exist with its present boundaries. After Yugoslavia's name changed to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Serbia's to the Socialist Republic of Serbia in 1963, the Autonomous Region of Kosovo was raised to the level of Autonomus Province (which [[Vojvodina]] had had since 1946) and gained inner autonomy in the 1960s.\n\nIn the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 constitution]], the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo's government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles\u2014President and Premier and a seat in the Federal Presidency, which made it a ''de facto'' Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining as a Socialist Autonomous Region within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croat]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] were defined official on the provincial level marking the two largest linguistic Kosovan groups: Serbs and Albanians. The word ''Metohija'' was also removed from the title in 1974 leaving the simple short form, ''Kosovo''.\n\nIn the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition of the Province of Kosovo as another Republic within the Federation, while the most extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. Tito's government dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution.\n[[File:Flag of SFR Yugoslav Albanian Minority.svg|thumb|200px|left|Flag of Albanian minority in SFR Yugoslavia]]\n\nIn 1981 the Kosovar Albanian students organised [[1981 protests in Kosovo|protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia]]. Those protests were harshly contained by the centralist Yugoslav government. In 1986, the [[SANU|Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU) was working on a document, which later would be known as the [[SANU Memorandum]]. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU portrayed the Serbian people as a victim and called for the revival of Serb nationalism, using both true and exaggerated facts for propaganda. During this time, [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] rose to power in the League of the Socialists of Serbia.\n\nSoon afterwards, as approved by the Assembly in 1990, the autonomy of Kosovo was revoked, and the pre-1974 status reinstated. Milo\u0161evi\u0107, however, did not remove Kosovo's seat from the Federal Presidency, but he installed his own supporters in that seat, so he could gain power in the Federal government. After [[Slovenia]]'s secession from Yugoslavia in 1991, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 used the seat to obtain dominance over the Federal government, outvoting his opponents.\n\nMany Albanians organized a peaceful active resistance movement, following the job losses suffered by some of them, while other, more radical and nationalistic oriented Albanians, started violent purges of the non-Albanian residents of Kosovo.\n\nOn 2 July 1990, an unconstitutional{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} ethnic Albanian parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, although this was not recognized by the Government since the ethnic Albanians refused to register themselves as legal citizens of Yugoslavia. In September of that year, the ethnic Albanian parliament, meeting in secrecy in the town of [[Ka\u00e7anik|Ka\u010danik]], adopted the ''Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo''. A year later, the Parliament organized the [[1991 Kosovan independence referendum]], which was observed by international organisations, but was not recognized internationally because of a lot of irregularities{{clarify|date=October 2012}}.

Serbian paramilitary forces committed war crimes in Kosovo, although the Serbian government claims that the Army was only going after suspected Albanian terrorists. This triggered a 78-day [[NATO]] [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing campaign]] in 1999. The Albanian Kosovar KLA played a major role not only in reconnaissance missions for the NATO, but in sabotaging the Serbian Army as well.\n\n==== 21st century ====\n{{main|Kosovo status process}}\n\nInternational negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], which ended the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] of 1999.

Traditions and customs differ even from town to town in Kosovo itself. The spoken dialect is [[Gheg]], typical of northern Albanians. The language of state institutions, education, books, media and newspapers is the standard dialect of Albanian, which is closer to the [[Tosk]] dialect.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{main|Religion in Kosovo}}\nThe majority of Kosovo Albanians are [[Sunni Muslims]]. There are also [[Roman Catholicism in Kosovo|Catholic]] Albanian communities concentrated in [[Gjakova]], [[Prizren]], [[Klina]] and a few villages near [[Pe\u0107]] and [[Vitina (town)|Vitina]].\n\n=== Art ===\n[[Kosovafilmi]] is the film industry, which releases movies in Albanian, created by Kosovar Albanian movie-makers. The National Theatre of Kosovo is the main theatre where plays are shown regularly by Albanian and international artists.\n\n==== Music ====\n{{main|Music in Kosovo}}\n\nMusic has always been part of Albanian culture. Although in Kosovo music is diverse (as it was mixed with the cultures of different regimes dominating Kosovo), authentic Albanian music does still exist. It is characterized by use of ''[[\u00e7iftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolina'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''.\n\n[[Folk music]] is very popular in Kosovo. There are many folk singers and ensembles.\n\nModern music in Kosovo has its origin from western countries. The main modern genres include [[Pop (music)|pop]], [[Albanian hip hop|hip hop/rap]], [[Albanian rock|rock]], and [[jazz]].\n\nThere are some notable music festivals in Kosovo:\n* Rock p\u00ebr Rock includes rock and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] music\n* Polifest includes all kinds of genres (usually hip hop, commercial pop, and never rock or metal)\n* Showfest includes all kinds of genres (usually hip hop, commercial pop, unusually rock and never metal)\n* Videofest includes all kinds of genres\n\nKosovo Radiotelevisions like [[Radio Television of Kosovo|RTK]], [[RTV21]] and KTV have their musical charts.\n\n=== Education ===\nEducation is provided for all levels, primary, secondary, and university degrees. [[Universiteti i Prishtin\u00ebs|University of Pristina]] is the public university of Kosovo, with several faculties and majors. The National Library (BK) is the main and the largest library in Kosovo, located in the centre of Pristina. There are many other private universities, among them [[American University in Kosovo]] (AUK), and many secondary schools and colleges such as [[Mehmet Akif College]].\n\n== Notable people

He recorded that only a small proportion of Serb families had been living in the same place for 200 years or more. In one large section of Eastern Kosovo, running north and south of Prishtina, he was able to categorize the Serb households as follows: leaving aside the 1,437 colonist families who had come after 1912, there were 706 households of \u2018old inhabitants\u2019 and 1,819 households of \u2018immigrants\u2019.

In the Gornja Morava district (the south-east corner of Kosovo) the Serb population consisted of 1,143 households of old inhabitants and 1,205 of \u2018immigrants\u2019, fewer than 200 of whom had migrated from other parts of Kosovo. Of the Albanian families he investigated in these areas, only a small number were \u2018old inhabitants\u2019.

However, there are also many Kosovo Albanians who do not bear clan names. Serbian writers sometimes argue that all these Albanians must therefore be Albanianized Serbs, as if all genuine Albanians would originally have belonged to clans. But since we know that there were non-clan Albanians in Kosovo as early as the fifteenth century, that there were only formed in areas which (unlike Kosovo) lacked governmental security, and indeed that many of the clans in the Mal\u00ebsi were still only in the process of formation at that time, this particular version of the argument about \u2018Albanianized Serbs\u2019 can simply be dismissed.\"</ref>\n \nKosovo was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1455 to 1912, at first as part of the ''[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|eyalet]]'' of [[Rumelia]], and from 1864 as a separate [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|province]] (''[[vilayet]]'').

Their attempts to use early Ottoman provincial surveys (''tahrir defterleri'') to gauge the ethnic make\u2014up of the population in the fifteenth century have proved little. Leaving aside questions arising from the dialects and pronunciation of the census scribes, interpreters, and even priests who baptized those recorded, no natural law binds ethnicity to name. Imitation, in which the customs, tastes, and even names of those in the public eye are copied by the less exalted, is a time\u2014tested tradition and one followed in the Ottoman Empire. Some Christian sipahis in early Ottoman Albania took such Turkic names as Timurta\u015f, for example, in a kind of cultural conformity completed later by conversion to Islam. Such cultural mimicry makes onomastics an inappropriate tool for anyone wishing to use Ottoman records to prove claims so modern as to have been irrelevant to the pre\u2014modern state.\nThe seventeenth\u2014century Ottoman notable arid author Evliya \u00c7elebi, who wrote a massive account of his travels around the empire and abroad, included in it details of local society that normally would not appear in official correspondence; for this reason his account of a visit to several towns in Kosovo in 1660 is extremely valuable. Evliya confirms that western and at least parts of central Kosovo were \u2018Arnavud\u2019. He notes that the town of Vu\u010ditrn had few speakers of \u2018Bo\u015fnakca\u2019; its inhabitants spoke Albanian or Turkish. He terms the highlands around Tetovo (in Macedonia), Pe\u0107, and Prizren the \u2018mountains of Arnavudluk\u2019. Elsewhere, he states that \u2018the mountains of Pe\u0107\u2019 lay in Arnavudluk, from which issued one of the rivers converging at Mitrovica, just north-west of which he sites Kosovo\u2019s border with Bosna. This river, the Ibar, flows from a source in the mountains of Montenegro north\u2014north\u2014west of Pe\u0107, in the region of Rozaje to which the K\u00eblmendi would later be moved. He names the other river running by Mitrovica as the K\u0131lab and says that it, too, had its source in Aravudluk; by this he apparently meant the Lab, which today is the name of the river descending from mountains north\u2014east of Mitrovica to join the Sitnica north of Pri\u0161tina. As Evliya travelled south, he appears to have named the entire stretch of river he was following the K\u0131lab, not noting the change of name when he took the right fork at the confluence of the Lab and Sitnica. Thus, Evliya states that the tomb of Murad I, killed in the battle of Kosovo Polje, stood beside the K\u0131lab, although it stands near the Sitnica outside Pri\u0161tina. Despite the confusion of names, Evliya included in Arnavudluk not only the western fringe of Kosovo, but also the central mountains from which the Sitnica (\u2018K\u0131lab\u2019) and its first tributaries descend.\nGiven that a large Albanian population lived in Kosovo, especially in the west and centre, both before and after the Habsburg invasion of 1689\u201390, it remains possible, in theory, that at that time in the Ottoman Empire, one people emigrated en masse and another immigrated to take its place.</ref>\n\n=== Modern period ===\n\n==== 19th century ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2011}}\n{{further|Demographic history of Kosovo|The Expulsion of Albanians 1877\u20131878|}}\n\nA large number of Albanians alongside smaller numbers of urban Turks (with some being of Albanian origin) were expelled and/or fled from what is now contemporary southern Serbia (Toplica and Morava regions) during the [[Serbian\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)]].<ref name=Jagodic1998/> Many settled in Kosovo, where they and their descendants are known as ''[[Muhaxhir (Albanians)|muhaxhir]]'', also ''muhaxher'' (\"exiles\", from Arabic ''''muhajir''''),<ref name=Jagodic1998>{{cite journal|last=Jagodi\u0107|first=Milo\u0161|title=The Emigration of Muslims from the New Serbian Regions 1877/1878|journal=Balkanologie.

Hundreds of Albanian leaders gathered in Prizren and opposed the Serbian and Montenegrin jurisdiction. Serbia complained to the Western Powers that the promised territories were not being held because the Ottomans were hesitating to do that. Western Powers put pressure to the Ottomans and in 1881, the Ottoman Army started the fighting against Albanians. The Prizren League created a Provisional Government with a President, Prime Minister (Ymer Prizreni) and Ministries of War (Sylejman Vokshi) and Foreign Ministry (Abdyl Frash\u00ebri). After three years of war, the Albanians were defeated. Many of the leaders were executed and imprisoned. In 1910, an Albanian uprising spread from [[Pristina]] and lasted until the Ottoman [[Sultan]]'s visit to Kosovo in June 1911.

However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three Regions in the Kingdom: Kosovo, [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Rascia]] and [[Zeta]].\n\nIn 1929 the Kingdom was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The territories of Kosovo were split among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]].

After numerous Serbian and Yugoslav [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] uprisings, Kosovo was liberated after 1944 with the help of the Albanian partisans of the [[Comintern]], and became a province of Serbia within the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]].\n \nThe Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija was formed in 1946 to placate its regional Albanian population within the [[History of Serbia|People's Republic of Serbia]] as a member of the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] under the leadership of the former Partisan leader, [[Josip Broz Tito]], but with no factual autonomy. This was the first time Kosovo came to exist with its present boundaries. After Yugoslavia's name changed to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Serbia's to the Socialist Republic of Serbia in 1963, the Autonomous Region of Kosovo was raised to the level of Autonomus Province (which [[Vojvodina]] had had since 1946) and gained inner autonomy in the 1960s.\n\nIn the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 constitution]], the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo's government received higher powers, including the highest governmental titles\u2014President and Premier and a seat in the Federal Presidency, which made it a ''de facto'' Socialist Republic within the Federation, but remaining as a Socialist Autonomous Region within the Socialist Republic of Serbia. [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croat]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] were defined official on the provincial level marking the two largest linguistic Kosovan groups: Serbs and Albanians. The word ''Metohija'' was also removed from the title in 1974 leaving the simple short form, ''Kosovo''.\n\nIn the 1970s, an Albanian nationalist movement pursued full recognition of the Province of Kosovo as another Republic within the Federation, while the most extreme elements aimed for full-scale independence. Tito's government dealt with the situation swiftly, but only giving it a temporary solution.\n[[File:Flag of SFR Yugoslav Albanian Minority.svg|thumb|200px|left|Flag of Albanian minority in SFR Yugoslavia]]\n\nIn 1981 the Kosovar Albanian students organised [[1981 protests in Kosovo|protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia]]. Those protests were harshly contained by the centralist Yugoslav government. In 1986, the [[SANU|Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU) was working on a document, which later would be known as the [[SANU Memorandum]]. An unfinished edition was filtered to the press. In the essay, SANU portrayed the Serbian people as a victim and called for the revival of Serb nationalism, using both true and exaggerated facts for propaganda. During this time, [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] rose to power in the League of the Socialists of Serbia.\n\nSoon afterwards, as approved by the Assembly in 1990, the autonomy of Kosovo was revoked, and the pre-1974 status reinstated. Milo\u0161evi\u0107, however, did not remove Kosovo's seat from the Federal Presidency, but he installed his own supporters in that seat, so he could gain power in the Federal government. After [[Slovenia]]'s secession from Yugoslavia in 1991, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 used the seat to obtain dominance over the Federal government, outvoting his opponents.\n\nMany Albanians organized a peaceful active resistance movement, following the job losses suffered by some of them, while other, more radical and nationalistic oriented Albanians, started violent purges of the non-Albanian residents of Kosovo.\n\nOn 2 July 1990, an unconstitutional{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} ethnic Albanian parliament declared Kosovo an independent country, although this was not recognized by the Government since the ethnic Albanians refused to register themselves as legal citizens of Yugoslavia. In September of that year, the ethnic Albanian parliament, meeting in secrecy in the town of [[Ka\u00e7anik|Ka\u010danik]], adopted the ''Constitution of the Republic of Kosovo''. A year later, the Parliament organized the [[1991 Kosovan independence referendum]], which was observed by international organisations, but was not recognized internationally because of a lot of irregularities{{clarify|date=October 2012}}.

Serbian paramilitary forces committed war crimes in Kosovo, although the Serbian government claims that the Army was only going after suspected Albanian terrorists. This triggered a 78-day [[NATO]] [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|bombing campaign]] in 1999.

Traditions and customs differ even from town to town in Kosovo itself. The spoken dialect is [[Gheg]], typical of northern Albanians. The language of state institutions, education, books, media and newspapers is the standard dialect of Albanian, which is closer to the [[Tosk]] dialect.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{main|Religion in Kosovo}}\nThe majority of Kosovo Albanians are [[Sunni Muslims]]. There are also [[Roman Catholicism in Kosovo|Catholic]] Albanian communities concentrated in [[Gjakova]], [[Prizren]], [[Klina]] and a few villages near [[Pe\u0107]] and [[Vitina (town)|Vitina]].\n\n=== Art ===\n[[Kosovafilmi]] is the film industry, which releases movies in Albanian, created by Kosovar Albanian movie-makers. The National Theatre of Kosovo is the main theatre where plays are shown regularly by Albanian and international artists.\n\n==== Music ====\n{{main|Music in Kosovo}}\n\nMusic has always been part of Albanian culture. Although in Kosovo music is diverse (as it was mixed with the cultures of different regimes dominating Kosovo), authentic Albanian music does still exist. It is characterized by use of ''[[\u00e7iftelia]]'' (an authentic Albanian instrument), ''mandolina'', ''mandola'' and ''percussion''.\n\n[[Folk music]] is very popular in Kosovo. There are many folk singers and ensembles.\n\nModern music in Kosovo has its origin from western countries. The main modern genres include [[Pop (music)|pop]], [[Albanian hip hop|hip hop/rap]], [[Albanian rock|rock]], and [[jazz]].\n\nThere are some notable music festivals in Kosovo:\n* Rock p\u00ebr Rock includes rock and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] music\n* Polifest includes all kinds of genres (usually hip hop, commercial pop, and never rock or metal)\n* Showfest includes all kinds of genres (usually hip hop, commercial pop, unusually rock and never metal)\n* Videofest includes all kinds of genres\n\nKosovo Radiotelevisions like [[Radio Television of Kosovo|RTK]], [[RTV21]] and KTV have their musical charts.\n\n=== Education ===\nEducation is provided for all levels, primary, secondary, and university degrees. [[Universiteti i Prishtin\u00ebs|University of Pristina]] is the public university of Kosovo, with several faculties and majors. The National Library (BK) is the main and the largest library in Kosovo, located in the centre of Pristina. There are many other private universities, among them [[American University in Kosovo]] (AUK), and many secondary schools and colleges such as [[Mehmet Akif College]].\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{main|List of Kosovo Albanians}}\n \n== See also ==\n\n* [[Albanians]]\n* [[Albanian nationalism in Kosovo]]\n* [[Albania-Kosovo relations]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{| style=\"margin-left:13px; line-height:150%\"\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:right; vertical-align:top;\"|a.\n|{{note|status}}{{Kosovo-note}}\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Navboxes\n| title = Links related to [[Kosovo]] [[Albanians|Albanian]]s   \n| titlestyle = \n|list1= \n{{Albanian diaspora}}\n{{Ethnic groups in Kosovo}}\n}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Albanians In Kosovo}}\n[[Category:Kosovo Albanians| ]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Kosovo]]\n[[Category:Kosovan people of Albanian descent| ]]\n[[Category:Muslim communities in Europe]]\n", "name_user": "SrpskiAnonimac", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Albanians"}

Much of Amber's current buildings were started or expanded during the reign of Raja Man Singh I in the 1600s. Among the chief building is the Diwan-i-Khas in Amber Palace of Rajasthan and the elaborately painted Ganesh Poll built by the Mirza Raja Jai Singh I.<ref name=DNA/>\n\nThe current Amer Palace was created in the late 16th century, as a larger palace to the already existing home of the rulers. The older palace, known as Kadimi Mahal (Persian for ancient) is known to be the oldest surviving palace in India. This ancient palace sits in the valley behind the Amer Palace.\n\nAmer was known in the medieval period as [[Dhundar]] (meaning attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers) and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 11th century onwards \u2013 between 1037 and 1727 AD, till the capital was moved from Amer to Jaipur.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers as they founded their empire at Amer.<ref name=\"KhangarotNathawat1990\">{{cite book|author1=R.

This is one of the four courtyards of Amer Palace, which was built during Sawai Jai Singh's reign (1693\u20131743 AD). Maharaja's personal bodyguards held parades here under the command of the army commander or ''Fauj Bakshi''. The Maharaja used to inspect the guards contingent. Adjacent to the courtyard were the horse stables, with the upper-level rooms occupied by the guards.<ref name=Jaleb>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amer_Fort_-_Jaleb_Chowk_-_Information_plate.jpg |title=Information plaque at Jaleb Chowk |accessdate=17 April 2011 |publisher=Archaeology Department of Rajasthan }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===First courtyard===\n[[File:Amer Fort Entrance.jpg|thumb|Ganesh Pol Entrance]]\nAn impressive stairway from Jalebi Chowk leads into the main palace grounds. Here, at the entrance to the right of the stairway steps is the Sila Devi temple where the Rajput Maharajas worshipped, starting with Maharaja Mansingh in the 16th century until the 1980s, when the animal sacrifice ritual (sacrifice of a buffalo) practiced by the royalty was stopped.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nGanesh Pol, or the Ganesh Gate, named after the [[Hindu god]] [[Lord Ganesh]], who removes all obstacles in life, is the entry into the private palaces of the Maharajas. It is a three-level structure with many frescoes that were also built at the orders of the Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1621\u20131627). Above this gate is the Suhag Mandir where ladies of the royal family used to watch functions held in the Diwan-i-Aam through latticed marble windows called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|j\u00e2l\u00ees]]\".<ref name=Jaleb1>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amer_Fort_-_Ganesh_Pol_-_Information_plate.jpg |title=Information plaque on Ganesh Pol |accessdate=17 April 2011 |publisher=Archaeology Department of Rajasthan }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n; Sila Devi temple\n[[File: Silver door in Amber Fort, Rajasthan.jpg|left|thumb|Embossed double leaf silver door entry into the Sila Devi temple]]\nOn the right side of the Jalebi Chowk, there is a small but an elegant temple called the Sila Devi temple (Sila Devi was an incarnation of [[Kali]] or [[Durga]]). The entrance to the temple is through a double door covered in silver with a raised relief. The main deity inside the sanctum is flanked by two lions made of silver. The legend attributed to the installation of this deity is that Maharaja Man Singh sought blessings from Kali for victory in the battle against the Raja of Jessore in Bengal. The goddess instructed the Raja, in a dream, to retrieve her image from the sea bed and install and worship it. The Raja, after he won the battle of Bengal in 1604, retrieved the idol from the sea and installed it in the temple and called it Sila Devi as it was carved out of one single stone slab. At the entrance to the temple, there is also a carving of [[Lord Ganesha]], which is made out of a single piece of [[coral]].<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nAnother version of the Sila Devi installation is that Raja Man Singh, after defeating the Raja of Jessore, received a gift of a black stone slab which was said to have a link to the [[Mahabharata]] epic story in which [[Kamsa|Kansa]] had killed older siblings of [[Lord Krishna]] on this stone. In exchange for this gift, Man Singh returned the kingdom he had won to the Raja of Bengal. This stone was then used to carve the image of [[Durga]] [[Mahishasuramardini]], who had slain the demon king [[Mahishasura]] and installed it in the fort's temple as Sila Devi. The Sila Devi was worshiped from then onwards as the lineage deity of the Rajput family of Jaipur. However, their family deity continued to be Jamva Mata of [[Jamwa Ramgarh|Ramgarh]].<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\nAnother practice that is associated with this temple is the religious rites of animal sacrifice during the festival days of [[Navrathri]] (a nine-day festival celebrated twice a year). The practice was to sacrifice a [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and also [[goats]] on the eighth day of the festival in front of the temple, which would be done in the presence of the royal family, watched by a large gathering of devotees. This practice was banned under the law from 1975, after which the sacrifice was held within the palace grounds in Jaipur, strictly as a private event with only the close kin of the royal family watching the event. However, now the practice of animal sacrifice has been totally stopped at the temple premises and offerings made to the goddess are only of the vegetarian type.<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\n===Second courtyard===\nThe second courtyard, up the main stairway of the first level courtyard, houses the Diwan-i-Aam or the Public Audience Hall. Built with a double row of columns, the Diwan-i-Aam is a raised platform with 27 colonnades, each of which is mounted with an elephant-shaped capital, with galleries above it. As the name suggests, the Raja (King) held audience here to hear and receive petitions from the public.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/><ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n===Third courtyard===\n[[File:Amber Fort interior.jpg|thumb|Mirrored ceiling in the Mirror Palace]]\n[[File:Amber Fort - Sheesh Mahal Interior.jpg|thumb|Sheesh Mahal Interior]]\nThe third courtyard is where the private quarters of the Maharaja, his family and attendants were located. This courtyard is entered through the Ganesh Pol or Ganesh Gate, which is embellished with mosaics and sculptures. The courtyard has two buildings, one opposite to the other, separated by a garden laid in the fashion of the [[Mughal Gardens]]. The building to the left of the entrance gate is called the Jai Mandir, which is exquisitely embellished with glass inlaid panels and multi-mirrored ceilings. The mirrors are of convex shape and designed with colored foil and paint which would glitter bright under candlelight at the time it was in use. Also known as Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), the mirror mosaics and colored glasses were a \"glittering jewel box in flickering candlelight\".<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>  Sheesh mahal was built by King Man Singh in the 16th century and completed in 1727. It is also the foundation year of Jaipur state.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://amerjaipur.in/Amer-monuments-description.php?mid=9&name=Sheesh%20mahal%20Amer%20palace|title = Sheesh mahal Amer palace|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-01|website = www.amerjaipur.in|publisher = |last = pareek|first = Amit Kumar Pareek and Agam kumar}}</ref> However, most of this work was allowed to deteriorate during the period 1970\u201380 but has since then been in the process of restoration and renovation. The walls around the hall hold carved marble relief panels. The hall provides enchanting vistas of the Maota Lake.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nOn top of Jai Mandir is Jas Mandir, a hall of private audience with floral glass inlays and [[alabaster]] relief work.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\nThe other building seen in the courtyard is opposite to the Jai Mandir and is known as the Sukh Niwas or Sukh Mahal (Hall of Pleasure). This hall is approached through a [[sandalwood]] door. The walls are decorated with marble inlay work with niches called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|ch\u00een\u00ee kh\u00e2na]]\". A piped water supply flows through an open channel that runs through this edifice keeping the environs cool, as in an air-conditioned environment. The water from this channel flows into the garden.\n\n; Magic flower\nA particular attraction here is the \"magic flower\" carved marble panel at the base of one of the pillars around the mirror palace depicting two hovering butterflies; the flower has seven unique designs including a fishtail, lotus, hooded cobra, elephant trunk, lion's tail, cob of corn, and scorpion, each one of which is visible by a special way of partially hiding the panel with the hands.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\n; Garden\nThe garden, located between the Jai Mandir on the east and the Sukh Niwas on the west, both built on high platforms in the third courtyard, was built by Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1623\u201368). It is patterned on the lines of the Chahar Bagh or Mughal Garden. It is in a sunken bed, shaped in a hexagonal design. It is laid out with narrow channels lined with marble around a star-shaped pool with a fountain at the center. Water for the garden flows in cascades through channels from the Sukh Niwas and also from the cascade channels called the ''\"chini khana niches\"'' that originate on the terrace of the Jai Mandir.<ref name=\"Ruggles2008\"/>\n\n; Tripolia gate\nTripolia gate means three gates. It is access to the palace from the west. It opens in three directions, one to the Jaleb Chowk, another to the Man Singh Palace and the third one to the Zenana Deorhi on the south.\n\n; Lion gate\nThe Lion Gate, the premier gate, was once a guarded gate; it leads to the private quarters in the palace premises and is titled 'Lion Gate' to suggest strength. Built during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh (1699\u20131743 AD), it is covered with frescoes; its alignment is zigzag, probably made so from security considerations to attack intruders.\n\n===Fourth courtyard===\nThe fourth courtyard is where the [[Zenana]] (Royal family women, including concubines or mistresses) lived. This courtyard has many living rooms where the queens resided and who were visited by the king at his choice without being found out as to which queen he was visiting, as all the rooms open into a common corridor.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n; Palace of Man Singh I\n[[File:Amber_Fort_-_Baradhari_pavlion_at_Man_Singh_Palace_Square.jpg|left|thumb|Baradari pavilion at Man Singh I Palace Square.]]\nSouth of this courtyard lies the Palace of Man Singh I, which is the oldest part of the palace fort.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The palace took 25 years to build and was completed in 1599 during the reign of Raja Man Singh I (1589\u20131614). It is the main palace. In the central courtyard of the palace is the pillared [[Baradari (building)|baradari]] or pavilion; frescoes and colored tiles decorate the rooms on the ground and upper floors. This pavilion (which used to be curtained for privacy) was used as the meeting venue by the maharanis (queens of the royal family). All sides of this pavilion are connected to several small rooms with open balconies. The exit from this palace leads to the town of Amer, a heritage town with many temples, palatial houses and mosques.<ref name=\"Abram2003\"/>\n\nThe queen mothers and the Raja's consorts lived in this part of the palace in Zanani Deorhi, which also housed their female attendants. The queen mothers took a deep interest in building temples in Amer town.<ref name=Deorhi>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amer_Fort_-_Zenani_Deorhi_-_Information_plate.jpg |title=Information plaque on Zenani Deorhi |accessdate=17 April 2011 |publisher=Archaeology Department of Rajasthan }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nSix forts of Rajasthan, namely, Amber Fort, [[Chittor Fort]], [[Gagron Fort]], [[Jaisalmer Fort]], [[Kumbhalgarh]] and [[Ranthambore Fort]] were included in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] list during the 37th meeting of the World Heritage Committee in Phnom Penh during June 2013.

Much of Amber's current buildings were started or expanded during the reign of Raja Man Singh I in the 1600s. Among the chief building is the Diwan-i-Khas in Amber Palace of Rajasthan and the elaborately painted Ganesh Poll built by the Mirza Raja Jai Singh I.<ref name=DNA/>\n\nThe current Amer Palace was created in the late 16th century, as a larger palace to the already existing home of the rulers. The older palace, known as Kadimi Mahal (Persian for ancient) is known to be the oldest surviving palace in India. This ancient palace sits in the valley behind the Amer Palace.\n\nAmer was known in the medieval period as [[Dhundar]] (meaning attributed to a sacrificial mount in the western frontiers) and ruled by the Kachwahas from the 11th century onwards \u2013 between 1037 and 1727 AD, till the capital was moved from Amer to Jaipur.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The history of Amer is indelibly linked to these rulers as they founded their empire at Amer.<ref name=\"KhangarotNathawat1990\">{{cite book|author1=R.

This is one of the four courtyards of Amer Palace, which was built during Sawai Jai Singh's reign (1693\u20131743 AD). Maharaja's personal bodyguards held parades here under the command of the army commander or ''Fauj Bakshi''. The Maharaja used to inspect the guards contingent. Adjacent to the courtyard were the horse stables, with the upper-level rooms occupied by the guards.<ref name=Jaleb>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amer_Fort_-_Jaleb_Chowk_-_Information_plate.jpg |title=Information plaque at Jaleb Chowk |accessdate=17 April 2011 |publisher=Archaeology Department of Rajasthan }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===First courtyard===\n[[File:Amer Fort Entrance.jpg|thumb|Ganesh Pol Entrance]]\nAn impressive stairway from Jalebi Chowk leads into the main palace grounds. Here, at the entrance to the right of the stairway steps is the Sila Devi temple where the Rajput Maharajas worshipped, starting with Maharaja Mansingh in the 16th century until the 1980s, when the animal sacrifice ritual (sacrifice of a buffalo) practiced by the royalty was stopped.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nGanesh Pol, or the Ganesh Gate, named after the [[Hindu god]] [[Lord Ganesh]], who removes all obstacles in life, is the entry into the private palaces of the Maharajas. It is a three-level structure with many frescoes that were also built at the orders of the Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1621\u20131627). Above this gate is the Suhag Mandir where ladies of the royal family used to watch functions held in the Diwan-i-Aam through latticed marble windows called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|j\u00e2l\u00ees]]\".<ref name=Jaleb1>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amer_Fort_-_Ganesh_Pol_-_Information_plate.jpg |title=Information plaque on Ganesh Pol |accessdate=17 April 2011 |publisher=Archaeology Department of Rajasthan }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n; Sila Devi temple\n[[File: Silver door in Amber Fort, Rajasthan.jpg|left|thumb|Embossed double leaf silver door entry into the Sila Devi temple]]\nOn the right side of the Jalebi Chowk, there is a small but an elegant temple called the Sila Devi temple (Sila Devi was an incarnation of [[Kali]] or [[Durga]]). The entrance to the temple is through a double door covered in silver with a raised relief. The main deity inside the sanctum is flanked by two lions made of silver. The legend attributed to the installation of this deity is that Maharaja Man Singh sought blessings from Kali for victory in the battle against the Raja of Jessore in Bengal. The goddess instructed the Raja, in a dream, to retrieve her image from the sea bed and install and worship it. The Raja, after he won the battle of Bengal in 1604, retrieved the idol from the sea and installed it in the temple and called it Sila Devi as it was carved out of one single stone slab. At the entrance to the temple, there is also a carving of [[Lord Ganesha]], which is made out of a single piece of [[coral]].<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nAnother version of the Sila Devi installation is that Raja Man Singh, after defeating the Raja of Jessore, received a gift of a black stone slab which was said to have a link to the [[Mahabharata]] epic story in which [[Kamsa|Kansa]] had killed older siblings of [[Lord Krishna]] on this stone. In exchange for this gift, Man Singh returned the kingdom he had won to the Raja of Bengal. This stone was then used to carve the image of [[Durga]] [[Mahishasuramardini]], who had slain the demon king [[Mahishasura]] and installed it in the fort's temple as Sila Devi. The Sila Devi was worshiped from then onwards as the lineage deity of the Rajput family of Jaipur. However, their family deity continued to be Jamva Mata of [[Jamwa Ramgarh|Ramgarh]].<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\nAnother practice that is associated with this temple is the religious rites of animal sacrifice during the festival days of [[Navrathri]] (a nine-day festival celebrated twice a year). The practice was to sacrifice a [[Water Buffalo|buffalo]] and also [[goats]] on the eighth day of the festival in front of the temple, which would be done in the presence of the royal family, watched by a large gathering of devotees. This practice was banned under the law from 1975, after which the sacrifice was held within the palace grounds in Jaipur, strictly as a private event with only the close kin of the royal family watching the event. However, now the practice of animal sacrifice has been totally stopped at the temple premises and offerings made to the goddess are only of the vegetarian type.<ref name=\"Babb2004\"/>\n\n===Second courtyard===\nThe second courtyard, up the main stairway of the first level courtyard, houses the Diwan-i-Aam or the Public Audience Hall. Built with a double row of columns, the Diwan-i-Aam is a raised platform with 27 colonnades, each of which is mounted with an elephant-shaped capital, with galleries above it. As the name suggests, the Raja (King) held audience here to hear and receive petitions from the public.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/><ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n===Third courtyard===\n[[File:Amber Fort interior.jpg|thumb|Mirrored ceiling in the Mirror Palace]]\n[[File:Amber Fort - Sheesh Mahal Interior.jpg|thumb|Sheesh Mahal Interior]]\nThe third courtyard is where the private quarters of the Maharaja, his family and attendants were located. This courtyard is entered through the Ganesh Pol or Ganesh Gate, which is embellished with mosaics and sculptures. The courtyard has two buildings, one opposite to the other, separated by a garden laid in the fashion of the [[Mughal Gardens]]. The building to the left of the entrance gate is called the Jai Mandir, which is exquisitely embellished with glass inlaid panels and multi-mirrored ceilings. The mirrors are of convex shape and designed with colored foil and paint which would glitter bright under candlelight at the time it was in use. Also known as Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), the mirror mosaics and colored glasses were a \"glittering jewel box in flickering candlelight\".<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>  Sheesh mahal was built by King Man Singh in the 16th century and completed in 1727. It is also the foundation year of Jaipur state.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://amerjaipur.in/Amer-monuments-description.php?mid=9&name=Sheesh%20mahal%20Amer%20palace|title = Sheesh mahal Amer palace|date = |accessdate = 2016-01-01|website = www.amerjaipur.in|publisher = |last = pareek|first = Amit Kumar Pareek and Agam kumar}}</ref> However, most of this work was allowed to deteriorate during the period 1970\u201380 but has since then been in the process of restoration and renovation. The walls around the hall hold carved marble relief panels. The hall provides enchanting vistas of the Maota Lake.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\nOn top of Jai Mandir is Jas Mandir, a hall of private audience with floral glass inlays and [[alabaster]] relief work.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\nThe other building seen in the courtyard is opposite to the Jai Mandir and is known as the Sukh Niwas or Sukh Mahal (Hall of Pleasure). This hall is approached through a [[sandalwood]] door. The walls are decorated with marble inlay work with niches called \"[[:fr:Glossaire de l'art moghol|ch\u00een\u00ee kh\u00e2na]]\". A piped water supply flows through an open channel that runs through this edifice keeping the environs cool, as in an air-conditioned environment. The water from this channel flows into the garden.\n\n; Magic flower\nA particular attraction here is the \"magic flower\" carved marble panel at the base of one of the pillars around the mirror palace depicting two hovering butterflies; the flower has seven unique designs including a fishtail, lotus, hooded cobra, elephant trunk, lion's tail, cob of corn, and scorpion, each one of which is visible by a special way of partially hiding the panel with the hands.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/>\n\n; Garden\nThe garden, located between the Jai Mandir on the east and the Sukh Niwas on the west, both built on high platforms in the third courtyard, was built by Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1623\u201368). It is patterned on the lines of the Chahar Bagh or Mughal Garden. It is in a sunken bed, shaped in a hexagonal design. It is laid out with narrow channels lined with marble around a star-shaped pool with a fountain at the center. Water for the garden flows in cascades through channels from the Sukh Niwas and also from the cascade channels called the ''\"chini khana niches\"'' that originate on the terrace of the Jai Mandir.<ref name=\"Ruggles2008\"/>\n\n; Tripolia gate\nTripolia gate means three gates. It is access to the palace from the west. It opens in three directions, one to the Jaleb Chowk, another to the Man Singh Palace and the third one to the Zenana Deorhi on the south.\n\n; Lion gate\nThe Lion Gate, the premier gate, was once a guarded gate; it leads to the private quarters in the palace premises and is titled 'Lion Gate' to suggest strength. Built during the reign of Sawai Jai Singh (1699\u20131743 AD), it is covered with frescoes; its alignment is zigzag, probably made so from security considerations to attack intruders.\n\n===Fourth courtyard===\nThe fourth courtyard is where the [[Zenana]] (Royal family women, including concubines or mistresses) lived. This courtyard has many living rooms where the queens resided and who were visited by the king at his choice without being found out as to which queen he was visiting, as all the rooms open into a common corridor.<ref name=\"BrownThomas2008\"/>\n\n; Palace of Man Singh I\n[[File:Amber_Fort_-_Baradhari_pavlion_at_Man_Singh_Palace_Square.jpg|left|thumb|Baradari pavilion at Man Singh I Palace Square.]]\nSouth of this courtyard lies the Palace of Man Singh I, which is the oldest part of the palace fort.<ref name=\"BruynBain2010\"/> The palace took 25 years to build and was completed in 1599 during the reign of Raja Man Singh I (1589\u20131614). It is the main palace. In the central courtyard of the palace is the pillared [[Baradari (building)|baradari]] or pavilion; frescoes and colored tiles decorate the rooms on the ground and upper floors. This pavilion (which used to be curtained for privacy) was used as the meeting venue by the maharanis (queens of the royal family). All sides of this pavilion are connected to several small rooms with open balconies. The exit from this palace leads to the town of Amer, a heritage town with many temples, palatial houses and mosques.<ref name=\"Abram2003\"/>\n\nThe queen mothers and the Raja's consorts lived in this part of the palace in Zanani Deorhi, which also housed their female attendants. The queen mothers took a deep interest in building temples in Amer town.<ref name=Deorhi>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Amer_Fort_-_Zenani_Deorhi_-_Information_plate.jpg |title=Information plaque on Zenani Deorhi |accessdate=17 April 2011 |publisher=Archaeology Department of Rajasthan }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\nSix forts of Rajasthan, namely, Amber Fort, [[Chittor Fort]], [[Gagron Fort]], [[Jaisalmer Fort]], [[Kumbhalgarh]] and [[Ranthambore Fort]] were included in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] list during the 37th meeting of the World Heritage Committee in Phnom Penh during June 2013.

Most enzymes are proteins, and most such processes are chemical reactions. Within the enzyme, generally catalysis occurs at a localized site, called the [[active site]].\n\nMost [[enzymes]] are made predominantly of proteins, either a single protein chain or many such chains in a [[multiprotein complex|multi-subunit complex]]. Enzymes often also incorporate non-protein components, such as  metal ions or specialized organic molecules known as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] (e.g. [[adenosine triphosphate]]). Many cofactors are vitamins, and their role as vitamins is directly linked to their use in the catalysis of biological process within metabolism.  [[Catalysis]] of [[Biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] in the [[cell (biology)|cell]] is vital since many but not all metabolically essential reactions have very low rates when uncatalysed. One driver of protein evolution is the optimization of such catalytic activities, although only the most crucial enzymes operate near catalytic efficiency limits, and many enzymes are far from optimal. Important factors in enzyme catalysis include general acid and base catalysis, orbital steering, entropic restriction, orientation effects (i.e. lock and key catalysis), as well as motional effects involving [[protein dynamics]]<ref name=\"Kamerlin\">{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 20099310\n| pmc = 2841229\n| year = 2010\n| last1 = Kamerlin\n| first1 = S.

The reduction of [[activation energy]] (''E''<sub>a</sub>) increases the fraction of reactant molecules that can overcome this barrier and form the product. An important principle is that since they only reduce energy barriers between products and reactants, enzymes always catalyze reactions in both directions, and cannot drive a reaction forward or affect the equilibrium position - only the speed with which is it achieved. As with other catalysts, the enzyme is not consumed or changed by the reaction (as a substrate is) but is recycled such that a single enzyme performs many rounds of catalysis.\n\n==Induced fit== <!--'Induced fit' redirects to this section -->\n[[File:Hexokinase induced fit.svg|alt=Hexokinase displayed as an opaque surface with a pronounced open binding cleft next to unbound substrate (top) and the same enzyme with more closed cleft that surrounds the bound substrate (bottom)|thumb|250px|Enzyme changes shape by induced fit upon substrate binding to form enzyme-substrate complex.

Koshland Jr. | title=Application of a Theory of Enzyme Specificity to Protein Synthesis | journal=[[Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.]] | date=February 1958 | volume=44 | issue=2 | pages=98\u2013104 | pmid=16590179 | doi=10.1073/pnas.44.2.98 | pmc=335371 | bibcode = 1958PNAS...44...98K }}{{open access}}</ref>  This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce [[conformational change]]s in the enzyme that strengthen binding.\n\nThe advantages of the induced fit mechanism arise due to the stabilizing effect of strong enzyme binding. There are two different mechanisms of substrate binding: uniform binding, which has strong substrate binding, and differential binding, which has strong transition state binding. The stabilizing effect of uniform binding increases both substrate and transition state binding affinity, while differential binding increases only transition state binding affinity. Both are used by enzymes and have been evolutionarily chosen to minimize the activation energy of the reaction. Enzymes that are saturated, that is, have a high affinity substrate binding, require differential binding to reduce the energy of activation, whereas small substrate unbound enzymes may use either differential or uniform binding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anslyn|first1=E.V.|last2=Dougherty|first2=D.A.|title=Modern Physical Organic Chemistry|date=2006|publisher=University Science Books|isbn=978-1-891389-31-3}}</ref>\n\nThese effects have led to most proteins using the differential binding mechanism to reduce the energy of activation, so most substrates have high affinity for the enzyme while in the transition state. Differential binding is carried out by the induced fit mechanism - the substrate first binds weakly, then the enzyme changes conformation increasing the affinity to the transition state and stabilizing it, so reducing the activation energy to reach it.\n\nIt is important to clarify, however, that the induced fit concept cannot be used to rationalize catalysis. That is, the chemical catalysis is defined as the reduction of ''E''<sub>a</sub><sup>\u2021</sup> (when the system is already in the ES<sup>\u2021</sup>) relative to ''E''<sub>a</sub><sup>\u2021</sup> in the uncatalyzed reaction in water (without the enzyme). The induced fit only suggests that the barrier is lower in the closed form of the enzyme but does not tell us what the reason for the barrier reduction is.\n\nInduced fit may be beneficial to the fidelity of molecular recognition in the presence of competition and noise via the [[conformational proofreading]] mechanism\n.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000468 | year=2007 | author=Savir Y | author2=Tlusty T | title=Conformational Proofreading: The Impact of Conformational Changes on the Specificity of Molecular Recognition | volume=2 | issue=5 | pages=e468 | journal=[[PLOS One]] | url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PLoSONE2007.pdf | pmid=17520027 | pmc=1868595 | editor1-last=Scalas | editor1-first=Enrico | bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..468S | access-date=22 August 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514055337/http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PLoSONE2007.pdf | archive-date=14 May 2011 | url-status=dead }}{{open access}}</ref>\n\n==Mechanisms of an alternative reaction route==\nThese conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the [[active site]] close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction. After binding takes place, one or more mechanisms of catalysis lowers the energy of the reaction's [[transition state]], by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction. There are six possible mechanisms of \"over the barrier\" catalysis as well as a \"through the barrier\" mechanism:\n\n===Proximity and orientation===\nEnzyme-substrate interactions align the reactive chemical groups and hold them close together in an optimal geometry, which increases the rate of the reaction. This reduces the [[entropy]] of the reactants and thus makes addition or transfer reactions less unfavorable, since a reduction in the overall entropy when two reactants become a single product. However this is a general effect and is seen in non-addition or transfer reactions where it occurs due to an increase in the \"effective concentration\" of the reagents. This is understood when considering how increases in concentration leads to increases in reaction rate: essentially when the reactants are more concentrated, they collide more often and so react more often. In enzyme catalysis, the binding of the reagents to the enzyme restricts the conformational space of the reactants, holding them in the 'proper orientation' and close to each other, so that the collide more frequently, and with the correct geometry, to facilitate the desired reaction.  The \"effective concentration\" is the concentration  the reactant would have to be, free in solution, to experiences the same collisional frequency.

This is related to the overall principle of catalysis, that of reducing energy barriers, since in general transition stated are high energy states, and by stabilizing them this high energy is reduced, lowering the barrier. A key feature of enzyme catalysis over many non-biological catalysis, is that both acid and base catalysis can be combined in the same reaction. In many abiotic systems, acids (large [H+]) or bases ( large concentration H+ sinks, or species with electron pairs) can increase the rate of the reaction; but of course the environment can only have one overall pH (measure of acidity or basicity (alkalinity)). However since enzymes are large molecules, they can position both acid groups and basic groups in their active site to interact with their substrates, and employ both modes independent of the bulk pH.\n\nOften general acid or base catalysis is employed to activate [[nucleophile]] and/or [[electrophile]] groups, or to stabilizing leaving groups. Many amino acids with acidic or basic groups are this employed in the active site, such as the glutamic and aspartic acid, histidine, cystine, tyrosine, lysine and arginine, as well as serine and threonine. In addition, the peptide backbone, with carbonyl and amide N groups is often employed. [[Cystine]] and [[Histidine]] are very commonly involved, since they both have a [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] close to neutral [[pH]] and can therefore both accept and donate protons.\n\nMany reaction mechanisms involving acid/base catalysis assume a substantially altered pKa. This alteration of pKa is possible through the local environment of the residue{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Conditions\n! Acids\n! Bases\n|-\n!

In addition, studies have shown that the charge distributions about the active sites are arranged so as to stabilize the transition states of the catalyzed reactions.

This adds an additional covalent intermediate to the reaction, and helps to reduce the energy of later transition states of the reaction. The covalent bond must, at a later stage in the reaction, be broken to regenerate the enzyme. This mechanism is utilised by the [[catalytic triad]] of enzymes such as [[protease]]s like [[chymotrypsin]] and [[trypsin]], where an acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed. An alternative mechanism is [[schiff base]] formation using the free [[amine]] from a [[lysine]] residue, as seen in the enzyme [[aldolase]] during [[glycolysis]].\n\nSome enzymes utilize non-amino acid [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[pyridoxal phosphate]] (PLP) or [[thiamine pyrophosphate]] (TPP) to form covalent intermediates with reactant molecules.<ref>Toney, M.

The enzyme of high energy content may firstly transfer some specific energetic group X<sub>1</sub> from catalytic site of the enzyme to the final place of the first bound reactant, then another group X<sub>2</sub> from the second bound reactant (or from the second group of the single reactant) must be transferred to active site to finish substrate conversion to product and enzyme regeneration.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11010-011-0742-4| pmid = 21318350| title = Is the enzyme a powerful reactant of the biochemical reaction?| journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry| volume = 352| issue = 1\u20132| pages = 87\u20139| year = 2011| last1 = Foigel| first1 = Alexander G.}}</ref>\n\nWe can present the whole enzymatic reaction as a two coupling reactions:\n \n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>{S1} + EX1 -> S1EX1 -> {P1} + EP2</chem>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>{S2} + EP2 -> S2EP2 -> {P2} + EX2</chem>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nIt may be seen from reaction ({{EquationNote|1}}) that the group X<sub>1</sub> of the active enzyme appears in the product due to possibility of the exchange reaction inside enzyme to avoid both electrostatic inhibition and repulsion of atoms. So we represent the active enzyme as a powerful reactant of the enzymatic reaction. The reaction ({{EquationNote|2}}) shows incomplete conversion of the substrate because its group X<sub>2</sub> remains inside enzyme.   This approach as idea had formerly proposed relying on the hypothetical extremely high enzymatic conversions (catalytically perfect enzyme).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fogel | first1 = A.G. | year = 1982 | title = Cooperativity of enzymatic reactions and molecular aspects of energy transduction | url = | journal = Mol.

This chemical aspect is supported by the well-studied mechanisms of the several enzymatic reactions. Consider the reaction of peptide bond hydrolysis catalyzed by a pure protein \u03b1-chymotrypsin (an enzyme acting without a cofactor), which is a well-studied member of the serine proteases family, see.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hengge | first1 = AC | last2 = Stein | first2 = RL | year = 2004 | title = Role of protein conformational mobility in enzyme catalysis: acylation of alpha-chymotrypsin by specific peptide substrates | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 742\u2013747 | doi = 10.1021/bi030222k | pmid = 14730979 }}</ref>\n\nWe present the experimental results for this reaction as two chemical steps:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>{S1} + EH -> {P1} + EP2</chem>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>{EP2} + {H-O-H} -> {EH} + P2</chem>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nwhere S<sub>1</sub>  is a polypeptide,  P<sub>1</sub>  and P<sub>2</sub>  are products. The first chemical step  ({{EquationNote|3}})  includes the formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. The second step ({{EquationNote|4}}) is the deacylation step. It is important to note that the group H+, initially found on the enzyme, but not in water, appears in the product before the step of hydrolysis, therefore it may be considered as an additional group of the enzymatic reaction.\n\nThus, the reaction ({{EquationNote|3}}) shows that the enzyme acts as a powerful reactant of the reaction. According to the proposed concept, the H transport from the enzyme promotes the first reactant conversion, breakdown of the first initial chemical bond (between groups P<sub>1</sub>  and P<sub>2</sub>). The step of hydrolysis leads to a breakdown of the second chemical bond and regeneration of the enzyme.\n\nThe proposed chemical mechanism does not depend on the concentration of the substrates or products in the medium.  However, a shift in their concentration mainly causes free energy changes in the first and final steps of the reactions  ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}})  due to the changes in the free energy content of every molecule, whether S or P, in water solution.\nThis approach is in accordance with the following mechanism of muscle contraction.

Most enzymes are proteins, and most such processes are chemical reactions. Within the enzyme, generally catalysis occurs at a localized site, called the [[active site]].\n\nMost [[enzymes]] are made predominantly of proteins, either a single protein chain or many such chains in a [[multiprotein complex|multi-subunit complex]]. Enzymes often also incorporate non-protein components, such as  metal ions or specialized organic molecules known as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] (e.g. [[adenosine triphosphate]]). Many cofactors are vitamins, and their role as vitamins is directly linked to their use in the catalysis of biological process within metabolism.  [[Catalysis]] of [[Biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] in the [[cell (biology)|cell]] is vital since many but not all metabolically essential reactions have very low rates when uncatalysed. One driver of protein evolution is the optimization of such catalytic activities, although only the most crucial enzymes operate near catalytic efficiency limits, and many enzymes are far from optimal. Important factors in enzyme catalysis include general acid and base catalysis, orbital steering, entropic restriction, orientation effects (i.e. lock and key catalysis), as well as motional effects involving [[protein dynamics]]<ref name=\"Kamerlin\">{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 20099310\n| pmc = 2841229\n| year = 2010\n| last1 = Kamerlin\n| first1 = S.

The reduction of [[activation energy]] (''E''<sub>a</sub>) increases the fraction of reactant molecules that can overcome this barrier and form the product. An important principle is that since they only reduce energy barriers between products and reactants, enzymes always catalyze reactions in both directions, and cannot drive a reaction forward or affect the equilibrium position - only the speed with which is it achieved. As with other catalysts, the enzyme is not consumed or changed by the reaction (as a substrate is) but is recycled such that a single enzyme performs many rounds of catalysis.\n\n==Induced fit== <!--'Induced fit' redirects to this section -->\n[[File:Hexokinase induced fit.svg|alt=Hexokinase displayed as an opaque surface with a pronounced open binding cleft next to unbound substrate (top) and the same enzyme with more closed cleft that surrounds the bound substrate (bottom)|thumb|250px|Enzyme changes shape by induced fit upon substrate binding to form enzyme-substrate complex.

There are two different mechanisms of substrate binding: uniform binding, which has strong substrate binding, and differential binding, which has strong transition state binding. The stabilizing effect of uniform binding increases both substrate and transition state binding affinity, while differential binding increases only transition state binding affinity. Both are used by enzymes and have been evolutionarily chosen to minimize the activation energy of the reaction. Enzymes that are saturated, that is, have a high affinity substrate binding, require differential binding to reduce the energy of activation, whereas small substrate unbound enzymes may use either differential or uniform binding.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anslyn|first1=E.V.|last2=Dougherty|first2=D.A.|title=Modern Physical Organic Chemistry|date=2006|publisher=University Science Books|isbn=978-1-891389-31-3}}</ref>\n\nThese effects have led to most proteins using the differential binding mechanism to reduce the energy of activation, so most substrates have high affinity for the enzyme while in the transition state. Differential binding is carried out by the induced fit mechanism - the substrate first binds weakly, then the enzyme changes conformation increasing the affinity to the transition state and stabilizing it, so reducing the activation energy to reach it.\n\nIt is important to clarify, however, that the induced fit concept cannot be used to rationalize catalysis. That is, the chemical catalysis is defined as the reduction of ''E''<sub>a</sub><sup>\u2021</sup> (when the system is already in the ES<sup>\u2021</sup>) relative to ''E''<sub>a</sub><sup>\u2021</sup> in the uncatalyzed reaction in water (without the enzyme). The induced fit only suggests that the barrier is lower in the closed form of the enzyme but does not tell us what the reason for the barrier reduction is.\n\nInduced fit may be beneficial to the fidelity of molecular recognition in the presence of competition and noise via the [[conformational proofreading]] mechanism\n.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000468 | year=2007 | author=Savir Y | author2=Tlusty T | title=Conformational Proofreading: The Impact of Conformational Changes on the Specificity of Molecular Recognition | volume=2 | issue=5 | pages=e468 | journal=[[PLOS One]] | url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PLoSONE2007.pdf | pmid=17520027 | pmc=1868595 | editor1-last=Scalas | editor1-first=Enrico | bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..468S | access-date=22 August 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514055337/http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/tlusty/papers/PLoSONE2007.pdf | archive-date=14 May 2011 | url-status=dead }}{{open access}}</ref>\n\n==Mechanisms of an alternative reaction route==\nThese conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the [[active site]] close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction. After binding takes place, one or more mechanisms of catalysis lowers the energy of the reaction's [[transition state]], by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction. There are six possible mechanisms of \"over the barrier\" catalysis as well as a \"through the barrier\" mechanism:\n\n===Proximity and orientation===\nEnzyme-substrate interactions align the reactive chemical groups and hold them close together in an optimal geometry, which increases the rate of the reaction. This reduces the [[entropy]] of the reactants and thus makes addition or transfer reactions less unfavorable, since a reduction in the overall entropy when two reactants become a single product. However this is a general effect and is seen in non-addition or transfer reactions where it occurs due to an increase in the \"effective concentration\" of the reagents. This is understood when considering how increases in concentration leads to increases in reaction rate: essentially when the reactants are more concentrated, they collide more often and so react more often. In enzyme catalysis, the binding of the reagents to the enzyme restricts the conformational space of the reactants, holding them in the 'proper orientation' and close to each other, so that the collide more frequently, and with the correct geometry, to facilitate the desired reaction.  The \"effective concentration\" is the concentration  the reactant would have to be, free in solution, to experiences the same collisional frequency. Often such theoretical effective concentrations are unphysical and impossible to realize in reality - which is a testament to the great catalytic power of many enzymes, with massive rate increases over the uncatalyzed state.\n\n{| width=800px align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"10\" style=\"border: 1px solid #a79c83\"\n|<small>For example:</small>\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | '''Similar reactions will occur far faster if the reaction is intramolecular.'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | [[Image:Inter vs intramolecular reaction rates.png]]\n|-\n| align=\"center\" | ''The effective concentration of [[acetate]] in the intramolecular reaction can be estimated as k<sub>2</sub>/k<sub>1</sub> = 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> Molar.''\n|}\n\nHowever, the situation might be more complex, since modern computational studies have established that traditional examples of proximity effects cannot be related directly to enzyme entropic effects.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja972723x | last1 = Stanton | first1 = R.V. | last2 = Perakyla | first2 = M. | last3 = Bakowies | first3 = D. | last4 = Kollman | first4 = P.A. | year = 1998 | title = Combined ab initio and Free Energy Calculations To Study Reactions in Enzymes and Solution: Amide Hydrolysis in Trypsin and Aqueous Solution | url = | journal = J.

This is related to the overall principle of catalysis, that of reducing energy barriers, since in general transition stated are high energy states, and by stabilizing them this high energy is reduced, lowering the barrier. A key feature of enzyme catalysis over many non-biological catalysis, is that both acid and base catalysis can be combined in the same reaction. In many abiotic systems, acids (large [H+]) or bases ( large concentration H+ sinks, or species with electron pairs) can increase the rate of the reaction; but of course the environment can only have one overall pH (measure of acidity or basicity (alkalinity)). However since enzymes are large molecules, they can position both acid groups and basic groups in their active site to interact with their substrates, and employ both modes independent of the bulk pH.\n\nOften general acid or base catalysis is employed to activate [[nucleophile]] and/or [[electrophile]] groups, or to stabilizing leaving groups. Many amino acids with acidic or basic groups are this employed in the active site, such as the glutamic and aspartic acid, histidine, cystine, tyrosine, lysine and arginine, as well as serine and threonine. In addition, the peptide backbone, with carbonyl and amide N groups is often employed. [[Cystine]] and [[Histidine]] are very commonly involved, since they both have a [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] close to neutral [[pH]] and can therefore both accept and donate protons.\n\nMany reaction mechanisms involving acid/base catalysis assume a substantially altered pKa. This alteration of pKa is possible through the local environment of the residue{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Conditions\n! Acids\n! Bases\n|-\n!

This strengthens the electrostatic interactions between the charged/polar substrates and the active sites. In addition, studies have shown that the charge distributions about the active sites are arranged so as to stabilize the transition states of the catalyzed reactions.

An alternative mechanism is [[schiff base]] formation using the free [[amine]] from a [[lysine]] residue, as seen in the enzyme [[aldolase]] during [[glycolysis]].\n\nSome enzymes utilize non-amino acid [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] such as [[pyridoxal phosphate]] (PLP) or [[thiamine pyrophosphate]] (TPP) to form covalent intermediates with reactant molecules.<ref>Toney, M.

A true proposal of a covalent catalysis (where the barrier is lower than the corresponding barrier in solution) would require, for example, a partial covalent bond to the transition state by an enzyme group (e.g., a very strong hydrogen bond), and such effects do not contribute significantly to catalysis.\n\n=== Metal ion catalysis ===\nA metal ion in the active site participates in catalysis by coordinating charge stabilization and shielding.

The enzyme of high energy content may firstly transfer some specific energetic group X<sub>1</sub> from catalytic site of the enzyme to the final place of the first bound reactant, then another group X<sub>2</sub> from the second bound reactant (or from the second group of the single reactant) must be transferred to active site to finish substrate conversion to product and enzyme regeneration.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11010-011-0742-4| pmid = 21318350| title = Is the enzyme a powerful reactant of the biochemical reaction?| journal = Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry| volume = 352| issue = 1\u20132| pages = 87\u20139| year = 2011| last1 = Foigel| first1 = Alexander G.}}</ref>\n\nWe can present the whole enzymatic reaction as a two coupling reactions:\n \n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>{S1} + EX1 -> S1EX1 -> {P1} + EP2</chem>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>{S2} + EP2 -> S2EP2 -> {P2} + EX2</chem>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nIt may be seen from reaction ({{EquationNote|1}}) that the group X<sub>1</sub> of the active enzyme appears in the product due to possibility of the exchange reaction inside enzyme to avoid both electrostatic inhibition and repulsion of atoms. So we represent the active enzyme as a powerful reactant of the enzymatic reaction. The reaction ({{EquationNote|2}}) shows incomplete conversion of the substrate because its group X<sub>2</sub> remains inside enzyme.   This approach as idea had formerly proposed relying on the hypothetical extremely high enzymatic conversions (catalytically perfect enzyme).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fogel | first1 = A.G. | year = 1982 | title = Cooperativity of enzymatic reactions and molecular aspects of energy transduction | url = | journal = Mol.

This chemical aspect is supported by the well-studied mechanisms of the several enzymatic reactions. Consider the reaction of peptide bond hydrolysis catalyzed by a pure protein \u03b1-chymotrypsin (an enzyme acting without a cofactor), which is a well-studied member of the serine proteases family, see.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hengge | first1 = AC | last2 = Stein | first2 = RL | year = 2004 | title = Role of protein conformational mobility in enzyme catalysis: acylation of alpha-chymotrypsin by specific peptide substrates | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 742\u2013747 | doi = 10.1021/bi030222k | pmid = 14730979 }}</ref>\n\nWe present the experimental results for this reaction as two chemical steps:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>{S1} + EH -> {P1} + EP2</chem>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|<chem>{EP2} + {H-O-H} -> {EH} + P2</chem>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nwhere S<sub>1</sub>  is a polypeptide,  P<sub>1</sub>  and P<sub>2</sub>  are products. The first chemical step  ({{EquationNote|3}})  includes the formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. The second step ({{EquationNote|4}}) is the deacylation step. It is important to note that the group H+, initially found on the enzyme, but not in water, appears in the product before the step of hydrolysis, therefore it may be considered as an additional group of the enzymatic reaction.\n\nThus, the reaction ({{EquationNote|3}}) shows that the enzyme acts as a powerful reactant of the reaction. According to the proposed concept, the H transport from the enzyme promotes the first reactant conversion, breakdown of the first initial chemical bond (between groups P<sub>1</sub>  and P<sub>2</sub>). The step of hydrolysis leads to a breakdown of the second chemical bond and regeneration of the enzyme.\n\nThe proposed chemical mechanism does not depend on the concentration of the substrates or products in the medium.  However, a shift in their concentration mainly causes free energy changes in the first and final steps of the reactions  ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}})  due to the changes in the free energy content of every molecule, whether S or P, in water solution.\nThis approach is in accordance with the following mechanism of muscle contraction. The final step of ATP hydrolysis in skeletal muscle is the product release caused by the association of myosin heads with actin.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lymn | first1 = RW | last2 = Taylor | first2 = EW. | year = 1971 | title = Mechanism of adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis by actomyosin | url = | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 10 | issue = 25| pages = 4617\u20134624 | doi=10.1021/bi00801a004| pmid = 4258719 }}</ref> The closing of the actin-binding cleft during the association reaction is structurally coupled with the opening of the nucleotide-binding pocket on the myosin active site.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holmes | first1 = KC | last2 = Angert | first2 = I | last3 = Kull | first3 = FG | last4 = Jahn | first4 = W | last5 = Schroder | first5 = RR. | year = 2003 | title = Electron cryo-microscopy shows how strong binding of myosin to actin releases nucleotide | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 425 | issue = 6956| pages = 423\u2013427 | doi=10.1038/nature02005|bibcode = 2003Natur.425..423H | pmid=14508495}}</ref>\n\nNotably, the final steps of ATP hydrolysis include the fast release of phosphate and the slow release of ADP.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Siemankowski | first1 = RF | last2 = Wiseman | first2 = MO | last3 = White | first3 = HD. | year = 1985 | title = ADP dissociation from actomyosin subfragment 1 is sufficiently slow to limit the unloaded shortening velocity in vertebrate muscle | url = | journal = Proc.
