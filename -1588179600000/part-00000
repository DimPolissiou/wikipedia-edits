In 2004, it was altered again, this time to limit access to gun trace data by government officials, and to ban the use of such data in firearms license revocations or civil lawsuits.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Webster |first=Daniel W. |last2=Vernick |first2=Jon S. |last3=Bulzacchelli |first3=Maria T. |last4=Vittes |first4=Katherine A. |date=2012-02-01 |title=Temporal Association between Federal Gun Laws and the Diversion of Guns to Criminals in Milwaukee |journal=Journal of Urban Health |language=en |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=87\u201397 |doi=10.1007/s11524-011-9639-5 |pmid=22218834 |issn=1099-3460|pmc=3284599 }}</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[Dickey Amendment]] of 1996\n*[[Gun law in the United States]]\n*[[Gun politics in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web |url=http://smartgunlaws.org/federal-law-on-tiahrt-amendments/ |title=Federal Law on Tiahrt Amendments |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=May 21, 2012 |website=smartgunlaws.org |publisher=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence |accessdate=July 7, 2014 }}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2013/the-tiahrt-amendment-on-firearms-traces-protecting-gun-owners-privacy-and-law-enforcement-safety.aspx |title=The \"Tiahrt Amendment\" on Firearms Traces: Protecting Gun Owners' Privacy and Law Enforcement Safety |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=January 15, 2013 |website=nraila.org |publisher=National Rifle Association of America Institute for Legislative Action |accessdate=July 7, 2014 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/in-the-news/2003/7/firearms-measure-surprises-some-in-gop.aspx NRA-ILA: Firearms Measure Surprises Some in GOP]\n\n[[Category:2003 in law]]\n[[Category:108th United States Congress]]\n[[Category:Gun politics in the United_States]]\n[[Category:United States federal legislation articles without infoboxes]]\n[[Category:Legal history of the United States]]\n[[Category:United States federal firearms legislation]]\n\n\n{{US-law-stub}}\n", "text_old": "The '''Tiahrt Amendment''' is a provision of the U.S. Department of Justice [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations bill]] that prohibits the [[National Tracing Center]] of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) from releasing information from its firearms trace database to anyone other than a law enforcement agency or prosecutor in connection with a criminal investigation.<ref name=GrimaldiHorwitz>{{cite news |last1=Grimaldi |first1=James V. |last2=Horwitz |first2=Sari |date=October 24, 2010 |title=Industry pressure hides gun traces, protects dealers from public scrutiny |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/23/AR2010102302996.html |newspaper=Washington Post |accessdate =July 6, 2014}}</ref> This precludes gun trace data from being used in academic research of gun use in crime.<ref name=GrimaldiHorwitz/> Additionally, the law blocks any data legally released from being admissible in civil lawsuits against gun sellers or manufacturers.<ref name=GrimaldiHorwitz/>\n\nThe Congressional Research Service has repeatedly said \"firearm trace data may be biased\" and \"cannot be used to test for statistical significance between firearm traces in general and the wider population of firearms available to criminals or the wider American public.\u201d[1] These limitations exist because the \"tracing system is an operational system designed to help law enforcement agencies identify the ownership path of individual firearms.

It was signed into the law as part of this bill on February 20, 2003. It was subsequently broadened in October 2003 with the addition of two provisions banning the ATF from requiring gun dealers to inspect their firearm inventories and requiring the FBI to destroy background check data within 24 hours. In 2004, it was altered again, this time to limit access to gun trace data by government officials, and to ban the use of such data in firearms license revocations or civil lawsuits.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Webster |first=Daniel W. |last2=Vernick |first2=Jon S. |last3=Bulzacchelli |first3=Maria T. |last4=Vittes |first4=Katherine A. |date=2012-02-01 |title=Temporal Association between Federal Gun Laws and the Diversion of Guns to Criminals in Milwaukee |journal=Journal of Urban Health |language=en |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=87\u201397 |doi=10.1007/s11524-011-9639-5 |pmid=22218834 |issn=1099-3460|pmc=3284599 }}</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[Dickey Amendment]] of 1996\n*[[Gun law in the United States]]\n*[[Gun politics in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite web |url=http://smartgunlaws.org/federal-law-on-tiahrt-amendments/ |title=Federal Law on Tiahrt Amendments |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=May 21, 2012 |website=smartgunlaws.org |publisher=Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence |accessdate=July 7, 2014 }}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2013/the-tiahrt-amendment-on-firearms-traces-protecting-gun-owners-privacy-and-law-enforcement-safety.aspx |title=The \"Tiahrt Amendment\" on Firearms Traces: Protecting Gun Owners' Privacy and Law Enforcement Safety |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=January 15, 2013 |website=nraila.org |publisher=National Rifle Association of America Institute for Legislative Action |accessdate=July 7, 2014 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/in-the-news/2003/7/firearms-measure-surprises-some-in-gop.aspx NRA-ILA: Firearms Measure Surprises Some in GOP]\n\n[[Category:2003 in law]]\n[[Category:108th United States Congress]]\n[[Category:Gun politics in the United_States]]\n[[Category:United States federal legislation articles without infoboxes]]\n[[Category:Legal history of the United States]]\n[[Category:United States federal firearms legislation]]\n\n\n{{US-law-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Jackcountry", "label": "safe", "comment": "corrected link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiahrt_Amendment"}
