The original Deadman character depicted him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Funeral director|mortician]] dressed in a [[trench coat]], gray-striped tie and gray-ringed, black [[stetson hat]] with gray gloves and [[Spats (footwear)|boot spats]]. He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks.

During the match, Calaway was referred to as The Undertaker, omitting the name 'Kane', which was dropped shortly after the event (and seven years later was given to another wrestler who eventually became Undertaker's [[Kane (wrestler)|younger brother]] of the same name). At the same time, The Undertaker switched [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] from Brother Love to [[Paul Bearer]] \u2013 a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[ghost]]ly character, almost always seen bearing an [[urn]], which he used to revive The Undertaker's strength whenever Undertaker fell victim to his opponents.

The turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of ''Superstars'', when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the ''Funeral Parlor'' set over that incident (aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]''). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply \"Not yours!\", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off. The Undertaker defeated Roberts at [[WrestleMania VIII]].<ref name=legacy /> He then feuded extensively with wrestlers managed by [[Harvey Wippleman]] throughout 1992 and 1993, such as [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] and [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (wrestler)|Giant Gonz\u00e1lez]].

Mankind cost The Undertaker the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] at [[In Your House 8: Beware of Dog]], assisting champion [[Goldust]] to victory. As a result, the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Location-based variations|Boiler Room Brawl]] was booked between the two at [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]].

In this then-new form, he took on a Gothic, brash and [[Rebellion|rebelling]] persona (perhaps to better fit in with the then-budding, more adult-oriented Attitude Era). In this form, he proclaimed himself as \"The Lord of Darkness\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family. It was during this time that The Undertaker also made an appearance in [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]], defeating [[Jinsei Shinzaki|Hakushi]] in a singles match.<ref name=PWInsiderTakervs.Hakushi>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=22474&p=1|title=PWInsider.com \u2014 Undertaker in Japan|accessdate=March 19, 2013|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2lcw1_michinoku-pro-undertaker-vs-hakushi_sport#.UUipFBzry5c|title=Michinoku Pro: Undertaker vs. Hakushi|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Undertaker standing 1997.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Undertaker in September 1997]]\nConcurrent to the deep, dark secret storyline directed by Bearer, Undertaker began a new rivalry at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] when [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] [[Shawn Michaels]] accidentally hit The Undertaker with a steel chair shot meant for Bret Hart, costing Undertaker the WWF Championship.<ref name=pwi98 /> After a double count-out draw during [[Ground Zero: In Your House]], Undertaker challenged Michaels to the first [[Hell in a Cell|Hell in a Cell match]] at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]].

The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary. In September 1999, on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]] main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against [[Triple H]].

The Undertaker became one of the most prominent figures of the [[Attitude Era]], featuring in various pivotal storylines and matches as WWF sustained a boom period in business in the late 1990s.

He made his debut as Kane the Undertaker at a taping of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' on November 19, 1990. The original Deadman character depicted him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Funeral director|mortician]] dressed in a [[trench coat]], gray-striped tie and gray-ringed, black [[stetson hat]] with gray gloves and [[Spats (footwear)|boot spats]]. He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks. Calaway made his official on-camera debut on November 22 at [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series]] as a villainous character when he was the mystery partner of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Team.<ref name=pwi89>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\", p. 88\u201389.</ref> Approximately one minute into the match, The Undertaker eliminated [[Koko B.

He also eliminated [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] before being [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]]; however, his team won the match with DiBiase being the sole survivor. During the match, Calaway was referred to as The Undertaker, omitting the name 'Kane', which was dropped shortly after the event (and seven years later was given to another wrestler who eventually became Undertaker's [[Kane (wrestler)|younger brother]] of the same name). At the same time, The Undertaker switched [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] from Brother Love to [[Paul Bearer]] \u2013 a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[ghost]]ly character, almost always seen bearing an [[urn]], which he used to revive The Undertaker's strength whenever Undertaker fell victim to his opponents.

At [[King of the Ring]] 1991, Undertaker defeated Animal in a qualifying match before fighting Sid Vicious to a double [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] in the Semi-Final, which saw both men eliminated from the [[King of the Ring tournament]]. The Undertaker defeated Hulk Hogan to win his first WWF Championship at [[Survivor Series (1991)|Survivor Series]] with the help of [[Ric Flair]] and thus became the youngest WWF Champion in history, until having this record broken by [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]] in April 1993 at [[WrestleMania IX]].<ref name=pwi90>PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\", p. 89\u201390.</ref> WWF President [[Jack Tunney]] ordered a rematch for [[This Tuesday in Texas]] six days later, where he lost the title back to Hogan.<ref name=pwi90 /> However, due to the controversial endings of the two title matches between The Undertaker and Hogan, the title was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vacant|vacated]] by Tunney. The title was awarded to Ric Flair as the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (1992)|1992]] Royal Rumble match.\n\nIn February 1992, The Undertaker's ally [[Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts]] tried to attack [[\"Macho Man\" Randy Savage]]'s manager/wife [[Miss Elizabeth]] with a steel chair when Undertaker stopped him, becoming a [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] for the first time. The turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of ''Superstars'', when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the ''Funeral Parlor'' set over that incident (aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]''). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply \"Not yours!\", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off. The Undertaker defeated Roberts at [[WrestleMania VIII]].<ref name=legacy /> He then feuded extensively with wrestlers managed by [[Harvey Wippleman]] throughout 1992 and 1993, such as [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] and [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (wrestler)|Giant Gonz\u00e1lez]].

In this then-new form, he took on a Gothic, brash and [[Rebellion|rebelling]] persona (perhaps to better fit in with the then-budding, more adult-oriented Attitude Era). In this form, he proclaimed himself as \"The Lord of Darkness\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family. It was during this time that The Undertaker also made an appearance in [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]], defeating [[Jinsei Shinzaki|Hakushi]] in a singles match.<ref name=PWInsiderTakervs.Hakushi>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=22474&p=1|title=PWInsider.com \u2014 Undertaker in Japan|accessdate=March 19, 2013|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2lcw1_michinoku-pro-undertaker-vs-hakushi_sport#.UUipFBzry5c|title=Michinoku Pro: Undertaker vs. Hakushi|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Undertaker standing 1997.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Undertaker in September 1997]]\nConcurrent to the deep, dark secret storyline directed by Bearer, Undertaker began a new rivalry at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] when [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] [[Shawn Michaels]] accidentally hit The Undertaker with a steel chair shot meant for Bret Hart, costing Undertaker the WWF Championship.<ref name=pwi98 /> After a double count-out draw during [[Ground Zero: In Your House]], Undertaker challenged Michaels to the first [[Hell in a Cell|Hell in a Cell match]] at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]]. During this match, The Undertaker's storyline half-brother Kane finally made his debut under the control of Paul Bearer, ripping off the door to the cell and giving The Undertaker a ''Tombstone Piledriver'', Undertaker's trademark finisher, allowing Michaels to pin him.<ref name=pwi98 /> As the storyline progressed through Bearer, Kane challenged The Undertaker, but Undertaker consistently refused to fight his half-brother. The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary. In September 1999, on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]] main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against [[Triple H]].
