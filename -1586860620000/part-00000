Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 February 1853 aged 96. Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871.{{r|LCC:Death}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of [[Tenterground]] at [[Spitalfields]], [[London]]. Furthermore, Cooke's father, Francis, is recorded in the 1762 [[English Land Tax|Land Tax Assessment]] Book for the Parish of Saint Mary, Whitechapel, as residing between [[Alie Street]] and [[Leman Street|Leman Street (West side)]], close to the corner of North and East Tenter Streets.{{r|\"Land Tax\"}}{{r|Location of Tenterground}}.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 February 1853 aged 96. Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871.{{r|LCC:Death}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of [[Tenterground]] at [[Spitalfields]], [[London]]. Furthermore, Cooke's father, Francis, is recorded in the 1762 [[English Land Tax|Land Tax Assessment]] Book for the Parish of Saint Mary, Whitechapel, as residing between [[Alie Street]] and [[Leman Street|Leman Street (West side)]], close to the corner of North and East Tenter Streets.{{r|\"Land Tax\"}}{{r|Location of Tenterground}}.

However, after winning just one of the four contests (a 21-14 victory against the [[New England Patriots]] on November 11), he was replaced by [[Mike Phipps]].\n\nThe team's disastrous [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]] saw Sipe enter the starting lineup after three consecutive losses in which the Browns were outscored 124-26.  Sipe's three starts reduced the margin of defeat for the squad, but still resulted in a trio of defeats, sending him back to the sidelines.  The following year, he finally moved into a consistent starting role following an opening game injury to Phipps on September 12, [[1976 NFL season|1976]].  As the team's signal caller that season, he led them to a 9-5 record, a six-game improvement over the previous season. 1976 was the team's second year under head coach [[Forrest Gregg]].\n\nDuring the first half of the [[1977 NFL season|1977 season]], he led the team to five wins in their first seven games.  However, on November 13 of that year, Sipe suffered a season-ending shoulder injury at [[Three Rivers Stadium]] against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] in the second quarter of the team's 35-31 defeat. With Phipps gone to the [[Chicago Bears]], the Browns turned to back-up quarterback [[Dave Mays]], who went 1-3 as a starter. The 1977 also saw a head coaching change as Gregg was fired and defensive coordinator [[Dick Modzelewski]] took over for the final game.<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/1977.htm</ref> Sipe came back the following year to throw for more than 2,900 yards and 21 touchdown passes, but the team's overall inconsistency resulted in an 8-8 finish.\n\nServing as the catalyst for many thrilling moments during the [[1979 NFL season|1979]] and [[1980 NFL season|1980 seasons]], Sipe helped the team earn the nickname \"[[Kardiac Kids]].\"  The designation was in recognition of their tendency to produce heart-stopping comeback victories in the final minutes of many games. Over the course of these two seasons, Sipe led the Browns to eight comebacks and eleven game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime.<ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/comeback.cgi?player=SipeBr00 \"Brian Sipe's Career 4th quarter comebacks and game-winning drives\"] Pro-Football-Reference.com</ref>\n\nSipe lead Cleveland to a 4-0 start in 1979, including a season opening overtime win over the [[New York Jets]].\n\n====1980 MVP award winning season====\nIn [[1980 NFL season|1980]], Sipe passed for 4,132 yards and 30 touchdowns, helping to lead the Browns to their first postseason berth since [[1972 NFL season|1972]].  Individually, his efforts earned him the [[NFL MVP]] award and a selection to the [[1981 Pro Bowl]].\n\nAt the end of the divisional playoff game the Browns played against the Raiders following the [[1980 NFL season]], the Browns trailed the Raiders with a score of 14-12. After the Browns forced the Raiders to turn the ball over on downs on their own 15-yard line, Sipe led the Browns back down the field, reaching the Raiders 13-yard line in 9 plays. With just 49 seconds remaining, the Browns could have settled for a game-winning field goal, but due to the brutally cold and windy weather in Cleveland that day (which rendered a field goal attempt significantly more risky) Browns [[head coach]] [[Sam Rutigliano]] instead opted to pass the ball. Sipe attempted a pass to Browns [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] tight end [[Ozzie Newsome]], but it was intercepted in the end zone by Raiders safety [[Mike Davis (defensive back)|Mike Davis]]. That play brought the Browns' season to a heartbreaking close, while the Raiders went on to win [[Super Bowl XV]] over the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. The play call - \"[[Red Right 88]]\" - would be immortalized in Cleveland sports infamy.\n\n====1981-82 seasons====\n[[File:Sipe2.jpg|thumb|Sipe signing autographs in Canton, Ohio in 1979.]]\nDespite throwing for 3,876 yards the [[1981 NFL season|following year]], Sipe was at the controls as the team staggered to a 5-11 mark.  In [[1982 NFL season|1982]], Sipe and the Browns won just two of the team's first six games in the strike-marred NFL season, and Sipe was benched in favor of third-year signal caller [[Paul McDonald (American football)|Paul McDonald]].\n\n===United States Football League===\nSipe regained his starting role the following year, but angered Browns management by negotiating with [[New Jersey Generals]] of the [[United States Football League]] (USFL) during the season. Sipe finished the season with 3,566 passing yards and 26 touchdown passes. Sipe had led Cleveland to a 9\u20137 record and the team just missed qualifying for the AFC playoffs. He then signed with the Generals and played for them in 1984, before concluding his career with the [[Jacksonville Bulls]] in 1985. Sipe's contract with New Jersey was a three-year deal for $600,000.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/12/27/Brian-Sipe-a-13th-round-draft-pick-who-survived-12/6378441349200/</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nSipe lives in [[San Diego]] and coached the football team at [[Santa Fe Christian Schools|Santa Fe Christian School]] in [[Solana Beach, California]], where he helped the Eagles to four CIF titles and a combined record of 75-21-1. Sipe was hired on January 18, 2009, as the quarterbacks coach for his alma mater, San Diego State.

The play call - \"[[Red Right 88]]\" - would be immortalized in Cleveland sports infamy.\n\n====1981-82 seasons====\n[[File:Sipe2.jpg|thumb|Sipe signing autographs in Canton, Ohio in 1979.]]\nDespite throwing for 3,876 yards the [[1981 NFL season|following year]], Sipe was at the controls as the team staggered to a 5-11 mark.  In [[1982 NFL season|1982]], Sipe and the Browns won just two of the team's first six games in the strike-marred NFL season, and Sipe was benched in favor of third-year signal caller [[Paul McDonald (American football)|Paul McDonald]].\n\n===United States Football League===\nSipe regained his starting role the following year, but angered Browns management by negotiating with [[New Jersey Generals]] of the [[United States Football League]] (USFL) during the season. Sipe finished the season with 3,566 passing yards and 26 touchdown passes. Sipe had led Cleveland to a 9\u20137 record and the team just missed qualifying for the AFC playoffs. He then signed with the Generals and played for them in 1984, before concluding his career with the [[Jacksonville Bulls]] in 1985. Sipe's contract with New Jersey was a three-year deal for $600,000.<ref>https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/12/27/Brian-Sipe-a-13th-round-draft-pick-who-survived-12/6378441349200/</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nSipe lives in [[San Diego]] and coached the football team at [[Santa Fe Christian Schools|Santa Fe Christian School]] in [[Solana Beach, California]], where he helped the Eagles to four CIF titles and a combined record of 75-21-1. Sipe was hired on January 18, 2009, as the quarterbacks coach for his alma mater, San Diego State.  Sipe served in that role through the end of the 2014 season.<ref name=\"SDS\" />\n\n==Career stats==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!|Year\n!|Team\n!|GP\n!|Att\n!|Comp\n!|Pct.\n!|Yards\n!|TDs\n!|INTs\n!|QB Rating\n|-\n|1974||Cleveland Browns||10||108||59||54.6||603||1||7||47.0\n|-\n|1975||Cleveland Browns||7||88||45||51.1||427||1||3||54.4\n|-\n|1976||Cleveland Browns||14||312||178||57.1||2113||17||14||77.3\n|-\n|1977||Cleveland Browns||9||195||112||57.4||1233||9||14||61.8\n|-\n|1978||Cleveland Browns||16||399||222||55.6||2906||21||15||80.7\n|-\n|1979||Cleveland Browns||16||535||286||53.5||3793||28||26||73.4\n|-\n|1980||Cleveland Browns||16||554||337||60.8||4132||30||14||91.4\n|-\n|1981||Cleveland Browns||16||567||313||55.2||3876||17||25||68.2\n|-\n|1982||Cleveland Browns||6||185||101||54.6||1064||4||8||60.7\n|-\n|1983||Cleveland Browns||15||496||291||58.7||3566||26||23||79.1\n|-\n!NFL <br>Career Totals\n|||125||3439||1944||56.5||23713||154||149||74.8\n|-\n|1984||New Jersey Generals||16||324||192||59.3||2540||17||15||82.3\n|-\n|1985||Jacksonville Bulls||-||89||55||61.8||685||4||2||91.5\n|-\n!USFL <br>Career Totals\n|||-||413||247||56.5||3225||21||17||84.3\n|}\n'''Key to Abbreviations'''<br>\nGP= Games Played<br>\nAtt= Passes attempted<br>\nCom= Passes Completed<br>\nPct= [[Completion percentage]]<br>\nYds= Yards<br>\nTD= [[Touchdown]]s<br>\nInt= [[Interception]]s<br>\nRate= [[Passer rating]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of NCAA major college football yearly passing leaders]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{San Diego State Aztecs quarterback navbox}}\n{{Browns1972DraftPicks}}\n{{Cleveland Browns starting quarterback navbox}}\n{{AP NFL MVPs}}\n{{NFL passing touchdown leaders}}\n{{NFL quarterbacks with a perfect passer rating}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sipe, Brian}}\n[[Category:1949 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American football quarterbacks]]\n[[Category:Cleveland Browns players]]\n[[Category:Grossmont Griffins football players]]\n[[Category:Jacksonville Bulls players]]\n[[Category:New Jersey Generals players]]\n[[Category:San Diego State Aztecs football coaches]]\n[[Category:San Diego State Aztecs football players]]\n[[Category:High school football coaches in California]]\n[[Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players]]\n[[Category:Players of American football from California]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from San Diego]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from El Cajon, California]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNational Football League:Typo/generalfixes, replaced: teams second \u2192 team's second", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Sipe"}

He was a local viewed as below her status. The pair had 11 children in total, including Tamaraeroa, Huirapa, Tahumat\u0101, Pahirua and Hinehou.<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/> Huirapa is the son who K\u0101ti Huirapa descends from.\n\nT\u016bhaitara instructed Tamaraeroa and Huirapa to kill Marukore at a place called Papanui.<ref name=\"Papanui\"/> However, Marukore knew of their plan and defeated them in the Battle of H\u016bkete after which their sister Hinehou laid them on the floor of her [[whare]], leaving her belongings with them before burning down the building in an incident now known as 'K\u0101rara K\u014dpae' (The Laying Down of Fighting Chiefs).<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/> Alternatively, Marukore himself burned their bodies on a funeral pyre.<ref name=\"Papanui\"/>\n\nNext the brothers Pahirua and Tahumat\u0101 sought out to defeat Marukore. As they were about to take advice from a local chief named R\u0101kaimoari, his daughter Hinewai-a-tapu made a remark about Tahumat\u0101 which sparked the Battle of Te Pakiaka ('The Roots') that lasted for some days. It was named so because Tahumat\u0101 caught Hinewai-a-tapu hiding under some tree roots, and made her his wife.<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/>\n\nEventually the Ng\u0101ti Mamoe chief Hikaororoa managed to trap Marukore's party in a whare. Hikaororoa asked for the 'chief of the long plume' to come to the door to be cannibalised. Marukore's younger cousin Rokopaekawa took Marukore's head dress (the sign of status) and was sacrificed instead. However he did not cook properly, and the head dress's plume was still visible in the dirt. This was considered a bad omen and so the body was discarded with the incident being called 'Pikit\u016broa' ('The Long Standing Feather Plumes')<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/>\n\nMarukore and T\u016bhaitara would both die in the Battle of Tapapanui.

Of this Te Hikutawatawa (later named T\u016b\u0101huriri), the ancestor of Ng\u0101i T\u016b\u0101huriri, was born a bastard. T\u016bmaro left for Waimea, near [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] with his family members, leaving Te Aohikuraki and Te Hikutawatawa behind. Te Hikutawatawa would later visit Waimea seeking to learn of his heritage. Te Hikutawatawa was outraged his [[mana]] being defiled by T\u016bmaro's father Kahukura-te-paku, and so returned to destroy the site, killing everyone who lived there. After this he was known as T\u016b\u0101huriri ('t\u016b\u0101hu' meaning 'sacred altar', 'riri' meaning 'to be angry').<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\">{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/tuahuriri/| title=T\u016b\u0101huriri| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLate in the 17th century the tribe began migrating to the northern part of the South Island under the leadership of the Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b chief P\u016braho, with his sons Maru and Mako, establishing Kaihinu [[P\u0101]] in the [[Tory Channel|Tory Channel / Kura Te Au]]. After an incident in which a Ng\u0101i Tahu war party had desecrated the bones of one of [[Ng\u0101i Tara]]'s ancestors, P\u016braho was murdered in revenge early one morning when he went to relieve himself. This broke out into a series of battles between the two tribes.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nOn one occasion when Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b fought with [[Rangit\u0101ne]], Chief T\u016bteurutira had mistaken one of his captives, Hinerongo, as one of the enemy's women. She was in fact a member of Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe who had already been taken captive by Rangit\u0101ne, and so he returned her to Matariki P\u0101 on the [[Clarence River, New Zealand|Clarence River]]. This struck a new alliance between their tribes, after which they successfully attacked Rangit\u0101ne in the [[Wairau River|Wairau Valley]]. For this Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe then ceded the east coast regions north of the Clarence River to Ng\u0101i Tahu, and T\u016bteurutira and Hinerongo married and settled at the p\u0101. Ng\u0101i Tahu continued to push south, conquering [[Kaik\u014dura]].<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nBy the 1690s Ng\u0101i Tahu had settled in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], including Ng\u0101ti Irakehu peaceably settling among [[Banks Peninsula]]'s Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/> From there they spread further south and into the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. As a consequence for ignoring Chief Te Aweawe's advice to strap two canoes together for a safer passage across the [[Cook Strait]], T\u016b\u0101huriri is said to have been left to drown along with T\u016bmaro, and likely his eldest son H\u0101mua while trying to leave Wellington as some of the last members to make the migration.<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\"/>\n\n===18th century===\nT\u016b\u0101huriri's second eldest son T\u016brakautahi, the famous chief of Ng\u0101i T\u016bhaitara born with a [[club foot]], settled the p\u0101 at [[Woodend, New Zealand|Woodend]] along with other chiefs, which at the time was surrounded by swampland. He also established the p\u0101 north of [[Kaiapoi]] over a Waitaha site, and claimed the area around Banks Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/turakautahi/| title=T\u016brakautahi| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Interestingly, it is said to have been his decision to learn the genealogies and stories of the West Coast tribes [[Ng\u0101ti T\u016bmatak\u014dkiri]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Wairaki]], the latter of which already shared a common ancestry with N\u0101ti Tahu through an ancestor named Tura.

After a three-month siege, a fire in the p\u0101 allowed Ng\u0101ti Toa to overcome it. Ng\u0101ti Toa then attacked Ng\u0101i Tahu on [[Banks Peninsula]] and took the p\u0101 at [[Onawe]]. In 1832\u201333 Ng\u0101i Tahu retaliated under the leadership of [[T\u016bhawaiki]], Taiaroa, Karetai, and Haereroa, attacking Ng\u0101ti Toa at [[Lake Grassmere]]. Ng\u0101i Tahu prevailed, and killed many Ng\u0101ti Toa, although Te Rauparaha again escaped.\n\nFighting continued for a year or so, with Ng\u0101i Tahu maintaining the upper hand. Ng\u0101ti Toa never again made a major incursion into Ng\u0101i Tahu territory. In 1834 Chief Iwikau of Ng\u0101ti Rangi\u0101moa (senior line of Ng\u0101i Tuahuriri), brother of Te Maiharanui, led a war party into the [[Marlborough Sounds]], though Ng\u0101ti Toa had hidden from them and could not be found.

The recognised tribal authority, Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu, is based in [[Christchurch]] and in [[Invercargill]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\" />\n\n==Dialect==\n\nIn the nineteenth century many Ng\u0101i Tahu, particularly in the southern reaches of Te Wai Pounamu, spoke a distinct [[dialect]] of the [[M\u0101ori language]], sometimes referred to as ''Southern M\u0101ori'', which was so different from the northern version of the language that missionary Rev. [[James Watkin]], based at [[Karitane]] found materials prepared by [[North Island]] missions couldn't be used in [[Otago]].<ref name=\"harlow87\">Harlow, R. (1987).

But it lacks {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (\"ng\") \u2014 this sound merged with {{IPA|/k/}} in prehistoric times: for example: ''Ng\u0101i Tahu'' as opposed to ''K\u0101i Tahu''). This change did not occur in the northern part of the Ng\u0101i Tahu area, and the possible presence of additional phonemes ({{IPA|/b, p, l, r/}}) has been debated. Non-standard consonants are sometimes identified in the spellings of South Island place names, such as ''g'' (as distinct from ''k'', e.g., Katigi, Otago), ''v'' (e.g., Mavora), ''l'' instead of ''r'' (e.g., Little Akaloa, Kilmog, Waihola, Rakiula), and ''w'' or ''u'' instead of ''wh'' as reflecting dialect difference, but similar spellings and pronunciations also occur in the North Island (e.g. Tolaga Bay, Booai (P\u016bhoi)).<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\nThe [[apocope]] (the dropping of the final vowel of words) resulting from pronunciations like 'Wacky-white' for \"[[Waikouaiti]]\" have been identified with Southern M\u0101ori. However, the devoicing (rather than apocope) of final vowels occurs in the speech of native speakers of the M\u0101ori language throughout New Zealand, and the pronunciation of the names of North Island towns by locals often omits final vowels as well, like in the pronunciation of \"Paraparam\" or \"Waiuk\".<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTe R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is the governance entity of Ng\u0101i Tahu, following the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the iwi and the [[New Zealand Government]] under Ng\u0101i Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.<ref>For example: {{cite web|url=http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/research/|title=Research|website=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|publisher=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|accessdate=16 June 2014|quote=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is regularly approached by researchers and organisations seeking engagement, advice or support for various research projects.}}</ref> It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 and a T\u016bhono organisation.

He was a local viewed as below her status.

As they were about to take advice from a local chief named R\u0101kaimoari, his daughter Hinewai-a-tapu made a remark about Tahumat\u0101 which sparked the Battle of Te Pakiaka ('The Roots') that lasted for some days. It was named so because Tahumat\u0101 caught Hinewai-a-tapu hiding under some tree roots, and made her his wife.<ref name=\"TeKaraka2\"/>\n\nEventually the Ng\u0101ti Mamoe chief Hikaororoa managed to trap Marukore's party in a whare. Hikaororoa asked for the 'chief of the long plume' to come to the door to be cannibalised. Marukore's younger cousin Rokopaekawa took Marukore's head dress (the sign of status) and was sacrificed instead.

Of this Te Hikutawatawa (later named T\u016b\u0101huriri), the ancestor of Ng\u0101i T\u016b\u0101huriri, was born a bastard. T\u016bmaro left for Waimea, near [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] with his family members, leaving Te Aohikuraki and Te Hikutawatawa behind. Te Hikutawatawa would later visit Waimea seeking to learn of his heritage. Te Hikutawatawa was outraged his [[mana]] being defiled by T\u016bmaro's father Kahukura-te-paku, and so returned to destroy the site, killing everyone who lived there. After this he was known as T\u016b\u0101huriri ('t\u016b\u0101hu' meaning 'sacred altar', 'riri' meaning 'to be angry').<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\">{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/tuahuriri/| title=T\u016b\u0101huriri| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLate in the 17th century the tribe began migrating to the northern part of the South Island under the leadership of the Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b chief P\u016braho, with his sons Maru and Mako, establishing Kaihinu [[P\u0101]] in the [[Tory Channel|Tory Channel / Kura Te Au]]. After an incident in which a Ng\u0101i Tahu war party had desecrated the bones of one of [[Ng\u0101i Tara]]'s ancestors, P\u016braho was murdered in revenge early one morning when he went to relieve himself. This broke out into a series of battles between the two tribes.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nOn one occasion when Ng\u0101ti Kur\u012b fought with [[Rangit\u0101ne]], Chief T\u016bteurutira had mistaken one of his captives, Hinerongo, as one of the enemy's women. She was in fact a member of Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe who had already been taken captive by Rangit\u0101ne, and so he returned her to Matariki P\u0101 on the [[Clarence River, New Zealand|Clarence River]]. This struck a new alliance between their tribes, after which they successfully attacked Rangit\u0101ne in the [[Wairau River|Wairau Valley]]. For this Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe then ceded the east coast regions north of the Clarence River to Ng\u0101i Tahu, and T\u016bteurutira and Hinerongo married and settled at the p\u0101. Ng\u0101i Tahu continued to push south, conquering [[Kaik\u014dura]].<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/>\n\nBy the 1690s Ng\u0101i Tahu had settled in [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]], including Ng\u0101ti Irakehu peaceably settling among [[Banks Peninsula]]'s Ng\u0101ti M\u0101moe.<ref name=teara-ngaitahu/> From there they spread further south and into the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]]. As a consequence for ignoring Chief Te Aweawe's advice to strap two canoes together for a safer passage across the [[Cook Strait]], T\u016b\u0101huriri is said to have been left to drown along with T\u016bmaro, and likely his eldest son H\u0101mua while trying to leave Wellington as some of the last members to make the migration.<ref name=\"Tuahuriri\"/>\n\n===18th century===\nT\u016b\u0101huriri's second eldest son T\u016brakautahi, the famous chief of Ng\u0101i T\u016bhaitara born with a [[club foot]], settled the p\u0101 at [[Woodend, New Zealand|Woodend]] along with other chiefs, which at the time was surrounded by swampland. He also established the p\u0101 north of [[Kaiapoi]] over a Waitaha site, and claimed the area around Banks Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/ti-kouka-whenua/turakautahi/| title=T\u016brakautahi| publisher=Christchurch City Libraries| accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> Interestingly, it is said to have been his decision to learn the genealogies and stories of the West Coast tribes [[Ng\u0101ti T\u016bmatak\u014dkiri]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Wairaki]], the latter of which already shared a common ancestry with N\u0101ti Tahu through an ancestor named Tura.

After a three-month siege, a fire in the p\u0101 allowed Ng\u0101ti Toa to overcome it. Ng\u0101ti Toa then attacked Ng\u0101i Tahu on [[Banks Peninsula]] and took the p\u0101 at [[Onawe]]. In 1832\u201333 Ng\u0101i Tahu retaliated under the leadership of [[T\u016bhawaiki]], Taiaroa, Karetai, and Haereroa, attacking Ng\u0101ti Toa at [[Lake Grassmere]]. Ng\u0101i Tahu prevailed, and killed many Ng\u0101ti Toa, although Te Rauparaha again escaped.\n\nFighting continued for a year or so, with Ng\u0101i Tahu maintaining the upper hand. Ng\u0101ti Toa never again made a major incursion into Ng\u0101i Tahu territory. In 1834 Chief Iwikau of Ng\u0101ti Rangi\u0101moa (senior line of Ng\u0101i Tuahuriri), brother of Te Maiharanui, led a war party into the [[Marlborough Sounds]], though Ng\u0101ti Toa had hidden from them and could not be found.

The recognised tribal authority, Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu, is based in [[Christchurch]] and in [[Invercargill]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\" />\n\n==Dialect==\n\nIn the nineteenth century many Ng\u0101i Tahu, particularly in the southern reaches of Te Wai Pounamu, spoke a distinct [[dialect]] of the [[M\u0101ori language]], sometimes referred to as ''Southern M\u0101ori'', which was so different from the northern version of the language that missionary Rev. [[James Watkin]], based at [[Karitane]] found materials prepared by [[North Island]] missions couldn't be used in [[Otago]].<ref name=\"harlow87\">Harlow, R. (1987).

''New Zealand Journal of Archaeology'', 1, 123\u2013138.</ref>\n\nSouthern M\u0101ori contains almost all the same [[phonemes]] as other M\u0101ori dialects (namely: {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u, f, h, k, m, n, p, r, t, w/}}), along with the same [[diphthong]]s. But it lacks {{IPA|/\u014b/}} (\"ng\") \u2014 this sound merged with {{IPA|/k/}} in prehistoric times: for example: ''Ng\u0101i Tahu'' as opposed to ''K\u0101i Tahu''). This change did not occur in the northern part of the Ng\u0101i Tahu area, and the possible presence of additional phonemes ({{IPA|/b, p, l, r/}}) has been debated. Non-standard consonants are sometimes identified in the spellings of South Island place names, such as ''g'' (as distinct from ''k'', e.g., Katigi, Otago), ''v'' (e.g., Mavora), ''l'' instead of ''r'' (e.g., Little Akaloa, Kilmog, Waihola, Rakiula), and ''w'' or ''u'' instead of ''wh'' as reflecting dialect difference, but similar spellings and pronunciations also occur in the North Island (e.g. Tolaga Bay, Booai (P\u016bhoi)).<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\nThe [[apocope]] (the dropping of the final vowel of words) resulting from pronunciations like 'Wacky-white' for \"[[Waikouaiti]]\" have been identified with Southern M\u0101ori. However, the devoicing (rather than apocope) of final vowels occurs in the speech of native speakers of the M\u0101ori language throughout New Zealand, and the pronunciation of the names of North Island towns by locals often omits final vowels as well, like in the pronunciation of \"Paraparam\" or \"Waiuk\".<ref name=\"harlow87\"/>\n\n==Governance==\n\nTe R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is the governance entity of Ng\u0101i Tahu, following the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the iwi and the [[New Zealand Government]] under Ng\u0101i Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998.<ref>For example: {{cite web|url=http://ngaitahu.iwi.nz/te-runanga-o-ngai-tahu/research/|title=Research|website=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|publisher=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu|accessdate=16 June 2014|quote=Te R\u016bnanga o Ng\u0101i Tahu (TRoNT) is regularly approached by researchers and organisations seeking engagement, advice or support for various research projects.}}</ref> It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the M\u0101ori Fisheries Act 2004, an iwi aquaculture organisation under the M\u0101ori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act 2004, an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act 1991 and a T\u016bhono organisation.

The Odras are mentioned as one of the peoples that fought in the Mahabharata. [[Pali]] literature calls them Oddakas. [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] also refer to the Oretas who inhabit India's eastern coast. The modern term Odia dates from the 15th century when it was used by the medieval Muslim chroniclers and adopted by the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]] kings of Odisha.\n(Source-Odisha\u2019s legendary history: Hill tribes of Orissa (Odisha) \u2013 Wikipedia,^ a b c d e \"Odisha Government Portal\". Orissa.gov.in. Retrieved 2012-05-23).\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Odisha}}\nThe Odias are distinguished by their [[ethnocultural]] customs as well as the use of the Odia language. Odisha's relative isolation and the lack of any discernible outside influence has contributed towards preserving a social and religious structure that has disappeared from most of North India.\n\nThe inhabitants of Odisha were known as [[Odra Kingdom|Odras]], [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkal]] and [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] in [[Mahabharata]]. During 3rd century BCE coastal Odisha was known as Kalinga. According to Mahabharata Kalinga extended from the mouth of [[Ganga]] in north to the mouth of [[Godavari]] in south.\n\nDuring 4th Century, [[Mahapadma Nanda]] conquered Kalinga.\nDuring rule of [[Ashoka]], Kalinga was annexed as part of [[Maurya Empire]]. During 2nd century BCE, [[Kharavela]] emerged as powerful ruler.

There are smaller Odia communities in the neighbouring states of [[West Bengal]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[Chhattisgarh]]. Most Odias in West Bengal live in the districts of [[Midnapore]] and [[Bankura]]. [[Surat]] in Gujarat also has a large Odia population, primarily diamond workers in the southern district of Ganjam. [[Bengaluru]] and [[Hyderabad]] have sizable Odia population due to an IT boom in late 2000s. Some Odias have migrated to [[Bangladesh]] where they are known as [[Bonaz]] community.\n\nWhile most American Odias prior to 1980 came from [[Balasore]], [[Brahmapur, Odisha|Brahmapur]], [[Sambalpur]] and [[Cuttack]], increased demand for software engineers and adoption have brought Odias from other areas. Migration to the UK has been recorded since 1935, and continues to this day. Most British Odias have obtained British citizenship.\n\n== Language and literature ==\n{{Main|Odia language}}\nAround 35-40 million people in Odisha and adjoining areas speak and use [[Odia language]] which is also one of the six classical languages of India and the only regional language in the Indo-Aryanic family to receive classical language status.<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/odia-gets-classical-language-status/article5711965.ece</ref> Odia words are found in the 2nd century B.C [[Jaugada]] inscriptions of emperor [[Ashoka]] and 1st century B.C [[Khandagiri]] inscriptions of emperor Kharavela. Known as Odra Bibhasa or as Odra Magadhi Apabrhamsa in ancient times the language has been inscribed throughout the last two millenniums in ancient [[Pali]], [[Prakrit]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Odia language|Odia]] scripts. The Buddhist Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries by Buddhists like Rahula, Saraha, Luipa, etc. The literary traditions of Odia language achieved prominence towards the rule of the [[Somava\u1e43\u015b\u012b dynasty|Somavamshi]] and Eastern Dynasty. In the 14th century during the rule of emperor Kapilendra Deva Routray, the poet Sarala Dasa wrote the Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, praising the goddess Durga. Rama-bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in Odia. Major contributions to the Odia language in the Middle Ages were contributed by the Panchasakha, [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Acyutananda]], [[Yasovanta]] and Ananta.\n\nMughalbandi or Kataki Odia, spoken in the [[Cuttack]] Khordha and [[Puri]] districts is generally considered as the standard dialect and is the language of instruction and media. There are eight major forms of Odia spoken across the Odisha and adjoining areas while another thirteen minor forms spoken by tribal and other groups of people. New literary traditions are emerging in the western Odia form of the language which is [[Sambalpuri language|Sambalpuri]] and prominent poets and writers have emerged like [[Haldhar Nag|Haldar Nag]].\n\n== Position of women in Odia society ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nThe position of women in the Odia society has been always held with high value. Besides the historical depiction of queens surrounded by female bodyguards on the temple arts, Odia women are accustomed to follow traditional ways along with acceptance of modern culture. Odia culture celebrates female concentric festivals like Raja, Khudrukuni Osa, Sudasa Brata, Kumar Purnima, etc. which is unique in its nature compared to other cultures in India. Remarkable Odia women like [[Sarala Devi]], [[Ramadevi Choudhury|Rama Devi]], [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]],  etc. played a pivotal role in the national and freedom movement of India. [[Nandini Satpathy|Nandini Satapathy]] became the first female chief minister of the state of Odisha in 1973. The new generation of young women in Odisha pursue higher education and are career-oriented in nature.\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Arts of Odisha}}\n[[Odissi dance|Odissi]] is one of the oldest classical dances of India. The [[Applique]] work of [[Pipili]] and [[Sambalpuri Saree|Sambalpuri]] sarees are notable. The silver filigree work from Cuttack and Pattachitra of Raghurajpur are some really authentic representation of ancient Indian art and culture.\n\nOdias were the master of swords and had their own form of martial arts, later popularly known as \"[[Paika akhada]]\".\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|Kalinga architecture}}\nThe Odia architecture has a regional architectural tradition that dates back to at least the 6th century from the times of the [[Shailodbhava dynasty]]. From the times of the Somavamshi and the Eastern Ganga dynasty the [[Kalinga architecture]] form achieved prominence with its special style of temple designs which consist of four major sections of a religious structure, namely Mukha Deula, Nata Mandapa, Bhoga Mandapa and Garba Griha (or the inner sanctum). The examples of these marvelous structures are prevalent across the several hundreds of temples build across the state of Odisha mainly in Bhubaneswar which happens to be known as the temple city. [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Puri Jagannath temple]], ruins of the [[Konark Sun Temple|Konark Sun]] temple, [[Lingaraja Temple|Lingaraj]] temple, etc. are the living examples of ancient Kalinga architecture.\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Cuisine of Odisha}}\nSeafood and sweets dominate Odia cuisine. Rice is the staple cereal and is eaten throughout the day. Popular Odia dishes are [[Rasagolla]], [[Rasabali]], [[Chhena Poda]], [[Chhena kheeri]], [[Chhena jalebi]], Chenna Jhilli, [[Chhenagaja]], [[Khira sagara]], [[Dalma (dish)|Dalma]] and [[Pakhala]]. Machha Besara (Fish in mustard gravy), Mansha Tarkari (Mutton curry), sea foods like Chingudi Tarakari (Prawn curry), and Kankada Tarakari (Crab curry). A standard Odia meal includes Pakhala (watered rice), Badhi Chura, Saga Bhaja (Spinach fry), Macha Bhaja, Chuin Bhaja, etc.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://odishanewsinsight.com/features/cuisine-of-odisha/|title=Cuisine Of Odisha|website=odishanewsinsight|date=16 November 2019|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aninews.in/news/lifestyle/food/odia-delicacies-in-bengalurus-first-ama-odia-bhoji-to-tickle-taste-buds20200112200631/|title=Odia delicacies in Bengaluru's first 'Ama Odia Bhoji' to tickle taste buds|website=aninews|date=12 January 2020|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Festivals ===\n{{Main|Festivals of Odisha}}\nA wide variety of festivals are celebrated throughout the year; There is a saying in Odia, \u2018Baarah maase, terah pooja\u2019, that there are 13 festivals in 12 months of a year.

More than 90% of the people are followers of Hinduism.<ref name=\"census2011\">{{cite web|title=Population by religion community \u2013 2011|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW00C-01%20MDDS.XLS|website=Census of India, 2011|publisher=The Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825155850/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW00C-01%20MDDS.XLS|archivedate=18 January 2020}}</ref> Hinduism in Odisha is more significant due to the specific Jagannath culture followed by Odia Hindus. The practices of the [[Jagannath]] sect is popular in the state and the annual [[Rath Yatra]] in Puri draws pilgrims from across India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenewleam.com/2018/07/lord-jagannaths-rathyatra-as-a-marker-of-odia-identity/|title=Lord Jagannath\u2019s Rathyatra as a Marker of Odia Identity|website=thenewleam|date=23 July 2018|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> Under the Hindu religion, Odia people are believers of a wide range of sects with roots to historical times.\n\nBefore the advent of the Vaisnava sects Purrushotam Jagannath cult in Odisha, Buddhism and Jainism{{cn|date=December 2018}} were two very prominent religions. According to Jainkhetra Samasa, the Jain tirthankar Prasvanth came to Kopatak which is now Kupari of Baleswar district and was the guest of a person called Dhanya. The Kshetra Samasa, says that Parsvnath preached at Tamralipti (now Tamluk in Bengal) of Kalinga. The national religion of ancient Odisha became Jainism during the time of the emperor Karakandu in the 7th Century B.C. The Kalinga Jina asana was established and the idol of Tirthankara Rishabhanatha then also known as the \"Kalinga Jina\"was the national symbol of the kingdom. Emperor Mahmeghvahana Kharavela was also a devout Jain and a religiously tolerant ruler who reclaimed and re-established the Kalinga Jina that was taken away as a victory token by the [[Nanda Empire|Magadhan]] king, [[Mahapadma Nanda]].\n\nBuddhism was also a prevalent religion in the Odisha region until the late Bhaumakar dynasty's rule. Remarkable archaeological findings like at Dhauli, Ratnagiri, Lalitgiri, khandagiri and Puspagiri across the state have unearthed the buried truth about the Buddhist past of Odisha in a large scale. Even today we can see the Buddhist impact on the socio-cultural traditions of the Odia people. Though a majority of Buddhist shrines lay undiscovered and buried, the past of Odia people is rich with descriptions about them in the Buddhist literature. The [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|tooth relic]] of Buddha was first hosted by ancient Odisha as the king Brahmadutta constructed a beautiful shrine in his capital Dantapura (assumed to be Puri) of Kalinga. Successive dynasties in ancient Odisha's Kalinga or Tri Kalinga region were tolerant and secular in their governance over all the existing religions with [[Vedic period|Vedic]] roots. This provided a peaceful and secure environment for all the religious ideologies to flourish in the region for over a time period of three thousand years. The founder of Vajrayana Buddhism, King [[Indrabhuti]] was born in Odisha along with other prominent monks like [[Saraha]], [[Luipa]], Lakshminara and characters of Buddhist mythology like Tapassu and Bahalika were born in Odisha.\n\nHindu sects like [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]] are also the oldest ways of Hindu belief systems in Odisha with many royal dynasties dedicating remarkable temples and making them state religion over their time of rule in history. [[Lingaraja Temple|Lingaraja]], Rajarani, Mausi Maa Temple and other Temples in Bhubaneswar are mostly of Shaivaite sect while prominent temples of goddesses like Samleswari, Tara-Tarini, Mangala, Budhi Thakurani, Tarini, Kichekeswari and Manikeswari, across Odisha are dedicated to the [[Shakti]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] cult.\n\nThe Odia culture is now mostly echoed through the spread of Vaishnavite [[Jagannath]] culture across the world and the deity Jagannath himself is deeply rooted to every household traditions, culture and religious belief of Odia people today. There are historical references of wooden idols of Hindu deities being worshiped as a specific trend of Kalinga region far before the construction of [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Puri Jagannath temple]] by the king, [[Anantavarman Chodaganga|Choda Ganga Deva]] in 12th century.\n\nLately converted Christians are generally found among the tribal people especially in the interior districts of [[Gajapati district|Gajapati]] and [[Kandhamal]]. Around 2% of the people are [[Odia Muslims|Muslims]], most of them descendants of migrants from [[North India]] and elsewhere. The larger concentration of the minority Muslim population is in the districts of Bhadrak, Kendrapada and Cuttack.\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n{{See also|Folk dance forms of Odisha}}\n[[Odissi music]] dates back as far as the history of the classical Odissi dance goes back. At present, the Odissi music is being lobbied by the intellectual community of the state to be recognized as a classical form of music by the cultural ministry of India. Be side Classical Odissi dance, there are some other prominent cultural and folk dance forms of the Odia people that have followed different parts if evolution over the ages.\n* [[Odissi]]\n* [[Mahari dance|Mahari]]: A predecessor of Odissi dance that was mostly performed by the temple Devadashi community or royal court performers.\n* [[Dhemsa]]: Is a very popular dance format of the tribal area Undivided Koraput districts of Odisha. This generally performed by the Bhartas/Gouda/Parja Community of Koraput & Nabarangapur during the celebration.\n* [[Gotipua]]\nThe folk dance forms have evolved over ages with direct tribal influence over them. They are listed as below.\n* [[Chhau dance|Chhau]]: The Odia Chhau dance is a direct result of its ancient martial traditions which are depicted in dance performances. Though Chhau is basically an Odia art form, it is also performed in West Bengal.  Saraikella Chhau and Mayurbhanj Chhau are the only two Odia variants that have survived over time with its originality.\n* [[Ghumura dance]]:  Is a direct result of the ancient martial traditions of the Odias when Odia Paikas who marched into the battlefield or rested on the beats and tunes of the Ghumura music.\n* [[Dalkhai]] Dance: Though this dance form has evolved from tribal dance forms, it shows a complex mix of the themes taken from various religious texts of Hinduism. It is very a popular folk dance form of western Odisha.\n* Jodi Sankha: It also derives itself from the martial traditions of ancient Odisha and the performers use only the music generated from the two conchs held by each of them.\n* [[Baagh Naach|Baagh Nach]]\nModern Odias have also adopted western dance and forms. Remarkably, the [[Prince Dance Group|Prince dance group]] was declared as the winner of TV reality show \"India's Got Talent\" in the year 2009 and [[Ananya Sritam Nanda]] was declared as the winner of junior Indian Idol in the year 2015.\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nAncient traces of entertainment can be traced to the rock edicts of Emperor Kharavela which speaks about the festive gatherings held by him in the third year of his rule that included shows of singing, dancing and instrumental music. Ancient temple art of the Odias give a strong and silent testimony to the evolution of Odissi classical dance form over the ages. Bargarh district's Dhanujatra which is also believed to be world's largest open air theater performance, Pala and Daskathia, Jatra or Odia Opera, etc. are some of the traditional ways of entertainment for masses that survive to this day. Modern Odia television shows and movies are widely appreciated by a large section of the middle class section of the Odias and the it continues to evolve at a rapid rate with innovative ways of presentation.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{See also|List of people from Odisha}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Subroto Bagchi]]\n* [[Bhikari Bal]]\n* [[Krishna Beura]]\n* [[Dutee Chand]]\n* [[Bibhusita Das]]\n* [[Gopabandhu Das]]\n* [[Madhusudan Das]]\n* [[Manoj Das]]\n* [[Nandita Das]]\n* [[Shaktikanta Das]]\n* [[Anil Dash]]\n* [[Madhu Sudan Kanungo]]\n* [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]\n* [[Lalit Mansingh]]\n* [[Chaturbhuj Meher]]\n* [[Gangadhar Meher]]\n* [[Kailash Chandra Meher]]\n* [[Kunja Bihari Meher]]\n* [[Sadhu Meher]]\n* [[B.

The Odras are mentioned as one of the peoples that fought in the Mahabharata. [[Pali]] literature calls them Oddakas. [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] also refer to the Oretas who inhabit India's eastern coast. The modern term Odia dates from the 15th century when it was used by the medieval Muslim chroniclers and adopted by the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati]] kings of Odisha.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Odisha}}\nThe Odias are distinguished by their [[ethnocultural]] customs as well as the use of the Odia language. Odisha's relative isolation and the lack of any discernible outside influence has contributed towards preserving a social and religious structure that has disappeared from most of North India.\n\nThe inhabitants of Odisha were known as [[Odra Kingdom|Odras]], [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkal]] and [[Kalinga (Mahabharata)|Kalinga]] in [[Mahabharata]]. During 3rd century BCE coastal Odisha was known as Kalinga. According to Mahabharata Kalinga extended from the mouth of [[Ganga]] in north to the mouth of [[Godavari]] in south.\n\nDuring 4th Century, [[Mahapadma Nanda]] conquered Kalinga.\nDuring rule of [[Ashoka]], Kalinga was annexed as part of [[Maurya Empire]]. During 2nd century BCE, [[Kharavela]] emerged as powerful ruler. He defeated several kings in North and South India. \n[[File:Hatigumfa.jpg|thumb|200px|Hathigumpha inscription of King Kh\u0101ravela at Udayagiri Hills]]\nDuring reign of [[Gupta Empire]], [[Samudra Gupta]] conquered Odisha.

Most British Odias have obtained British citizenship.\n\n== Language and literature ==\n{{Main|Odia language}}\nAround 35-40 million people in Odisha and adjoining areas speak and use [[Odia language]] which is also one of the six classical languages of India and the only regional language in the Indo-Aryanic family to receive classical language status.<ref>https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/odia-gets-classical-language-status/article5711965.ece</ref> Odia words are found in the 2nd century B.C [[Jaugada]] inscriptions of emperor [[Ashoka]] and 1st century B.C [[Khandagiri]] inscriptions of emperor Kharavela. Known as Odra Bibhasa or as Odra Magadhi Apabrhamsa in ancient times the language has been inscribed throughout the last two millenniums in ancient [[Pali]], [[Prakrit]], [[Sanskrit]] and [[Odia language|Odia]] scripts. The Buddhist Charyapadas composed in the 7th to 9th centuries by Buddhists like Rahula, Saraha, Luipa, etc. The literary traditions of Odia language achieved prominence towards the rule of the [[Somava\u1e43\u015b\u012b dynasty|Somavamshi]] and Eastern Dynasty. In the 14th century during the rule of emperor Kapilendra Deva Routray, the poet Sarala Dasa wrote the Mahabharata, Chandi Purana, and Vilanka Ramayana, praising the goddess Durga. Rama-bibaha, written by Arjuna Dasa, was the first long poem written in Odia. Major contributions to the Odia language in the Middle Ages were contributed by the Panchasakha, [[Jagannatha Dasa (Odia poet)|Jagannatha Dasa]], [[Balarama Dasa]], [[Acyutananda]], [[Yasovanta]] and Ananta.\n\nMughalbandi or Kataki Odia, spoken in the [[Cuttack]] Khordha and [[Puri]] districts is generally considered as the standard dialect and is the language of instruction and media. There are eight major forms of Odia spoken across the Odisha and adjoining areas while another thirteen minor forms spoken by tribal and other groups of people. New literary traditions are emerging in the western Odia form of the language which is [[Sambalpuri language|Sambalpuri]] and prominent poets and writers have emerged like [[Haldhar Nag|Haldar Nag]].\n\n== Position of women in Odia society ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}\nThe position of women in the Odia society has been always held with high value. Besides the historical depiction of queens surrounded by female bodyguards on the temple arts, Odia women are accustomed to follow traditional ways along with acceptance of modern culture. Odia culture celebrates female concentric festivals like Raja, Khudrukuni Osa, Sudasa Brata, Kumar Purnima, etc. which is unique in its nature compared to other cultures in India. Remarkable Odia women like [[Sarala Devi]], [[Ramadevi Choudhury|Rama Devi]], [[Kuntala Kumari Sabat]],  etc. played a pivotal role in the national and freedom movement of India. [[Nandini Satpathy|Nandini Satapathy]] became the first female chief minister of the state of Odisha in 1973. The new generation of young women in Odisha pursue higher education and are career-oriented in nature.\n\n== Culture ==\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Arts of Odisha}}\n[[Odissi dance|Odissi]] is one of the oldest classical dances of India. The [[Applique]] work of [[Pipili]] and [[Sambalpuri Saree|Sambalpuri]] sarees are notable. The silver filigree work from Cuttack and Pattachitra of Raghurajpur are some really authentic representation of ancient Indian art and culture.\n\nOdias were the master of swords and had their own form of martial arts, later popularly known as \"[[Paika akhada]]\".\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{See also|Kalinga architecture}}\nThe Odia architecture has a regional architectural tradition that dates back to at least the 6th century from the times of the [[Shailodbhava dynasty]]. From the times of the Somavamshi and the Eastern Ganga dynasty the [[Kalinga architecture]] form achieved prominence with its special style of temple designs which consist of four major sections of a religious structure, namely Mukha Deula, Nata Mandapa, Bhoga Mandapa and Garba Griha (or the inner sanctum). The examples of these marvelous structures are prevalent across the several hundreds of temples build across the state of Odisha mainly in Bhubaneswar which happens to be known as the temple city. [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Puri Jagannath temple]], ruins of the [[Konark Sun Temple|Konark Sun]] temple, [[Lingaraja Temple|Lingaraj]] temple, etc. are the living examples of ancient Kalinga architecture.\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Cuisine of Odisha}}\nSeafood and sweets dominate Odia cuisine. Rice is the staple cereal and is eaten throughout the day. Popular Odia dishes are [[Rasagolla]], [[Rasabali]], [[Chhena Poda]], [[Chhena kheeri]], [[Chhena jalebi]], Chenna Jhilli, [[Chhenagaja]], [[Khira sagara]], [[Dalma (dish)|Dalma]] and [[Pakhala]]. Machha Besara (Fish in mustard gravy), Mansha Tarkari (Mutton curry), sea foods like Chingudi Tarakari (Prawn curry), and Kankada Tarakari (Crab curry). A standard Odia meal includes Pakhala (watered rice), Badhi Chura, Saga Bhaja (Spinach fry), Macha Bhaja, Chuin Bhaja, etc.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://odishanewsinsight.com/features/cuisine-of-odisha/|title=Cuisine Of Odisha|website=odishanewsinsight|date=16 November 2019|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aninews.in/news/lifestyle/food/odia-delicacies-in-bengalurus-first-ama-odia-bhoji-to-tickle-taste-buds20200112200631/|title=Odia delicacies in Bengaluru's first 'Ama Odia Bhoji' to tickle taste buds|website=aninews|date=12 January 2020|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Festivals ===\n{{Main|Festivals of Odisha}}\nA wide variety of festivals are celebrated throughout the year; There is a saying in Odia, \u2018Baarah maase, terah pooja\u2019, that there are 13 festivals in 12 months of a year. Well known [[festivals]], that are popular among the Odia people, are the [[Ratha Yatra]], [[Durga Puja]], [[Kali Puja]], [[Nuakhai]], Pushpuni, Pua Jiunita, [[Raja (festival)|Raja]], Dola Purnima, Pana Sankranti (as [[Vaisakhi]] is called in Odisha ), Karthika Purnima / Boita Bandana, Khudrukuni puja /Tapoi Osa, [[Kumar Purnima]], [[Ditia Osa]], [[Chaitra Purnima]], [[Agijala Purnima]], [[Bhai Juntia]], [[Pua Juntia]], [[Jhia Juntia]], [[Sabitri Brata]], [[Sudasha Brata]], [[Manabasa gurubara]] etc.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://telanganatoday.com/tenacious-people-odisha|title=The tenacious people of Odisha|website=telanganatoday|date=2 December 2018|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nOdisha is one of the most religiously homogeneous states in India. More than 90% of the people are followers of Hinduism.<ref name=\"census2011\">{{cite web|title=Population by religion community \u2013 2011|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW00C-01%20MDDS.XLS|website=Census of India, 2011|publisher=The Registrar General & Census Commissioner, India|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150825155850/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW00C-01%20MDDS.XLS|archivedate=18 January 2020}}</ref> Hinduism in Odisha is more significant due to the specific Jagannath culture followed by Odia Hindus. The practices of the [[Jagannath]] sect is popular in the state and the annual [[Rath Yatra]] in Puri draws pilgrims from across India.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenewleam.com/2018/07/lord-jagannaths-rathyatra-as-a-marker-of-odia-identity/|title=Lord Jagannath\u2019s Rathyatra as a Marker of Odia Identity|website=thenewleam|date=23 July 2018|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> Under the Hindu religion, Odia people are believers of a wide range of sects with roots to historical times.\n\nBefore the advent of the Vaisnava sects Purrushotam Jagannath cult in Odisha, Buddhism and Jainism{{cn|date=December 2018}} were two very prominent religions. According to Jainkhetra Samasa, the Jain tirthankar Prasvanth came to Kopatak which is now Kupari of Baleswar district and was the guest of a person called Dhanya. The Kshetra Samasa, says that Parsvnath preached at Tamralipti (now Tamluk in Bengal) of Kalinga. The national religion of ancient Odisha became Jainism during the time of the emperor Karakandu in the 7th Century B.C. The Kalinga Jina asana was established and the idol of Tirthankara Rishabhanatha then also known as the \"Kalinga Jina\"was the national symbol of the kingdom. Emperor Mahmeghvahana Kharavela was also a devout Jain and a religiously tolerant ruler who reclaimed and re-established the Kalinga Jina that was taken away as a victory token by the [[Nanda Empire|Magadhan]] king, [[Mahapadma Nanda]].\n\nBuddhism was also a prevalent religion in the Odisha region until the late Bhaumakar dynasty's rule. Remarkable archaeological findings like at Dhauli, Ratnagiri, Lalitgiri, khandagiri and Puspagiri across the state have unearthed the buried truth about the Buddhist past of Odisha in a large scale. Even today we can see the Buddhist impact on the socio-cultural traditions of the Odia people. Though a majority of Buddhist shrines lay undiscovered and buried, the past of Odia people is rich with descriptions about them in the Buddhist literature. The [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|tooth relic]] of Buddha was first hosted by ancient Odisha as the king Brahmadutta constructed a beautiful shrine in his capital Dantapura (assumed to be Puri) of Kalinga. Successive dynasties in ancient Odisha's Kalinga or Tri Kalinga region were tolerant and secular in their governance over all the existing religions with [[Vedic period|Vedic]] roots. This provided a peaceful and secure environment for all the religious ideologies to flourish in the region for over a time period of three thousand years. The founder of Vajrayana Buddhism, King [[Indrabhuti]] was born in Odisha along with other prominent monks like [[Saraha]], [[Luipa]], Lakshminara and characters of Buddhist mythology like Tapassu and Bahalika were born in Odisha.\n\nHindu sects like [[Shaivism]] and [[Shaktism]] are also the oldest ways of Hindu belief systems in Odisha with many royal dynasties dedicating remarkable temples and making them state religion over their time of rule in history. [[Lingaraja Temple|Lingaraja]], Rajarani, Mausi Maa Temple and other Temples in Bhubaneswar are mostly of Shaivaite sect while prominent temples of goddesses like Samleswari, Tara-Tarini, Mangala, Budhi Thakurani, Tarini, Kichekeswari and Manikeswari, across Odisha are dedicated to the [[Shakti]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] cult.\n\nThe Odia culture is now mostly echoed through the spread of Vaishnavite [[Jagannath]] culture across the world and the deity Jagannath himself is deeply rooted to every household traditions, culture and religious belief of Odia people today. There are historical references of wooden idols of Hindu deities being worshiped as a specific trend of Kalinga region far before the construction of [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Puri Jagannath temple]] by the king, [[Anantavarman Chodaganga|Choda Ganga Deva]] in 12th century.\n\nLately converted Christians are generally found among the tribal people especially in the interior districts of [[Gajapati district|Gajapati]] and [[Kandhamal]]. Around 2% of the people are [[Odia Muslims|Muslims]], most of them descendants of migrants from [[North India]] and elsewhere. The larger concentration of the minority Muslim population is in the districts of Bhadrak, Kendrapada and Cuttack.\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n{{See also|Folk dance forms of Odisha}}\n[[Odissi music]] dates back as far as the history of the classical Odissi dance goes back. At present, the Odissi music is being lobbied by the intellectual community of the state to be recognized as a classical form of music by the cultural ministry of India. Be side Classical Odissi dance, there are some other prominent cultural and folk dance forms of the Odia people that have followed different parts if evolution over the ages.\n* [[Odissi]]\n* [[Mahari dance|Mahari]]: A predecessor of Odissi dance that was mostly performed by the temple Devadashi community or royal court performers.\n* [[Dhemsa]]: Is a very popular dance format of the tribal area Undivided Koraput districts of Odisha. This generally performed by the Bhartas/Gouda/Parja Community of Koraput & Nabarangapur during the celebration.\n* [[Gotipua]]\nThe folk dance forms have evolved over ages with direct tribal influence over them. They are listed as below.\n* [[Chhau dance|Chhau]]: The Odia Chhau dance is a direct result of its ancient martial traditions which are depicted in dance performances. Though Chhau is basically an Odia art form, it is also performed in West Bengal.  Saraikella Chhau and Mayurbhanj Chhau are the only two Odia variants that have survived over time with its originality.\n* [[Ghumura dance]]:  Is a direct result of the ancient martial traditions of the Odias when Odia Paikas who marched into the battlefield or rested on the beats and tunes of the Ghumura music.\n* [[Dalkhai]] Dance: Though this dance form has evolved from tribal dance forms, it shows a complex mix of the themes taken from various religious texts of Hinduism. It is very a popular folk dance form of western Odisha.\n* Jodi Sankha: It also derives itself from the martial traditions of ancient Odisha and the performers use only the music generated from the two conchs held by each of them.\n* [[Baagh Naach|Baagh Nach]]\nModern Odias have also adopted western dance and forms. Remarkably, the [[Prince Dance Group|Prince dance group]] was declared as the winner of TV reality show \"India's Got Talent\" in the year 2009 and [[Ananya Sritam Nanda]] was declared as the winner of junior Indian Idol in the year 2015.\n\n=== Entertainment ===\nAncient traces of entertainment can be traced to the rock edicts of Emperor Kharavela which speaks about the festive gatherings held by him in the third year of his rule that included shows of singing, dancing and instrumental music. Ancient temple art of the Odias give a strong and silent testimony to the evolution of Odissi classical dance form over the ages. Bargarh district's Dhanujatra which is also believed to be world's largest open air theater performance, Pala and Daskathia, Jatra or Odia Opera, etc. are some of the traditional ways of entertainment for masses that survive to this day. Modern Odia television shows and movies are widely appreciated by a large section of the middle class section of the Odias and the it continues to evolve at a rapid rate with innovative ways of presentation.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{See also|List of people from Odisha}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Subroto Bagchi]]\n* [[Bhikari Bal]]\n* [[Krishna Beura]]\n* [[Dutee Chand]]\n* [[Bibhusita Das]]\n* [[Gopabandhu Das]]\n* [[Madhusudan Das]]\n* [[Manoj Das]]\n* [[Nandita Das]]\n* [[Shaktikanta Das]]\n* [[Anil Dash]]\n* [[Madhu Sudan Kanungo]]\n* [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]\n* [[Lalit Mansingh]]\n* [[Chaturbhuj Meher]]\n* [[Gangadhar Meher]]\n* [[Kailash Chandra Meher]]\n* [[Kunja Bihari Meher]]\n* [[Sadhu Meher]]\n* [[B.

The municipality covers an area of {{convert|{{Dutch municipality total area|Hellevoetsluis}}|km2|abbr=on}} of which {{convert|{{Dutch municipality water area|Hellevoetsluis}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water and it includes the population centres [[Nieuw-Helvoet]], [[Nieuwenhoorn]] and [[Oude en Nieuwe Struiten]], all former municipalities.\n\nHellevoetsluis is located on the [[Haringvliet]] with the sea, beach and dunes close by, on the extreme southern edge of the [[South Holland#Subdivisions|Rijnmond]] and [[Europoort]] areas, close to the broad [[Zeeland]] landscape. The name translates as \"[[lock (water transport)|lock]] at the foot of the Helle\". The Helle was a small local river which disappeared over time.\n\n==History==\nThe area has been settled since before roman times and was concentrated around a body of water called the \"Helle\", which was later Latinized by the Romans to \"Helinium\" and \"Helius\". The name Hel(le) Voet, ''Helius' foot'' or \"(land at) the lowest point of Helius\", appears in documents from the 13th century and later, such as in 1395, when the Nieuw-Helvoet Polder is issued for inspection. This polder had a drainage sluice (Dutch: \"sluis\") in the southern dike: the Hellevoetse sluis.\n\nThe history of Hellevoetsluis has always been connected with water. During the time of the [[Eighty Year's War]] and the forming of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] Hellevoetsluis was the naval port of the [[Admiralty of Rotterdam|Admiralty of de Maze]] ([[Rotterdam]]) and could accommodate an entire fleet within a special land-enclosed [[fortification|fortress]] with [[harbour]] and [[dockyard]] facilities, accessible through a [[canal]]. Thanks to its strategic situation the town grew from the beginning of the 17th century to be the homeport for the Dutch war fleet. In later years the port was fortified more and more and Hellevoetsluis therefore became a unique combination of fortified town and naval port. The [[Admiral]]s [[Maarten Tromp]], [[Michiel de Ruyter]] and [[Piet Heyn]] had their home base here and in 1688 during the [[Glorious Revolution]] [[William III of England|William III of Orange]]'s invasion fleet departed from the port.\n\n[[File:Hellevoetsluis 1866.png|thumb|260px|left|Hellevoetsluis in 1866.]]\nThe ''Kanaal door Voorne'' (Canal through Voorne) was built in 1830 from Hellevoetsluis to Nieuwesluis (near [[Heenvliet]]) and made Hellevoetsluis an outport of Rotterdam. It was a period when the town grew and flourished; the shipping industry provided prosperity. Its neighbourhood {{ill|Vlotbrug, Hellevoetsluis|lt=Vlotbrug|nl|Vlotbrug (Hellevoetsluis)}} may have been named after a [[vlotbrug]] constructed over the canal.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, however, Hellevoetsluis went into decline. Ocean-going ships became too large to use the canal and the [[Nieuwe Waterweg]] was dug, making the Canal through Voorne redundant. The naval base was relocated to [[Den Helder]] in the 1930s, the Government [[shipyard]] was closed, and during World War II the Germans destroyed three quarters of all buildings in 1944. They also used the canal as a base for [[Biber (submarine)|Biber submarines]].<ref name=lp146>{{cite book |title=Weapons of Desperation German Frogmen and Midget Submarines of World war II |last=Paterson |first=Lawrence |year=2006 |publisher=Chatham Publishing |isbn=978-1-86176-279-5 |page=146}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II Hellevoetsluis grew considerably. As a [[New town#Netherlands|New Town]] the population doubled in the 1970s. Today 43,000 inhabitants live in modern houses with abundant green areas nearby. It is home to many commuters working in [[Europoort]] or [[Rotterdam]].\n\nDuring the flood of 1953 Hellevoetsluis was inundated and after this flood the Netherlands implemented the \"Deltawerken\", a vast plan that put in place sea-defenses such as dams to protect vulnerable Islands in the Meuse-Rhine river delta. \n\nThe city is home to several buildings from the 16th-19th Centuries, that are listed monuments. Among these are the \"Admiraliteitsgebouw\" (currently used as city hall), the \"de Hoop\" windmill, Fort/Bastion Haerlem, \"Droogdok Jan Blanken\": a historic shipbuilding site and,  the [[Water Tower Hellevoetsluis]], designed by architect N. Biezeveld and built in 1896.\n\n==Facilities==\nHellevoetsluis has many shops: in addition to the various small (community) shopping centres, there is the covered [[shopping centre]] ''De Struytse Hoeck'', which has over 120 shops and is partly built over the Canal through Voorne. Education up to secondary school level, a library, community centres, health care, modern facilities for water sport are all available. Following the construction of the Haringvliet locks, the [[Haringvliet]] is ideal water for surfing and sailing. There are also extensive mooring facilities. Close by are the beach and the dunes at Voorne, a nature reserve.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Uitzicht vanaf brug op haven.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n[[File:Uitzicht vanaf brug op haven2.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n===Water sports===\nHellevoetsluis is one of the largest water sports centres in the country. There are 2,000 mooring places, spread over five harbours. With such a broad expanse of water as the Haringvliet and the [[North Sea]] close by, it is popular with water sports lovers and the Haringvliet is being used increasingly for national and international water sports events.\n\n[[File:Bunkers vesting Hellevoetsluis.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n[[File:Hellevoetsluis 006.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n===Entertainment===\nThe old town centre, the fortress, has many terraces that look out upon the busy harbour and plenty of bars and restaurants serving 'international' food. There are also restaurants and bars outside the fortress. A petting zoo, a sailing school, a fitness centre, tennis courts, a sauna, etc., are nearby.\n\n===Events===\nIn August the \"Fortress Days\" are held. A fleet of ships can also be seen and there is a large, varied fair, aeroplane demonstrations and a big firework display.\n\nEvery two years, the Dutch Classic Yacht Regatta is held in the harbour. A large number of classic, sharp [[yacht]]s can be seen.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are excellently preserved fortifications in the fortress. A walking tour leads to historical buildings such as the lighthouse, the Prinsehuis, Corn Mill ''De Hoop'' and a number of museums. The museum ''Gesigt van 't Dok'' situated at Oostzanddijk contains a replica of 1834 of town, fortress and naval shipyard. This replica forms the heart of an exhibition on the development of Hellevoetsluis into a modern naval port at the beginning of the previous century.\n\nThe National Firefighting Museum, located in what used to be the Kuiperij and Grootmagazijn on Industriehaven, contains a rich collection ranging from the most primitive fire fighting equipment from centuries ago to the highly sophisticated equipment of today. Water buckets, fire hoses, water barrels, uniforms hand and [[steam engines]], every device that marks a point in the history of fire fighting is represented.\n\nIn the ''Oudheidskamer'', also situated on the Industriehaven, there is a collection of items from daily life of the past two centuries. It includes items that relate to the past of Hellevoetsluis as naval port as well as agriculture-related articles.\n\nThe first [[dry dock]] in the Netherlands dates from 1806, and it marked a revolutionary development in the history of shipbuilding and ship repair. The dry dock is still there and has become a major historical and industrial/archaeological monument.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in The Netherlands}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities===\nHellevoetsluis is [[Town twinning|twinned]] with \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\n* {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Torbay]], England \n|}\n\nbecause on 5 November 1678 a fleet of 463 ships with 14,000 men landed [[William III of Orange]] in [[Torbay]] having sailed from Hellevoetsluis to claim thrones of Great Britain, as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] \n\n<br />\n\n== Born in Hellevoetsluis ==\n[[File:Luitenant Dirk Klop (Venlo-incident 1939) (cropped).jpg|155px|thumb|Dirk Klop, 1939]]\n* [[Jan Pieter Theodoor Huydecoper]] (1728 in Hellevoetsluis \u2013 1767) an administrator of the [[Dutch West India Company]] and [[List of colonial governors of the Dutch Gold Coast|Director-General of the Dutch Gold Coast]] 1764 to 1767 \n* [[Theodoor de Booy]] (1882 in Hellevoetsluis \u2013 1919) a Dutch-born American archaeologist\n* [[Jan Greshoff]] (1888 in Nieuw-Helvoet \u2013 1971) a Dutch journalist, poet, and literary critic\n* [[Dirk Klop]] (1906 in Nieuw-Helvoet \u2013 1939) a Dutch Army intelligence officer, killed in the [[Venlo incident]]\n* [[Adriaan Wesselink]] (1909 in Hellevoetsluis \u2013 1995) a Dutch astronomer, specialising in [[variable stars]] \n* Anthony van Kampen (1911 in Hellevoetsluis -

The municipality covers an area of {{convert|{{Dutch municipality total area|Hellevoetsluis}}|km2|abbr=on}} of which {{convert|{{Dutch municipality water area|Hellevoetsluis}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water and it includes the population centres [[Nieuw-Helvoet]], [[Nieuwenhoorn]] and [[Oude en Nieuwe Struiten]], all former municipalities.\n\nHellevoetsluis is located on the [[Haringvliet]] with the sea, beach and dunes close by, on the extreme southern edge of the [[South Holland#Subdivisions|Rijnmond]] and [[Europoort]] areas, close to the broad [[Zeeland]] landscape. The name translates as \"[[lock (water transport)|lock]] at the foot of the Helle\". The Helle was a small local river which disappeared over time.\n\n==History==\nThe area has been settled since before roman times and was concentrated around a body of water called the \"Helle\", which was later Latinized by the Romans to \"Helinium\" and \"Helius\". The name Hel(le) Voet, ''Helius' foot'' or \"(land at) the lowest point of Helius\", appears in documents from the 13th century and later, such as in 1395, when the Nieuw-Helvoet Polder is issued for inspection. This polder had a drainage sluice (Dutch: \"sluis\") in the southern dike: the Hellevoetse sluis.\n\nThe history of Hellevoetsluis has always been connected with water. During the time of the [[Eighty Year's War]] and the forming of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] Hellevoetsluis was the naval port of the [[Admiralty of Rotterdam|Admiralty of de Maze]] ([[Rotterdam]]) and could accommodate an entire fleet within a special land-enclosed [[fortification|fortress]] with [[harbour]] and [[dockyard]] facilities, accessible through a [[canal]]. Thanks to its strategic situation the town grew from the beginning of the 17th century to be the homeport for the Dutch war fleet. In later years the port was fortified more and more and Hellevoetsluis therefore became a unique combination of fortified town and naval port. The [[Admiral]]s [[Maarten Tromp]], [[Michiel de Ruyter]] and [[Piet Heyn]] had their home base here and in 1688 during the [[Glorious Revolution]] [[William III of England|William III of Orange]]'s invasion fleet departed from the port.\n\n[[File:Hellevoetsluis 1866.png|thumb|260px|left|Hellevoetsluis in 1866.]]\nThe ''Kanaal door Voorne'' (Canal through Voorne) was built in 1830 from Hellevoetsluis to Nieuwesluis (near [[Heenvliet]]) and made Hellevoetsluis an outport of Rotterdam. It was a period when the town grew and flourished; the shipping industry provided prosperity. Its neighbourhood {{ill|Vlotbrug, Hellevoetsluis|lt=Vlotbrug|nl|Vlotbrug (Hellevoetsluis)}} may have been named after a [[vlotbrug]] constructed over the canal.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, however, Hellevoetsluis went into decline. Ocean-going ships became too large to use the canal and the [[Nieuwe Waterweg]] was dug, making the Canal through Voorne redundant. The naval base was relocated to [[Den Helder]] in the 1930s, the Government [[shipyard]] was closed, and during World War II the Germans destroyed three quarters of all buildings in 1944. They also used the canal as a base for [[Biber (submarine)|Biber submarines]].<ref name=lp146>{{cite book |title=Weapons of Desperation German Frogmen and Midget Submarines of World war II |last=Paterson |first=Lawrence |year=2006 |publisher=Chatham Publishing |isbn=978-1-86176-279-5 |page=146}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II Hellevoetsluis grew considerably. As a [[New town#Netherlands|New Town]] the population doubled in the 1970s. Today 43,000 inhabitants live in modern houses with abundant green areas nearby. It is home to many commuters working in [[Europoort]] or [[Rotterdam]].\n\nDuring the flood of 1953 Hellevoetsluis was inundated and after this flood the Netherlands implemented the \"Deltawerken\", a vast plan that put in place sea-defenses such as dams to protect vulnerable Islands in the Meuse-Rhine river delta. \n\nThe city is home to several buildings from the 16th-19th Centuries, that are listed monuments. Among these are the \"Admiraliteitsgebouw\" (currently used as city hall), the \"de Hoop\" windmill, Fort/Bastion Haerlem, \"Droogdok Jan Blanken\": a historic shipbuilding site and,  the [[Water Tower Hellevoetsluis]], designed by architect N. Biezeveld and built in 1896.\n\n==Facilities==\nHellevoetsluis has many shops: in addition to the various small (community) shopping centres, there is the covered [[shopping centre]] ''De Struytse Hoeck'', which has over 120 shops and is partly built over the Canal through Voorne. Education up to secondary school level, a library, community centres, health care, modern facilities for water sport are all available. Following the construction of the Haringvliet locks, the [[Haringvliet]] is ideal water for surfing and sailing. There are also extensive mooring facilities. Close by are the beach and the dunes at Voorne, a nature reserve.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:Uitzicht vanaf brug op haven.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n[[File:Uitzicht vanaf brug op haven2.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n===Water sports===\nHellevoetsluis is one of the largest water sports centres in the country. There are 2,000 mooring places, spread over five harbours. With such a broad expanse of water as the Haringvliet and the [[North Sea]] close by, it is popular with water sports lovers and the Haringvliet is being used increasingly for national and international water sports events.\n\n[[File:Bunkers vesting Hellevoetsluis.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n[[File:Hellevoetsluis 006.jpg|thumb|200px|right]]\n===Entertainment===\nThe old town centre, the fortress, has many terraces that look out upon the busy harbour and plenty of bars and restaurants serving 'international' food. There are also restaurants and bars outside the fortress. A petting zoo, a sailing school, a fitness centre, tennis courts, a sauna, etc., are nearby.\n\n===Events===\nIn August the \"Fortress Days\" are held. A fleet of ships can also be seen and there is a large, varied fair, aeroplane demonstrations and a big firework display.\n\nEvery two years, the Dutch Classic Yacht Regatta is held in the harbour. A large number of classic, sharp [[yacht]]s can be seen.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are excellently preserved fortifications in the fortress. A walking tour leads to historical buildings such as the lighthouse, the Prinsehuis, Corn Mill ''De Hoop'' and a number of museums. The museum ''Gesigt van 't Dok'' situated at Oostzanddijk contains a replica of 1834 of town, fortress and naval shipyard. This replica forms the heart of an exhibition on the development of Hellevoetsluis into a modern naval port at the beginning of the previous century.\n\nThe National Firefighting Museum, located in what used to be the Kuiperij and Grootmagazijn on Industriehaven, contains a rich collection ranging from the most primitive fire fighting equipment from centuries ago to the highly sophisticated equipment of today. Water buckets, fire hoses, water barrels, uniforms hand and [[steam engines]], every device that marks a point in the history of fire fighting is represented.\n\nIn the ''Oudheidskamer'', also situated on the Industriehaven, there is a collection of items from daily life of the past two centuries. It includes items that relate to the past of Hellevoetsluis as naval port as well as agriculture-related articles.\n\nThe first [[dry dock]] in the Netherlands dates from 1806, and it marked a revolutionary development in the history of shipbuilding and ship repair.

{"title_page": "Depression (economics)", "text_new": "{{Globalize|article|Anglophone|2name=[[English-speaking world|the English-speaking world]]|date=October 2012}}\nIn [[economics]], a '''depression''' is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies. It is a more severe economic downturn than a [[economic recession|recession]], which is a slowdown in economic activity over the course of a normal [[business cycle]].\n\n'''Depressions''' are characterized by their length, by abnormally large increases in [[unemployment]], falls in the availability of [[credit (finance)|credit]] (often due to some form of banking or financial crisis), shrinking output as buyers dry up and suppliers cut back on production and investment, more [[bankruptcies]] including sovereign debt defaults, significantly reduced amounts of [[trade]] and commerce (especially international trade), as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations (often due to currency [[devaluation]]s). Price [[deflation (economics)|deflation]], [[financial crisis|financial crises]], [[stock market crash]], and [[bank failure]]s are also common elements of a depression that do not normally occur during a recession.\n\n==Definitions==\nIn the [[United States]] the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] determines contractions and expansions in the business cycle, but does not declare depressions.<ref name=\"nber.org\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions_faq.html |title=The NBER's Business Cycle Dating Procedure: Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Nber.org |accessdate=2012-09-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008141654/http://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions_faq.html |archivedate=2012-10-08 }}</ref> Generally, periods labeled depressions are marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced using current resources and technology ([[potential output]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0821657.html |title=Private Tutor |publisher=Infoplease.com |accessdate=2012-09-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913025403/http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0821657.html |archivedate=2012-09-13 }}</ref> Another proposed definition of ''depression'' includes two general rules:<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12852043 | work=The Economist | title=Diagnosing depression | date=December 30, 2008 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215002935/http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12852043 | archivedate=February 15, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://businesscycles.info/recession-definition/ |title=Home Improvement Tips and Techniques &#124; Business Cycles |accessdate=2009-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202110823/http://businesscycles.info/recession-definition/ |archivedate=2009-02-02 }}</ref>\n# a decline in real GDP exceeding 10%, or\n# a recession lasting 2 or more years.\n\nThere are also differences in the duration of depression across definitions. Some economists refer only to the period when economic activity is declining. The more common use, however, also encompasses the time until the economic activity has returned close to normal levels.<ref name=\"nber.org\"/>\n\nA recession is briefly defined as a period of declining economic activity spread across the economy (according to NBER). Under the first definition, each depression will always coincide with a recession, since the difference between a depression and a recession is the severity of the fall in economic activity.  In other words, each depression is always a recession, sharing the same starting and ending dates and having the same duration.\n\nUnder the second definition, depressions and recessions will always be distinct events however, having the same starting dates. This definition of depression implies that a recession and a depression will have different ending dates and thus distinct durations. Under this definition, the length of depression will always be longer than that of the recession starting the same date.\n\nA useful example is a difference in the chronology of the Great Depression in the U.S. under the view of alternative definitions. Using the second definition of depression, most economists refer to the Great Depression, as the period between 1929 and 1941. On the other hand, using the first definition, the depression that started in August 1929 lasted until March 1933. Note that NBER, which publishes the recession (instead of depression) dates for the U.S. economy, has identified two recessions during that period. The first between August 1929 and March 1933 and the second starting in May 1937 and ending in June 1938.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |title=US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |accessdate=2008-10-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219215409/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |archivedate=2009-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nToday the term \"depression\" is most often associated with the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but the term had been in use long before then. Indeed, an early major American economic crisis, the [[Panic of 1819]], was described by then-president [[James Monroe]] as \"a depression\",<ref name=\"hnn\">{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/articles/61931.html|title=When Did the Great Depression Receive Its Name?

At the time of the Great Depression (of the 1930s), the phrase \"The Great Depression\" had already been used to refer to the period 1873\u201396 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873\u201379 (in the United States), which has since been renamed the [[Long Depression]].\n\nCommon use of the phrase \"The Great Depression\" for the 1930s crisis is most frequently attributed to British economist [[Lionel Robbins]], whose 1934 book ''The Great Depression'' is credited with 'formalizing' the phrase,<ref name=\"hnn\"/> though US president [[Herbert Hoover]] is widely credited with having 'popularized' the term/phrase,<ref name=\"hnn\" /><ref>''The Glory and the Dream: A Narrative History of America, 1932\u20131972'', William Manchester</ref> informally referring to the downturn as a \"depression\", with such uses as \"Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement\", (December 1930, Message to Congress) and \"I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression\" (1931).\n\n==Occurrence== \nDue to the lack of an agreed definition and the strong negative associations, the characterization of any period as a \"depression\" is contentious. The term was frequently used for regional crises from the early 19th century until the 1930s, and for the more widespread crises of the 1870s and 1930s, but economic crises since 1945 have generally been referred to as \"recessions\", with the 1970s global crisis referred to as \"[[stagflation]]\", but not a depression. The only two eras commonly referred to at the current time as \"depressions\" are the 1870s and 1930s.<ref name=\"krug2010\">{{citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/opinion/28krugman.html | first = Paul | last = Krugman | author-link = Paul Krugman | title = The Third Depression | date = June 27, 2010 | journal = [[The New York Times]] | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120411051630/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/opinion/28krugman.html | archive-date = April 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nTo some degree this is simply a stylistic change, similar to the decline in the use of \"panic\" to refer to financial crises, but it does also reflect that the [[economic cycle]] \u2013 both in the United States and in most [[OECD]] countries \u2013 though not in all \u2013 has been more moderate since 1945.\n\nThere ''have'' been many periods of prolonged economic underperformance in particular countries/regions since 1945, detailed below, but terming these as \"depressions\" is controversial. The 2008-2009 economic cycle, which has comprised the most significant global crisis since the Great Depression, has at times been termed a depression,<ref name=\"krug2010\" /> but this terminology is not widely used, with the episode instead being referred to by other terms, such as the \"[[Great Recession]]\".\n\n== Notable depressions ==\n\n===The General Crisis of 1640===\n{{main|The General Crisis}}\nThe largest Great Depression of all time occurred during the General Crisis.

Greece's continuing troubles have led to discussions about [[Greek withdrawal from the eurozone|its departure from the eurozone]].\n\n==Other depressions==\n===Global===\nThe late 1910s and early 1920s were marked by an economic depression that unraveled in particularly catastrophic circumstances: The [[Great War]] and its aftermath led to a global nosedive in commodities that ruined many developing nations, while servicemen returning from the trenches found themselves with high unemployment as businesses failed, unable to transition into a peacetime economy. Also, the [[Spanish flu pandemic]] of 1918-20 brought economic activity to a standstill as even more people became incapacitated. Most developed countries had mostly recovered by 1921\u201322, however [[Germany]] saw its economy crippled until 1923-24 because of the hyperinflation crisis.\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]], coupled with the rising costs of maintenance of [[welfare state]] in most countries led to a [[1973-75 recession|recession between 1973 and 1975]], followed by a period of [[stagflation|almost minimal growth and rising inflation and unemployment]]. The [[Early 1980s recession|1980-82 recession]] marked the end of the period.\n\nThe [[Savings and loan crisis|savings & loans]] and the [[leveraged buyout]] crises led to a severe depression in mid-to-late 1989, causing a [[Early 1990s recession|recession in 1990-91]] (also fueled by [[1990 oil price shock|the oil price crisis]]), whose effects lasted as late as 1994. This downturn is more remembered for its political effects: [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] had to resign in November 1990 as a result of the socioeconomic debacle caused by her later policies; and while his approval ratings were above 60%, [[U.S. President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 election]] to [[Bill Clinton]] because of the domestic malady marked by the depression and increasing urban decay.\n\nIn 2005, the [[2000s energy crisis|persistent oil price rises]] and [[economic overheating]] caused by deregulation led to a gradual deterioration of the world economy with inflation and unemployment rising as growth slowed down: The [[housing bubble]] in the U.S. burst in 2007, and the American economy slipped into a [[Great Recession|recession]]. This, in turn, provoked the failure of many prominent financial institutions throughout 2008, most notably [[Lehman Brothers]], leading to the loss of millions of jobs.\n.\n\n===Regional===\nSeveral Latin American countries had severe downturns in the 1980s: by the Kehoe and Prescott definition of a great depression as at least one year with output 20% below trend, [[Economy of Argentina|Argentina]], [[Economic history of Brazil#Stagnation, inflation, and crisis, 1981-94|Brazil]], [[Economy of Chile|Chile]], and [[Economic history of Mexico#1982 crisis and recovery|Mexico]] experienced great depressions in the 1980s, and Argentina experienced [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|another]] in 1998\u20132002.

However, the depression was multicausal, with its severity compounded by a coincidence of multiple sudden external shocks, including loss of Soviet trade, the [[savings and loan crisis]] and [[early 1990s recession]] in the West, with the internal overheating that had been brewing throughout the 1980s. Liberalization had resulted in the so-called \"casino economy\". Persistent structural and monetary policy problems had not been solved, leaving the economy vulnerable to even mild external shocks. The depression had lasting effects: the Finnish markka was floated and was eventually replaced by the euro in 1999, ending decades of government control of the economy, but also high, persistent unemployment. Employment has never returned even close to the pre-crisis level.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Great Recession]]\n* [[L-shaped recession]]\n* [[List of recessions]]\n* [[List of recessions in the United States]]\n* [[Recession]]\n* [[Stagflation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n{{US recessions}}\n\n[[Category:Economic crises]]\n[[Category:Recessions|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{Globalize|article|Anglophone|2name=[[English-speaking world|the English-speaking world]]|date=October 2012}}\nIn [[economics]], a '''depression''' is a sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies.

Some economists refer only to the period when economic activity is declining. The more common use, however, also encompasses the time until the economic activity has returned close to normal levels.<ref name=\"nber.org\"/>\n\nA recession is briefly defined as a period of declining economic activity spread across the economy (according to NBER). Under the first definition, each depression will always coincide with a recession, since the difference between a depression and a recession is the severity of the fall in economic activity.  In other words, each depression is always a recession, sharing the same starting and ending dates and having the same duration.\n\nUnder the second definition, depressions and recessions will always be distinct events however, having the same starting dates. This definition of depression implies that a recession and a depression will have different ending dates and thus distinct durations. Under this definition, the length of depression will always be longer than that of the recession starting the same date.\n\nA useful example is a difference in the chronology of the Great Depression in the U.S. under the view of alternative definitions. Using the second definition of depression, most economists refer to the Great Depression, as the period between 1929 and 1941. On the other hand, using the first definition, the depression that started in August 1929 lasted until March 1933. Note that NBER, which publishes the recession (instead of depression) dates for the U.S. economy, has identified two recessions during that period. The first between August 1929 and March 1933 and the second starting in May 1937 and ending in June 1938.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |title=US Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research |accessdate=2008-10-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219215409/https://www.nber.org/cycles/ |archivedate=2009-02-19}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nToday the term \"depression\" is most often associated with the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but the term had been in use long before then.

At the time of the Great Depression (of the 1930s), the phrase \"The Great Depression\" had already been used to refer to the period 1873\u201396 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873\u201379 (in the United States), which has since been renamed the [[Long Depression]].\n\nCommon use of the phrase \"The Great Depression\" for the 1930s crisis is most frequently attributed to British economist [[Lionel Robbins]], whose 1934 book ''The Great Depression'' is credited with 'formalizing' the phrase,<ref name=\"hnn\"/> though US president [[Herbert Hoover]] is widely credited with having 'popularized' the term/phrase,<ref name=\"hnn\" /><ref>''The Glory and the Dream: A Narrative History of America, 1932\u20131972'', William Manchester</ref> informally referring to the downturn as a \"depression\", with such uses as \"Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement\", (December 1930, Message to Congress) and \"I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression\" (1931).\n\n==Occurrence== \nDue to the lack of an agreed definition and the strong negative associations, the characterization of any period as a \"depression\" is contentious. The term was frequently used for regional crises from the early 19th century until the 1930s, and for the more widespread crises of the 1870s and 1930s, but economic crises since 1945 have generally been referred to as \"recessions\", with the 1970s global crisis referred to as \"[[stagflation]]\", but not a depression. The only two eras commonly referred to at the current time as \"depressions\" are the 1870s and 1930s.<ref name=\"krug2010\">{{citation | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/opinion/28krugman.html | first = Paul | last = Krugman | author-link = Paul Krugman | title = The Third Depression | date = June 27, 2010 | journal = [[The New York Times]] | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120411051630/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/28/opinion/28krugman.html | archive-date = April 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\nTo some degree this is simply a stylistic change, similar to the decline in the use of \"panic\" to refer to financial crises, but it does also reflect that the [[economic cycle]] \u2013 both in the United States and in most [[OECD]] countries \u2013 though not in all \u2013 has been more moderate since 1945.\n\nThere ''have'' been many periods of prolonged economic underperformance in particular countries/regions since 1945, detailed below, but terming these as \"depressions\" is controversial.

Greece's continuing troubles have led to discussions about [[Greek withdrawal from the eurozone|its departure from the eurozone]].\n\n==Other depressions==\n===Global===\nThe late 1910s and early 1920s were marked by an economic depression that unraveled in particularly catastrophic circumstances: The [[Great War]] and its aftermath led to a global nosedive in commodities that ruined many developing nations, while servicemen returning from the trenches found themselves with high unemployment as businesses failed, unable to transition into a peacetime economy. Also, the [[Spanish flu pandemic]] of 1918-20 brought economic activity to a standstill as even more people became incapacitated. Most developed countries had mostly recovered by 1921-22, however [[Germany]] saw its economy crippled until 1923-24 because of the hyperinflation crisis.\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]], coupled with the rising costs of maintenance of [[welfare state]] in most countries led to a [[1973-75 recession|recession between 1973 and 1975]], followed by a period of [[stagflation|almost minimal growth and rising inflation and unemployment]]. The [[Early 1980s recession|1980-82 recession]] marked the end of the period.\n\nThe [[Savings and loan crisis|savings & loans]] and the [[leveraged buyout]] crises led to a severe depression in mid-to-late 1989, causing a [[Early 1990s recession|recession in 1990-91]] (also fueled by [[1990 oil price shock|the oil price crisis]]), whose effects lasted as late as 1994. This downturn is more remembered for its political effects: [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] had to resign in November 1990 as a result of the socioeconomic debacle caused by her later policies; and while his approval ratings were above 60%, [[U.S. President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] lost the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 election]] to [[Bill Clinton]] because of the domestic malady marked by the depression and increasing urban decay.\n\nIn 2005, the [[2000s energy crisis|persistent oil price rises]] and [[economic overheating]] caused by deregulation led to a gradual deterioration of the world economy with inflation and unemployment rising as growth slowed down: The [[housing bubble]] in the U.S. burst in 2007, and the American economy slipped into a [[Great Recession|recession]]. This, in turn, provoked the failure of many prominent financial institutions throughout 2008, most notably [[Lehman Brothers]], leading to the loss of millions of jobs.\n.\n\n===Regional===\nSeveral Latin American countries had severe downturns in the 1980s: by the Kehoe and Prescott definition of a great depression as at least one year with output 20% below trend, [[Economy of Argentina|Argentina]], [[Economic history of Brazil#Stagnation, inflation, and crisis, 1981-94|Brazil]], [[Economy of Chile|Chile]], and [[Economic history of Mexico#1982 crisis and recovery|Mexico]] experienced great depressions in the 1980s, and Argentina experienced [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|another]] in 1998\u20132002. South American countries fell once again into this in the early-to-mid 2010s.\n\nThis definition also includes the economic performance of [[Economy of New Zealand|New Zealand]] from 1974\u20131992 and [[Economy of Switzerland|Switzerland]] from 1973 to the present, although this designation for Switzerland has been controversial.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Abrahamsen, Y. |author2=Aeppli, R. |author3=Atukeren, E. |author4=Graff, M. |author5=M\u00fcller, C. |author6=Schips, B. |title=The Swiss disease: Facts and artifacts.

However, the depression was multicausal, with its severity compounded by a coincidence of multiple sudden external shocks, including loss of Soviet trade, the [[savings and loan crisis]] and [[early 1990s recession]] in the West, with the internal overheating that had been brewing throughout the 1980s. Liberalization had resulted in the so-called \"casino economy\". Persistent structural and monetary policy problems had not been solved, leaving the economy vulnerable to even mild external shocks. The depression had lasting effects: the Finnish markka was floated and was eventually replaced by the euro in 1999, ending decades of government control of the economy, but also high, persistent unemployment. Employment has never returned even close to the pre-crisis level.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Great Recession]]\n* [[L-shaped recession]]\n* [[List of recessions]]\n* [[List of recessions in the United States]]\n* [[Recession]]\n* [[Stagflation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n{{US recessions}}\n\n[[Category:Economic crises]]\n[[Category:Recessions|*]]\n", "name_user": "Nat965", "label": "safe", "comment": "ApplyGen fix(es),typo(s) fixed: occured \u2192 occurred, 1921-22 \u2192 1921\u201322", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(economics)"}
