Project]] and best known as leader of [[Morning Musume]] and [[Hello!Project|Hello! Project]] until 2011. She is also the former member of its popular subgroup [[Mini Moni]].<ref name=\"EC graduates\">{{cite web|url= http://www.hello-online.org/index.php?act=helloonline&CODE=article&topic=719|title= The end of an era: Elder Club graduates|date= February 1, 2009|publisher= Hello!Online}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Morning Musume Career (2001\u20132011) ===\nIn 2001, Ai Takahashi joined Japanese idol group ''Morning Musume'', as part of the group's fifth generation, along with [[Makoto Ogawa]], [[Asami Konno]], and [[Risa Niigaki]]. Her audition involved a training camp of three days and two nights, in which participants were expected to learn a new song, a dance routine and a script. Out of 25,000 applicants, nine were selected for the camp in which Takahashi passed.<ref name=\"JPTimes\" /> Her debut with the group was on their single \"[[Mr. Moonlight: Ai no Big Band]]\", and her first appearance on a Morning Musume full-length release was their fourth studio album, ''[[4th Ikimasshoi!]]''. Her first appearance within a [[Hello! Project shuffle unit]] release was on the 2002 single \"Shiawase Beam! Suki Suki Beam!\" under the group name [[Hello! Project shuffle units#Happy 7|Happy 7]].\n\nIn 2003, Takahashi replaced [[Mari Yaguchi]] in the Morning Musume spinoff group [[Mini Moni]], first appearing in the group's movie ''[[Mini Moni ja Movie: Okashi na Daib\u014dken!]]'' and its accompanying soundtrack. Later in 2003, she was part of the Morning Musume splinter group [[Morning Musume Sakuragumi]], which performed mainly slower numbers on the group's two [[extended play|EPs]], \"[[Hare Ame Nochi Suki]]\" and \"[[Sakura Mankai]]\", and the shuffle group [[7Air]], an R&B-inspired septet.\n\nTakahashi's vocals became more prominent on the second and final Mini Moni album, ''[[Mini Moni Songs 2]]'' (2004), as well as on Morning Musume's singles from their Spring 2004 release \"[[Roman: My Dear Boy]]\" onward. She also had a duet with [[Tsunku]] on the cover version of Tsunku and [[Ayumi Hamasaki]]'s duet \"[[Love: Destiny (song)|Love: Since 1999]]\" on his solo album ''[[Take1]]''.\n\nIn 2005, Morning Musume's first single release of the year, \"[[The Manpower!!!]]\", featured Takahashi in a prominent co-lead-vocal role, a role she has retained on subsequent singles since. In the summer of that year, she became part of the 2005 shuffle Group [[Elegies (J-pop)|Elegies]].\n\nIn 2006, Takahashi played the lead role, Sapphire, in ''[[Princess Knight|Ribon no Kishi]] The Musical,'' which was a collaboration work by Hello! Project and the Japanese all-female theatrical company [[Takarazuka Revue]]. The musical was based on [[Tezuka Osamu]]'s manga and also starred [[v-u-den]], [[Nozomi Tsuji]], [[Aya Matsuura]], and [[Natsumi Abe]], as well as Marcia and Kaoru Ebira of the [[Takarazuka Revue]]. On July 2, Takahashi released her first and only solo single to date, \"Yume Kara Samete\".\n\nFollowing then-leader [[Hitomi Yoshizawa]]'s graduation from Morning Musume on May 6, 2007, the current sub-leader, [[Miki Fujimoto]] ascended to the leader position, with Takahashi becoming the new sub-leader of the group.

Project]] and best known as leader of [[Morning Musume]] and [[Hello!Project]] until 2011. She is also the former member of its popular subgroup [[Mini Moni]].<ref name=\"EC graduates\">{{cite web|url= http://www.hello-online.org/index.php?act=helloonline&CODE=article&topic=719|title= The end of an era: Elder Club graduates|date= February 1, 2009|publisher= Hello!Online}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Morning Musume Career (2001\u20132011) ===\nIn 2001, Ai Takahashi joined Japanese idol group ''Morning Musume'', as part of the group's fifth generation, along with [[Makoto Ogawa]], [[Asami Konno]], and [[Risa Niigaki]]. Her audition involved a training camp of three days and two nights, in which participants were expected to learn a new song, a dance routine and a script. Out of 25,000 applicants, nine were selected for the camp in which Takahashi passed.<ref name=\"JPTimes\" /> Her debut with the group was on their single \"[[Mr. Moonlight: Ai no Big Band]]\", and her first appearance on a Morning Musume full-length release was their fourth studio album, ''[[4th Ikimasshoi!]]''. Her first appearance within a [[Hello! Project shuffle unit]] release was on the 2002 single \"Shiawase Beam! Suki Suki Beam!\" under the group name [[Hello! Project shuffle units#Happy 7|Happy 7]].\n\nIn 2003, Takahashi replaced [[Mari Yaguchi]] in the Morning Musume spinoff group [[Mini Moni]], first appearing in the group's movie ''[[Mini Moni ja Movie: Okashi na Daib\u014dken!]]'' and its accompanying soundtrack. Later in 2003, she was part of the Morning Musume splinter group [[Morning Musume Sakuragumi]], which performed mainly slower numbers on the group's two [[extended play|EPs]], \"[[Hare Ame Nochi Suki]]\" and \"[[Sakura Mankai]]\", and the shuffle group [[7Air]], an R&B-inspired septet.\n\nTakahashi's vocals became more prominent on the second and final Mini Moni album, ''[[Mini Moni Songs 2]]'' (2004), as well as on Morning Musume's singles from their Spring 2004 release \"[[Roman: My Dear Boy]]\" onward. She also had a duet with [[Tsunku]] on the cover version of Tsunku and [[Ayumi Hamasaki]]'s duet \"[[Love: Destiny (song)|Love: Since 1999]]\" on his solo album ''[[Take1]]''.\n\nIn 2005, Morning Musume's first single release of the year, \"[[The Manpower!!!]]\", featured Takahashi in a prominent co-lead-vocal role, a role she has retained on subsequent singles since. In the summer of that year, she became part of the 2005 shuffle Group [[Elegies (J-pop)|Elegies]].\n\nIn 2006, Takahashi played the lead role, Sapphire, in ''[[Princess Knight|Ribon no Kishi]] The Musical,'' which was a collaboration work by Hello! Project and the Japanese all-female theatrical company [[Takarazuka Revue]]. The musical was based on [[Tezuka Osamu]]'s manga and also starred [[v-u-den]], [[Nozomi Tsuji]], [[Aya Matsuura]], and [[Natsumi Abe]], as well as Marcia and Kaoru Ebira of the [[Takarazuka Revue]]. On July 2, Takahashi released her first and only solo single to date, \"Yume Kara Samete\".\n\nFollowing then-leader [[Hitomi Yoshizawa]]'s graduation from Morning Musume on May 6, 2007, the current sub-leader, [[Miki Fujimoto]] ascended to the leader position, with Takahashi becoming the new sub-leader of the group. However, on June 1, 2007, after Fujimoto's resignation,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/f-et-tp0-20070601-207238.html#spot|title= Nikkan Sports News|date= 2007-06-01|publisher= Nikkan Sports News|language= Japanese|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070603153923/http://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/f-et-tp0-20070601-207238.html|archivedate= 2007-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20070601-00000166-sph-ent |title=Yahoo!

The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides\u2014Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions.

Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene.

In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the R\u00e1kosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|\u00c1VH]], to enforce the new regime.

The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while R\u00e1kosi opposed both vigorously. R\u00e1kosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the \u00c1VH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref> Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958.

K\u00e1d\u00e1r quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. K\u00e1d\u00e1r proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, \"Those who are not against us are with us.\" K\u00e1d\u00e1r introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''h\u00e1zt\u00e1ji gazd\u00e1lkod\u00e1s''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.\n\nIn 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" within the [[Eastern bloc]].

Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.\n\nWith the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected.

As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nIn 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] had claimed in [[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech|a private speech]] that [[Hungarian Socialist Party|his party]] \"lied\" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]].

The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of Hungary|new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes. Although these developments were met with and still engender controversy, Fidesz secured a second parliamentary supermajority [[2014 Hungarian parliamentary election|in 2014]] and a third [[2018 Hungarian parliamentary election|in 2018]].<ref>Krek\u00f3, P\u00e9ter and Juh\u00e1sz, Attila , ''The Hungarian Far Right: Social Demand, Political Supply, and International Context'' (Stuttgart: ibidem Verlag, 2017), {{ISBN|978-3-8382-1184-8}}.

Popular opinion also states that the four-season system became a two-season system as spring and autumn are getting shorter and shorter, even vanishing some years.

Budapest, the capital, serves as an important hub for the [[Hungarian State Railways|Hungarian railway system]] (''M\u00c1V''). The capital is served by three large train stations called ''[[Eastern Railway Station (Budapest)|Keleti]]'' (Eastern), ''[[Western Railway Station (Budapest)|Nyugati]]'' (Western), and ''[[Southern Railway Station (Budapest)|D\u00e9li]]'' (Southern) ''p\u00e1lyaudvar''s.

The [[Budapest Metro]] is the second-oldest underground [[rapid transit|metro]] system in the world; its [[Line 1 (Budapest Metro)|Line 1]] dates from 1896. The system consists of four lines. A [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system, ''[[H\u00c9V]]'', operates in the Budapest metropolitan area.\nHungary has a total length of approximately {{convert|1314|km|2|abbr=on}} motorways ({{lang-hu|aut\u00f3p\u00e1lya}}). Motorway sections are being added to the existing network, which already connects many major economically important cities to the capital.\nThe most important port is Budapest. Other important ones include [[Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]].\n\nThere are five international airports in Hungary: [[Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport|Budapest Liszt Ferenc]] (informally called \"Ferihegy\" after its previous name), [[Debrecen International Airport|Debrecen]], [[S\u00e1rmell\u00e9k International Airport|S\u00e1rmell\u00e9k]] (also called H\u00e9v\u00edz-Balaton Airport), [[Gy\u0151r-P\u00e9r International Airport|Gy\u0151r-P\u00e9r]], and [[P\u00e9cs-Pog\u00e1ny International Airport|P\u00e9cs-Pog\u00e1ny]].

Hungarian historiography identifies the foundation of the Hungarian state with [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I's]] [[baptism]] and coronation with the [[Szentkorona|Holy Crown]] in A.D. 1000. Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s. The [[Catholic Church in Hungary]] remained strong through the centuries, and the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as [[prince-primate]] (''hercegpr\u00edm\u00e1s'') of Hungary. \n\nAlthough contemporary Hungary has no [[official religion]] and recognizes [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental right, the Hungarian constitution \"recognizes Christianity's nation-building role\" in its preamble<ref>{{cite web|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g Alapt\u00f6rv\u00e9nye|url=http://www.parlament.hu/irom39/02627/02627.pdf|website=Parlament.hu|publisher=Hungarian Parliament|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> and in Article VII affirms that \"the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals.\"<ref>[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf Hungary's Constitution of 2011]</ref>\n\nDuring the initial stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Hungarians took up, first, [[Lutheranism]], then [[Calvinism]] in the form of the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]. In the second half of the 16th century, the [[Jesuits]] led a [[Counterreformation]] campaign and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Christians. In practice this meant ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed. The country's eastern regions, especially around [[Debrecen]] (the \"Calvinist Rome\"), remain almost completely [[Reformed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6819/ |title=Facts and Statistics |publisher=Reformatus.hu |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> a trait they share with historically contiguous [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnically Hungarian regions]] across the Romanian border. \n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities:[[Armenians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]].\n\nHistorically, Hungary was home to a significant Jewish community.

In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] (1845\u20131914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.\n\nTurning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of \"Young People\" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]] and Dezs\u00f6 Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.\n\n[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]]]]\n\nBesides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[B\u00e9la Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay]] took almost the same route. [[Istv\u00e1n Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.\n\nForeigners have unexpectedly \"discovered\" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings.

One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century.

Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of [[jazz]] such as trumpeter [[Rudolf Tomsits]], pianist-composer [[K\u00e1roly Binder]] and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, [[Ferenc Seb\u0151]] and [[M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n]].

Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''K\u00e9pes kr\u00f3nika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].\n[[File:K\u00e9pes Kr\u00f3nika 1360.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chronicon Pictum]], a medieval illustrated chronicle from the 14th century]]\n[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458\u20131490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].\nThe most important poets of the period was [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664).\n\nBalassi's poetry shows medieval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' (\"Peril of Sziget\", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\nAmong the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published.

Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).\n\nIt was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.\n\nNearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.\n\nThe finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;\u2013 red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.\n\nIn Hungary proper, S\u00e1rk\u00f6z in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd|Maty\u00f3f\u00f6ld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|S\u00e1rk\u00f6z]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.\n\nThese vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes.

During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without fight and was subject to foreign occupation. The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides\u2014Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions.

Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and, due to the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation toward [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] and [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], promising economic and social recovery, rose.\n\nHorthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, respectively, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon.

The Soviet leadership selected [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] to front the [[Stalinization]] of the country, and R\u00e1kosi ''de facto'' ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarization, industrialization, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the R\u00e1kosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|\u00c1VH]], to enforce the new regime. In the ensuing purges approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamupress.com/product/First-Domino,4091.aspx |title=Granville/ frm |format=PDF |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign [[Gulag]]s.

The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while R\u00e1kosi opposed both vigorously. R\u00e1kosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the \u00c1VH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref> Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6065398.stm \"Hungary's 1956 brain drain\"], BBC News, 23 October 2006</ref>\n\n==== K\u00e1d\u00e1r era 1956\u20131988 ====\n{{See also|Goulash Communism}}\n[[File:J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], General Secretary of MSZMP, the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956\u20131988)]]\n\nAfter a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSzMP). K\u00e1d\u00e1r quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. K\u00e1d\u00e1r proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, \"Those who are not against us are with us.\" K\u00e1d\u00e1r introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''h\u00e1zt\u00e1ji gazd\u00e1lkod\u00e1s''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.\n\nIn 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" within the [[Eastern bloc]]. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's [[GDP per capita]] was fourth only to [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and the Soviet Union itself.<ref name=\"madison185\">*{{Cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus |title=The world economy|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-92-64-02261-4|page=185}}</ref> As a result of this relatively high standard of living, a more liberalized economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism.

Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.\n\nWith the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nIn 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] had claimed in [[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech|a private speech]] that [[Hungarian Socialist Party|his party]] \"lied\" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]].

The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of Hungary|new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes.

[[Lake Balaton]] and [[Lake H\u00e9v\u00edz]], the largest lake in Central Europe and the largest thermal lake in the world, respectively, are in Transdanubia as well.\n\nThe ''Duna-Tisza k\u00f6ze'' and ''Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal'' are characterized mainly by the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] (''Alf\u00f6ld''), which stretches across most of the eastern and southeastern areas of the country.

The body is divided into county police departments which are also divided into regional and town police departments. The National Police also have subordinate agencies with nationwide jurisdiction, such as the \"Nemzeti Nyomoz\u00f3 Iroda\" (National Bureau of Investigation), a civilian police force specialised in investigating serious crimes, and the gendarmerie-like, militarised \"K\u00e9szenl\u00e9ti Rend\u0151rs\u00e9g\" (Stand-by Police) mainly dealing with riots and often reinforcing local police forces. Due to Hungary's accession to the [[Schengen Treaty]], the Police and Border Guards were merged into a single national corps, with the Border Guards becoming Police Officers.

Hungarian historiography identifies the foundation of the Hungarian state with [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I's]] [[baptism]] and coronation with the [[Szentkorona|Holy Crown]] in A.D. 1000. Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s. The [[Catholic Church in Hungary]] remained strong through the centuries, and the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as [[prince-primate]] (''hercegpr\u00edm\u00e1s'') of Hungary. \n\nAlthough contemporary Hungary has no [[official religion]] and recognizes [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental right, the Hungarian constitution \"recognizes Christianity's nation-building role\" in its preamble<ref>{{cite web|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g Alapt\u00f6rv\u00e9nye|url=http://www.parlament.hu/irom39/02627/02627.pdf|website=Parlament.hu|publisher=Hungarian Parliament|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> and in Article VII affirms that \"the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals.\"<ref>[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf Hungary's Constitution of 2011]</ref>\n\nDuring the initial stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Hungarians took up, first, [[Lutheranism]], then [[Calvinism]] in the form of the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]. In the second half of the 16th century, the [[Jesuits]] led a [[Counterreformation]] campaign and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Christians. In practice this meant ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed. The country's eastern regions, especially around [[Debrecen]] (the \"Calvinist Rome\"), remain almost completely [[Reformed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6819/ |title=Facts and Statistics |publisher=Reformatus.hu |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> a trait they share with historically contiguous [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnically Hungarian regions]] across the Romanian border. \n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities:[[Armenians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]].\n\nHistorically, Hungary was home to a significant Jewish community.

In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] (1845\u20131914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.\n\nTurning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of \"Young People\" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]] and Dezs\u00f6 Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.\n\n[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]]]]\n\nBesides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[B\u00e9la Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay]] took almost the same route. [[Istv\u00e1n Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.\n\nForeigners have unexpectedly \"discovered\" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings. In the [[Budapest]] downtown area almost all the buildings are about one hundred years old, with thick walls, high ceilings, and motifs on the front wall.<ref name=\"Eliznik.org.uk\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://budapestcorner.com/index.php/flats/general-information|title=General information on various student flats and building types in Budapest|publisher=Budapest Corner|accessdate=11 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214123942/http://budapestcorner.com/index.php/flats/general-information|archivedate=14 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Hungary}}\n[[File:Hungarian State Opera House(PDXdj).jpg|thumb|[[Hungarian State Opera House]] on [[Andr\u00e1ssy \u00fat]] (UNESCO World Heritage Site)]]\nHungarian music consists mainly of traditional [[Hungarian folk music]] and music by prominent composers such as [[Liszt]] and [[Bart\u00f3k]], considered to be among the greatest Hungarian composers. Other renowned composers are [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi|Dohn\u00e1nyi]], [[Franz Schmidt]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], [[Gabriel von Wayditch]], [[Rudolf Wagner-R\u00e9geny]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lajtha]], [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]], [[Imre K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]], [[S\u00e1ndor Veress]] and [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa|R\u00f3zsa]]. Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong [[dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] rhythm, as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.\n\nHungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music, [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g]], [[Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Jeney]] among them. One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century. His music was invigorated by the themes, modes, and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighboring folk music traditions he studied, which he synthesized with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html Szabolcsi] Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style. For example, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], two of Hungary's most famous composers, are known for using folk themes in their own music.</ref>\n[[File:Liszt 1858.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Liszt|Ferenc (Franz) Liszt]], one of the greatest pianists of all time; well-known composer and conductor]]\nHungary has made many contributions to the fields of [[folk music|folk]], [[popular music|popular]] and [[european classical music|classical music]].

Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of [[jazz]] such as trumpeter [[Rudolf Tomsits]], pianist-composer [[K\u00e1roly Binder]] and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, [[Ferenc Seb\u0151]] and [[M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n]].

It is also the oldest surviving [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] poem.<br />\nAmong the first chronicles about Hungarian history were [[Gesta Hungarorum]] (\"Deeds of the Hungarians\") by the unknown author usually called ''Anonymus'', and [[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]] (\"Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians\") by Simon K\u00e9zai. Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''K\u00e9pes kr\u00f3nika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].\n[[File:K\u00e9pes Kr\u00f3nika 1360.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chronicon Pictum]], a medieval illustrated chronicle from the 14th century]]\n[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458\u20131490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].\nThe most important poets of the period was [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664).\n\nBalassi's poetry shows medieval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' (\"Peril of Sziget\", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\nAmong the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published. (See [[Bible translations into Hungarian]] for more details.)\n[[File:Marai2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai]], Hungarian writer and journalist]]\n\nThe Hungarian enlightenment took place about fifty years after the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].

The greatest poets of the time were [[Mih\u00e1ly Csokonai Vit\u00e9z]] and [[D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi]].\nThe greatest figure of the language reform was [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]. The [[Hungarian language]] became feasible for all type of scientific explanations from this time, and furthermore many new words were coined for describing new inventions.\n\n[[Hungarian literature]] has recently gained some renown outside the borders of Hungary (mostly through translations into German, French and English).

The latter is a contemporary Jewish writer who survived the Holocaust and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2002.\nThe older classics of Hungarian literature and Hungarian poetry have remained almost totally unknown outside Hungary. [[J\u00e1nos Arany]], a famous 19th-century Hungarian poet, is still much loved in Hungary (especially his collection of [[Ballads]]), among several other \"true classics\" like [[S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi]], the poet of the Revolution of 1848, [[Endre Ady]], [[Mih\u00e1ly Babits]], [[Dezs\u0151 Kosztol\u00e1nyi]], [[Attila J\u00f3zsef]], [[Mikl\u00f3s Radn\u00f3ti]] and [[J\u00e1nos Pilinszky]].

Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s is the Hungarian name for the national dances, with Hungarian embroidered costumes and energetic music. From the men's intricate bootslapping dances to the ancient women's circle dances, Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s demonstrates the infectious exuberance of the Hungarian folk dancing still celebrated in the villages.\n\n[[Verbunkos]] is a solo man's dance evolved from the recruiting performances of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army.\n\nThe [[Leg\u00e9nyes]] is a men's solo dance done by the ethnic Hungarian people living in the [[Kalotaszeg]] region of Transylvania. Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).\n\nIt was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.\n\nNearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.\n\nThe finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;\u2013 red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.\n\nIn Hungary proper, S\u00e1rk\u00f6z in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd|Maty\u00f3f\u00f6ld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|S\u00e1rk\u00f6z]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.\n\nThese vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes. No two are precisely alike, since all work is done by hand, including both the shaping and the decorating. The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece.\n\n=== Porcelain ===\n{{Main|Herend Porcelain|Zsolnay}}\nFounded in 1826, [[Herend Porcelain]] is one of the world's largest ceramic factories, specializing in luxury hand painted and gilded [[porcelain]].

The track, which has several configurations, has promoted several series of racing, including [[NASCAR]], the [[IndyCar Series]], the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] series, and the [[Championship Cup Series]].\n\nFrom 2002 to 2019, Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway had hosted the final race of the season in all three of NASCAR's series as [[Ford Championship Weekend]]: the [[NASCAR Cup Series]], [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]], and the [[NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series]]. The races currently have the names [[Dixie Vodka 400]], [[2020Census.gov 300]], and [[Ford EcoBoost 200]], respectively.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Homestead Miami Speedway.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Sunset at Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway in 2006]]\nThe speedway was constructed, with the efforts of promoter Ralph Sanchez, as part of a plan to help [[Homestead, Florida|Homestead]] rebound after the devastation caused by [[Hurricane Andrew]]. Groundbreaking began August 24, 1993, exactly one year after the hurricane.\n\nIt opened in November 1995 with a [[NASCAR]] [[Busch Series]] race, the last race of that season. The Busch Series would continue to hold its season-ending races at Homestead; in 2002 NASCAR's Winston Cup Series and Craftsman Truck Series would also hold their season-ending races at Homestead as well.  Since 2002 NASCAR has marketed the seasons-ending Homestead races as [[Ford Championship Weekend]].\n\nIn the spring of 1996, the [[Champ Car|CART]] series held its first race there.\n\nThe track reflects the [[art deco]] district of nearby [[Miami Beach]] with its liberal use of colors such as aqua, purple and silver.  Though the track itself has been considered to be aesthetically pleasing from the outset, initially the racing at Homestead was not considered very good. The track opened as a four-turn, rectangular-oval, based on the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]]'s layout, coincidental considering that circuit and  Miami Beach were developed by [[Carl G. Fisher]]. However, due to its shorter distance, the track was not able to maintain the racing characteristics of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Instead, the sharp, flat turns and aprons made passing difficult and lowered overall speed. The geometry also created unfavorably severe crash angles. In 1996, track management attempted to correct the problems by widening the aprons of the turns by as much as {{convert|24|ft|m}}. The movie ''[[Super Speedway]]'' was shot at the speedway before the track was reconfigured to an oval. In the summer of 1997, an [[United States Dollar|$]]8.2 million reconfiguration project changed the turns from a rectangle to a traditional, continuous turn oval.\n\nIn 2003, the track was reconfigured once again. The turns were changed from mostly flat to steep variable banking. In 2005, lights were installed to allow night racing for the first time. The renovations were praised by fans, and the track has produced a number of close finishes, including [[2005 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series|2005]]'s last-lap battle between [[Greg Biffle]] and [[Mark Martin]].\n\nOn March 26, 2006, [[Indy Racing League]] driver [[Paul Dana]] suffered fatal injuries in the warm-up session before the race when he was involved in a high-speed collision with [[Ed Carpenter (racing driver)|Ed Carpenter]] at over {{convert|215|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Other drivers to suffer fatal injuries at the speedway are [[John Nemechek]] in a Craftsman Truck race on March 16, 1997, and Jeff Clinton who died in a Grand Am sports car event at the track in March 2002.\n\nIn 2009, Homestead became the home to a total of five season-ending racing series events, with the [[GAINSCO Auto Insurance Indy 300]] finale for the IRL IndyCar Series as well as the Grand-Am [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] moving to October from their traditional early season slots.  The Indy Car series would discontinue its Homestead race while the Rolex Series later changed its Homestead race to a date earlier in the season.\n\nBehind the main grandstand is the '''Homestead RC Raceway''' for [[radio controlled car]]s, it was used to host the 2011 [[International Federation of Model Auto Racing|IFMAR Worlds]] for 1:8 IC Track cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homesteadmiamispeedway.com/Articles/2011/04/IFMAR-RC-Champs.aspx|title=Motorsports Olympics at Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway|website=www.homesteadmiamispeedway.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Track length of paved oval===\nThe CART measured for the inaugural race in 1996 a length of {{convert|1.517|mi|km}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.champcarstats.com/races/199601.htm|title=1996 Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami Presented by Toyota|author=|date=|website=www.champcarstats.com|accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref> This length was referenced to the old rectangular layout.

As a form of play fighting, a young calf will bunt the flank of its mother. A newborn calf will bunt the mother's udder and this stimulates milk flow.

Another example of bunting is when a dam experiences pain while a foal is suckling. The dam will proceed to bunt the foal with her head, non-aggressively, to prevent further discomfort. Many foals will play fight with one another; displaying the bunting behaviour. The foal will push its head against another foal's body in an attempt to knock the other off-balance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McDonnell|first1=Sue M.|title=The Equid Ethogram: A Practical Field Guide to Horse Behavior|date=2003|publisher=Eclipse Press|isbn=9781581500905|pages=295|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-Mvm9NjH0WUC|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHorses will also rub the bottom or sides of their jaw onto others.

As a form of play fighting, a young calf will bunt the flank of its mother. A newborn calf will bunt the mother's udder and this stimulates milk flow.

Another example of bunting is when a dam experiences pain while a foal is suckling. The dam will proceed to bunt the foal with her head, non-aggressively, to prevent further discomfort. Many foals will play fight with one another; displaying the bunting behaviour. The foal will push its head against another foal's body in an attempt to knock the other off-balance.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McDonnell|first1=Sue M.|title=The Equid Ethogram: A Practical Field Guide to Horse Behavior|date=2003|publisher=Eclipse Press|isbn=9781581500905|pages=295|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-Mvm9NjH0WUC|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHorses will also rub the bottom or sides of their jaw onto others.
