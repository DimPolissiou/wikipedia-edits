However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nChristian thought of this age was heavily influenced by Pope Gregory the Great, monasticism and St.Benedict. Constantine and his Bishop Alduin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

Charlemagne was king. As king, he advocated Christian principles, had at least one Christian advisor, and openly supported Christian missions. The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking 30 years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

However, [[Early modern Europe]] witnessed the turning point in the '''history of Christian thought on persecution and tolerance'''. Christian writers like [[John Milton]] and [[John Locke]] argued for limited religious toleration, while some Christians eventually came to support the concept of [[Freedom of religion|religious freedom]] which was developed by secular authors like [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Nowadays Christians generally accept the belief that heresy and dissent are not punishable by a civil authority.<ref name=\"Coffey00-206\">Coffey 2000: 206.</ref>\n\n==Historical background ==\n====Early Christianity====\n\n[[Early Christianity]] was a minority religion in the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Persecution of early Christians by the Romans|the early Christians were persecuted, on and off, during their first 300 years]]. Christianity's definition and practice of tolerance/intolerance were influenced by that persecution in a largely negative way. However, according to Guy Stroumsa, there is still a history in early Christian thought of tolerance as a concept, though not a fully developed one, and with some ambivalence, presenting both inclusivity and inventing the concept of heresy in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Stroumsa\">{{cite book|last=Stroumsa|first=Guy|editor1=Graham N.Stanton|editor2=Guy G.

At the same time a Germanic tribe, the Lombards, were gaining in Italy, another Germanic  tribe, the Franks were establishing their rule in what had been Roman Gaul and would become modern France. Clovis the first, a convert to Latin Christianity, became the first important ruler of  the Merovingian dynasty. He supported missionaries in newly conquered territories and strengthened ties with the Pope. After 700, the Merovongians gradually lost control of the kingdom to the Carolingians.  In 754, the Pope traveled to St.Denis, near Paris, to crown Pepin the Short king and name him defender of the faith. In exchange, Pepin crushed the Lombards and gave their land to the Pope. This alliance suited both parties, and redirected the church's interest away from the East, linking Rome's destiny with the West.<ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|198-199}}\n\nChristian thought of this age was heavily influenced by Pope Gregory the Great, monasticism and St.Benedict. Constantine and his Bishop Alduin had a long term effect on the idea of forced conversion in Christian thought. <ref name=\"Humanities\"/>{{rp|200-201}}\n\n====High Middle Ages====\nThe persecution of Christian heretics resumed in 1022, when fourteen people were burned at [[Orl\u00e9ans]].<ref name=\"Coffey 2000-23\" /> Around this time [[Bogomilism]] and [[Catharism]] appeared in Europe; these sects were seen as heretical by the [[Catholic Church]], and the [[Inquisition]] was initially established to counter them. Heavily persecuted, these heresies were eradicated by the 14th century. The suppression of the Cathar (or \"Albigensian\") faith took the form of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1209\u20131229), a 20-year military campaign initiated by the Roman Catholic Church. Its violence was extreme even by medieval standards. Notable individuals who were executed for heresy in the late Middle Ages are [[Jerome of Prague]], [[John Badby]] and [[Jan Hus]]. Only the [[Waldensians]], another heretical Christian sect, managed to survive in remote areas in Northern Italy.\n\nAlso during the high Middle Ages, 1000\u20131250, the [[Crusades]] pitched Christians and Muslims against each other in a war about the possession of Jerusalem, with atrocities from both sides. There were massacres of Muslims and Jews when Jerusalem was taken by Crusaders in 1099.  After [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and later the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsardom]] had conquered the [[Kazan Khanate]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate]] in the 1550s, the [[History of Tatarstan|government forcibly baptized]] Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] and pagan [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordva]] and [[Mari people|Mari]]. Mosques were prohibited. This persecution ended only under the reign of [[Catherine II of Russia]] in the late eighteenth century. \n\n====Late Middle Ages====\nThe [[Northern Crusades]], a series of campaigns against the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of northeastern Europe, faced fierce pagan resistance, requiring decades of violence by dedicated [[Teutonic Order|warrior-monks]] to force the submission, and compel the conversion, of the region's inhabitants, who were often left as serfs to an imported Christian [[Baltic Germans|German-speaking nobility]].<ref>Christiansen, Eric. The Northern Crusades. London: Penguin Books. pg. 14-15.</ref> There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist; for example, the Christian conquest and conversion of Old Prussia resulted in the death of much of the native population, whose [[Old Prussian|language]] subsequently became extinct.<ref name=\"The German Hansa page 34\">The German Hansa, P. Dollinger, page 34, 1999, Routledge</ref>\n  \nThe [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]] also went on to persecute Jews and Muslims. In Spain after the [[Reconquista]], Jews were forced to either convert or be exiled. Many were killed. The persecution of Jews goes back to 12th-century Visigothic Spain after the emergence of the [[blood libel against Jews]]. Although the Spanish had agreed to allow Muslims the freedom of religion in 1492, this was often ignored. In 1501, Muslims were offered the choice of conversion or exile. In 1556, Arab or Muslim dress was forbidden, and in 1566 Arabic language as a whole was prohibited in Spain.<ref>{{cite book | last = Lapidus | first =  Ira M. | title = A History of Islamic societes | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | isbn = 0-521-22552-3| page = 389}}</ref> Jews were eventually expelled from England by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], too.\n\n====Reformation Era====\n\nWhen [[Martin Luther]] wrote his [[The Ninety-Five Theses|Ninety-Five Theses]] in 1517, Catholicism reacted the same way as it had to the heresies of the late Middle Ages. However, while the [[Protestant Reformation]] could be \"crushed\" in Spain with \"a few dozen executions in the 1550s\",<ref>Coffey 2000: 212</ref> the same strategy failed in Germany, Northern Europe and in England. France had to suffer through the [[French Wars of Religion]] before it again became wholly Catholic. The divide between [[Catholicism]] and  the new [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] was deep. Protestants commonly alleged that the catholic [[Pope]] was the [[Antichrist]]. Conflicts between Christian factions reached their heights in France with the 1572 [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], in Germany and [[Central Europe]] with the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) and in England with the [[English Civil War]] (1641\u20131651). Following the devastations caused by these wars, the ideas of [[religious toleration]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[religious pluralism]] slowly gained ground in Europe. The [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe]], which had reached their height between 1550 and 1650, continued until 1750.\n\n====Early Modern Era====\n\nEuropean [[Colonialism]], that was accompanied by Christian evangelism and often by violence, led to the suppression of [[Folk religion|indigenous religions]] in the territories conquered or usurped by the Europeans. The [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] largely destroyed the [[Aztec]] and [[Inca civilization]]. However, Colonialism (and later European [[Imperialism]]) as a whole were not motivated by religious zeal; the suppression of the indigenous religions was their side result, not their main purpose. Only partial aspects, like the [[Goa Inquisition]], bear resemblance to the persecutions that occurred on the European continent. By the 18th century, persecutions of unsanctioned beliefs had been reduced in most Europeans countries to [[religious discrimination]], in the form of legal restrictions on those who did not accept the official faith. This often included being barred from higher education, or from participation in the national legislature. In colonized nations, attempts to convert native peoples to Christianity became more encouraging and less forceful. In British India during the Victorian era, Christian converts were given preferential treatment for governmental appointments.\n\n====Modern Era====\nAt the present time, most countries in which Christianity is the religion of the majority of the people, are either [[secular state]]s or they embrace the [[separation of Church and State]] in another way. (A list of countries in which Christianity is still the state religion can be found in the article on [[State religion]].) Some recent political conflicts are sometimes considered [[religious persecution]]s. Among these, there is the case of the [[Hue Vesak shootings]] in [[South Vietnam]] on May 8,<ref>Tucker, p. 291.</ref> 1963 and the [[Massacres of Albanians in the Balkan Wars|ethnic cleansing of Albanians]], most of whom were Muslim, in [[Kosovo]] between 1992 and 1999, along with the [[Bosnian genocide|genocide of the Bosnian Muslims]].<ref name=\"irf2000\">{{Cite book|title=International Religious Freedom (2000): Report to Congress by the Department of State|author=Barbara Larkin (editor)|isbn=0-7567-1229-7}}</ref>\n\n==Early Christian Thought==\nIn Roman empire, by the first century, the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and [[Middle Platonism|the middle Platonists]] were developing a philosophical monotheism that saw all gods as aspects of the \"one god.\" This provided the ideology for a kind of 'theological tolerance' which became characteristic of paganism in the imperial age.<ref name=\"Meeks\">{{cite book|last=Meeks|first=Wayne A.|title=The First Urban Christians|publisher=Yale University|edition=second|year=2003|ISBN=0-300-09861-8}}</ref>{{rp|165}}  However, Meeks points out that, even with this philosophical development, Christian groups were much more inclusive in terms of social stratification and other social categories than were the Roman voluntary associations.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|79}} Following the teaching of Paul in Colossians 3:11, heterogeneity characterized the Pauline groups, and the role of women was much greater than in either Judaism or paganism.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|81}} Early Christians were told to love others, even enemies, to treat each other as family, and Christians of all sorts called each other \"brother\" and \"sister.\" These concepts and practices were foundational to early Christian thought, have remained central, and can be seen as early precursors to modern concepts of tolerance.<ref name=\"Meeks\"/>{{rp|88-90}}  \n\n[[Tertullian|Tertullian]] (155-200 CE) was a Christian intellectual in late second century Africa who advocated for religious tolerance.

The Edict did not only protect Christians from religious persecution, but all religions, allowing anyone to worship whichever deity they chose.

The Franks had been fighting the Saxons since  Charlemagne's grandfather, with Charlemagne himself beginning in earnest in 772, taking 30 years to finally defeat them.  They made treaties.  The events of 782 began when Widukind, the Saxon leader, persuaded a group of Saxons who had submitted to Charlemagne, to break their treaty and rebel. Charlemagne was elsewhere, so they went to battle with the Frankish army that had been left behind and annihilated it.  They killed two of the King\u2019s chief lieutenants, and some of his closest companions and counsellors. Charlemagne gathered his forces, returned to Saxony, conquered the Saxon rebels, giving them the option of convert or die. The Saxons largely refused, and though no one knows the number for sure, it is said 4500 unarmed prisoners were murdered in what is called the \"[[Massacre of Verden]].\" Massive deportations followed, and death was decreed as the penalty for any Saxon who refused baptism thereafter.<ref name =\"Logan\">{{cite book|last=Logan|first=F.

These tactics were particularly widely used in the [[Northern Crusades]], where Christian rulers \u2013 and, later, monastic orders such as the [[Teutonic Knights]] \u2013 waged a centuries-long series of campaigns to compel the pagan [[Balts]] and [[Slavs]] of the region to convert by conquering them and settling in the newly conquered territory as feudal rulers.<ref>Christiansen, Eric.

It is, to be sure, contrary to the Christian Faith that anyone who is unwilling and wholly opposed to it should be compelled to adopt and observe Christianity. For this reason a valid distinction is made by some between kinds of unwilling ones and kinds of compelled ones. Thus one who is drawn to Christianity by violence, through fear and through torture, and receives the sacrament of Baptism in order to avoid loss, he (like one who comes to Baptism in dissimulation) does receive the impress of Christianity, and may be forced to observe the Christian Faith as one who expressed a conditional willingness though, absolutely speaking, he was unwilling ...<ref>Chazan, Robert, ed., Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages, West Orange, NJ:Behrman House, 1980, p. 103.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn addition to sponsoring forced conversion, the Church accepted the use of forced conversion as a pretext for the elimination of hostile or recalcitrant tribes that did not easily submit to conquest.<ref>Fonnesberg-Schmidt, Iben. \u201cPope Honorius III and Mission and Crusades in the Baltic Region\u201d.

The Reformers \"fully embraced\" Augustine's advocacy of coercion in religious matters, and many regarded the death penalty for heresy as legitimate.<ref name=\"Coffey23\" />  Furthermore, by presenting a much more powerful threat to Catholic unity than the heretic groups of the Middle Ages, the Reformation led to the intensification of persecution under Catholic regimes.\n\n*[[Martin Luther]] had written against persecution in the 1520s, and had demonstrated genuine sympathy towards the Jews in his earlier writings, especially in ''Das Jesus ein geborener Jude sei'' (''That Jesus was born as a Jew'') from 1523,  but after 1525 his position hardened. In ''Wider die Sabbather an einen guten Freund'' (Against the Sabbather to a Good Friend), 1538, he still considered a conversion of the Jews to Christianity as possible,<ref>Thomas Kaufmann, 2005: ''Luthers \"Judenschriften in ihren historischen Kontexten'' (Nachrichten der Akademie der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen) {{in lang|de}}, p. 526</ref> but in 1543 he published [[On the Jews and their Lies]], a \"violent anti-semitic tract.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 23, 24</ref>\n*[[John Calvin]] helped to secure the execution for heresy of [[Michael Servetus]],<ref>Coffey 2000: 24.</ref> although he unsuccessfully requested that he should be beheaded instead of being burned at the stake.\n\nEffectively, however, the 16th-century Protestant view was less extreme than the mediaeval Catholic position. In England, [[John Foxe]], [[John Hales]], [[Richard Perrinchief]], [[Herbert Thorndike]] and [[Jonas Proast]] all only saw mild forms of persecution against the [[English Dissenters]] as legitimate.<ref>see Coffey 2000: 24,25.</ref> But (with the probable exception of John Foxe), this was only a retraction in degree, not a full rejection of religious persecution.  There is also the crucial distinction between ''dissent'' and ''heresy'' to consider. Most dissenters disagreed with the Anglican Church only on secondary matters of worship and ecclesiology, and although this was a considered a serious sin, only a few 17th-century Anglican writers thought that this 'crime' deserved the death penalty.<ref name=\"Coffey00-25\">Coffey 2000: 25</ref> These concerns notwithstanding, the English government saw fit to execute as treasonous a multitude of priests, dissenters, and recusant Catholics, even those who retained but private reservations.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} The English Act of Supremacy thus significantly complicated the matter by securely welding Church and state.\n\nThe Elizabethan bishop [[Thomas Bilson]] was of the opinion that men ought to be \"corrected, not murdered\",  but he did not condemn the Christian Emperors for executing the [[Manichaeans]] for \"monstrous blasphemies\".<ref>Coffey 2000: 24,26; Thomas Bilson 1585, ''The True Difference between Christian Subjection and Unchristian Rebellion'', pp. 19,20, 383.</ref> The Lutheran theologian [[Georgius Calixtus]] argued for the reconciliation of Christendom by removing all unimportant differences between Catholicism and Protestantism, and [[Rupertus Meldenius]] advocated [[in necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas]] (''in necessary things unity; in uncertain things freedom; in everything compassion'') in 1626.\n\n==Protestant advocacy of toleration==\n\n===The English Protestant 'Call for Toleration'===\nWhile the Christian theologians mentioned above advocated religious persecution to various extents, it was also Christians who helped pioneer the concept of [[religious toleration]].\n\nIn his book on 'The English Reformation', particularly in the chapter 'The Origins of Religious Toleration', the late [[A. G. Dickens]] argued that from the beginning of the Reformation there had \"existed in Protestant thought \u2013 in [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] and [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], as well as among the Anabaptists \u2013 a more liberal tradition, which [[John Frith]] was perhaps the first echo in England\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 438}};</ref> Condemned for heresy, Frith was burnt at the stake in 1533. In his own mind, he died not because of the denial of the doctrines on purgatory and transubstantiation but \"for the principle that a particular doctrine on either point was not a necessary part of a Christian's faith\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\">{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|page= 116}};</ref> In other words, there was an important distinction to be made between a genuine article of faith and other matters where a variety of very different conclusions should be tolerated within the Church. This stand against unreasonable and profligate dogmatism meant that Frith, \"to a greater extent than any other of our early Protestants\", upheld \"a certain degree of religious freedom\".<ref name=\"Dickens 1978 116\"/>\n\nFrith was not alone. [[John Foxe]], for example, \"strove hard to save Anabaptists from the fire, and he enunciated a sweeping doctrine of tolerance even towards Catholics, whose doctrines he detested with every fibre of his being\".<ref>{{cite book |title= 'The English Reformation'|last= Dickens|first= A.G.|year= 1978|publisher= Fontana/Collins|location= London & Glasgow|pages= 439\u2013440}};</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, [[Thomas Helwys]] was principal formulator of that distinctively [[Baptist]] request: that the church and the state be kept separate in matters of law, so that individuals might have a freedom of religious conscience. Helwys said the King \"is a mortal man, and not God, therefore he hath no power over the mortal soul of his subjects to make laws and ordinances for them and to set spiritual Lords over them\".<ref>{{cite book |title= \u2018A Short Declaration on the Mystery of Iniquity\u2019|last= Helwys|first= Thomas|year= 1612}};</ref> [[James I of England|King James I]] had Helwys thrown into Newgate prison, where he had died by 1616 at about the age of forty.\n\nBy the time of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on religious toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English [[Puritans]] during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work<ref>Coffey, John (1998) \"Puritanism & Liberty Revisited: The Case for Toleration in the English Revolution\", ''The Historical Journal'', Cambridge University Press.</ref> emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], non-Christian religions, and even [[atheism]]. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the [[General Baptists]] and the [[Levellers]]. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise in a pluralistic society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was in sharp contrast to the ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.\n\nIn 1644 the \"Augustinian consensus concerning persecution was irreparably fractured.\"<ref>Coffey 2000: 47.</ref> This year can be identified quite exactly, because 1644 saw the publication of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'', [[William Walwyn]]'s ''The Compassionate Samaritane'', [[Henry Robinson (writer)|Henry Robinson]]'s ''Liberty of Conscience'' and [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger William]]'s ''[[The Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]].'' These authors were Puritans or had dissented from the Church of England, and their radical Protestantism led them to condemn religious persecution, which they saw as a popish corruption of primitive Christianity.<ref name=Coffey50>Coffey 2000: 50.</ref> Other non-Anglican writers advocating toleration were [[Richard Overton (pamphleteer)|Richard Overton]], [[John Wildman]] and [[John Goodwin (preacher)|John Goodwin]], the Baptists [[Samuel Richardson (Baptist)|Samuel Richardson]] and [[Thomas Collier (Unitarian)|Thomas Collier]] and the Quakers [[Samuel Fisher (quaker)|Samuel Fisher]] and [[William Penn]].

John Milton and John Locke are the predecessors of modern [[liberalism]]. Although Milton was a Puritan and Locke an Anglican, ''Areopagitica'' and ''A Letter concerning Toleration'' are canonical liberal texts.<ref>Coffey 2000: 206; A. Patterson, ''Early Modern Liberalism'', Cambridge 1997</ref>  Only from the 1690s onwards the philosophy of [[Deism]] emerged, and with it a third group that advocated religious toleration, but, unlike the radical Protestants and the Anglicans, also rejected biblical authority; this group prominently includes [[Voltaire]], [[Frederick II of Prussia]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and the English-Irish philosopher [[John Toland]].<ref name=\"Coffey50\" /> When Toland published the writings of Milton, [[Edmund Ludlow]] and [[Algernon Sidney]], he tried to downplay the Puritan divinity in these works.<ref name=\"Coffey2000-207\"/>\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], issued the [[Patent of Toleration]] in 1781.\n\n===Developments in 17th-century England===\n\n{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}\nFollowing the debates that started in the 1640s the [[Church of England]] was the first Christian church to grant adherents of other [[Christian denominations]] freedom of worship, with the [[Act of Toleration 1689]], which  nevertheless still retained some forms of [[religious discrimination]] and did not include toleration for Catholics.

For some Christians, different sects of Christianity represent \"different religions.\" These people thus mistake the survey term \"many religions\" to mean \"different sects of Christianity,\" even though that is not the commonly intended use of the phrase. What the survey really shows is that more US Christians believe that God can make himself known through multiple Christian sects, than believe that He can make Himself known even through other religions. It is worth noting that a majority of US Christians take the more inclusive stance.)\n\n==The mid-20th-century Spanish model==\n{{Separation of church and state in the history of the Catholic Church|expanded = 20th}}\n\nAs of the mid-20th century, an example of Catholic church-state relations was the Catholic situation in [[Spain under Franco|Franco's Spain]], where according to the doctrine of [[National Catholicism]] the Catholic Church:\n* was officially recognized and protected by the state,\n* had substantial control over social policy, and\n* had this relationship explicitly set out in a [[Concordat]].\nIt had long been the policy of the Catholic Church to support [[toleration]] of competing religions under such a scheme, but it also supported legal restrictions on attempts to convert Catholics to those same religions, under the motto that \"error has no rights\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n==Modern Roman Catholic policy==\nOn the seventh of December 1965 The Catholic Church's [[Vatican II]] council issued the decree \"[[Dignitatis humanae]]\" which dealt with the rights of the person and communities to social and civil liberty in religious matters. It states: \"2. The Vatican Council declares that the human person has a right to religious freedom. Freedom of this kind means that all men should be immune from coercion on the part of individuals, social groups and every human power so that, within due limits, nobody is forced to act against his convictions in religious matters in private or public, alone or in associations with others. The Vatican Council further declares that the right of religious freedom is based on the very word of God and by reason itself. This right of the human person to religious freedom must be given such recognition in the constitutional order of society as will make it a civic right...but if it [the civil authority] presumes to control or restrict religious activity it must be said to have exceeded the limits of its power...Therefore, provided the just requirements of public order are not violated, these groups [i.e. religious communities] have a right to immunity so that they may organize their own lives according to their religious principles...From this it follows that it is wrong for a public authority to compel its citizens by force or fear or any other means to profess or repudiate any religion or to prevent anyone from joining or leaving a religious body. There is even more serious transgression of God's will and of the sacred rights of the individual person and the family of nations when force is applied to wipe out or repress religion either throughout the whole world or in a single region or in a particular community\".<ref>Austin Flannery (General Editor), Vatican Council II - The Conciliar and Post Concilliar Documents, 1981 Edition</ref>\n\nOn 12 March 2000 [[Pope John Paul II]] prayed for forgiveness because \"Christians have often denied the Gospel; yielding to a mentality of power, they have violated the rights of ethnic groups and peoples, and shown contempt for their cultures and religious traditions\" <ref>{{cite web|title=POPE JOHN PAUL II ASKS FOR FORGIVENESS|date=March 12, 2000|access-date=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.sacredheart.edu/faithservice/centerforchristianandjewishunderstanding/documentsandstatements/popejohnpauliiasksforforgivenessmarch122000/|publisher=[[Sacred Heart University]]}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger ([[Pope Benedict XVI]]) wrote \"The quality of exemplarity which the honest admission of past faults can exert on attitudes within the Church and civil society should also be noted, for it gives rise to a renewed obedience to the Truth and to respect for the dignity and the rights of others, most especially, of the very weak.

Its root system provides excellent soil retention, it is hardy and provides an attractive shrub even when bare in winter, and its ability to be reproduced by cuttings makes it a low-cost solution for large-scale plantings.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://rwmwd.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=%7B2874F7F4-216C-49AE-A8A0-73062E72001B%7D |title = Home}}</ref><ref>http://www.northjersey.com/news/139671573_Boro_decides_to_fund_PRC_bank_stabilization_project__.html</ref>\n\nSome [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Plateau Indigenous]] tribes ate the berries to treat [[common cold|colds]] and to slow bleeding.<ref name=\"Moerman\">Moerman, Daniel E.

The pass was formed by the [[San Andreas Fault]], a major [[transform fault]] between the [[Pacific plate]] and the [[North American plate]].  The tall mountain ranges on either side of the pass result in the pass being a transitional zone from a [[Mediterranean climate]] west of the pass, to a [[Desert climate]] east of the pass.  This also makes the pass area one of the windiest places in the United States, and why it is home to the [[San Gorgonio Pass wind farm]].\n\nThe pass serves as a major transportation corridor between the [[Greater Los Angeles]] region and the [[Coachella Valley]], and ultimately into [[Arizona]] and the United States interior.  Both [[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]], and the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], the second U.S. [[transcontinental railroad]], utilize the pass.\n\nSan Gorgonio pass is one of the deepest mountain passes in the [[48 contiguous states]], with the mountains to either side rising almost {{convert|9000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above it.  [[San Gorgonio Mountain]], taller but farther away and less visible, is at the northern side of the pass, and [[San Jacinto Peak|Mount San Jacinto]] is on the southern side.

Its first mention, as \"Roteland\", occurs in the will of [[Edward the Confessor]]; in [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] it is \"the King's [[soke (legal)|soc]] of Roteland\", not being then a shire; and in the reign of [[John, King of England|John]] it was assigned as a dowry to [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame|Queen Isabella]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= W.B.H. |title=Rutland: Origin of the Name |journal=Notes and Queries |date=April 1909 |page=294 }}</ref>\n\nThe northwestern part of the county was recorded as Rutland, a detached part of [[Nottinghamshire]], in [[Domesday Book]]; the south-eastern part as the [[wapentake]] of ''Wicelsea'' in [[Northamptonshire]]. It was first mentioned as a separate county in 1159, but as late as the 14th century it was referred to as the '[[Soke (legal)|Soke]] of Rutland'. Historicallym it was also known as '''Rutlandshire;''' however,  the shorter name is more common in recent times.\n\nRutland may be from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|hry\u00fer}}'' or ''{{lang|ang|hrythr}}'' \"cattle\" and ''{{lang|ang|land}}'' \"land\", as a record from 1128 as ''Ritelanede'' shows. However, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names'' by A D Mills gives an alternative etymology, \"Rota's land\", from the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) personal name and ''land'' land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t40.e11276 |title=Rutland |first=A D |last=Mills |year=2003 |work=A Dictionary of British Place-Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=24 April 2010 }}</ref> It is from the alternative interpretation of ''red land'' that the traditional nickname for a male person from Rutland, a \"Raddle Man\", derives.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Joad |editor-first=C.E.M. |title=The English Counties Illustrated |year=1948 |publisher=Odhams Press |page=307 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Rutland}}\n[[File:Clipsham Yew Tree Avenue - Rutland County Council - geograph.org.uk - 1533637.jpg|thumb|Topiary with date at [[Clipsham]] Yew Tree Avenue, marking Rutland's<br> re-establishment in 1997]]\nEarl of Rutland and [[Duke of Rutland]] are titles in the [[peerage]] of England held in the Manners family, derived from the historic county of Rutland. The Earl of Rutland was elevated to the status of [[Duke]] in 1703 and the titles were merged. The family seat is [[Belvoir Castle]], Leicestershire.\n\nThe office of [[High Sheriff of Rutland]] was instituted in 1129, and there has been a [[Lord Lieutenant of Rutland]] since at least 1559.\n\nBy the time of the 19th century it had been divided into the [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s of [[Alstoe]], East Rutland, Martinsley, [[Oakham]] and Wrandike.\n\nRutland covered parts of three [[poor law union]]s and [[rural sanitary district]]s (RSDs): those of Oakham, Uppingham and Stamford. The [[registration county]] of Rutland contained the entirety of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs, which included several parishes in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire \u2013 the eastern part in Stamford RSD was included in the Lincolnshire registration county. Under the Poor Laws, Oakham Union workhouse was built in 1836\u201337 at a site to the north-east of the town, with room for 100 paupers. The building later operated as the Catmose Vale Hospital, and now forms part of the [[Oakham School]].<ref>[http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Oakham/Oakham.shtml Workhouses website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006110956/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Oakham%2FOakham.shtml |date=6 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] the rural sanitary districts were partitioned along county boundaries to form three [[rural district]]s. The part of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs in Rutland formed the [[Oakham Rural District]] and [[Uppingham Rural District]], with the two parishes from Oakham RSD in Leicestershire becoming part of the [[Melton Mowbray Rural District]], the nine parishes of Uppingham RSD in Leicestershire becoming the [[Hallaton Rural District]], and the six parishes of Uppingham RSD in Northamptonshire becoming [[Gretton Rural District]]. Meanwhile, that part of Stamford RSD in Rutland became the [[Ketton Rural District]].\n\n[[Oakham Urban District]] was created from Oakham Rural District in 1911.

The original proposal was for Rutland to be merged with what is now the  [[Melton (borough)|Melton borough]], as Rutland did not meet the requirement of having a population of at least 40,000. The revised and implemented proposals allowed Rutland to be exempt from this.\n\n===Unitary authority (1997\u2013present)===\nIn 1994, the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]], which was conducting a structural review of English local government, recommended that Rutland become a [[unitary authority]]. This was implemented on 1 April 1997, when [[Rutland County Council]] became responsible for almost all local services in Rutland, with the exception of the [[Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service]] and [[Leicestershire Police]], which are run by [[Local Government in the United Kingdom#joint-boards|joint boards]] with [[Leicestershire County Council]] and [[Leicester City Council]].

Its first mention, as \"Roteland\", occurs in the will of [[Edward the Confessor]]; in [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] it is \"the King's [[soke (legal)|soc]] of Roteland\", not being then a shire; and in the reign of [[John, King of England|John]] it was assigned as a dowry to [[Isabella of Angoul\u00eame|Queen Isabella]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= W.B.H. |title=Rutland: Origin of the Name |journal=Notes and Queries |date=April 1909 |page=294 }}</ref>\n\nThe northwestern part of the county was recorded as Rutland, a detached part of [[Nottinghamshire]], in [[Domesday Book]]; the south-eastern part as the [[wapentake]] of ''Wicelsea'' in [[Northamptonshire]]. It was first mentioned as a separate county in 1159, but as late as the 14th century it was referred to as the '[[Soke (legal)|Soke]] of Rutland'. Historically it was also known as '''Rutlandshire''', but in recent times only the shorter name is common.\n\nRutland may be from [[Old English]] ''{{lang|ang|hry\u00fer}}'' or ''{{lang|ang|hrythr}}'' \"cattle\" and ''{{lang|ang|land}}'' \"land\", as a record from 1128 as ''Ritelanede'' shows. However, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names'' by A D Mills gives an alternative etymology, \"Rota's land\", from the Old English (Anglo-Saxon) personal name and ''land'' land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t40.e11276 |title=Rutland |first=A D |last=Mills |year=2003 |work=A Dictionary of British Place-Names |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=24 April 2010 }}</ref> It is from the alternative interpretation of ''red land'' that the traditional nickname for a male person from Rutland, a \"Raddle Man\", derives.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Joad |editor-first=C.E.M. |title=The English Counties Illustrated |year=1948 |publisher=Odhams Press |page=307 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Rutland}}\n[[File:Clipsham Yew Tree Avenue - Rutland County Council - geograph.org.uk - 1533637.jpg|thumb|Topiary with date at [[Clipsham]] Yew Tree Avenue, marking Rutland's<br> re-establishment in 1997]]\nEarl of Rutland and [[Duke of Rutland]] are titles in the [[peerage]] of England held in the Manners family, derived from the historic county of Rutland.

The building later operated as the Catmose Vale Hospital, and now forms part of the [[Oakham School]].<ref>[http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Oakham/Oakham.shtml Workhouses website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006110956/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?Oakham%2FOakham.shtml |date=6 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1894 under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] the rural sanitary districts were partitioned along county boundaries to form three [[rural district]]s. The part of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs in Rutland formed the [[Oakham Rural District]] and [[Uppingham Rural District]], with the two parishes from Oakham RSD in Leicestershire becoming part of the [[Melton Mowbray Rural District]], the nine parishes of Uppingham RSD in Leicestershire becoming the [[Hallaton Rural District]], and the six parishes of Uppingham RSD in Northamptonshire becoming [[Gretton Rural District]]. Meanwhile, that part of Stamford RSD in Rutland became the [[Ketton Rural District]].\n\n[[Oakham Urban District]] was created from Oakham Rural District in 1911.

The final proposals were less radical and instead proposed that Rutland become a single [[rural district]] within the administrative county of Leicestershire.<ref>Little Rutland To Go It Alone \u2013 No Merger with Leicestershire.

The original proposal was for Rutland to be merged with what is now the  [[Melton (borough)|Melton borough]], as Rutland did not meet the requirement of having a population of at least 40,000. The revised and implemented proposals allowed Rutland to be exempt from this.\n\n===Unitary authority (1997\u2013present)===\nIn 1994, the [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)|Local Government Commission for England]], which was conducting a structural review of English local government, recommended that Rutland become a [[unitary authority]]. This was implemented on 1 April 1997, when [[Rutland County Council]] became responsible for almost all local services in Rutland, with the exception of the [[Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service]] and [[Leicestershire Police]], which are run by [[Local Government in the United Kingdom#joint-boards|joint boards]] with [[Leicestershire County Council]] and [[Leicester City Council]].

The Mulde flows into the Elbe {{convert|3|km|mi|0}} north of Dessau.<ref>[[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]</ref>\n\nIn August 2002 a flood caused severe damage, that even endangered the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] \"Dessau-W\u00f6rlitzer Gartenreich\" and the city Dessau.

But more possibly it is related to the German \"mahlen\" which means \"to mill\". Therefore, Mulde probably means \"the milling river\" and corresponds to the great number of water mills driven by the river in former times. Nowadays, there are hydroelectric power stations in use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of rivers of Saxony]]\n*[[List of rivers of Saxony-Anhalt]]\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Mulde}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons|Mulde|Mulde}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Mulde basin| ]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Saxony]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Saxony-Anhalt]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Germany]]\n\n\n{{Saxony-river-stub}}\n{{SaxonyAnhalt-river-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulde"}

In 1342 and 1345, the Hungarians were victorious in a battle against [[Tatars|Tatar-Mongols]]; the conflict was resolved by the death of [[Jani Beg]], in 1357. The Polish chronicler [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] mentioned Moldavians (under the name ''Wallachians'') as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|W\u0142adys\u0142aw I]], against the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].<ref>''The Annals of Jan D\u0142ugosz'', p. 273</ref>\n\nIn 1353, [[Drago\u0219]], mentioned as a Vlach ''[[Knyaz]]'' in [[Maramure\u0219]], was sent by [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] to establish a line of defense against the [[Golden Horde]] forces of Mongols on the [[Siret River]]. This expedition resulted in a polity vassal to Hungary, in the [[Baia]] (''T\u00e2rgul Moldovei'' or ''Moldvab\u00e1nya'') region.\n\n[[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Cuhea]], another Vlach [[voivode]] from Maramure\u0219 who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathians in 1359, took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in removing Moldavia from Hungarian control. His realm extended north to the [[Cheremosh River]], while the southern part of Moldavia was still occupied by the Tatar Mongols.\n\nAfter first residing in Baia, Bogdan moved Moldavia's seat to [[Siret]] (it was to remain there until [[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru Mu\u0219at]] moved it to [[Suceava]]; it was finally moved to [[Ia\u0219i]] under [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] - in 1565). The area around Suceava, roughly correspondent to future [[Bukovina]], would later constitute one of the two administrative divisions of the new realm, under the name ''\u021aara de Sus'' (the \"Upper Land\"), whereas the rest, on both sides of the [[Prut]] river, formed ''\u021aara de Jos'' (the \"Lower Land\").\n\nDisfavored by the brief union of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Angevin Poland]] and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor [[La\u021bcu of Moldavia|La\u021bcu]] accepted [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences. Despite remaining officially [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and culturally connected with the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 1382, princes of the [[House of Bogdan-Mu\u0219at]] entered a conflict with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople Patriarchy]] over control of appointments to the newly founded [[Metropolitan of Moldavia|Moldavian Metropolitan seat]]; [[Patriarch Antony IV of Constantinople|Patriarch Antony IV]] even cast an [[anathema]] over Moldavia after [[Roman I of Moldavia|Roman I]] expelled his appointee back to Byzantium. The crisis was finally settled in favor of the Moldavian princes under [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]]. Nevertheless, religious policy remained complex: while conversions to faiths other than Orthodox were discouraged (and forbidden for princes), Moldavia included sizable Roman Catholic communities (Germans and [[Magyars]]), as well as [[Armenian Apostolic Church|non-Chalcedonic]] [[Armenians in Romania|Armenians]]; after 1460, the country welcomed [[Hussite]] refugees (founders of [[Ciuburciu]] and, probably, [[Hu\u0219i]]).\n\nThe principality of Moldavia covered the entire geographic region of Moldavia. In various periods, various other territories were politically connected with the Moldavian principality. This is the case of the province of [[Pokuttya]], the fiefdoms of [[Cetatea de Balt\u0103]] and [[Ciceu]] (both in [[Transylvania]]) or, at a later date, the territories between the Dniester and the Bug rivers.\n\n[[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I]] profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon realm]], becoming a [[Vassalage|vassal]] of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|W\u0142adys\u0142aw II]] on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the [[Teutonic Knights]], and was granted control over [[Pokuttya]] until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the [[Danube Delta]]. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Alb\u0103]] in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the [[Black Sea]], before being toppled from the throne for supporting [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] in his conflict with [[Vytautas the Great]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Under [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]], growing Polish influence was challenged by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], whose expedition was defeated at [[Ghind\u0103oani]] in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.\n\nAlthough [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]] was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from [[Mircea I of Wallachia]]), he shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|Siege of Marienburg]]), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia's history, but also saw the very first confrontation with the [[Ottoman Turks]] at Cetatea Alb\u0103 in 1420, and later even a conflict with the Poles. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]] and the ascension of [[Peter III Aaron]] in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as [[Matthias Corvinus]] deposed Aron and backed [[Alex\u0103ndrel]] to the throne in [[Suceava]]. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire]] allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay [[tribute]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Stephen the Great}}\n{{See also|Moldavian\u2013Ottoman Wars}}\n\nUnder [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], who took the throne and subsequently came to an agreement with [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1457, the state reached its most glorious period. Stephen blocked Hungarian interventions in the [[Battle of Baia]], invaded Wallachia in 1471, and dealt with Ottoman reprisals in a major victory (the 1475 [[Battle of Vaslui]]); after feeling threatened by Polish ambitions, he also attacked [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and resisted Polish reprisals in the [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest]] (1497). However, he had to surrender [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]] (Kiliya) and Cetatea Alb\u0103 ([[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]]), the two main fortresses in the [[Budjak]], to the Ottomans in 1484, and in 1498 he had to accept Ottoman suzerainty, when he was forced to agree to continue paying tribute to Sultan [[Bayezid II]]. Following the taking of [[Khotyn|Hotin]] (Khotyn) and [[Pokuttya]], Stephen's rule also brought a brief extension of Moldavian rule into [[Transylvania]]: Cetatea de Balt\u0103 and [[Ciceu]] became his [[Fiefdom|fiefs]] in 1489.\n\n=== Early Modern Era and Renaissance ===\n{{Main|Early Modern Romania}}\n{{See also|Early Modern Wallachia|Early Modern Transylvania}}\n[[File:Khotyn 3.jpg|thumb|[[Khotyn Fortress]] on the [[Dniester]] River, present-day [[Ukraine]], then bordering the northern frontier of the Moldavian Principality and southern [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]\n\nUnder [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]], Ottoman overlordship was confirmed in the shape that would rapidly evolve into control over Moldavia's affairs. [[Peter IV Rare\u0219]], who reigned in the 1530s and 1540s, clashed with the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] over his ambitions in Transylvania (losing possessions in the region to [[George Martinuzzi]]), was defeated in Pokuttya by Poland, and failed in his attempt to extricate Moldavia from Ottoman rule \u2013 the country lost [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] to the Ottomans, who included it in their [[Silistra Eyalet]].\n\nA period of profound crisis followed. Moldavia stopped issuing its own coinage circa 1520, under [[Stephen IV of Moldavia|Prince \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103]], when it was confronted with rapid depletion of funds and rising demands from the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]. Such problems became endemic when the country, brought into the [[Great Turkish War]], suffered the impact of the [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire]]; at one point, during the 1650s and 1660s, princes began relying on [[counterfeit]] coinage (usually copies of [[Swedish riksdaler]]s, as was that issued by [[Eustratie Dabija]]). The economic decline was accompanied by a failure to maintain state structures: the [[Feudalism|feudal]]-based [[Moldavian military forces]] were no longer convoked, and the few troops maintained by the rulers remained professional [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] such as the ''[[seimeni]]''.\n\n[[File:Jassy (Iasi)-Trei Ierarhi Monastery (J.Rey, 1845).jpg|thumb|left|[[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] in Ia\u0219i, housed the [[Vasilian College]], an institution of higher learning founded in 1640]]\n[[File:Mihai 1600.png|thumb|left|In 1600, [[Michael the Brave]] became Prince of Wallachia, of Transylvania, and of Moldavia.]]\n\nHowever, Moldavia and the similarly affected Wallachia remained both important sources of income for the Ottoman Empire and relatively prosperous agricultural economies (especially as suppliers of grain and cattle \u2013 the latter was especially relevant in Moldavia, which remained an under-populated country of [[pasture]]s). In time, much of the resources were tied to the [[Economic history of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman economy]], either through [[Monopoly|monopolies]] on trade that were only lifted in 1829, after the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] (which did not affect all domains directly), or through the raise in direct taxes - the one demanded by the Ottomans from the princes, as well as the ones demanded by the princes from the country's population. Taxes were directly proportional with Ottoman requests, but also with the growing importance of Ottoman appointment and sanctioning of princes in front of election by the [[boyar]]s and the boyar Council \u2013 ''[[Sfatul boieresc]]'' (drawing in a competition among pretenders, which also implied the intervention of creditors as suppliers of bribes). The fiscal system soon included taxes such as the ''[[Historical Romanian taxes|v\u0103c\u0103rit]]'' (a tax on head of cattle), first introduced by [[Iancu Sasul]] in the 1580s.\n\nThe economic opportunities offered brought about a significant influx of [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] and [[Levant]]ine financiers and officials, who entered a stiff competition with the high boyars over appointments to the Court. As the [[Manorialism|manor system]] suffered the blows of economic crises, and in the absence of [[Salary|salarisation]] (which implied that persons in office could decide their own income), obtaining princely appointment became the major focus of a boyar's career. Such changes also implied the decline of free peasantry and the rise of [[serfdom]], as well as the rapid fall in the importance of low boyars (a traditional institution, the latter soon became marginal, and, in more successful instances, added to the population of towns); however, they also implied a rapid transition towards a [[monetary economy]], based on exchanges in foreign currency. Serfdom was doubled by the much less numerous slave population (''robi''), composed of migrant [[Roma in Romania|Roma]] and captured [[Nogais]].\n\n[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|Moldavia through the ages]]\n\nThe conflict between princes and boyars was to become exceptionally violent \u2013 the latter group, who frequently appealed to the Ottoman court in order to have princes comply with its demands, was persecuted by rulers such as [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] and [[John III the Terrible|John III]]. Ioan Vod\u0103's revolt against the Ottomans ended in his execution (1574). The country descended into political chaos, with frequent Ottoman and [[Tatars|Tatar]] incursions and pillages. The claims of Mu\u0219atins to the crown and the traditional system of succession were ended by scores of illegitimate reigns; one of the usurpers, [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]], was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Greek who encouraged the [[Renaissance]] and attempted to introduce [[Lutheranism]] to Moldavia.\n\nIn 1595, the rise of the [[Movile\u0219ti]] boyars to the throne with [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]] coincided with the start of frequent anti-Ottoman and anti-[[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] military expeditions of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] into Moldavian territory (see ''[[Moldavian Magnate Wars]]''), and rivalries between pretenders to the Moldavian throne encouraged by the three competing powers.\n\nThe Wallachian prince [[Michael the Brave]], after previously taking over [[Transylvania]], also deposed Prince Ieremia Movil\u0103, in 1600, and managed to become the first Prince to rule over Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania;<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379802/Michael Michael the Brave] at [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]</ref><ref name=\"White2000\">{{cite book|author=George W.

Polish incursions were dealt a blow by the Ottomans during the 1620 [[Battle of Cecora (1620)|Battle of Cecora]], which also saw an end to the reign of [[Gaspar Graziani]].\n\nA period of relative peace followed during the more prosperous and prestigious rule of [[Vasile Lupu]]. He took the throne as a boyar appointee in 1637 and began battling his rival [[Gheorghe \u0218tefan]], as well as the Wallachian prince [[Matei Basarab]]. However, his invasion of Wallachia, with the backing of [[Cossack]] [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], ended in disaster at the [[Battle of Finta]] in 1653. A few years later, Moldavia was occupied for two short intervals by the anti-Ottoman Wallachian prince [[Constantin \u0218erban]], who clashed with the first ruler of the [[Ghica family]], [[George Ghica]]. In the early 1680s, Moldavian troops under [[George Ducas]] intervened in [[right-bank Ukraine]] and assisted [[Mehmed IV]] in the [[Battle of Vienna]], only to suffer the effects of the [[Great Turkish War]].\n\n===Phanariots (1711\u20131822)===\n{{Main|Phanariotes|History of the Russo-Turkish wars}}\n[[File:Principati1786.jpg|thumb|The Principalities of Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] in 1782, Italian map by G.

Prince [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] sided with Peter in open rebellion against the Ottomans, but he was defeated at [[St\u0103nile\u0219ti]]. Sultan [[Ahmed III]] officially discarded recognition of local choices for princes, imposing instead a system relying solely on Ottoman approval: the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote epoch]], inaugurated by the reign of [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]].\n\nPhanariote rule was marked by [[political corruption]], intrigue, and high taxation, as well as by sporadic incursions of Habsburg and Russian armies deep into Moldavian territory. Nonetheless, they also attempted legislative and administrative modernization inspired by [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] (such as the decision by [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]] to salarize public offices, to the outrage of boyars, and the abolition of serfdom in 1749, as well as [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]]'s ''Code''), and signified a decrease in Ottoman demands after the threat of Russian annexation became real and the prospects of a better life led to waves of peasant emigration to neighboring lands. The effects of Ottoman control were also made less notable after the 1774 [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Ottoman subjects of the Eastern Orthodox faith - leading to campaigns of petitioning by the Moldavian boyars against princely policies.\n\nIn 1712, [[Khotyn|Hotin]] was taken over by the Ottomans and became part of a defensive system that Moldavian princes were required to maintain, as well as an area for Islamic [[colonization]] (the [[Laz people|Laz]] community).\n\n===Fragmentation===\n{{See also|Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca|Treaty of Bucharest (1812)}}\n[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|The Principality of Moldavia, 1793\u20131812, highlighted in orange]]\n\nIn 1775 Moldavia lost to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] its northwestern part, which became known as [[Bukovina]]. For Moldavia, it meant both an important territorial loss and a major blow to the cattle trade, as the region stood on the trade route to Central Europe.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Jassy]] in 1792 forced the Ottoman Empire to cede [[Yedisan]] to the Russian Empire, which made Russian presence much more notable, given that the Empire acquired a common border with Moldavia. The first effect of this was the cession of the eastern half of Moldavia (renamed as [[Bessarabia]]) to the Russian Empire in 1812.\n\n===Organic Statute, 1848 revolution===\n{{Main|National awakening of Romania|Regulamentul Organic|Moldavian Revolution of 1848|Wallachian Revolution of 1848}}\n[[File:Statuia lui \u015etefan cel Mare din Ia\u015fi1.jpg|thumb|left|Ia\u0219i, [[Palace of Culture (Ia\u0219i)|Princely Palace]] of Moldavia]]\n\nPhanariote rule was officially ended after the 1821 occupation of the country by [[Alexander Ypsilantis]]'s [[Filiki Eteria]] during the [[Greek War of Independence]]; the subsequent Ottoman retaliation led to the rule of [[Ioan Sturdza]]. He was considered the first of a new system, since the Ottomans and Russia had agreed in 1826 to allow for the election by locals of rulers over the two [[Danubian Principalities]], and convened on their mandating for seven-year terms. In practice, a new foundation to reigns in Moldavia was created by the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)]], beginning a period of Russian domination over the two countries which ended only in 1856. Begun as a military occupation under the command of [[Pavel Kiselyov]], Russian domination gave Wallachia and Moldavia, which were not removed from nominal Ottoman control, the modernizing ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'' (the first document resembling a [[constitution]], as well as the first to regard both principalities). After 1829, the country also became an important destination for [[immigration]] of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] and areas of Russia (''see [[History of the Jews in Romania]] and [[Sudi\u021bi]]'').\n\n[[File:Obeliscul cu lei Iasi 02.JPG|thumb|Ia\u0219i, [[Copou Park|Obelisk of Lions]] (1834), dedicated to the Organic Statute]]\n\nThe first Moldavian rule established under the Statute, that of [[Mihail Sturdza]], was nonetheless ambivalent: eager to reduce abuse of office, Sturdza introduced reforms (the abolition of slavery, [[secularization]], economic rebuilding), but he was widely seen as enforcing his own power over that of the newly instituted consultative Assembly. A supporter of the union of his country with Wallachia and of Romanian [[Romantic nationalism]], he obtained the establishment of a [[customs union]] between the two countries (1847) and showed support for [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] projects favored by low boyars; nevertheless, he clamped down with noted violence the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Moldavian revolutionary attempt]] in the last days of March 1848. [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] allowed the exiled revolutionaries to return to Moldavia c. 1853, which led to the creation of the [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]] ({{lang|ro|Partida Na\u021bional\u0103}}), a trans-boundary group of radical union supporters which campaigned for a single state under a foreign dynasty.\n\n===Southern Bessarabia===\n{{See also|Southern Bessarabia}}\n[[File:Rom1856-1859.png|thumb|Moldavia (in orange) after 1856]]\nIn 1856, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the Russian Empire returned to Moldavia a significant territory in southern [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabia]] (including a part of [[Budjak]]), organised later as the [[Bolgrad]], [[Cahul]], and [[Izmail|Ismail]] counties.<ref name=king23-hitch41>King, p.22-23; Hitchins, p. 41</ref>\n\n===Union with Wallachia===\n\nRussian domination ended abruptly after the [[Crimean War]], when the Treaty of Paris also passed the two Romanian principalities under the tutelage of [[Great power|Great European Powers]] (together with Russia and the Ottoman overlord, power-sharing included the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], and [[Prussia]]). Due to Austrian and Ottoman opposition and British reserves, the union program as demanded by radical campaigners was debated intensely. In September 1857, given that ''[[Kaymakam|Caimacam]]'' [[Nicolae Vogoride]] had perpetrated [[Electoral fraud|fraud]] in elections in Moldavia, the Powers allowed the two states to convene ad-hoc [[divan]]s, which were to decide a new constitutional framework; the result showed overwhelming support for the union, as the creation of a [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] state. After further meetings among leaders of tutor states, an agreement was reached (the ''Paris Convention''), whereby a limited union was to be enforced \u2013 separate governments and thrones, with only two bodies (a [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Court of Cassation]] and a Central Commission residing in [[Foc\u0219ani]]); it also stipulated that an end to all privilege was to be passed into law, and awarded back to Moldavia the areas around [[Bolhrad]], [[Cahul]], and [[Izmail]].\n\nHowever, the Convention failed to note whether the two thrones could not be occupied by the same person, allowing ''Partida Na\u021bional\u0103'' to introduce the candidacy of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] in both countries. On January 17 (January 5, 1859 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]]), in [[Ia\u0219i]], he was elected prince of Moldavia by the respective electoral body. After street pressure over the much more [[Conservatism|conservative]] body in [[Bucharest]], Cuza was elected in Wallachia as well (February 5/January 24). Exactly three years later, after diplomatic missions that helped remove opposition to the action, the formal union created the [[United Principalities]] (the basis of modern Romania) and instituted Cuza as ''[[Domnitor]]'' (all legal matters were clarified after the replacement of the prince with [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] in April 1866, and the creation of an independent [[Kingdom of Romania]] in 1881) - this officially ending the existence of the Principality of Moldavia.\n\n==Society==\n\n===Slavery===\n{{further|Slavery in Romania#Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia}}\nSlavery ({{lang-ro|robie}}) was part of the [[social class|social order]] from before the founding of the Principality of Moldavia, until it was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] (Gypsy) ethnicity. There were also slaves of [[Tatars|Tatar]] ethnicity, probably prisoners captured from the wars with the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai]] and [[Crimean Tatars]]. The institution of slavery was first attested in a 1470 Moldavian document, through which Prince [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] frees Oan\u0103, a Tatar slave who had fled to [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon Poland]].<ref name=Achim>Viorel Achim, ''The Roma in Romanian History'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-9241-84-9}}</ref>\n\nThe exact origins of slavery are not known, as it was a common [[Slavery in medieval Europe|practice in medieval Europe]]. As in the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Roma were held as slaves of the state, of the [[boyars]] or of the monasteries. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era; he believed that the Romanians took the Roma as slaves from the [[Mongols]] and preserved their status to control their labor. Other historians consider that the Roma were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. The ethnic identity of the \"Tatar slaves\" is unknown, they could have been captured Tatars of the [[Golden Horde]], [[Cuman people|Cumans]], or the slaves of Tatars and Cumans.<ref name=Achim/> While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, most of them came from south of the [[Danube]], demonstrating that slavery a widespread practice. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.<ref name=Stefanescu>\u0218tefan \u0218tef\u0103nescu, ''Istoria medie a Rom\u00e2niei'', Vol. I, Editura Universit\u0103\u021bii din Bucure\u0219ti, Bucharest, 1991 {{in lang|ro}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, Roma slaves were divided into three categories. The smallest was owned by the ''hospodars'', and went by the Romanian-language name of ''\u021bigani domne\u0219ti'' (\"Gypsies belonging to the lord\"). The two other categories comprised ''\u021bigani m\u0103n\u0103stire\u0219ti'' (\"Gypsies belonging to the monasteries\"), who were the property of [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monasteries, and ''\u021bigani boiere\u0219ti'' (\"Gypsies belonging to the boyars\"), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.<ref name=Djuvara>[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''\u00centre Orient \u0219i Occident. \u021a\u0103rile rom\u00e2ne la \u00eenceputul epocii moderne'', Humanitas, Bucharest, 1995. {{ISBN|973-28-0523-4}} {{in lang|ro}}</ref><ref name=Guy>Will Guy, ''Between Past and Future: The Roma of Central and Eastern Europe'', University of Hertfordshire Press, Hatfield, 2001. {{ISBN|1-902806-07-7}}</ref>\n\nThe abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In 1844, Moldavian Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]] proposed a law on the freeing of slaves owned by the church and state. By the 1850s, the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society. In December 1855, following a proposal by Prince [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]], a bill drafted by [[Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu]] and [[Petre Mavrogheni]] was adopted by the Divan; the law emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).<ref name=Achim/><ref name=Djuvara/>\n\nSupport for the abolitionists was reflected in [[Romanian literature]] of the mid-19th century. The issue of the Roma slavery became a theme in the literary works of various [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] intellectuals, many of whom were active in the abolitionist camp. The Romanian abolitionist movement was also influenced by the much larger movement against [[Slavery in the United States|Black slavery]] in the United States through press reports and through a translation of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. Translated by Theodor Codrescu and first published in [[Ia\u0219i]] in 1853, under the name ''Coliba lui Mo\u0219u Toma sau Via\u021ba negrilor \u00een sudul Statelor Unite din America'' (which translates back as \"Uncle Toma's Cabin or the Life of Blacks in the Southern United States of America\"), it was the first American novel to be published in Romanian.

Stephen justified this by saying that \"every man has a duty to defend his fatherland\"; according to Polish chronicler [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]], if someone was found without carrying a weapon, he was [[Death sentence|sentenced to death]].<ref>''The Annals of Jan D\u0142ugosz'', p. 566</ref> Stephen reformed the army by promoting men from the landed free peasantry ''r\u0103ze\u0219i'' (i.e. something akin to [[freehold (law)|freeholding]] [[yeomen]]) to infantry (''voinici'') and light cavalry (''h\u00e2nsari'') \u2014 to make himself less dependent on the [[boyars]] \u2014 and introduced his army to guns. In times of crises, The Small Host (''Oastea Mic\u0103'') \u2014 which consisted of around 10,000 to 12,000 men \u2014 stood ready to engage the enemy, while the Large Host (''Oastea Mare'') \u2014 which could reach up to 40,000 \u2014 had all the free peasantry older than 14, and strong enough to carry a [[sword]] or use the [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], recruited. This seldom happened, for such a [[lev\u00e9e en masse]] was devastating for both economy and population growth. In the [[Battle of Vaslui]], Stephen had to summon the Large Host and also recruited [[mercenary]] troops.\n\n[[File:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|thumb|Battle flag of Stephen the Great]]\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], the Moldavians relied on light [[cavalry]] (''[[C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i (cavalry)|c\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i]]'') which used [[hit-and-run tactics]] similar to those of the [[Tatars]]; this gave them great mobility and also flexibility, in case they found it more suitable to dismount their horses and fight in hand-to-hand combat, as it happened in 1422, when 400 [[horse archer]]s were sent to aid [[History of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Jagiellon Poland]], Moldavia's overlord against the [[Teutonic Knights]]. When making eye-contact with the enemy, the horse archers would withdraw to a nearby forest and [[camouflage]] themselves with leaves and branches; according to Jan D\u0142ugosz, when the enemy entered the wood, they were \"showered with arrows\" and defeated.<ref>D\u0142ugosz, p. 438</ref>  The heavy cavalry consisted of the nobility, namely, the boyars and their guards, the ''viteji'' (lit. \"brave ones\", small nobility) and the ''curteni'' \u2014 the Court Cavalry (all nominally part of the ''Small Host''). In times of war, boyars were compelled by the [[Feudalism|feudal system of allegiance]] to supply the prince with troops in accordance with the extent of their [[Manorialism|manorial domain]].\n\nOther troops consisted of professional foot soldiers (''lefegii'') which fulfilled the [[Heavy infantry#Middle Ages|heavy infantry]] role, and the ''pl\u0103ie\u0219i'', free peasants whose role was that of border guards: they guarded the mountain passes and were prepared to [[ambush]] the enemy and to fight delaying actions.\n\nIn the absence of the prince, command was assigned to the ''Mare Sp\u0103tar'' (Grand Sword-Bearer - a military office) or to the ''Mare Vornic'' (approx. Governor of the Country; a civilian office second only to the ''[[Voievod#Moldavia and Wallachia|Voievod]]'', which was filled by the prince himself). Supplying the troops was by tradition-later-made-into-law the duty of the inhabitants of those lands on which the soldiers were present at a given time.\n\nThe Moldavians' (as well as Wallachians') favourite military doctrine in (defensive) wars was a [[scorched earth]] policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using [[hit-and-run tactics]] and disruption of communication and supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured in a place where it would find itself in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains of what was once the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed all the way to the border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the [[Battle of Vaslui]].\n\nTowards the end of the 15th century, especially after the success of [[gun]]s and [[cannon]]s, mercenaries became a dominant force in the country's military. With the economic demands created by the [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire]], the force diminished and included only mercenaries such as the ''[[seimeni]]''.\n\nThe 1829 [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] allowed Moldavia to again maintain its own troops, no longer acting as an auxiliary under strict Ottoman supervision, and assigned red over blue [[Flag terminology|pennants]] (''see [[Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia]]''). Their renewed existence under [[Mihail Sturdza]] was a major symbol and rally point for the [[Romantic nationalism|nationalist]] cause, aiding in bringing about the [[1848 Moldavian revolution]].\n\n===Fleet===\n\nAn early mention of a Moldavian [[naval fleet]] is found in connection with the rule of [[Aron Tiranul]], who used it to help [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian ruler]] [[Michael the Brave]] establish his control over the [[Chilia branch]] of the [[Danube]] and [[Dobruja]].\n\nThe Treaty of Adrianople provided for a Moldavian self-defense naval force, to be composed of [[caicque]] vessels. [[Schooner]]s armed with [[cannon]]s were first built in the 1840s. Along with patrolling the Danube, these made their way on its tributaries, the [[Siret River|Siret]] and the [[Prut River]].\n\n===Flags and historical coats of arms===\n{{Further|Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia}}\n<gallery>\nFile:MoldavianOldCoatWijsbergen.jpg|Coat of arms of Moldavia under Prince Stephen III the Great\nFile:Coa Romania Country History \u0218tefan cel Mare (1457-1504) v2.svg|Coat of arms of Stephen III of Moldavia\nFile:Historical Baia Suceava CoA 14th century.png|14th century coat of arms of Baia, the first capital of Moldavia\nFile:Biserica Sf\u00e2ntul Dumitru din Suceava13.jpg|Coat of arms of the Principality of Moldavia depicted on the walls of St. Demetrius Church in Suceava\nFile:Moldova herb.jpg|Coat of arms of the principality of Moldavia, at the [[Cet\u0103\u021buia Monastery]] in Ia\u0219i\nFile:Slatina Lapusneanu.jpg|16th century coat of arms of Moldavia during [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]]'s reign, on one of the walls from Slatina Monastery\nFile:Stema Mihai Viteazul.jpg|Seal of [[Michael the Brave]] (showing the arms of [[Wallachia]], Moldavia, and [[Transylvania]])\nFile:Coa Dimitrie Cantemir 1734.jpg|Coat of arms of [[Dimitrie Cantemir]]\nFile:Wappen Herzogtum Bukowina.png|Historical coat of arms of the [[Duchy of Bukovina]]\nFile:Palace of Justice, Vienna - Aula, Coat of Arms - Herzogtum Bukowina 4216.jpg|Coat of arms of the Duchy of Bukovina on display at the [[Palace of Justice (Vienna)|Palace of Justice]] in Vienna, Austria\nFile:Coat of arms of Ioan Radu Cantacuzino, 1744.jpg|[[Cantacuzino family]] coat of arms\nFile:Moruzi family coat of arms.svg|[[Moruzi family]] coat of arms\nFile:Sturdza family coat of arms (Eugene Rizo Rangab\u00e9 version).svg|[[Sturdza family]] coat of arms\nFile:Stema Moldovei.png|Coat of Arms of the Principality of Moldavia (19th century depiction)\nFile:Stema Bucovinei.png|Coat of arms of Bukovina\nFile:Stema Basarabiei.png|Coat of arms of the Bessarabia\nFile:Flag of the Moldavian Democratic Republic.svg|Flag of the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] (1917\u201318)\nFile:Etendard d'Etienne le Grand - 28 juillet 1917, \u00e0 la Sorbonne (Agence Rol).jpg|Medieval flag of Moldavia held by two Romanian soldiers at [[Sorbonne]], Paris, France\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\n{{See also|Moldavian Plateau}}\n[[File:PhysicalAncientMoldavia.jpg|thumb|Physical map of Moldavia]]\nGeographically, Moldavia is limited by the [[Carpathian Mountains]] to the West, the [[Cheremosh River]] to the North, the [[Dniester River]] to the East and the [[Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the South.

In 1342 and 1345, the Hungarians were victorious in a battle against [[Tatars|Tatar-Mongols]]; the conflict was resolved by the death of [[Jani Beg]], in 1357.

This expedition resulted in a polity vassal to Hungary, in the [[Baia]] (''T\u00e2rgul Moldovei'' or ''Moldvab\u00e1nya'') region.\n\n[[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Cuhea]], another Vlach [[voivode]] from Maramure\u0219 who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathians in 1359, took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in removing Moldavia from Hungarian control. His realm extended north to the [[Cheremosh River]], while the southern part of Moldavia was still occupied by the Tatar Mongols.\n\nAfter first residing in Baia, Bogdan moved Moldavia's seat to [[Siret]] (it was to remain there until [[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru Mu\u0219at]] moved it to [[Suceava]]; it was finally moved to [[Ia\u0219i]] under [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] - in 1565). The area around Suceava, roughly correspondent to future [[Bukovina]], would later constitute one of the two administrative divisions of the new realm, under the name ''\u021aara de Sus'' (the \"Upper Land\"), whereas the rest, on both sides of the [[Prut]] river, formed ''\u021aara de Jos'' (the \"Lower Land\").\n\nDisfavored by the brief union of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Angevin Poland]] and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor [[La\u021bcu of Moldavia|La\u021bcu]] accepted [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences. Despite remaining officially [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and culturally connected with the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 1382, princes of the [[House of Bogdan-Mu\u0219at]] entered a conflict with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople Patriarchy]] over control of appointments to the newly founded [[Metropolitan of Moldavia|Moldavian Metropolitan seat]]; [[Patriarch Antony IV of Constantinople|Patriarch Antony IV]] even cast an [[anathema]] over Moldavia after [[Roman I of Moldavia|Roman I]] expelled his appointee back to Byzantium. The crisis was finally settled in favor of the Moldavian princes under [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]]. Nevertheless, religious policy remained complex: while conversions to faiths other than Orthodox were discouraged (and forbidden for princes), Moldavia included sizable Roman Catholic communities (Germans and [[Magyars]]), as well as [[Armenian Apostolic Church|non-Chalcedonic]] [[Armenians in Romania|Armenians]]; after 1460, the country welcomed [[Hussite]] refugees (founders of [[Ciuburciu]] and, probably, [[Hu\u0219i]]).\n\nThe principality of Moldavia covered the entire geographic region of Moldavia. In various periods, various other territories were politically connected with the Moldavian principality. This is the case of the province of [[Pokuttya]], the fiefdoms of [[Cetatea de Balt\u0103]] and [[Ciceu]] (both in [[Transylvania]]) or, at a later date, the territories between the Dniester and the Bug rivers.\n\n[[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I]] profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon realm]], becoming a [[Vassalage|vassal]] of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|W\u0142adys\u0142aw II]] on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the [[Teutonic Knights]], and was granted control over [[Pokuttya]] until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the [[Danube Delta]]. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Alb\u0103]] in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the [[Black Sea]], before being toppled from the throne for supporting [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] in his conflict with [[Vytautas the Great]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Under [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]], growing Polish influence was challenged by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], whose expedition was defeated at [[Ghind\u0103oani]] in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.\n\nAlthough [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]] was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from [[Mircea I of Wallachia]]), he shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|Siege of Marienburg]]), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia's history, but also saw the very first confrontation with the [[Ottoman Turks]] at Cetatea Alb\u0103 in 1420, and later even a conflict with the Poles. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]] and the ascension of [[Peter III Aaron]] in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as [[Matthias Corvinus]] deposed Aron and backed [[Alex\u0103ndrel]] to the throne in [[Suceava]]. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire]] allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay [[tribute]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{Main|Stephen the Great}}\n{{See also|Moldavian\u2013Ottoman Wars}}\n\nUnder [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], who took the throne and subsequently came to an agreement with [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1457, the state reached its most glorious period. Stephen blocked Hungarian interventions in the [[Battle of Baia]], invaded Wallachia in 1471, and dealt with Ottoman reprisals in a major victory (the 1475 [[Battle of Vaslui]]); after feeling threatened by Polish ambitions, he also attacked [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and resisted Polish reprisals in the [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest]] (1497). However, he had to surrender [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]] (Kiliya) and Cetatea Alb\u0103 ([[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]]), the two main fortresses in the [[Budjak]], to the Ottomans in 1484, and in 1498 he had to accept Ottoman suzerainty, when he was forced to agree to continue paying tribute to Sultan [[Bayezid II]]. Following the taking of [[Khotyn|Hotin]] (Khotyn) and [[Pokuttya]], Stephen's rule also brought a brief extension of Moldavian rule into [[Transylvania]]: Cetatea de Balt\u0103 and [[Ciceu]] became his [[Fiefdom|fiefs]] in 1489.\n\n=== Early Modern Era and Renaissance ===\n{{Main|Early Modern Romania}}\n{{See also|Early Modern Wallachia|Early Modern Transylvania}}\n[[File:Khotyn 3.jpg|thumb|[[Khotyn Fortress]] on the [[Dniester]] River, present-day [[Ukraine]], then bordering the northern frontier of the Moldavian Principality and southern [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]\n\nUnder [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]], Ottoman overlordship was confirmed in the shape that would rapidly evolve into control over Moldavia's affairs. [[Peter IV Rare\u0219]], who reigned in the 1530s and 1540s, clashed with the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] over his ambitions in Transylvania (losing possessions in the region to [[George Martinuzzi]]), was defeated in Pokuttya by Poland, and failed in his attempt to extricate Moldavia from Ottoman rule \u2013 the country lost [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] to the Ottomans, who included it in their [[Silistra Eyalet]].\n\nA period of profound crisis followed. Moldavia stopped issuing its own coinage circa 1520, under [[Stephen IV of Moldavia|Prince \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103]], when it was confronted with rapid depletion of funds and rising demands from the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]. Such problems became endemic when the country, brought into the [[Great Turkish War]], suffered the impact of the [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire]]; at one point, during the 1650s and 1660s, princes began relying on [[counterfeit]] coinage (usually copies of [[Swedish riksdaler]]s, as was that issued by [[Eustratie Dabija]]). The economic decline was accompanied by a failure to maintain state structures: the [[Feudalism|feudal]]-based [[Moldavian military forces]] were no longer convoked, and the few troops maintained by the rulers remained professional [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] such as the ''[[seimeni]]''.\n\n[[File:Jassy (Iasi)-Trei Ierarhi Monastery (J.Rey, 1845).jpg|thumb|left|[[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] in Ia\u0219i, housed the [[Vasilian College]], an institution of higher learning founded in 1640]]\n[[File:Mihai 1600.png|thumb|left|In 1600, [[Michael the Brave]] became Prince of Wallachia, of Transylvania, and of Moldavia.]]\n\nHowever, Moldavia and the similarly affected Wallachia remained both important sources of income for the Ottoman Empire and relatively prosperous agricultural economies (especially as suppliers of grain and cattle \u2013 the latter was especially relevant in Moldavia, which remained an under-populated country of [[pasture]]s). In time, much of the resources were tied to the [[Economic history of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman economy]], either through [[Monopoly|monopolies]] on trade that were only lifted in 1829, after the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] (which did not affect all domains directly), or through the raise in direct taxes - the one demanded by the Ottomans from the princes, as well as the ones demanded by the princes from the country's population. Taxes were directly proportional with Ottoman requests, but also with the growing importance of Ottoman appointment and sanctioning of princes in front of election by the [[boyar]]s and the boyar Council \u2013 ''[[Sfatul boieresc]]'' (drawing in a competition among pretenders, which also implied the intervention of creditors as suppliers of bribes). The fiscal system soon included taxes such as the ''[[Historical Romanian taxes|v\u0103c\u0103rit]]'' (a tax on head of cattle), first introduced by [[Iancu Sasul]] in the 1580s.\n\nThe economic opportunities offered brought about a significant influx of [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] and [[Levant]]ine financiers and officials, who entered a stiff competition with the high boyars over appointments to the Court. As the [[Manorialism|manor system]] suffered the blows of economic crises, and in the absence of [[Salary|salarisation]] (which implied that persons in office could decide their own income), obtaining princely appointment became the major focus of a boyar's career. Such changes also implied the decline of free peasantry and the rise of [[serfdom]], as well as the rapid fall in the importance of low boyars (a traditional institution, the latter soon became marginal, and, in more successful instances, added to the population of towns); however, they also implied a rapid transition towards a [[monetary economy]], based on exchanges in foreign currency. Serfdom was doubled by the much less numerous slave population (''robi''), composed of migrant [[Roma in Romania|Roma]] and captured [[Nogais]].\n\n[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|Moldavia through the ages]]\n\nThe conflict between princes and boyars was to become exceptionally violent \u2013 the latter group, who frequently appealed to the Ottoman court in order to have princes comply with its demands, was persecuted by rulers such as [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]] and [[John III the Terrible|John III]]. Ioan Vod\u0103's revolt against the Ottomans ended in his execution (1574). The country descended into political chaos, with frequent Ottoman and [[Tatars|Tatar]] incursions and pillages. The claims of Mu\u0219atins to the crown and the traditional system of succession were ended by scores of illegitimate reigns; one of the usurpers, [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]], was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Greek who encouraged the [[Renaissance]] and attempted to introduce [[Lutheranism]] to Moldavia.\n\nIn 1595, the rise of the [[Movile\u0219ti]] boyars to the throne with [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]] coincided with the start of frequent anti-Ottoman and anti-[[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] military expeditions of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] into Moldavian territory (see ''[[Moldavian Magnate Wars]]''), and rivalries between pretenders to the Moldavian throne encouraged by the three competing powers.\n\nThe Wallachian prince [[Michael the Brave]], after previously taking over [[Transylvania]], also deposed Prince Ieremia Movil\u0103, in 1600, and managed to become the first Prince to rule over Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania;<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379802/Michael Michael the Brave] at [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]</ref><ref name=\"White2000\">{{cite book|author=George W.

Polish incursions were dealt a blow by the Ottomans during the 1620 [[Battle of Cecora (1620)|Battle of Cecora]], which also saw an end to the reign of [[Gaspar Graziani]].\n\nA period of relative peace followed during the more prosperous and prestigious rule of [[Vasile Lupu]]. He took the throne as a boyar appointee in 1637 and began battling his rival [[Gheorghe \u0218tefan]], as well as the Wallachian prince [[Matei Basarab]]. However, his invasion of Wallachia, with the backing of [[Cossack]] [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], ended in disaster at the [[Battle of Finta]] in 1653. A few years later, Moldavia was occupied for two short intervals by the anti-Ottoman Wallachian prince [[Constantin \u0218erban]], who clashed with the first ruler of the [[Ghica family]], [[George Ghica]]. In the early 1680s, Moldavian troops under [[George Ducas]] intervened in [[right-bank Ukraine]] and assisted [[Mehmed IV]] in the [[Battle of Vienna]], only to suffer the effects of the [[Great Turkish War]].\n\n===Phanariots (1711\u20131822)===\n{{Main|Phanariotes|History of the Russo-Turkish wars}}\n[[File:Principati1786.jpg|thumb|The Principalities of Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] in 1782, Italian map by G.

Prince [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] sided with Peter in open rebellion against the Ottomans, but he was defeated at [[St\u0103nile\u0219ti]]. Sultan [[Ahmed III]] officially discarded recognition of local choices for princes, imposing instead a system relying solely on Ottoman approval: the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote epoch]], inaugurated by the reign of [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]].\n\nPhanariote rule was marked by [[political corruption]], intrigue, and high taxation, as well as by sporadic incursions of Habsburg and Russian armies deep into Moldavian territory. Nonetheless, they also attempted legislative and administrative modernization inspired by [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] (such as the decision by [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]] to salarize public offices, to the outrage of boyars, and the abolition of serfdom in 1749, as well as [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]]'s ''Code''), and signified a decrease in Ottoman demands after the threat of Russian annexation became real and the prospects of a better life led to waves of peasant emigration to neighboring lands. The effects of Ottoman control were also made less notable after the 1774 [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Ottoman subjects of the Eastern Orthodox faith - leading to campaigns of petitioning by the Moldavian boyars against princely policies.\n\nIn 1712, [[Khotyn|Hotin]] was taken over by the Ottomans and became part of a defensive system that Moldavian princes were required to maintain, as well as an area for Islamic [[colonization]] (the [[Laz people|Laz]] community).\n\n===Fragmentation===\n{{See also|Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca|Treaty of Bucharest (1812)}}\n[[File:Rom1793-1812.png|thumb|The Principality of Moldavia, 1793\u20131812, highlighted in orange]]\n\nIn 1775 Moldavia lost to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] its northwestern part, which became known as [[Bukovina]]. For Moldavia, it meant both an important territorial loss and a major blow to the cattle trade, as the region stood on the trade route to Central Europe.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Jassy]] in 1792 forced the Ottoman Empire to cede [[Yedisan]] to the Russian Empire, which made Russian presence much more notable, given that the Empire acquired a common border with Moldavia. The first effect of this was the cession of the eastern half of Moldavia (renamed as [[Bessarabia]]) to the Russian Empire in 1812.\n\n===Organic Statute, 1848 revolution===\n{{Main|National awakening of Romania|Regulamentul Organic|Moldavian Revolution of 1848|Wallachian Revolution of 1848}}\n[[File:Statuia lui \u015etefan cel Mare din Ia\u015fi1.jpg|thumb|left|Ia\u0219i, [[Palace of Culture (Ia\u0219i)|Princely Palace]] of Moldavia]]\n\nPhanariote rule was officially ended after the 1821 occupation of the country by [[Alexander Ypsilantis]]'s [[Filiki Eteria]] during the [[Greek War of Independence]]; the subsequent Ottoman retaliation led to the rule of [[Ioan Sturdza]]. He was considered the first of a new system, since the Ottomans and Russia had agreed in 1826 to allow for the election by locals of rulers over the two [[Danubian Principalities]], and convened on their mandating for seven-year terms. In practice, a new foundation to reigns in Moldavia was created by the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)]], beginning a period of Russian domination over the two countries which ended only in 1856. Begun as a military occupation under the command of [[Pavel Kiselyov]], Russian domination gave Wallachia and Moldavia, which were not removed from nominal Ottoman control, the modernizing ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'' (the first document resembling a [[constitution]], as well as the first to regard both principalities). After 1829, the country also became an important destination for [[immigration]] of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] and areas of Russia (''see [[History of the Jews in Romania]] and [[Sudi\u021bi]]'').\n\n[[File:Obeliscul cu lei Iasi 02.JPG|thumb|Ia\u0219i, [[Copou Park|Obelisk of Lions]] (1834), dedicated to the Organic Statute]]\n\nThe first Moldavian rule established under the Statute, that of [[Mihail Sturdza]], was nonetheless ambivalent: eager to reduce abuse of office, Sturdza introduced reforms (the abolition of slavery, [[secularization]], economic rebuilding), but he was widely seen as enforcing his own power over that of the newly instituted consultative Assembly. A supporter of the union of his country with Wallachia and of Romanian [[Romantic nationalism]], he obtained the establishment of a [[customs union]] between the two countries (1847) and showed support for [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] projects favored by low boyars; nevertheless, he clamped down with noted violence the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Moldavian revolutionary attempt]] in the last days of March 1848. [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] allowed the exiled revolutionaries to return to Moldavia c. 1853, which led to the creation of the [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]] ({{lang|ro|Partida Na\u021bional\u0103}}), a trans-boundary group of radical union supporters which campaigned for a single state under a foreign dynasty.\n\n===Southern Bessarabia===\n{{See also|Southern Bessarabia}}\n[[File:Rom1856-1859.png|thumb|Moldavia (in orange) after 1856]]\nIn 1856, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the Russian Empire returned to Moldavia a significant territory in southern [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabia]] (including a part of [[Budjak]]), organised later as the [[Bolgrad]], [[Cahul]], and [[Izmail|Ismail]] counties.<ref name=king23-hitch41>King, p.22-23; Hitchins, p. 41</ref>\n\n===Union with Wallachia===\n\nRussian domination ended abruptly after the [[Crimean War]], when the Treaty of Paris also passed the two Romanian principalities under the tutelage of [[Great power|Great European Powers]] (together with Russia and the Ottoman overlord, power-sharing included the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], and [[Prussia]]). Due to Austrian and Ottoman opposition and British reserves, the union program as demanded by radical campaigners was debated intensely. In September 1857, given that ''[[Kaymakam|Caimacam]]'' [[Nicolae Vogoride]] had perpetrated [[Electoral fraud|fraud]] in elections in Moldavia, the Powers allowed the two states to convene ad-hoc [[divan]]s, which were to decide a new constitutional framework; the result showed overwhelming support for the union, as the creation of a [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] state. After further meetings among leaders of tutor states, an agreement was reached (the ''Paris Convention''), whereby a limited union was to be enforced \u2013 separate governments and thrones, with only two bodies (a [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Court of Cassation]] and a Central Commission residing in [[Foc\u0219ani]]); it also stipulated that an end to all privilege was to be passed into law, and awarded back to Moldavia the areas around [[Bolhrad]], [[Cahul]], and [[Izmail]].\n\nHowever, the Convention failed to note whether the two thrones could not be occupied by the same person, allowing ''Partida Na\u021bional\u0103'' to introduce the candidacy of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] in both countries. On January 17 (January 5, 1859 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]]), in [[Ia\u0219i]], he was elected prince of Moldavia by the respective electoral body. After street pressure over the much more [[Conservatism|conservative]] body in [[Bucharest]], Cuza was elected in Wallachia as well (February 5/January 24). Exactly three years later, after diplomatic missions that helped remove opposition to the action, the formal union created the [[United Principalities]] (the basis of modern Romania) and instituted Cuza as ''[[Domnitor]]'' (all legal matters were clarified after the replacement of the prince with [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] in April 1866, and the creation of an independent [[Kingdom of Romania]] in 1881) - this officially ending the existence of the Principality of Moldavia.\n\n==Society==\n\n===Slavery===\n{{further|Slavery in Romania#Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia}}\nSlavery ({{lang-ro|robie}}) was part of the [[social class|social order]] from before the founding of the Principality of Moldavia, until it was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] (Gypsy) ethnicity. There were also slaves of [[Tatars|Tatar]] ethnicity, probably prisoners captured from the wars with the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai]] and [[Crimean Tatars]]. The institution of slavery was first attested in a 1470 Moldavian document, through which Prince [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] frees Oan\u0103, a Tatar slave who had fled to [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon Poland]].<ref name=Achim>Viorel Achim, ''The Roma in Romanian History'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-9241-84-9}}</ref>\n\nThe exact origins of slavery are not known, as it was a common [[Slavery in medieval Europe|practice in medieval Europe]]. As in the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Roma were held as slaves of the state, of the [[boyars]] or of the monasteries. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era; he believed that the Romanians took the Roma as slaves from the [[Mongols]] and preserved their status to control their labor. Other historians consider that the Roma were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. The ethnic identity of the \"Tatar slaves\" is unknown, they could have been captured Tatars of the [[Golden Horde]], [[Cuman people|Cumans]], or the slaves of Tatars and Cumans.<ref name=Achim/> While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, most of them came from south of the [[Danube]], demonstrating that slavery a widespread practice.

The two other categories comprised ''\u021bigani m\u0103n\u0103stire\u0219ti'' (\"Gypsies belonging to the monasteries\"), who were the property of [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monasteries, and ''\u021bigani boiere\u0219ti'' (\"Gypsies belonging to the boyars\"), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.<ref name=Djuvara>[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''\u00centre Orient \u0219i Occident. \u021a\u0103rile rom\u00e2ne la \u00eenceputul epocii moderne'', Humanitas, Bucharest, 1995. {{ISBN|973-28-0523-4}} {{in lang|ro}}</ref><ref name=Guy>Will Guy, ''Between Past and Future: The Roma of Central and Eastern Europe'', University of Hertfordshire Press, Hatfield, 2001. {{ISBN|1-902806-07-7}}</ref>\n\nThe abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In 1844, Moldavian Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]] proposed a law on the freeing of slaves owned by the church and state. By the 1850s, the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society. In December 1855, following a proposal by Prince [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]], a bill drafted by [[Mihail Kog\u0103lniceanu]] and [[Petre Mavrogheni]] was adopted by the Divan; the law emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).<ref name=Achim/><ref name=Djuvara/>\n\nSupport for the abolitionists was reflected in [[Romanian literature]] of the mid-19th century. The issue of the Roma slavery became a theme in the literary works of various [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] intellectuals, many of whom were active in the abolitionist camp. The Romanian abolitionist movement was also influenced by the much larger movement against [[Slavery in the United States|Black slavery]] in the United States through press reports and through a translation of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. Translated by Theodor Codrescu and first published in [[Ia\u0219i]] in 1853, under the name ''Coliba lui Mo\u0219u Toma sau Via\u021ba negrilor \u00een sudul Statelor Unite din America'' (which translates back as \"Uncle Toma's Cabin or the Life of Blacks in the Southern United States of America\"), it was the first American novel to be published in Romanian.

In times of crises, The Small Host (''Oastea Mic\u0103'') \u2014 which consisted of around 10,000 to 12,000 men \u2014 stood ready to engage the enemy, while the Large Host (''Oastea Mare'') \u2014 which could reach up to 40,000 \u2014 had all the free peasantry older than 14, and strong enough to carry a [[sword]] or use the [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], recruited. This seldom happened, for such a [[lev\u00e9e en masse]] was devastating for both economy and population growth. In the [[Battle of Vaslui]], Stephen had to summon the Large Host and also recruited [[mercenary]] troops.\n\n[[File:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|thumb|Battle flag of Stephen the Great]]\nIn the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], the Moldavians relied on light [[cavalry]] (''[[C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i (cavalry)|c\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i]]'') which used [[hit-and-run tactics]] similar to those of the [[Tatars]]; this gave them great mobility and also flexibility, in case they found it more suitable to dismount their horses and fight in hand-to-hand combat, as it happened in 1422, when 400 [[horse archer]]s were sent to aid [[History of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Jagiellon Poland]], Moldavia's overlord against the [[Teutonic Knights]]. When making eye-contact with the enemy, the horse archers would withdraw to a nearby forest and [[camouflage]] themselves with leaves and branches; according to Jan D\u0142ugosz, when the enemy entered the wood, they were \"showered with arrows\" and defeated.<ref>D\u0142ugosz, p. 438</ref>  The heavy cavalry consisted of the nobility, namely, the boyars and their guards, the ''viteji'' (lit. \"brave ones\", small nobility) and the ''curteni'' \u2014 the Court Cavalry (all nominally part of the ''Small Host''). In times of war, boyars were compelled by the [[Feudalism|feudal system of allegiance]] to supply the prince with troops in accordance with the extent of their [[Manorialism|manorial domain]].\n\nOther troops consisted of professional foot soldiers (''lefegii'') which fulfilled the [[Heavy infantry#Middle Ages|heavy infantry]] role, and the ''pl\u0103ie\u0219i'', free peasants whose role was that of border guards: they guarded the mountain passes and were prepared to [[ambush]] the enemy and to fight delaying actions.\n\nIn the absence of the prince, command was assigned to the ''Mare Sp\u0103tar'' (Grand Sword-Bearer - a military office) or to the ''Mare Vornic'' (approx. Governor of the Country; a civilian office second only to the ''[[Voievod#Moldavia and Wallachia|Voievod]]'', which was filled by the prince himself). Supplying the troops was by tradition-later-made-into-law the duty of the inhabitants of those lands on which the soldiers were present at a given time.\n\nThe Moldavians' (as well as Wallachians') favourite military doctrine in (defensive) wars was a [[scorched earth]] policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using [[hit-and-run tactics]] and disruption of communication and supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured in a place where it would find itself in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains of what was once the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed all the way to the border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the [[Battle of Vaslui]].\n\nTowards the end of the 15th century, especially after the success of [[gun]]s and [[cannon]]s, mercenaries became a dominant force in the country's military. With the economic demands created by the [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire]], the force diminished and included only mercenaries such as the ''[[seimeni]]''.\n\nThe 1829 [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] allowed Moldavia to again maintain its own troops, no longer acting as an auxiliary under strict Ottoman supervision, and assigned red over blue [[Flag terminology|pennants]] (''see [[Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia]]''). Their renewed existence under [[Mihail Sturdza]] was a major symbol and rally point for the [[Romantic nationalism|nationalist]] cause, aiding in bringing about the [[1848 Moldavian revolution]].\n\n===Fleet===\n\nAn early mention of a Moldavian [[naval fleet]] is found in connection with the rule of [[Aron Tiranul]], who used it to help [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian ruler]] [[Michael the Brave]] establish his control over the [[Chilia branch]] of the [[Danube]] and [[Dobruja]].\n\nThe Treaty of Adrianople provided for a Moldavian self-defense naval force, to be composed of [[caicque]] vessels. [[Schooner]]s armed with [[cannon]]s were first built in the 1840s. Along with patrolling the Danube, these made their way on its tributaries, the [[Siret River|Siret]] and the [[Prut River]].\n\n===Flags and historical coats of arms===\n{{Further|Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia}}\n<gallery>\nFile:MoldavianOldCoatWijsbergen.jpg|Coat of arms of Moldavia under Prince Stephen III the Great\nFile:Coa Romania Country History \u0218tefan cel Mare (1457-1504) v2.svg|Coat of arms of Stephen III of Moldavia\nFile:Historical Baia Suceava CoA 14th century.png|14th century coat of arms of Baia, the first capital of Moldavia\nFile:Biserica Sf\u00e2ntul Dumitru din Suceava13.jpg|Coat of arms of the Principality of Moldavia depicted on the walls of St. Demetrius Church in Suceava\nFile:Moldova herb.jpg|Coat of arms of the principality of Moldavia, at the [[Cet\u0103\u021buia Monastery]] in Ia\u0219i\nFile:Slatina Lapusneanu.jpg|16th century coat of arms of Moldavia during [[Alexandru L\u0103pu\u0219neanu]]'s reign, on one of the walls from Slatina Monastery\nFile:Stema Mihai Viteazul.jpg|Seal of [[Michael the Brave]] (showing the arms of [[Wallachia]], Moldavia, and [[Transylvania]])\nFile:Coa Dimitrie Cantemir 1734.jpg|Coat of arms of [[Dimitrie Cantemir]]\nFile:Wappen Herzogtum Bukowina.png|Historical coat of arms of the [[Duchy of Bukovina]]\nFile:Palace of Justice, Vienna - Aula, Coat of Arms - Herzogtum Bukowina 4216.jpg|Coat of arms of the Duchy of Bukovina on display at the [[Palace of Justice (Vienna)|Palace of Justice]] in Vienna, Austria\nFile:Coat of arms of Ioan Radu Cantacuzino, 1744.jpg|[[Cantacuzino family]] coat of arms\nFile:Moruzi family coat of arms.svg|[[Moruzi family]] coat of arms\nFile:Sturdza family coat of arms (Eugene Rizo Rangab\u00e9 version).svg|[[Sturdza family]] coat of arms\nFile:Stema Moldovei.png|Coat of Arms of the Principality of Moldavia (19th century depiction)\nFile:Stema Bucovinei.png|Coat of arms of Bukovina\nFile:Stema Basarabiei.png|Coat of arms of the Bessarabia\nFile:Flag of the Moldavian Democratic Republic.svg|Flag of the [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] (1917\u201318)\nFile:Etendard d'Etienne le Grand - 28 juillet 1917, \u00e0 la Sorbonne (Agence Rol).jpg|Medieval flag of Moldavia held by two Romanian soldiers at [[Sorbonne]], Paris, France\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\n{{See also|Moldavian Plateau}}\n[[File:PhysicalAncientMoldavia.jpg|thumb|Physical map of Moldavia]]\nGeographically, Moldavia is limited by the [[Carpathian Mountains]] to the West, the [[Cheremosh River]] to the North, the [[Dniester River]] to the East and the [[Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the South.
