It is stated that his origin was [[Albanians|Albanian]]. He grew up in the inner ''mehter'' of Kara Ibrahim Pasha. When Kara Ibrahim Pasha was the [[Grand Vizier]] in 1684, he was a member of the [[Imperial Council (Ottoman Empire)|Imperial Council]]. He was then appointed as ''[[djebedji]]'' and in 1691 became [[Agha of the Janissaries]]. \n\nHe was promoted to [[Vizier]] and appointed to the Babada\u011f guard. He was appointed to the governorship of the [[Anatolia Eyalet]] in 1695, and in 1696 to the [[Diyarbak\u0131r Eyalet]]. During his campaign in [[Austria]], he was dismissed from his [[Vizier]] position in Sofia because complains about his atrocities and exiled to [[Po\u010ditelj]], [[Bosnia]]. Upon the increase of the enemy attack on [[Bosnia]], in 1697, his [[Vizier]] status was returned and he was appointed to the [[Serasker]] of the Bosnian Front. He repelled the enemy by succeeding in [[Bosnia]]. In 1698, he was appointed to the governorship of [[Raqqa]]. In 1699, he was assigned to the [[Baghdad]] Governorate. He took back [[Basra]] and [[Kurna]] from the rebel forces and eliminated them. Upon these achievements, he was brought back to the Anatolian Governorship.\n\nOn 4 September 1702, he replaced [[Amcazade K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc H\u00fcseyin Pasha]], who left his job due to his illness. Daltaban Mustafa Pasha was appointed as the [[Grand Vizier]] with the advice of [[Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m]] Feyzullah Efendi who was [[Sultan Mustafa II]]'s tutor.\n\nDaltaban Mustafa Pasha had understood that he should fulfill the demands of Feyzullah Efendi in order to continue this task. [[Sultan Mustafa II]] already refused to accept his presenting [[Grand Vizier]] and divan calls and irregularities without being interviewed by the [[Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m]]. He wanted each of the policies of the state and the government to implement Feyzullah Efendi's opinions and ideas for each activity he would demonstrate.\n\nAlthough Daltaban Mustafa Pasha is determined to go on Feyzullah Efendi's path, as he is determined to go; he was not liked by the state officials because he was a countryman and did not understand the movements and behaviors of the Istanbulites and was rough and harsh. Even the Sultan had begun to be uneasy with this rude, harsh attitude. For example, when Fethullah, the son of Feyzullah Efendi, came to the Pasha Gate, which was the workplace of the Grand Vizier, they would have taken him in front of the door; When Feyzullah came to the front of the car in front of the door to the passenger, car began to go up. Until then, according to the committees of service, [[Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m]] would go on the left side of the [[Grand Vizier]] to show that he was at a lower rank; but Daltaban Mustafa Pasha began to go on the left side of Feyzullah Efendi and concluded that the [[Grand Vizier]] was at a lower rank.\n\nOn the other hand, [[Reis \u00fcl-K\u00fcttab]] [[Rami Mehmet Pasha]], who wished to be the [[Grand Vizier]], had been working against Grand Vizier. He spread a rumor that the [[Grand Vizier]] wanted to work independently from [[Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m]] and that he was trying to get support from the [[Janissaries]] and the [[Crimeans]]. Feyzullah Efendi, a control fetish, was adversely affected. With the signing of [[Treaty of Karlowitz]]; The [[Crimeans]] were forbidden to carry out the plundering strikes in [[Russia]] and the [[Russians]] were also prohibited from establishing fortifications in these borders. The [[Crimeans]] were observing that the [[Russians]] built fortifications; they had sent the news to [[Istanbul]], but the [[Ottoman state]] decided not to do anything about this treaty violation. The [[Crimeans]], in turn, wanted to attack the [[Russia]]n border regions. The previous [[Grand Vizier]] had not accepted this, but Daltaban Mustafa Pasha was more open to the demands of the [[Crimeans]].  And he was more tolerant to the rebellious attitude of [[Crimean Khanate|The Khan of Crimea]] [[Devlet II Giray]]. For this reason, he was acting slow in executing of Sultan's orders through Feyzullah Efendi to suppress the rebellion of [[Devlet II Giray]]. This behavior was considered an example of the independent movement of Daltaban Mustafa Pasha for Rami Mehmet Pasha and Feyzullah Efendi. Feyzullah Efendi, convinced the Sultan about the dismissal of Daltaban Mustafa Pasha.\n\nDaltaban Mustafa Pasha was dismissed from his post on 24 January 1703 for the crime of provoking the Crimean Khan against the Sultan. He was killed three days later.\n\n== Evaluation ==\nDaltaban Mustafa Pasha had been successful when he was a governor and a military officer. His execution, negatively affected the military class, in particular the [[kap\u0131kulu]] soldiers.\n\nDaltaban Mustafa Pasha's accent was inaccurate and he had special expressions in the language he used.

It is stated that his origin was [[Albanian]]. He grew up in the inner ''mehter'' of Kara Ibrahim Pasha. When Kara Ibrahim Pasha was the [[Grand Vizier]] in 1684, he was a member of the [[Imperial Council (Ottoman Empire)|Imperial Council]]. He was then appointed as ''[[djebedji]]'' and in 1691 became [[Agha of the Janissaries]]. \n\nHe was promoted to [[Vizier]] and appointed to the Babada\u011f guard. He was appointed to the governorship of the [[Anatolia Eyalet]] in 1695, and in 1696 to the [[Diyarbak\u0131r Eyalet]]. During his campaign in [[Austria]], he was dismissed from his [[Vizier]] position in Sofia because complains about his atrocities and exiled to [[Po\u010ditelj]], [[Bosnia]]. Upon the increase of the enemy attack on [[Bosnia]], in 1697, his [[Vizier]] status was returned and he was appointed to the [[Serasker]] of the Bosnian Front. He repelled the enemy by succeeding in [[Bosnia]]. In 1698, he was appointed to the governorship of [[Raqqa]]. In 1699, he was assigned to the [[Baghdad]] Governorate. He took back [[Basra]] and [[Kurna]] from the rebel forces and eliminated them. Upon these achievements, he was brought back to the Anatolian Governorship.\n\nOn 4 September 1702, he replaced [[Amcazade K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc H\u00fcseyin Pasha]], who left his job due to his illness. Daltaban Mustafa Pasha was appointed as the [[Grand Vizier]] with the advice of [[Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m]] Feyzullah Efendi who was [[Sultan Mustafa II]]'s tutor.\n\nDaltaban Mustafa Pasha had understood that he should fulfill the demands of Feyzullah Efendi in order to continue this task. [[Sultan Mustafa II]] already refused to accept his presenting [[Grand Vizier]] and divan calls and irregularities without being interviewed by the [[Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m]]. He wanted each of the policies of the state and the government to implement Feyzullah Efendi's opinions and ideas for each activity he would demonstrate.\n\nAlthough Daltaban Mustafa Pasha is determined to go on Feyzullah Efendi's path, as he is determined to go; he was not liked by the state officials because he was a countryman and did not understand the movements and behaviors of the Istanbulites and was rough and harsh. Even the Sultan had begun to be uneasy with this rude, harsh attitude. For example, when Fethullah, the son of Feyzullah Efendi, came to the Pasha Gate, which was the workplace of the Grand Vizier, they would have taken him in front of the door; When Feyzullah came to the front of the car in front of the door to the passenger, car began to go up. Until then, according to the committees of service, [[Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m]] would go on the left side of the [[Grand Vizier]] to show that he was at a lower rank; but Daltaban Mustafa Pasha began to go on the left side of Feyzullah Efendi and concluded that the [[Grand Vizier]] was at a lower rank.\n\nOn the other hand, [[Reis \u00fcl-K\u00fcttab]] [[Rami Mehmet Pasha]], who wished to be the [[Grand Vizier]], had been working against Grand Vizier. He spread a rumor that the [[Grand Vizier]] wanted to work independently from [[Shaykh al-Isl\u0101m]] and that he was trying to get support from the [[Janissaries]] and the [[Crimeans]]. Feyzullah Efendi, a control fetish, was adversely affected. With the signing of [[Treaty of Karlowitz]]; The [[Crimeans]] were forbidden to carry out the plundering strikes in [[Russia]] and the [[Russians]] were also prohibited from establishing fortifications in these borders. The [[Crimeans]] were observing that the [[Russians]] built fortifications; they had sent the news to [[Istanbul]], but the [[Ottoman state]] decided not to do anything about this treaty violation. The [[Crimeans]], in turn, wanted to attack the [[Russia]]n border regions. The previous [[Grand Vizier]] had not accepted this, but Daltaban Mustafa Pasha was more open to the demands of the [[Crimeans]].  And he was more tolerant to the rebellious attitude of [[Crimean Khanate|The Khan of Crimea]] [[Devlet II Giray]]. For this reason, he was acting slow in executing of Sultan's orders through Feyzullah Efendi to suppress the rebellion of [[Devlet II Giray]]. This behavior was considered an example of the independent movement of Daltaban Mustafa Pasha for Rami Mehmet Pasha and Feyzullah Efendi. Feyzullah Efendi, convinced the Sultan about the dismissal of Daltaban Mustafa Pasha.\n\nDaltaban Mustafa Pasha was dismissed from his post on 24 January 1703 for the crime of provoking the Crimean Khan against the Sultan. He was killed three days later.\n\n== Evaluation ==\nDaltaban Mustafa Pasha had been successful when he was a governor and a military officer. His execution, negatively affected the military class, in particular the [[kap\u0131kulu]] soldiers.\n\nDaltaban Mustafa Pasha's accent was inaccurate and he had special expressions in the language he used. Rami Mehmet Pasha ridiculed it by creating a dictionary and it is reported to have called \"Islahhat-\u0131 Daltaniye\". His mouth was broken and his language used was also toxic, rude and harsh. His treatment of others was often violent and heartbreaking.\n\nDaltaban Mustafa Pasha started to implement new rules for the clothes worn by the viziers during the days of the divan. In order to show that the viziers were separate from the other state office on the divan, a rule was put on them to wear a turban called \"kallavi\" instead of another style of turban, called \"m\u00fccevveze\" which they had traditionally worn for hundreds of years.\n\n\"Zubdet Country Vekay\u0131\" is generally 500 pouches per year for the special administration, pen and secretariat of the Grand Vizier; While Daltaban Mustafa Pasha was the Grand Vizier, he stated that the will he gathered for other bureaucratic treatments in re-assignment, re-assignment, and job change had reached 1,200 bags per year.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers]]\n\n==References==\n* Uzun\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131l\u0131, \u0130smail Hakk\u0131 (1956), ''Osmanl\u0131 Tarihi IV.

In accordance with the customs of the Lyman Family, Turner was not raised by her mother, but she and her younger sister were eventually ejected from the Family after their mother chose to leave.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peleg |first1=Oren |title=How to Understand Charles Manson: Hire a Screenwriter Who Grew Up in a Cult |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/05/charles-manson-charlie-says-cult-movie-mary-harron-guinevere-turner |accessdate=9 May 2019}}</ref> Turner considered rejoining the group when she was 18, but eventually chose to attend college instead in part because of the deeply misogynistic and sexist attitudes of the group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Turner |first1=Guinevere |title=My Childhood in a Cult |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/my-childhood-in-a-cult |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nTurner and ''[[I Shot Andy Warhol]]'' director [[Mary Harron]] wrote a screenplay, which ended up being selected for the [[American Psycho (film)|film version]] of [[Bret Easton Ellis]]' ''[[American Psycho]]''. She has a brief [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in the film, in which she delivers the in-joke, \"I'm not a [[lesbian]]!\". There is also a line about attending [[Sarah Lawrence College]], Turner's real-life [[alma mater]].\n\nTurner emerged on the scene with the film ''[[Go Fish (film)|Go Fish]]'', which she co-wrote and co-produced with her then-girlfriend, [[Rose Troche]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Janet|last=Maslin|authorlink=Janet Maslin|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A03E1DA133AF933A25755C0A962958260|title=Review/Film; Girl Meets Girl, Laughter Included|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York Times Company|date=June 10, 1994|accessdate=August 21, 2018}}</ref> Turner also starred in the film, portraying a young woman named Max whose friends help her find a new girlfriend, Ely, portrayed by VS Brodie. Director [[Kevin Smith]] was a fan of the movie, particularly a scene in it wherein, in an imagined sequence, some of a character's friends chastise her for \"selling out\" and sleeping with a man, and used it as an inspiration for his own take on a similar theme in his own film ''[[Chasing Amy]]''. Turner has cameos in both ''Chasing Amy'' and Smith's later film ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. Smith also named [[Joey Lauren Adams]]' character in Smith's ''[[Mallrats]]'' after Turner.\n\nA writer and story editor for the first two seasons of ''[[The L Word]]'', Turner also made several guest appearances on the show as [[Alice Pieszecki]]'s screenwriter ex-girlfriend, [[Lesbian X|Gabby]].\n\nIn 2005, Turner wrote the script for ''[[BloodRayne (film)|BloodRayne]]''. It was nominated for a [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for [[27th Golden Raspberry Awards|Worst Screenplay]] in 2006. In the documentary ''Tales from the Script'', she stated in an interview that director [[Uwe Boll]] only used about 25% of her screenplay.<ref>{{cite

While Lala Mustafa commanded the eventual capture of the island from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], Ali Pasha took the bulk of his fleet to [[Crete]] and then to [[Morea]], thereby effectively preventing any Christian relief fleet from coming to the aid of the besieged defenders of Cyprus.\n\n==Battle of Lepanto and death==\n[[File:Ali Pasha.jpg|thumb|A print from a 1571 anonymous German [[broadsheet]] after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] of the same year, where Ali Pasha was wounded and killed in action by being shot in the head and beheaded.

Selim had entrusted him with one of the most precious possessions of the Ottoman Sultans, the great \"Banner of the Caliphs\", a huge green banner heavily embroidered with texts from the [[Qur'an]] and with the name of Allah emblazoned upon it 28,900 times in golden letters. It was intended to provide an incentive for him and his men to do their best in battle.\n\nAli Pasha was more of a land soldier than a naval tactician, and his failure to keep his lines together and keep his individual squadrons from charging like cavalry units in a land battle allowed the Christian forces to penetrate his battle line in various places and to surround and defeat the isolated ships.  He was also somewhat of a firebrand and almost immediately sought the direct confrontation with his opposite number.  His flagship, the galley ''Sultana'', battled head-to-head with [[John of Austria|Don Juan]]'s flagship [[Real (galley)|''La Real'']], was boarded and, after about one hour of bloody fighting, with reinforcements being provided to both sides by other galleys in their respective fleets, was captured. In the ensuing battle, Ali Pasha was slain and his head was then displayed upon a pike.  This, and the capture of the Banner of the Caliphs by ''La Real'', led to a collapse in Turkish morale, greatly contributing to their rout in the battle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Ottoman governors of Egypt]]\n* [[List of Kapudan Pashas]]\n\n==Literature==\n*Currey, E.

While Lala Mustafa commanded the eventual capture of the island from [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], Ali Pasha took the bulk of his fleet to [[Crete]] and then to [[Morea]], thereby effectively preventing any Christian relief fleet from coming to the aid of the besieged defenders of Cyprus.\n\n==Battle of Lepanto and death==\n[[File:Ali Pasha.jpg|thumb|A print from a 1571 anonymous German [[broadsheet]] after the [[Battle of Lepanto]] of the same year, where Ali Pasha was wounded and killed in action by being shot in the head and beheaded. The print ostensibly shows his \"true likeness\" in the foreground, while his head is displayed on a pike on an Ottoman battleship in the background.]]\n{{Disputed section|date=December 2015}}\nAli Pasha was commander-in-chief of the Ottoman naval forces at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] on 7 October 1571. Selim had entrusted him with one of the most precious possessions of the Ottoman Sultans, the great \"Banner of the Caliphs\", a huge green banner heavily embroidered with texts from the [[Qur'an]] and with the name of Allah emblazoned upon it 28,900 times in golden letters. It was intended to provide an incentive for him and his men to do their best in battle.\n\nAli Pasha was more of a land soldier than a naval tactician, and his failure to keep his lines together and keep his individual squadrons from charging like cavalry units in a land battle allowed the Christian forces to penetrate his battle line in various places and to surround and defeat the isolated ships.  He was also somewhat of a firebrand and almost immediately sought the direct confrontation with his opposite number.  His flagship, the galley ''Sultana'', battled head-to-head with [[John of Austria|Don Juan]]'s flagship [[Real (galley)|''La Real'']], was boarded and, after about one hour of bloody fighting, with reinforcements being provided to both sides by other galleys in their respective fleets, was captured. In the ensuing battle, Ali Pasha was slain and his head was then displayed upon a pike.  This, and the capture of the Banner of the Caliphs by ''La Real'', led to a collapse in Turkish morale, greatly contributing to their rout in the battle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Ottoman governors of Egypt]]\n* [[List of Kapudan Pashas]]\n\n==Literature==\n*Currey, E.

Some believe that Timur suffered his crippling injuries while serving as a mercenary to the khan of [[Sistan]] in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] in what is today the [[Dashti Margo]] in southwest [[Afghanistan]]. Timur's injuries have given him the names of Timur the Lame and Tamerlane by Europeans.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|31}}\n\n== Military leader ==\nAbout 1360, Timur gained prominence as a military leader whose troops were mostly Turkic tribesmen of the region.<ref name=\"Chaliand\" /> He took part in campaigns in Transoxiana with the Khan of the Chagatai Khanate.

This was the second military expedition that he led, and its success led to further operations, among them the subjugation of [[Khwarezm]] and [[Urgench]].\n\nFollowing Qazaghan's murder, disputes arose among the many claimants to [[sovereign]] power. [[Tughlugh Timur]] of [[Kashgar]], the Khan of the Eastern Chagatai Khanate, another descendant of Genghis Khan, invaded, interrupting this infighting. Timur was sent to negotiate with the invader but joined with him instead and was rewarded with Transoxania. At about this time, his father died and Timur also became chief of the Berlas. Tughlugh then attempted to set his son [[Ilyas Khoja]] over Transoxania, but Timur repelled this invasion with a smaller force.<ref name=hannah />\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Timur during attack on Balkh 1370.jpg|thumb|Timur commanding the [[Siege of Balkh (1370)|Siege of Balkh]]]]\n\nIt was in this period that Timur reduced the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai khans]] to the position of [[figurehead]]s while he ruled in their name. Also during this period, Timur and his brother-in-law Amir Husayn, who were at first fellow fugitives and wanderers in joint adventures, became rivals and antagonists. The relationship between them began to become strained after Husayn abandoned efforts to carry out Timur's orders to finish off Ilya Khoja (former governor of Mawarannah) close to Tishnet.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|40}}\n\nTimur began to gain a following of people in Balkh, consisting of merchants, fellow tribesmen, Muslim clergy, aristocracy and agricultural workers, because of his kindness in sharing his belongings with them. This contrasted Timur's behavior with that of Husayn, who alienated these people, took many possessions from them via his heavy tax laws and selfishly spent the tax money building elaborate structures.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|41\u20132}} Around 1370, Husayn surrendered to Timur and was later assassinated, which allowed Timur to be formally proclaimed sovereign at [[Balkh]]. He married Husayn's wife [[Saray Mulk Khanum]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, allowing him to become imperial ruler of the Chaghatay tribe.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />\n\n== Legitimization of Timur's rule ==\n[[File:TimuridEmpire1400.png|thumb|300px|The extent of the [[Timurid Empire]]]]\n\nTimur's Turco-Mongolian heritage provided opportunities and challenges as he sought to rule the Mongol Empire and the Muslim world. According to the Mongol traditions, Timur could not claim the title of ''khan'' or rule the Mongol Empire because he was not a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]]. Therefore, Timur set up a puppet [[Chagatai Khan|Chaghatay Khan]], [[Suurgatmish|Suyurghatmish]], as the nominal ruler of Balkh as he pretended to act as a \"protector of the member of a Chinggisid line, that of Genghis Khan's eldest son, [[Jochi]]\".<ref name=\"manz-2002-3\">{{cite journal|last=Manz|first=Beatrice Forbes|title=Tamerlane's Career and Its Uses|journal=Journal of World History|year=2002|volume=13|page=3|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0017}}</ref> Timur instead used the title of [[Amir]] meaning general, and acting in the name of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] ruler of Transoxania.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|106}} To reinforce this position, Timur claimed the title Guregen (royal son-in-law) when he married [[Saray Mulk Khanum]], a princess of Chinggisid descent.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|14}}\n\nAs with the title of Khan, Timur similarly could not claim the supreme title of the Islamic world, [[Caliph]], because the \"office was limited to the [[Quraysh]], the tribe of the [[Prophet Muhammad]]\". Therefore, Timur reacted to the challenge by creating a myth and image of himself as a \"supernatural personal power\" ordained by God.<ref name=\"manz-2002-3\" /> Otherwise he was described as a spiritual descendant of Ali, thus taken lineage of both to Genghis Khan and the Quraysh.<ref>Denise Aigle ''The Mongol Empire between Myth and Reality: Studies in Anthropological History'' BRILL, 28 October 2014 p. 132</ref>\n\n== Period of expansion ==\nTimur spent the next 35 years in various [[List of wars|wars]] and expeditions. He not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him to the lands near the [[Caspian Sea]] and to the banks of the [[Ural River|Ural]] and the [[Volga]]. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in [[Persia]], including [[Baghdad]], [[Karbala]] and Northern Iraq.\n\nOne of the most formidable of Timur's opponents was another Mongol ruler, a descendant of Genghis Khan named [[Tokhtamysh]]. After having been a refugee in Timur's court, Tokhtamysh became ruler both of the eastern [[White Horde|Kipchak]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. After his accession, he quarreled with Timur over the possession of [[Khiva|Khwarizm]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. However, Timur still supported him against the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russians]] and in 1382 Tokhtamysh invaded the Muscovite dominion and [[Siege of Moscow (1382)|burned Moscow]].<ref>Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 93</ref>\n\n[[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition states that later, in 1395 Timur, having reached the frontier of [[Principality of Ryazan]], had taken [[Elets]] and started advancing towards Moscow. Great Prince [[Vasily I of Moscow]] went with an army to [[Kolomna]] and halted at the banks of the [[Oka River]]. The clergy brought the famed [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] icon from [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] to Moscow. Along the way people prayed kneeling: \u201cO Mother of God, save the land of Russia!\u201d Suddenly, Timur's armies retreated. In memory of this miraculous deliverance of the Russian land from Timur on 26 August, the all-Russian celebration in honor of the Meeting of the Vladimir Icon of the Most Holy Mother of God was established.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oca.org/saints/lives/2016/08/26/102402-commemoration-of-the-vladimir-icon-of-the-mother-of-god-and-the|title=Commemoration of the Vladimir Icon of the Mother of God and the deliverance of Moscow from the Invasion of Tamerlane|website=oca.org|accessdate=5 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Conquest of Persia ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Tamerlane Besieging Urganj.JPG|thumb|Timur besieges the historic city of [[Urganj]].]]\n[[File:Timur orders campaign against Georgia.jpg|thumb|Timur orders [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|campaign]] against [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]\n[[File:Timur's army attacks Nerges, Georgia.jpg|thumb|Emir Timur's army attacks the survivors of the town of Nerges, in Georgia, in the spring of 1396.]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Abu Sa'id (Ilkhanid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]], ruler of the [[Ilkhanate]], in 1335, there was a power vacuum in Persia. In the end, Persia was split amongst the [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]], [[Kartids]], [[Eretnids]], [[Chobanids]], [[Injuids]], [[Jalayirids]], and [[Sarbadars]]. In 1383, Timur started his lengthy military conquest of Persia, though he already ruled over much of Persian [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by 1381, after Khwaja Mas'ud, of the [[Sarbadar]] dynasty surrendered. Timur began his Persian campaign with [[Herat]], capital of the [[Kurt dynasty|Kartid dynasty]]. When Herat did not surrender he reduced the city to rubble and massacred most of its citizens; it remained in ruins until [[Shah Rukh]] ordered its reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=96ec98LieGsC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=siege+of+herat+timur#v=onepage&q=siege%20of%20herat%20timur&f=false|title=Mughal Gardens|work=google.ca|isbn=9780884022350|last1=Wescoat|first1=James L.|last2=Wolschke-Bulmahn|first2=Joachim|year=1996}}</ref> Timur then sent a General to capture rebellious [[Kandahar]]. With the capture of Herat the Kartid kingdom surrendered and became vassals of Timur; it would later be annexed outright less than a decade later in 1389 by Timur's son [[Miran Shah]].\n\nTimur then headed west to capture the [[Zagros Mountains]], passing through [[Mazandaran]]. During his travel through the north of Persia, he captured the then town of [[Tehran]], which surrendered and was thus treated mercifully. He laid siege to [[Soltaniyeh]] in 1384. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] revolted one year later, so Timur destroyed Isfizar, and the prisoners were cemented into the walls alive. The next year the kingdom of Sistan, under the [[Mihrabanids|Mihrabanid dynasty]], was ravaged, and its capital at [[Zaranj]] was destroyed. Timur then returned to his capital of [[Samarkand]], where he began planning for his [[Timur's invasion of Georgia|Georgian campaign]] and [[Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war|Golden Horde]] invasion. In 1386, Timur passed through [[Mazandaran]] as he had when trying to capture the Zagros. He went near the city of [[Soltaniyeh]], which he had previously captured but instead turned north and captured [[Tabriz]] with little resistance, along with [[Maragha]]. He ordered heavy taxation of the people, which was collected by Adil Aqa, who was also given control over Soltaniyeh. Adil was later executed because Timur suspected him of corruption.\n\nTimur then went north to begin his Georgian and Golden Horde campaigns, pausing his full-scale invasion of Persia. When he returned, he found his generals had done well in protecting the cities and lands he had conquered in Persia. Though many rebelled, and his son [[Miran Shah]], who may have been [[regent]], was forced to annex rebellious vassal dynasties, his holdings remained. So he proceeded to capture the rest of Persia, specifically the two major southern cities of [[Isfahan]] and [[Shiraz]]. When he arrived with his army at [[Isfahan]] in 1387, the city [[Siege of Isfahan (1387)|immediately surrendered]]; he treated it with relative mercy as he normally did with cities that surrendered (unlike Herat). However, after Isfahan revolted against Timur's taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur's soldiers, he ordered the massacre of the city's citizens; the death toll is reckoned at between 100,000 and 200,000.<ref name=\"Chaliand 2007 87\">{{cite book|last=Chaliand|first=Gerard|title=The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al Qaeda|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24709-3|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar|url-access=registration|quote=isfahan Timur.|author2=Arnaud Blin |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar/page/87 87]}}</ref> An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers constructed of about 1,500 heads each.<ref>Fisher, W.B.; Jackson, P.; Lockhart, L.; Boyle, J.A. : The Cambridge History of Iran, p55.</ref> This has been described as a \"systematic use of terror against towns...an integral element of Tamerlane's strategic element\", which he viewed as preventing bloodshed by discouraging resistance. His massacres were selective and he spared the artistic and educated.<ref name=\"Chaliand 2007 87\" /> This would later influence the next great Persian conqueror: [[Nader Shah]].\n\nTimur then began a five-year campaign to the west in 1392, attacking [[Iranian Kurdistan|Persian Kurdistan]]. In 1393, Shiraz was captured after surrendering, and the Muzaffarids became vassals of Timur, though prince [[Shah Mansur (Persia)|Shah Mansur]] rebelled but was defeated, and the [[Muzafarids]] were annexed. Shortly after Georgia was devastated so that the Golden Horde could not use it to threaten northern Iran. In the same year, Timur caught Baghdad by surprise in August by marching there in only eight days from Shiraz. Sultan [[Ahmad Jalayir]] fled to Syria, where the Mamluk Sultan [[Barquq]] protected him and killed Timur's envoys. Timur left the [[Sarbadar]] prince Khwaja Mas'ud to govern [[Baghdad]], but he was driven out when [[Ahmad Jalayir]] returned. Ahmad was unpopular but got some dangerous help from [[Qara Yusuf]] of the [[Kara Koyunlu]]; he fled again in 1399, this time to the Ottomans.\n\n=== Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war ===\nIn the meantime, Tokhtamysh, now khan of the [[Golden Horde]], turned against his patron and in 1385 invaded [[Azerbaijan]]. The inevitable response by Timur resulted in the [[Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war]]. In the initial stage of the war, Timur won a victory at the [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]]. After the battle Tokhtamysh and some of his army were allowed to escape. After Tokhtamysh's initial defeat, Timur invaded Muscovy to the north of Tokhtamysh's holdings. Timur's army burned [[Ryazan]] and advanced on Moscow. He was pulled away before reaching the Oka River by Tokhtamysh's renewed campaign in the south.<ref>Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 94</ref>\n\nIn the first phase of the conflict with Tokhtamysh, Timur led an army of over 100,000 men north for more than 700 miles into the steppe. He then rode west about 1,000 miles advancing in a front more than 10 miles wide. During this advance, Timur's army got far enough north to be in a region of [[midnight sun|very long summer days]] causing complaints by his Muslim soldiers about keeping a long schedule of [[salat|prayers]]. It was then that Tokhtamysh's army was boxed in against the east bank of the Volga River in the [[Orenburg]] region and destroyed at the [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]], in 1391.\n\nIn the second phase of the conflict, Timur took a different route against the enemy by invading the realm of Tokhtamysh via the [[Caucasus]] region. In 1395, Timur defeated Tokhtamysh in the [[Battle of the Terek River]], concluding the struggle between the two monarchs. Tokhtamysh was unable to restore his power or prestige, and he was killed about a decade later in the area of present-day [[Tyumen]]. During the course of Timur's campaigns, his army destroyed [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], the capital of the Golden Horde, and [[Astrakhan]], subsequently disrupting the Golden Horde's [[Silk Road]]. The Golden Horde no longer held power after their losses to Timur.\n\n=== Ismailis ===\nIn May 1393, Timur's army invaded the [[Anjudan]], crippling the [[Ismaili]] village only a year after his assault on the Ismailis in [[Mazandaran]]. The village was prepared for the attack, evidenced by its fortress and system of tunnels. Undeterred, Timur's soldiers flooded the tunnels by cutting into a channel overhead. Timur's reasons for attacking this village are not yet well understood. However, it has been suggested that his [[Timur#Personal life|religious persuasions]] and view of himself as an [[Timur#Indian campaign|executor of divine will]] may have contributed to his motivations.<ref name=\"Virani, Shafique N 2007, p. 116\">Virani, Shafique N.

His invasion did not go unopposed and he encountered resistance from the Governor of [[Meerut]] during the march to Delhi. Timur was still able to continue his approach to Delhi, arriving in 1398, to fight the armies of Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, which had already been weakened by a succession struggle within the royal family.\n\n=== Capture of Delhi (1398) ===\n[[File:Delhi after sack of Timur Lang, 1398.jpg|thumb|Delhi after sack of Timur Lang, 1398]]\n\nThe battle took place on 17 December 1398. Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq and the army of Mallu Iqbal<ref>Mallu, who later received the title of Iqbal Khan, was a noble in Siri and an ally of Muqarrab Khan, but later on betrayed him and Nusrat Khan, and allied with Nasir-ud-din Mahmud Shah.

Timur then loaded his camels with as much wood and hay as they could carry. When the war elephants charged, Timur set the hay on fire and prodded the camels with iron sticks, causing them to charge at the elephants howling in pain: Timur had understood that elephants were easily panicked. Faced with the strange spectacle of camels flying straight at them with flames leaping from their backs, the elephants turned around and stampeded back toward their own lines. Timur capitalized on the subsequent disruption in the forces of Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, securing an easy victory. Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq fled with remnants of his forces. Delhi was sacked and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed 100,000 captives.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\nThe capture of the Delhi Sultanate was one of Timur's greatest victories, as at that time, Delhi was one of the richest cities in the world. After Delhi fell to Timur's army, uprisings by its citizens against the Turkic-Mongols began to occur, causing a retaliatory bloody massacre within the city walls. After three days of citizens uprising within Delhi, it was said that the city reeked of the decomposing bodies of its citizens with their heads being erected like structures and the bodies left as food for the birds by Timur's soldiers. Timur's invasion and destruction of Delhi continued the chaos that was still consuming India, and the city would not be able to recover from the great loss it suffered for almost a century.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|269\u2013274}}\n\n== Campaigns in the Levant ==\n[[File:Behzad timur egyptian.jpg|thumb|Timur defeating the [[Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] [[Nasir-ad-Din Faraj]] of [[Egypt]]]]\n[[File:Chlebowski-Bajazyt w niewoli.jpg|thumb|[[Bayezid I]] being held captive by Timur]]\n\nBefore the end of 1399, Timur started a war with [[Bayezid I]], sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and the [[Mamluk]] sultan of Egypt [[Nasir-ad-Din Faraj]].

Timur cited the killing of [[Hasan ibn Ali]] by the Umayyad caliph [[Muawiyah I]] and the killing of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] by [[Yazid I]] as the reason for his massacre of the inhabitants of Damascus.\n\nTimur invaded Baghdad in June 1401. After the capture of the city, 20,000 of its citizens were massacred. Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him. When they ran out of men to kill, many warriors killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign, and when they ran out of prisoners to kill, many resorted to beheading their own wives.<ref>Ibn Arabshah, Timur the Great Amir, p. 168</ref>\n\n== Invasion of Anatolia ==\n\nIn the meantime, years of insulting letters had passed between Timur and Bayezid. Both rulers insulted each other in their own way while Timur preferred to undermine Bayezid's position as a ruler and play down the significance of his military successes. \n\nThis is the excerpt from one of Timur's letters addressed to Ottoman sultan:\n\n\"Believe me, you are but pismire ant: don't seek to fight the elephants for they'll crush you under their feet. Shall a petty prince such as you are contend with us? But your rodomontades (braggadocio) are not extraordinary; for a [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]] never spake with judgement.

Bayezid was captured in battle and subsequently died in captivity, initiating the twelve-year [[Ottoman Interregnum]] period. Timur's stated motivation for attacking Bayezid and the Ottoman Empire was the restoration of [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] authority.

The legend has it that Timur, wounded by an enemy arrow, found shelter at the abandoned ruins of an old fortress in the desert. Lamenting his fate, Timur saw a little ant carrying a grain up the side of a collapsed wall. Thinking that the end was close, Timur directed all his attention to that ant and watched how troubled by the wind or the size of her cargo, the ant fell back down to the ground each time she climbed the wall. Timur counted overall 69 attempts and finally, on the 70th try, the little ant succeeded and made her way into the nest with a precious prize. If an ant can persevere like this, Timur thought, then surely a man can do the same. Inspired by the diligent ant, he decided that he would never again lose hope, and eventually the chain of events, coupled with his persistence and military genius led to him becoming arguably the most powerful monarch of his era.<ref>John C. Johnson, \"Tamerlane and the ant\", Stories, 2011</ref>\n\nThere is a shared view that Timur's real motive for his campaigns was his imperialistic ambition. However, Timur's following words: \"The whole expanse of the inhabited part of the world is not large enough to have two kings\" explains that his true desire was \"to amaze the world\", and through his destructive campaigns, to produce an impression rather than to achieve enduring results. This is supported by the fact that besides Iran, Timur simply plundered the states he invaded with a purpose of enriching his native Samarqand and neglected the conquered areas, which may have resulted in a relatively quick disintegration of his Empire after his death<ref name=\"barthold\">{{cite book |last1=Barthold |first1=V.V. |title=Four studies on the History of Central Asia, vol. 1 |date=1962 |publisher=Leiden, E.J.Brill |pages=59-60 |edition=Second Printing, 1962}}</ref>.   \n\nTimur used Persian expressions in his conversations often, and his motto was the Persian phrase ''r\u0101st\u012b rust\u012b'' ({{lang|fa|\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0631\u0633\u062a\u06cc}}, meaning \"truth is safety\" or ''\"veritas salus\"'').<ref name=Fischel />\n\n== Exchanges with Europe ==\n{{Main|Timurid relations with Europe}}\n[[File:Letter of Tamerlane to Charles VI 1402.jpg|thumb|upright|Letter of Timur to [[Charles VI of France]], 1402, a witness to [[Timurid relations with Europe]].

Relations between the court of [[Henry III of Castile]] and that of Timur played an important part in medieval [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] diplomacy. In 1402, the time of the [[Battle of Ankara]], two Spanish ambassadors were already with Timur: Pelayo de Sotomayor and Fernando de Palazuelos. Later, Timur sent to the court of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n#Le\u00f3n and Castile|Kingdom of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] a Chagatai ambassador named Hajji Muhammad al-Qazi with letters and gifts.\n\nIn return, Henry III of Castile sent a famous embassy to Timur's court in Samarkand in 1403\u201306, led by [[Ruy Gonz\u00e1lez de Clavijo]], with two other ambassadors, Alfonso Paez and Gomez de Salazar. On their return, Timur affirmed that he regarded the king of Castile \"as his very own son\".\n\nAccording to Clavijo, Timur's good treatment of the Spanish delegation contrasted with the disdain shown by his host toward the envoys of the \"lord of [[Cathay]]\" (i.e., the Yongle Emperor), the Chinese ruler. Clavijo's visit to Samarkand allowed him to report to the European audience on the news from [[Cathay]] (China), which few Europeans had been able to visit directly in the century that had passed since the travels of [[Marco Polo]].\n\nThe French archives preserve:\n*A 30 July 1402 letter from Timur to [[Charles VI of France]], suggesting that he send traders to Asia.

In fact, it is difficult to define the sphere of either side of the administration and we find Persians and Chaghatays sharing many tasks. (In discussing the settled bureaucracy and the people who worked within it I use the word Persian in a cultural rather than ethnological sense. In almost all the territories which Tem\u00fcr incorporated into his realm Persian was the primary language of administration and literary culture. Thus the language of the settled 'diwan' was Persian and its scribes had to be thoroughly adept in Persian culture, whatever their ethnic origin.) Tem\u00fcr's Chaghatay emirs were often involved in civil and provincial administration and even in financial affairs, traditionally the province of Persian bureaucracy.\"</ref> In addition, during his reign, some contributions to Turkic literature were penned, with Turkic cultural influence expanding and flourishing as a result. A literary form of [[Chagatai language|Chagatai Turkic]] came into use alongside Persian as both a cultural and an official language.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The new Central Asia |last=Roy |first=Olivier |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=I.

Between 1424 and 1428, [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi]] wrote a second [[Zafarnama (Yazdi biography)|''Zafarnama'']] drawing heavily on Shami's earlier work. [[Ahmad ibn Arabshah]] wrote a much less favorable history in Arabic. Arabshah's history was translated into Latin by the Dutch Orientalist [[Jacobus Golius]] in 1636.\n\nAs Timurid-sponsored histories, the two ''Zafarnama''s present a dramatically different picture from Arabshah's chronicle. [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] remarked that the former presented Timur as a \"liberal, benevolent and illustrious prince\" while the latter painted him as \"deformed and impious, of a low birth and detestable principles\".{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n==== ''Malfuzat-i Timuri'' ====\nThe ''Malfuzat-i Timur\u012b'' and the appended ''Tuz\u016bk-i T\u012bm\u016br\u012b'', supposedly Timur's own autobiography, are almost certainly 17th-century fabrications.<ref name=\"EI\" /><ref name=\"iranica-hosayni\">{{cite encyclopedia | title=Ab\u016b \u1e6c\u0101leb \u1e24osayn\u012b | encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica]] | accessdate=17 September 2014 | author=Hameed ud-Din | year=2011 | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abo-taleb-hosaym-arizi}}</ref> The scholar Abu Taleb Hosayni presented the texts to the Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]], a distant descendant of Timur, in 1637\u201338, supposedly after discovering the [[Chagatai language]] originals in the library of a [[Yemen]]i ruler.

This was the second military expedition that he led, and its success led to further operations, among them the subjugation of [[Khwarezm]] and [[Urgench]].\n\nFollowing Qazaghan's murder, disputes arose among the many claimants to [[sovereign]] power. [[Tughlugh Timur]] of [[Kashgar]], the Khan of the Eastern Chagatai Khanate, another descendant of Genghis Khan, invaded, interrupting this infighting. Timur was sent to negotiate with the invader but joined with him instead and was rewarded with Transoxania. At about this time, his father died and Timur also became chief of the Berlas. Tughlugh then attempted to set his son [[Ilyas Khoja]] over Transoxania, but Timur repelled this invasion with a smaller force.<ref name=hannah />\n\n== Rise to power ==\n[[File:Timur during attack on Balkh 1370.jpg|thumb|Timur commanding the [[Siege of Balkh (1370)|Siege of Balkh]]]]\n\nIt was in this period that Timur reduced the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai khans]] to the position of [[figurehead]]s while he ruled in their name. Also during this period, Timur and his brother-in-law Amir Husayn, who were at first fellow fugitives and wanderers in joint adventures, became rivals and antagonists. The relationship between them began to become strained after Husayn abandoned efforts to carry out Timur's orders to finish off Ilya Khoja (former governor of Mawarannah) close to Tishnet.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|40}}\n\nTimur began to gain a following of people in Balkh, consisting of merchants, fellow tribesmen, Muslim clergy, aristocracy and agricultural workers, because of his kindness in sharing his belongings with them. This contrasted Timur's behavior with that of Husayn, who alienated these people, took many possessions from them via his heavy tax laws and selfishly spent the tax money building elaborate structures.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|41\u20132}} Around 1370, Husayn surrendered to Timur and was later assassinated, which allowed Timur to be formally proclaimed sovereign at [[Balkh]]. He married Husayn's wife [[Saray Mulk Khanum]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, allowing him to become imperial ruler of the Chaghatay tribe.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />\n\n== Legitimization of Timur's rule ==\n[[File:Emp\u00e8ri Timurida.png|thumb|300px|The extent of the [[Timurid Empire]] and Timur's conquests]]\n\nTimur's Turco-Mongolian heritage provided opportunities and challenges as he sought to rule the Mongol Empire and the Muslim world. According to the Mongol traditions, Timur could not claim the title of ''khan'' or rule the Mongol Empire because he was not a descendant of [[Genghis Khan]]. Therefore, Timur set up a puppet [[Chagatai Khan|Chaghatay Khan]], [[Suurgatmish|Suyurghatmish]], as the nominal ruler of Balkh as he pretended to act as a \"protector of the member of a Chinggisid line, that of Genghis Khan's eldest son, [[Jochi]]\".<ref name=\"manz-2002-3\">{{cite journal|last=Manz|first=Beatrice Forbes|title=Tamerlane's Career and Its Uses|journal=Journal of World History|year=2002|volume=13|page=3|doi=10.1353/jwh.2002.0017}}</ref> Timur instead used the title of [[Amir]] meaning general, and acting in the name of the [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] ruler of Transoxania.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|106}} To reinforce this position, Timur claimed the title Guregen (royal son-in-law) when he married [[Saray Mulk Khanum]], a princess of Chinggisid descent.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|14}}\n\nAs with the title of Khan, Timur similarly could not claim the supreme title of the Islamic world, [[Caliph]], because the \"office was limited to the [[Quraysh]], the tribe of the [[Prophet Muhammad]]\". Therefore, Timur reacted to the challenge by creating a myth and image of himself as a \"supernatural personal power\" ordained by God.<ref name=\"manz-2002-3\" /> Otherwise he was described as a spiritual descendant of Ali, thus taken lineage of both to Genghis Khan and the Quraysh.<ref>Denise Aigle ''The Mongol Empire between Myth and Reality: Studies in Anthropological History'' BRILL, 28 October 2014 p. 132</ref>\n\n== Period of expansion ==\nTimur spent the next 35 years in various [[List of wars|wars]] and expeditions. He not only consolidated his rule at home by the subjugation of his foes, but sought extension of territory by encroachments upon the lands of foreign potentates. His conquests to the west and northwest led him to the lands near the [[Caspian Sea]] and to the banks of the [[Ural River|Ural]] and the [[Volga]]. Conquests in the south and south-West encompassed almost every province in [[Persia]], including [[Baghdad]], [[Karbala]] and Northern Iraq.\n\nOne of the most formidable of Timur's opponents was another Mongol ruler, a descendant of Genghis Khan named [[Tokhtamysh]]. After having been a refugee in Timur's court, Tokhtamysh became ruler both of the eastern [[White Horde|Kipchak]] and the [[Golden Horde]]. After his accession, he quarreled with Timur over the possession of [[Khiva|Khwarizm]] and [[Azerbaijan]]. However, Timur still supported him against the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russians]] and in 1382 Tokhtamysh invaded the Muscovite dominion and [[Siege of Moscow (1382)|burned Moscow]].<ref>Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 93</ref>\n\n[[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] tradition states that later, in 1395 Timur, having reached the frontier of [[Principality of Ryazan]], had taken [[Elets]] and started advancing towards Moscow. Great Prince [[Vasily I of Moscow]] went with an army to [[Kolomna]] and halted at the banks of the [[Oka River]]. The clergy brought the famed [[Theotokos of Vladimir]] icon from [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] to Moscow. Along the way people prayed kneeling: \u201cO Mother of God, save the land of Russia!\u201d Suddenly, Timur's armies retreated.

In the end, Persia was split amongst the [[Muzaffarids (Iran)|Muzaffarids]], [[Kartids]], [[Eretnids]], [[Chobanids]], [[Injuids]], [[Jalayirids]], and [[Sarbadars]]. In 1383, Timur started his lengthy military conquest of Persia, though he already ruled over much of Persian [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by 1381, after Khwaja Mas'ud, of the [[Sarbadar]] dynasty surrendered. Timur began his Persian campaign with [[Herat]], capital of the [[Kurt dynasty|Kartid dynasty]]. When Herat did not surrender he reduced the city to rubble and massacred most of its citizens; it remained in ruins until [[Shah Rukh]] ordered its reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=96ec98LieGsC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=siege+of+herat+timur#v=onepage&q=siege%20of%20herat%20timur&f=false|title=Mughal Gardens|work=google.ca|isbn=9780884022350|last1=Wescoat|first1=James L.|last2=Wolschke-Bulmahn|first2=Joachim|year=1996}}</ref> Timur then sent a General to capture rebellious [[Kandahar]]. With the capture of Herat the Kartid kingdom surrendered and became vassals of Timur; it would later be annexed outright less than a decade later in 1389 by Timur's son [[Miran Shah]].\n\nTimur then headed west to capture the [[Zagros Mountains]], passing through [[Mazandaran]]. During his travel through the north of Persia, he captured the then town of [[Tehran]], which surrendered and was thus treated mercifully. He laid siege to [[Soltaniyeh]] in 1384. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] revolted one year later, so Timur destroyed Isfizar, and the prisoners were cemented into the walls alive. The next year the kingdom of Sistan, under the [[Mihrabanids|Mihrabanid dynasty]], was ravaged, and its capital at [[Zaranj]] was destroyed. Timur then returned to his capital of [[Samarkand]], where he began planning for his [[Timur's invasion of Georgia|Georgian campaign]] and [[Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war|Golden Horde]] invasion. In 1386, Timur passed through [[Mazandaran]] as he had when trying to capture the Zagros. He went near the city of [[Soltaniyeh]], which he had previously captured but instead turned north and captured [[Tabriz]] with little resistance, along with [[Maragha]]. He ordered heavy taxation of the people, which was collected by Adil Aqa, who was also given control over Soltaniyeh. Adil was later executed because Timur suspected him of corruption.\n\nTimur then went north to begin his Georgian and Golden Horde campaigns, pausing his full-scale invasion of Persia. When he returned, he found his generals had done well in protecting the cities and lands he had conquered in Persia. Though many rebelled, and his son [[Miran Shah]], who may have been [[regent]], was forced to annex rebellious vassal dynasties, his holdings remained. So he proceeded to capture the rest of Persia, specifically the two major southern cities of [[Isfahan]] and [[Shiraz]]. When he arrived with his army at [[Isfahan]] in 1387, the city [[Siege of Isfahan (1387)|immediately surrendered]]; he treated it with relative mercy as he normally did with cities that surrendered (unlike Herat). However, after Isfahan revolted against Timur's taxes by killing the tax collectors and some of Timur's soldiers, he ordered the massacre of the city's citizens; the death toll is reckoned at between 100,000 and 200,000.<ref name=\"Chaliand 2007 87\">{{cite book|last=Chaliand|first=Gerard|title=The History of Terrorism: From Antiquity to Al Qaeda|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24709-3|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar|url-access=registration|quote=isfahan Timur.|author2=Arnaud Blin |page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofterrori00grar/page/87 87]}}</ref> An eye-witness counted more than 28 towers constructed of about 1,500 heads each.<ref>Fisher, W.B.; Jackson, P.; Lockhart, L.; Boyle, J.A. : The Cambridge History of Iran, p55.</ref> This has been described as a \"systematic use of terror against towns...an integral element of Tamerlane's strategic element\", which he viewed as preventing bloodshed by discouraging resistance. His massacres were selective and he spared the artistic and educated.<ref name=\"Chaliand 2007 87\" /> This would later influence the next great Persian conqueror: [[Nader Shah]].\n\nTimur then began a five-year campaign to the west in 1392, attacking [[Iranian Kurdistan|Persian Kurdistan]]. In 1393, Shiraz was captured after surrendering, and the Muzaffarids became vassals of Timur, though prince [[Shah Mansur (Persia)|Shah Mansur]] rebelled but was defeated, and the [[Muzafarids]] were annexed. Shortly after Georgia was devastated so that the Golden Horde could not use it to threaten northern Iran. In the same year, Timur caught Baghdad by surprise in August by marching there in only eight days from Shiraz. Sultan [[Ahmad Jalayir]] fled to Syria, where the Mamluk Sultan [[Barquq]] protected him and killed Timur's envoys. Timur left the [[Sarbadar]] prince Khwaja Mas'ud to govern [[Baghdad]], but he was driven out when [[Ahmad Jalayir]] returned. Ahmad was unpopular but got some dangerous help from [[Qara Yusuf]] of the [[Kara Koyunlu]]; he fled again in 1399, this time to the Ottomans.\n\n=== Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war ===\nIn the meantime, Tokhtamysh, now khan of the [[Golden Horde]], turned against his patron and in 1385 invaded [[Azerbaijan]]. The inevitable response by Timur resulted in the [[Tokhtamysh\u2013Timur war]]. In the initial stage of the war, Timur won a victory at the [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]]. After the battle Tokhtamysh and some of his army were allowed to escape. After Tokhtamysh's initial defeat, Timur invaded Muscovy to the north of Tokhtamysh's holdings. Timur's army burned [[Ryazan]] and advanced on Moscow. He was pulled away before reaching the Oka River by Tokhtamysh's renewed campaign in the south.<ref>Nicholas V. Raisanovsky; Mark D. Steinberg: ''A History of Russia'' Seventh Edition, pg 94</ref>\n\nIn the first phase of the conflict with Tokhtamysh, Timur led an army of over 100,000 men north for more than 700 miles into the steppe. He then rode west about 1,000 miles advancing in a front more than 10 miles wide. During this advance, Timur's army got far enough north to be in a region of [[midnight sun|very long summer days]] causing complaints by his Muslim soldiers about keeping a long schedule of [[salat|prayers]]. It was then that Tokhtamysh's army was boxed in against the east bank of the Volga River in the [[Orenburg]] region and destroyed at the [[Battle of the Kondurcha River]], in 1391.\n\nIn the second phase of the conflict, Timur took a different route against the enemy by invading the realm of Tokhtamysh via the [[Caucasus]] region. In 1395, Timur defeated Tokhtamysh in the [[Battle of the Terek River]], concluding the struggle between the two monarchs. Tokhtamysh was unable to restore his power or prestige, and he was killed about a decade later in the area of present-day [[Tyumen]]. During the course of Timur's campaigns, his army destroyed [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], the capital of the Golden Horde, and [[Astrakhan]], subsequently disrupting the Golden Horde's [[Silk Road]]. The Golden Horde no longer held power after their losses to Timur.\n\n=== Ismailis ===\nIn May 1393, Timur's army invaded the [[Anjudan]], crippling the [[Ismaili]] village only a year after his assault on the Ismailis in [[Mazandaran]]. The village was prepared for the attack, evidenced by its fortress and system of tunnels. Undeterred, Timur's soldiers flooded the tunnels by cutting into a channel overhead. Timur's reasons for attacking this village are not yet well understood. However, it has been suggested that his [[Timur#Personal life|religious persuasions]] and view of himself as an [[Timur#Indian campaign|executor of divine will]] may have contributed to his motivations.<ref name=\"Virani, Shafique N 2007, p. 116\">Virani, Shafique N.

His invasion did not go unopposed and he encountered resistance from the Governor of [[Meerut]] during the march to Delhi. Timur was still able to continue his approach to Delhi, arriving in 1398, to fight the armies of Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, which had already been weakened by a succession struggle within the royal family.\n\n=== Capture of Delhi (1398) ===\n[[File:Delhi after sack of Timur Lang, 1398.jpg|thumb|Delhi after sack of Timur Lang, 1398]]\n\nThe battle took place on 17 December 1398. Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq and the army of Mallu Iqbal<ref>Mallu, who later received the title of Iqbal Khan, was a noble in Siri and an ally of Muqarrab Khan, but later on betrayed him and Nusrat Khan, and allied with Nasir-ud-din Mahmud Shah.

Timur then loaded his camels with as much wood and hay as they could carry. When the war elephants charged, Timur set the hay on fire and prodded the camels with iron sticks, causing them to charge at the elephants howling in pain: Timur had understood that elephants were easily panicked. Faced with the strange spectacle of camels flying straight at them with flames leaping from their backs, the elephants turned around and stampeded back toward their own lines. Timur capitalized on the subsequent disruption in the forces of Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq, securing an easy victory. Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud Shah Tughluq fled with remnants of his forces. Delhi was sacked and left in ruins. Before the battle for Delhi, Timur executed 100,000 captives.<ref name=\"EI\" />\n\nThe capture of the Delhi Sultanate was one of Timur's greatest victories, as at that time, Delhi was one of the richest cities in the world. After Delhi fell to Timur's army, uprisings by its citizens against the Turkic-Mongols began to occur, causing a retaliatory bloody massacre within the city walls. After three days of citizens uprising within Delhi, it was said that the city reeked of the decomposing bodies of its citizens with their heads being erected like structures and the bodies left as food for the birds by Timur's soldiers. Timur's invasion and destruction of Delhi continued the chaos that was still consuming India, and the city would not be able to recover from the great loss it suffered for almost a century.<ref name=\"marozzi-2004\" />{{rp|269\u2013274}}\n\n== Campaigns in the Levant ==\n[[File:Behzad timur egyptian.jpg|thumb|Timur defeating the [[Mamluk]] [[Sultan]] [[Nasir-ad-Din Faraj]] of [[Egypt]]]]\n[[File:Chlebowski-Bajazyt w niewoli.jpg|thumb|[[Bayezid I]] being held captive by Timur]]\n\nBefore the end of 1399, Timur started a war with [[Bayezid I]], sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and the [[Mamluk]] sultan of Egypt [[Nasir-ad-Din Faraj]].

Timur cited the killing of [[Hasan ibn Ali]] by the Umayyad caliph [[Muawiyah I]] and the killing of [[Husayn ibn Ali]] by [[Yazid I]] as the reason for his massacre of the inhabitants of Damascus.\n\nTimur invaded Baghdad in June 1401. After the capture of the city, 20,000 of its citizens were massacred. Timur ordered that every soldier should return with at least two severed human heads to show him. When they ran out of men to kill, many warriors killed prisoners captured earlier in the campaign, and when they ran out of prisoners to kill, many resorted to beheading their own wives.<ref>Ibn Arabshah, Timur the Great Amir, p. 168</ref>\n\n== Invasion of Anatolia ==\n\nIn the meantime, years of insulting letters had passed between Timur and Bayezid. Both rulers insulted each other in their own way while Timur preferred to undermine Bayezid's position as a ruler and play down the significance of his military successes. \n\nThis is the excerpt from one of Timur's letters addressed to Ottoman sultan:\n\n\"Believe me, you are but pismire ant: don't seek to fight the elephants for they'll crush you under their feet. Shall a petty prince such as you are contend with us? But your rodomontades (braggadocio) are not extraordinary; for a [[Turkmen people|Turcoman]] never spake with judgement.

Bayezid was captured in battle and subsequently died in captivity, initiating the twelve-year [[Ottoman Interregnum]] period. Timur's stated motivation for attacking Bayezid and the Ottoman Empire was the restoration of [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] authority. Timur saw the Seljuks as the rightful rulers of [[Anatolia]] as they had been granted rule by Mongol conquerors, illustrating again Timur's interest with Genghizid legitimacy.\n\nAfter the Ankara victory, Timur's army ravaged Western Anatolia, with Muslim writers complaining that the Timurid army acted more like a horde of savages than that of a civilized conqueror.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} But Timur did [[Siege of Smyrna|besiege and take]] the city of [[Smyrna]], a stronghold of the Christian [[Knights Hospitalers]], thus he referred to himself as ''[[ghazi warriors|ghazi]]'' or \"Warrior of Islam\".

The legend has it that Timur, wounded by an enemy arrow, found shelter at the abandoned ruins of an old fortress in the desert. Lamenting his fate, Timur saw a little ant carrying a grain up the side of a collapsed wall. Thinking that the end was close, Timur directed all his attention to that ant and watched how troubled by the wind or the size of her cargo, the ant fell back down to the ground each time she climbed the wall. Timur counted overall 69 attempts and finally, on the 70th try, the little ant succeeded and made her way into the nest with a precious prize. If an ant can persevere like this, Timur thought, then surely a man can do the same. Inspired by the diligent ant, he decided that he would never again lose hope, and eventually the chain of events, coupled with his persistence and military genius led to him becoming arguably the most powerful monarch of his era.<ref>John C. Johnson, \"Tamerlane and the ant\", Stories, 2011</ref>\n\nThere is a shared view that Timur's real motive for his campaigns was his imperialistic ambition. However, Timur's following words: \"The whole expanse of the inhabited part of the world is not large enough to have two kings\" explains that his true desire was \"to amaze the world\", and through his destructive campaigns, to produce an impression rather than to achieve enduring results. This is supported by the fact that besides Iran, Timur simply plundered the states he invaded with a purpose of enriching his native Samarqand and neglected the conquered areas, which may have resulted in a relatively quick disintegration of his Empire after his death<ref name=\"barthold\">{{cite book |last1=Barthold |first1=V.V. |title=Four studies on the History of Central Asia, vol. 1 |date=1962 |publisher=Leiden, E.J.Brill |pages=59-60 |edition=Second Printing, 1962}}</ref>.   \n\nTimur used Persian expressions in his conversations often, and his motto was the Persian phrase ''r\u0101st\u012b rust\u012b'' ({{lang|fa|\u0631\u0627\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0631\u0633\u062a\u06cc}}, meaning \"truth is safety\" or ''\"veritas salus\"'').<ref name=Fischel />\n\n== Exchanges with Europe ==\n{{Main|Timurid relations with Europe}}\n[[File:Letter of Tamerlane to Charles VI 1402.jpg|thumb|upright|Letter of Timur to [[Charles VI of France]], 1402, a witness to [[Timurid relations with Europe]].

Relations between the court of [[Henry III of Castile]] and that of Timur played an important part in medieval [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] diplomacy. In 1402, the time of the [[Battle of Ankara]], two Spanish ambassadors were already with Timur: Pelayo de Sotomayor and Fernando de Palazuelos. Later, Timur sent to the court of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n#Le\u00f3n and Castile|Kingdom of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] a Chagatai ambassador named Hajji Muhammad al-Qazi with letters and gifts.\n\nIn return, Henry III of Castile sent a famous embassy to Timur's court in Samarkand in 1403\u201306, led by [[Ruy Gonz\u00e1lez de Clavijo]], with two other ambassadors, Alfonso Paez and Gomez de Salazar. On their return, Timur affirmed that he regarded the king of Castile \"as his very own son\".\n\nAccording to Clavijo, Timur's good treatment of the Spanish delegation contrasted with the disdain shown by his host toward the envoys of the \"lord of [[Cathay]]\" (i.e., the Yongle Emperor), the Chinese ruler. Clavijo's visit to Samarkand allowed him to report to the European audience on the news from [[Cathay]] (China), which few Europeans had been able to visit directly in the century that had passed since the travels of [[Marco Polo]].\n\nThe French archives preserve:\n*A 30 July 1402 letter from Timur to [[Charles VI of France]], suggesting that he send traders to Asia.

He was responsible for the effective destruction of the Nestorian Christian [[Church of the East]] in much of Asia. Thus, while Timur still retains a positive image in Muslim Central Asia, he is vilified by many in [[Arabia]], [[Iraq]], Persia, and India, where some of his greatest atrocities were carried out.

(including police tasks). The class has a helicopter deck aft behind the superstructure but lacks an aircraft hangar. However, it can perform [[Rotors running refueling]] and can thus increase the endurance and the range of the helicopter. December 2013 a third ship of the class (HDMS ''Lauge Koch'') was ordered by the Danish Parliament. Service entry of the third ship will be 2016, with an estimated cost of 513 mill Dkr (US$ {{Format price|{{To USD|513000000|DNK}} }}).\n\n==Armament==\nThe standard armament consists of two {{convert|12.7|mm|in|adj=on|1}} heavy machine guns. This is supplemented by the two [[Stanflex]] modular mission payload slots (one on the foredeck, the other aft of the superstructure), which can be fitted with a multi-purpose gun, [[surface-to-air missile]]s, or [[anti-submarine warfare|ASW]] torpedoes, along with other non-weapon payloads. Another two container positions are \"prepared for\" but not installed on the starboard and port sides of the heli deck.\n\n==List of ships==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n![[Pennant number|Pennant<br>number]]\n!Name\n!Int'l [[Callsign|c/s]]\n![[Shipyard]]\n!Laid down\n!Launched\n!In service\n!Christened by\n!Decommissioned\n|-\n| P570\n| {{HDMS|Knud Rasmussen|P570|2}}\n| OVFG\n| Karstensens Skibsv\u00e6rft\n| 2005-11-21\n| 2006-10-19\n| 2008-02-18\n| J\u00f3annes ejdesgaard\n\n| -\n|-\n| P571\n| {{HDMS|Ejnar Mikkelsen|P571|2}}\n| OVFH\n| Karstensens Skibsv\u00e6rft\n| 2006-11-10\n| 2007-06-01\n| 2009-01-16\n| -\n| -\n|-\n| P572\n| {{HDMS|Lauge Koch|P572|2}}\n| OVFI\n| Karstensens Skibsv\u00e6rft\n| 2014-05\n| \n| 2017-12-11\n| -\n| -\n|-\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://forsvaret.dk/sitecollectiondocuments/smk/projekter/if/pr%C3%A6sentation_af_skib_-_if_-_endelig_version.pdf Official presentation (Danish)]\n\n{{Knud Rasmussen class patrol vessel}}\n\n[[Category:Patrol ship classes]]\n[[Category:Knud Rasmussen-class patrol vessels| ]]\n[[Category:Active patrol vessels of Denmark| ]]\n", "name_user": "Tupsumato", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knud_Rasmussen-class_patrol_vessel"}

Japanese immigrant laborers and the white upperclass live in a rigidly classist society. Jo (played as a child by Cole Takiue), an orphan of mixed-race lineage (''[[h\u0101fu]]''), finds himself ostracized by both groups until Doc ([[Matt Dillon]]), a white (''[[haole]]'') doctor from the mainland, is hired as a physician for workers on the plantation owned by Mr. Danielson ([[Nick Boraine]]). Doc has Jo run medicine and translate for him on the island.\n\nTen years later, Jo (played by [[Ryan Potter]]) falls in love with the plantation owner's daughter, Grace (Olivia Ritchie). They interact a few times at the Danielson's home under the guise of treating her ankle injury. Mr. Danielson meets a new doctor, Dr. Reyes ([[Jim Caviezel]]), and invites him to tend to the white upperclass residents of the island, even as his company is going bankrupt. Throughout this time, Doc has been taking several secret trips to see a lawyer in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]  about formally adopting Jo, even though it was illegal at that time to adopt a [[hapa|mixed-race]] child. Jo at first is impressed by the new doctor and his car, a [[Ford Model T]], and asks him to take him on as an assistant. However, when they go to treat Mr. Danielson's accountant, who had poisoned himself as a suicide attempt, Jo realizes that the doctor is a charlatan. Dr. Reyes later expresses a romantic interest in Grace, and her father, seeing it as an opportunity to save his plantation and way of life, encourages the proposal.\n\nMr. Danielson sets out on a trip to Hilo to discuss his looming bankruptcy with the bank, intending to inform them that Grace is marrying into a wealthy family. Along the way, he accidentally falls into a ditch and hits his head. Doc and Jo are the first to reach him and, on inspection, Doc fears Mr. Danielson's head injury is severe. He tells Jo to find Dr. Reyes so that they can use his motorcar to transport him. At his home, Mr. Danielson and his mother ([[Juliet Mills]]) insist Dr. Reyes treat his injury and that Doc and Jo leave. Moments later, Grace comes crying out of the house announcing that her father is dead. Grace's grandmother and Dr. Reyes watch Grace and Jo embrace, and Grace's grandmother scolds Grace and pulls her away.\n\nThat night, Doc and Jo are walking back to their house. Along the way, Dr. Reyes purposefully chases them in his car and tries to run them over. Doc manages to push Jo out of the way, but gets hit himself and dies shortly afterward. Dr. Reyes threatens to kill Jo if he doesn't leave town. Later, Jo returns to his mother's house and is found by the Hilo lawyer who informs him that Doc's adoption was a success. Jo runs to the scheduled wedding between Dr. Reyes and Grace and asks for her hand in marriage. Grace's caretaker of several years, Miss Hanabusa (Rumi Oyama), approves the proposal and informs everyone that Mr. Danielson was bankrupt.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Potter]] as Jo\n* [[Matt Dillon]] as \"Doc\"\n* [[Jim Caviezel]] as Doctor Reyes\n* Olivia Ritchie as Grace Danielson\n* [[Nick Boraine]] as Mr. Danielson\n* Rumi Oyama as Miss Hanabusa\n* [[Juliet Mills]] as Grace's grandmother\n* [[Stelio Savante]] as Mayor<ref>{{cite news |last1=Papadatos |first1=Markos |title=Stelio Savante talks 'Running for Grace,' technology, Viola Davis |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/entertainment/stelio-savante-talks-running-for-grace-technology-viola-davis/article/531052 |accessdate=12 December 2018 |work=Digital Journal |date=3 September 2018}}</ref>\n* Cole Takiue as young Jo\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released two weeks early in Hawaii before it received its mainland release in the United States on Aug 17, 2018.<ref>{{cite news |title='Running for Grace' tells tale of segregated coffee fields on Hawaii island |url=https://www.khon2.com/news/local-news/wake-up-2day/-running-for-grace-tells-tale-of-segregated-coffee-fields-on-big-island/1313301548 |accessdate=12 December 2018 |work=khon2}}</ref> The film first premiered in three movie theaters in Hawaii on July 20, 2018.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title |tt5696326}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|running_for_grace}}\n* [https://www.runningforgracemovie.com/ Official website]\n\n[[Category:2018 films]]\n[[Category:2010s romance films]]\n[[Category:American romance films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2018 Family Movie directed by David L.
