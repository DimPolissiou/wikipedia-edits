Ramsey (ed.), ''South Asian Sufis: Devotion, Deviation, and Destiny'', A&C Black (2012), p. 143</ref> and was particularly intensified under the Muslim reformer [[Shah Waliullah]] (1703-1762) who, because he wanted to give back to Muslims their self-consciousness during the decline of the [[Mughal empire]] and the rise of the non-Muslim powers like the [[Marathas]], [[Jats]] and [[Sikhs]], launched a mass-movement of the religious education which made \"them conscious of their distinct nationhood which in turn culminated in the form of Two Nation Theory and ultimately the creation of Pakistan.\"<ref>M. Ikram Chaghatai (ed.),''Shah Waliullah (1703 - 1762): His Religious and Political Thought'', Sang-e-Meel Publications (2005), p. 275</ref>\n\n[[Akbar Ahmed]] also considers [[Haji Shariatullah]] (1781\u20131840) and [[Syed Ahmad Barelvi]] (1786\u20131831) to be the forerunners of the Pakistan movement, because of their purist and militant reformist movements targeting the Muslim masses, saying that \"reformers like Waliullah, Barelvi and Shariatullah were not demanding a Pakistan in the modern sense of nationhood. They were, however, instrumental in creating an awareness of the crisis looming for the Muslims and the need to create their own political organization. What [[Sir Syed Ahmad Khan|Sir Sayyed]] did was to provide a modern idiom in which to express the quest for Islamic identity.\"<ref>Akbar Ahmed, ''Jinnah, Pakistan and Islamic Identity: The search for Saladin'', Routledge (2005), p. 121</ref>\n\nThus, many Pakistanis describe modernist and reformist scholar Syed Ahmad Khan (1817\u20131898) as the architect of the two-nation theory. For instance, Sir Syed, in a January 1883 speech in [[Patna]], talked of two different nations, even if his own approach was conciliatory:\n{{quote|Friends, in India there live two prominent nations which are distinguished by the names of Hindus and Mussulmans. Just as a man has some principal organs, similarly these two nations are like the principal limbs of India.<ref>[[Ramachandra Guha]], ''Makers of Modern India'', Harvard University Press (2011), p. 65</ref>|}}\nHowever, the formation of the [[Indian National Congress]] was seen politically threatening and he dispensed with composite Indian nationalism. In an 1887 speech, he said:\n{{quote|Now suppose that all the English were to leave India\u2014then who would be rulers of India? Is it possible that under these circumstances two nations, Mohammedan and Hindu, could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power? Most certainly not.

M. Ikram]] says that it \"created quite a sensation in the twenties\":\n\n{{quote|The Hindus and Muslims are not two religious sects like the Protestants and Catholics of England, but form two distinct communities of peoples, and so they regard themselves. Their respective attitude towards life, distinctive culture, civilization and social habits, their traditions and history, no less than their religion, divide them so completely that the fact that they have lived in the same country for nearly 1,000 years has contributed hardly anything to their fusion into a nation... Any of us Indian Muslims travelling for instance in Afghanistan, Persia, and Central Asia, among Chinese Muslims, Arabs, and Turks, would at once be made at home and would not find anything to which we are not accustomed. On the contrary in India, we find ourselves in all social matters total aliens when we cross the street and enter that part of the town where our Hindu fellow townsmen live.<ref>S.M.

The Muslim is inspired by the great literature of Arabia and Persia, his conduct is influenced by the precepts of [[Saadi Shirazi|Sadi]] or of the great saints of Islam. The Hindu venerates myriads of gods, demi-gods, and demons of whose very name the Muslim is ignorant, and his daily life is governed by an elaborate code of rules the very reason of which is as unintelligible to the Muslim as to the Christian. Even their newspapers, their novels, and current literature are mutually unintelligible. The Muslim reads his script from right to left, the Hindu books and newspapers are printed from left to right. But it is useless to enumerate the grounds of difference between Hindu and Muslim; the only thing that matters is that they do in fact feel and think of themselves as separate peoples. In all disquisitions on nationality, this is the only test which is found to cover all cases. If a certain body of persons think of themselves as one nation and are willing to endure tribulation and material losses in order to remain together, then they are one people; if they cannot pass this acid test, they are not. Judged by this standard the Muslims of India are a nation. Communal differences, as they are called, are really national jealousies. That is why Sir Muhammad Iqbal declared 'the problem of India is international, not national'.<ref>Sir John Cumming, ''Political India: 1832-1932, A Co-operative Survey Of A Century'', Oxford University Press (1932), pp. 104-105</ref>|}}\n\n[[Diana L. Eck]] quotes [[Sir John Strachey]] (1823-1907), another important British civil servant in the region, and says that this idea of India not being a nation \"would be echoed by British administrators for many decades\" and \"was to become one of the undergirding themes of empire\", in an 1883 conference precisely entitled \"What is India?\", at the [[University of Cambridge]], he said:\n\n{{quote|There is no such country, and this is the first and most essential fact about India that can be learned. India is a name, which we give to a great region including a multitude of different countries. There is no general Indian term that corresponds to it... Scotland is more like Spain than Bengal is like the Punjab....

[[Jinnah]] stated that Hindus and Muslims belonged to two different religious philosophies, with different social customs and literature, with no intermarriage and based on conflicting ideas and concepts. Their outlook on life and of life was different and despite 1000 years of history, the relations between the Hindus and Muslims could not attain the level of cordiality.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 1948, Jinnah said:\n{{quote|Islam has taught us this and I think you will agree with me, for whatever you may be and wherever you are, you are a Muslim.

At first they demanded separate electorates, but when they came to the conclusion that Muslims would not be safe in a Hindu-dominated [[India]], they began to demand a separate state.

It is formed by causes which take their origin in historical, religious, cultural and social antipathy, of which political antipathy is only a reflection. These form one deep river of discontent which, being regularly fed by these sources, keeps on mounting to a head and overflowing its ordinary channels. Any current of water flowing from another source, however pure, when it joins it, instead of altering the colour or diluting its strength becomes lost in the mainstream. The silt of this antagonism which this current has deposited has become permanent and deep. So long as this silt keeps on accumulating and so long as this antagonism lasts, it is unnatural to expect this antipathy between Hindus and Muslims to give place to unity.<ref>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, ''Pakistan Or Partition of India'', Thacker limited (1945), p. 324</ref>|}}\n\n===Explanations by Muslim leaders===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}<!--3 quotes that need citations-->\n[[Image:Pic iqbal 23.jpg|thumb|right|Muhammad Iqbal]]\n[[Muhammad Iqbal]]'s statement explaining the attitude of Muslim delegates to the London round-table conference issued in December 1933 was a rejoinder to [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s statement. Nehru had said that the attitude of the Muslim delegation was based on \"reactionarism\". Iqbal concluded his rejoinder with:\n{{quote|In conclusion, I must put a straight question to Pandit Jawaharlal, how is India's problem to be solved if the majority community will neither concede the minimum safeguards necessary for the protection of a minority of 80 million people nor accept the award of a third party; but continue to talk of a kind of nationalism which works out only to its own benefit? This position can admit of only two alternatives. Either the Indian majority community will have to accept for itself the permanent position of an agent of British imperialism in the East, or the country will have to be redistributed on a basis of religious, historical and cultural affinities so as to do away with the question of electorates and the communal problem in its present form.|<ref name=\"iqbal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allamaiqbal.com/person/movement/move_main.htm|title=Iqbal and the Pakistan Movement|publisher=Iqbal Academy |location=Lahore |accessdate=22 April 2006}}</ref>}}\n\nIn [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s All India Muslim League presidential address delivered in Lahore, on March 22, 1940, he explained:\n\n{{quote|It is extremely difficult to appreciate why our Hindu friends fail to understand the real nature of Islam and Hinduism. They are not religions in the strict sense of the word, but are, in fact, different and distinct social orders, and it is a dream that the Hindus and Muslims can ever evolve a common nationality, and this misconception of one Indian nation has troubles and will lead India to destruction if we fail to revise our notions in time. The Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs, [[litterateur]]s. They neither intermarry nor interdine together and, indeed, they belong to two different civilizations which are based mainly on conflicting ideas and conceptions. Their aspect on life and of life are different. It is quite clear that Hindus and Mussalmans derive their inspiration from different sources of history. They have different epics, different heroes, and different episodes. Very often the hero of one is a foe of the other and, likewise, their victories and defeats overlap. To yoke together two such nations under a single state, one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority, must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built for the government of such a state.|<ref name=\"Quaid\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nazariapak.info/data/quaid/statements/two-nation.asp|title=Excerpt from the presidential address delivered Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Lahore on March 22, 1940|first=Nazaria-e-Pakistan Foundation|last=Official website|accessdate=22 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628044030/http://www.nazariapak.info/data/quaid/statements/two-nation.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 28 June 2006}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1944, Jinnah said:\n{{quote|We maintain and hold that Muslims and Hindus are two major nations by any definition or test of a nation. We are a nation of hundred million and what is more, we are a nation with our own distinctive culture and civilization, language and literature, art and architecture, names and nomenclature, sense of values and proportions, legal laws and moral codes, customs and calendar, history and tradition, and aptitude and ambitions. In short, we have our own outlook on life and of life.|}}\n\nIn an interview with the British journalist [[Beverley Nichols]], he said in 1943: \n{{quote|Islam is not only a religious doctrine but also a realistic code of conduct in terms of every day and everything important in life: our history, our laws and our jurisprudence. In all these things, our outlook is not only fundamentally different but also opposed to Hindus. There is nothing in life that links us together. Our names, clothes, food, festivals, and rituals, all are different. Our economic life, our educational ideas, treatment of women, attitude towards animals, and humanitarian considerations, all are very different.|}}\n\nIn May 1947, he took an entirely different approach when he told [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]], who was in charge of British India's transition to independence: {{quote|Your Excellency doesn't understand that the Punjab is a nation. Bengal is a nation. A man is a Punjabi or a Bengali first before he is a Hindu or a Muslim. If you give us those provinces you must, under no condition, partition them. You will destroy their viability and cause endless bloodshed and trouble.|}}\n\nMountbatten replied: {{quote|Yes, of course. A man is not only a Punjabi or a Bengali before he is a Muslim or Hindu, but he is an Indian before all else. What you're saying is the perfect, absolute answer I've been looking for. You've presented me the arguments to keep India united.|}}\n\n===Savarkar's ideas on \"two nations\"===\n\nAccording to Ambedkar, Savarkar's idea of \"two nations\" did not translate into two separate countries. [[B. R. Ambedkar]] summarised Savarkar's position thus:\n{{quote|Mr. Savarkar... insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution;... In the struggle for political power between the two nations the rule of the game which Mr. Savarkar prescribes is to be [[one man one vote]], be the man Hindu or Muslim. In his scheme a Muslim is to have no advantage which a Hindu does not have. Minority is to be no justification for privilege and majority is to be no ground for penalty. The State will guarantee the Muslims any defined measure of political power in the form of Muslim religion and Muslim culture. But the State will not guarantee secured seats in the Legislature or in the Administration and, if such guarantee is insisted upon by the Muslims, such guaranteed quota is not to exceed their proportion to the general population.<ref name = \"Ambedkar\"/>}}\n\nBut [[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]] also expressed his surprise at the agreement between Savarkar and Jinnah on describing Hindus and Muslims as two nations. He noticed that both were different in implementation:\n\n\"Strange as it may appear, Mr. Savarkar and Mr. Jinnah, instead of being opposed to each other on the one nation versus two nations issue, are in complete agreement about it. Both agree, not only agree but insist, that there are two nations in India \u2014one the Muslim nation and the other the Hindu nation. They differ only as regards the terms and conditions on which the two nations should live. Mr. Jinnah says India should be cut up into two, Pakistan and Hindustan, the Muslim nation to occupy Pakistan and the Hindu nation to occupy Hindustan. Mr. Savarkar, on the other hand, insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution; that the constitution shall be such that the Hindu nation will be enabled to occupy a predominant position that is due to it and the Muslim nation made to live in the position of subordinate co-operation with the Hindu nation.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ambedkar |first=B.R. |date=1940 |title=Pakistan or the Partition of India |author-link=B.R.

He was from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, in present-day [[Pakistan]]. He believed that the partition would be harmful to the Muslims of the subcontinent. After partition, following a majority of the NWFP voters going for Pakistan in a controversial referendum, Ghaffar Khan resigned himself to their choice and took an oath of allegiance to the new country on February 23, 1948, during a session of the Constituent Assembly, and his second son, [[Khan Abdul Wali Khan|Wali Khan]], \"played by the rules of the political system\" as well.<ref>[[Christophe Jaffrelot]], ''The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience'', Oxford University Press (2015), p. 153</ref>\n\n===Gandhi's view===\n[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] was against the division of India on the basis of religion.

Mr. Niaz Murtaza, a Pakistani scholar with a doctoral degree from the Berkeley-based University of California, wrote in his [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] column (April 11, 2017): \n\n{{quote|If the two-nation theory is eternally true, why did Muslims come to Hindu India from Arabia? Why did they live with and rule Hindus for centuries instead of giving them a separate state based on such a theory? Why did the two-nation theory emerge when Hindu rule became certain? All this can only be justified by an absurd sense of superiority claiming a divine birthright to rule others, which many Muslims do hold despite their dismal morals and progress today.|}}\n\nIn his memoirs entitled ''Pathway to Pakistan'' (1961), [[Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman]], a prominent leader of the Pakistan movement and the first president of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]], has written: \"The two-nation theory, which we had used in the fight for Pakistan, had created not only bad blood against the Muslims of the minority provinces but also an ideological wedge, between them and the Hindus of India.\".{{sfn|Khaliquzzaman, Pathway to Pakistan|1961|p=390}} He further wrote: \"He ([[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]]) doubted the utility of the two-nation theory, which to my mind also had never paid any dividends to us, but after the partition, it proved positively injurious to the Muslims of India, and on a long-view basis for Muslims everywhere.\"{{sfn|Khaliquzzaman, Pathway to Pakistan|1961|p=400}}\n\nAccording to Khaliquzzaman, on August 1, 1947, [[Jinnah]] invited the Muslim League members of India's constituent assembly to a farewell meeting at his Delhi house.\n\n{{quote|Mr. Rizwanullah put some awkward questions concerning the position of Muslims, who would be left over in India, their status and their future. I had never before found Mr. Jinnah so disconcerted as on that occasion, probably because he was realizing then quite vividly what was immediately in store for the Muslims. Finding the situation awkward, I asked my friends and colleagues to end the discussion. I believe as a result of our farewell meeting, Mr. Jinnah took the earliest opportunity to bid goodbye to his two-nation theory in his speech on 11 August 1947 as the governor general-designate and President of the constituent assembly of Pakistan.{{sfn|Khaliquzzaman, Pathway to Pakistan|1961|p=321}} }}\n\nIn his August 11, 1947 speech, [[Jinnah]] had spoken of composite Pakistani nationalism, effectively negating the faith-based nationalism that he had advocated in his speech of March 22, 1940. In his August 11 speech, he said that non-Muslims would be equal citizens of Pakistan and that there would be no discrimination against them. \"You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the state.\" On the other hand, far from being an ideological point (transition from faith-based to composite nationalism), it was mainly tactical: [[Dilip Hiro]] says that \"extracts of this speech were widely disseminated\" in order to abort the communal violence in Punjab and the NWFP, where Muslims and Sikhs-Hindus were butchering each other and which greatly disturbed Jinnah on a personal level, but \"the tactic had little, if any, impact on the horrendous barbarity that was being perpetrated on the plains of Punjab.\"<ref>Dilip Hiro, ''The Longest August: The Unflinching Rivalry Between India and Pakistan'', Hachette UK (2015), p. 101</ref> Another Indian scholar, Venkat Dhulipala, who in his book ''Creating a New Medina'' precisely shows that Pakistan was meant to be a new Medina, an Islamic state, and not only a state for Muslims, so it was meant to be ideological from the beginning with no space for composite nationalism, in an interview also says that the speech \"was made primarily keeping in mind the tremendous violence that was going on\", that it was \"directed at protecting Muslims from even greater violence in areas where they were vulnerable\", \"it was pragmatism\", and to vindicate this, the historian goes on to say that \"after all, a few months later, when asked to open the doors of the Muslim League to all Pakistanis irrespective of their religion or creed, the same Jinnah refused, saying that Pakistan was not ready for it.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Ajaz Ashraf |date=28 June 2016

However, [[Salman Sayyid]] says that 1971 is not so much the failure of the two-nation theory and the advent of a [[Supremacism#Islamic|united Islamic polity]] despite ethnic and cultural difference, but more so the defeat of \"a [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian]]-style nation-state, which insists that linguistic, cultural and ethnic homogeneity is necessary for high 'sociopolitical cohesion'.

His [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal in 1905]] creating two provinces, one with a Muslim majority and the other with a Hindu majority, seems to have been confirmed by Bangladesh's emergence as a Muslim state.

Ramsey (ed.), ''South Asian Sufis: Devotion, Deviation, and Destiny'', A&C Black (2012), p. 143</ref> and was particularly intensified under the Muslim reformer [[Shah Waliullah]] (1703-1762) who, because he wanted to give back to Muslims their self-consciousness during the decline of the [[Mughal empire]] and the rise of the non-Muslim powers like the [[Marathas]], [[Jats]] and [[Sikhs]], launched a mass-movement of the religious education which made \"them conscious of their distinct nationhood which in turn culminated in the form of Two Nation Theory and ultimately the creation of Pakistan.\"<ref>M. Ikram Chaghatai (ed.),''Shah Waliullah (1703 - 1762): His Religious and Political Thought'', Sang-e-Meel Publications (2005), p. 275</ref>\n\n[[Akbar Ahmed]] also considers [[Haji Shariatullah]] (1781\u20131840) and [[Syed Ahmad Barelvi]] (1786\u20131831) to be the forerunners of the Pakistan movement, because of their purist and militant reformist movements targeting the Muslim masses, saying that \"reformers like Waliullah, Barelvi and Shariatullah were not demanding a Pakistan in the modern sense of nationhood. They were, however, instrumental in creating an awareness of the crisis looming for the Muslims and the need to create their own political organization. What [[Sir Syed Ahmad Khan|Sir Sayyed]] did was to provide a modern idiom in which to express the quest for Islamic identity.\"<ref>Akbar Ahmed, ''Jinnah, Pakistan and Islamic Identity: The search for Saladin'', Routledge (2005), p. 121</ref>\n\nThus, many Pakistanis describe modernist and reformist scholar Syed Ahmad Khan (1817\u20131898) as the architect of the two-nation theory. For instance, Sir Syed, in a January 1883 speech in [[Patna]], talked of two different nations, even if his own approach was conciliatory:\n{{quote|Friends, in India there live two prominent nations which are distinguished by the names of Hindus and Mussulmans. Just as a man has some principal organs, similarly these two nations are like the principal limbs of India.<ref>[[Ramachandra Guha]], ''Makers of Modern India'', Harvard University Press (2011), p. 65</ref>|}}\nHowever, the formation of the [[Indian National Congress]] was seen politically threatening and he dispensed with composite Indian nationalism. In an 1887 speech, he said:\n{{quote|Now suppose that all the English were to leave India\u2014then who would be rulers of India? Is it possible that under these circumstances two nations, Mohammedan and Hindu, could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power? Most certainly not.

The Congress thinks that they profess the same religion, that they speak the same language, that their way of life and customs are the same...

M. Ikram]] says that it \"created quite a sensation in the twenties\":\n\n{{quote|The Hindus and Muslims are not two religious sects like the Protestants and Catholics of England, but form two distinct communities of peoples, and so they regard themselves. Their respective attitude towards life, distinctive culture, civilization and social habits, their traditions and history, no less than their religion, divide them so completely that the fact that they have lived in the same country for nearly 1,000 years has contributed hardly anything to their fusion into a nation... Any of us Indian Muslims travelling for instance in Afghanistan, Persia, and Central Asia, among Chinese Muslims, Arabs, and Turks, would at once be made at home and would not find anything to which we are not accustomed. On the contrary in India, we find ourselves in all social matters total aliens when we cross the street and enter that part of the town where our Hindu fellow townsmen live.<ref>S.M. Ikram, ''Indian Muslims and Partition of India'', Atlantic Publishers & Dist (1995), p. 308</ref>|}}\n\nSir John Cumming (1868-1958), a British administrator in the subcontinent, in his 1932 book ''Political India'' quotes the last part and gives the following commentary:\n\n{{quote|It is not only in the customs and usages which mark their external life that the two people differ; the sources of their moral and intellectual inspiration are different. The Muslim is inspired by the great literature of Arabia and Persia, his conduct is influenced by the precepts of [[Saadi Shirazi|Sadi]] or of the great saints of Islam. The Hindu venerates myriads of gods, demi-gods, and demons of whose very name the Muslim is ignorant, and his daily life is governed by an elaborate code of rules the very reason of which is as unintelligible to the Muslim as to the Christian. Even their newspapers, their novels, and current literature are mutually unintelligible. The Muslim reads his script from right to left, the Hindu books and newspapers are printed from left to right. But it is useless to enumerate the grounds of difference between Hindu and Muslim; the only thing that matters is that they do in fact feel and think of themselves as separate peoples. In all disquisitions on nationality, this is the only test which is found to cover all cases.

They are not religions in the strict sense of the word, but are, in fact, different and distinct social orders, and it is a dream that the Hindus and Muslims can ever evolve a common nationality, and this misconception of one Indian nation has troubles and will lead India to destruction if we fail to revise our notions in time. The Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs, [[litterateur]]s. They neither intermarry nor interdine together and, indeed, they belong to two different civilizations which are based mainly on conflicting ideas and conceptions. Their aspect on life and of life are different. It is quite clear that Hindus and Mussalmans derive their inspiration from different sources of history. They have different epics, different heroes, and different episodes. Very often the hero of one is a foe of the other and, likewise, their victories and defeats overlap. To yoke together two such nations under a single state, one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority, must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built for the government of such a state.|<ref name=\"Quaid\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nazariapak.info/data/quaid/statements/two-nation.asp|title=Excerpt from the presidential address delivered Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Lahore on March 22, 1940|first=Nazaria-e-Pakistan Foundation|last=Official website|accessdate=22 April 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628044030/http://www.nazariapak.info/data/quaid/statements/two-nation.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 28 June 2006}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1944, Jinnah said:\n{{quote|We maintain and hold that Muslims and Hindus are two major nations by any definition or test of a nation. We are a nation of hundred million and what is more, we are a nation with our own distinctive culture and civilization, language and literature, art and architecture, names and nomenclature, sense of values and proportions, legal laws and moral codes, customs and calendar, history and tradition, and aptitude and ambitions. In short, we have our own outlook on life and of life.|}}\n\nIn an interview with the British journalist [[Beverley Nichols]], he said in 1943: \n{{quote|Islam is not only a religious doctrine but also a realistic code of conduct in terms of every day and everything important in life: our history, our laws and our jurisprudence. In all these things, our outlook is not only fundamentally different but also opposed to Hindus. There is nothing in life that links us together. Our names, clothes, food, festivals, and rituals, all are different. Our economic life, our educational ideas, treatment of women, attitude towards animals, and humanitarian considerations, all are very different.|}}\n\nIn May 1947, he took an entirely different approach when he told [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]], who was in charge of British India's transition to independence: {{quote|Your Excellency doesn't understand that the Punjab is a nation. Bengal is a nation. A man is a Punjabi or a Bengali first before he is a Hindu or a Muslim. If you give us those provinces you must, under no condition, partition them. You will destroy their viability and cause endless bloodshed and trouble.|}}\n\nMountbatten replied: {{quote|Yes, of course. A man is not only a Punjabi or a Bengali before he is a Muslim or Hindu, but he is an Indian before all else. What you're saying is the perfect, absolute answer I've been looking for. You've presented me the arguments to keep India united.|}}\n\n===Savarkar's ideas on \"two nations\"===\n\nAccording to Ambedkar, Savarkar's idea of \"two nations\" did not translate into two separate countries. [[B. R. Ambedkar]] summarised Savarkar's position thus:\n{{quote|Mr. Savarkar... insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution;... In the struggle for political power between the two nations the rule of the game which Mr. Savarkar prescribes is to be [[one man one vote]], be the man Hindu or Muslim. In his scheme a Muslim is to have no advantage which a Hindu does not have. Minority is to be no justification for privilege and majority is to be no ground for penalty. The State will guarantee the Muslims any defined measure of political power in the form of Muslim religion and Muslim culture. But the State will not guarantee secured seats in the Legislature or in the Administration and, if such guarantee is insisted upon by the Muslims, such guaranteed quota is not to exceed their proportion to the general population.<ref name = \"Ambedkar\"/>}}\n\nBut [[B. R. Ambedkar|Ambedkar]] also expressed his surprise at the agreement between Savarkar and Jinnah on describing Hindus and Muslims as two nations. He noticed that both were different in implementation:\n\n\"Strange as it may appear, Mr. Savarkar and Mr. Jinnah, instead of being opposed to each other on the one nation versus two nations issue, are in complete agreement about it. Both agree, not only agree but insist, that there are two nations in India \u2014one the Muslim nation and the other the Hindu nation. They differ only as regards the terms and conditions on which the two nations should live. Mr. Jinnah says India should be cut up into two, Pakistan and Hindustan, the Muslim nation to occupy Pakistan and the Hindu nation to occupy Hindustan. Mr. Savarkar, on the other hand, insists that, although there are two nations in India, India shall not be divided into two parts, one for Muslims and the other for the Hindus; that the two nations shall dwell in one country and shall live under the mantle of one single constitution; that the constitution shall be such that the Hindu nation will be enabled to occupy a predominant position that is due to it and the Muslim nation made to live in the position of subordinate co-operation with the Hindu nation.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Ambedkar |first=B.R. |date=1940 |title=Pakistan or the Partition of India |author-link=B.R.

He was from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, in present-day [[Pakistan]]. He believed that the partition would be harmful to the Muslims of the subcontinent. After partition, following a majority of the NWFP voters going for Pakistan in a controversial referendum, Ghaffar Khan resigned himself to their choice and took an oath of allegiance to the new country on February 23, 1948, during a session of the Constituent Assembly, and his second son, [[Khan Abdul Wali Khan|Wali Khan]], \"played by the rules of the political system\" as well.<ref>[[Christophe Jaffrelot]], ''The Pakistan Paradox: Instability and Resilience'', Oxford University Press (2015), p. 153</ref>\n\n===Gandhi's view===\n[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] was against the division of India on the basis of religion.

Mr. Niaz Murtaza, a Pakistani scholar with a doctoral degree from the Berkeley-based University of California, wrote in his [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] column (April 11, 2017): \n\n{{quote|If the two-nation theory is eternally true, why did Muslims come to Hindu India from Arabia? Why did they live with and rule Hindus for centuries instead of giving them a separate state based on such a theory? Why did the two-nation theory emerge when Hindu rule became certain? All this can only be justified by an absurd sense of superiority claiming a divine birthright to rule others, which many Muslims do hold despite their dismal morals and progress today.|}}\n\nIn his memoirs entitled ''Pathway to Pakistan'' (1961), [[Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman]], a prominent leader of the Pakistan movement and the first president of the [[Pakistan Muslim League]], has written: \"The two-nation theory, which we had used in the fight for Pakistan, had created not only bad blood against the Muslims of the minority provinces but also an ideological wedge, between them and the Hindus of India.\".{{sfn|Khaliquzzaman, Pathway to Pakistan|1961|p=390}} He further wrote: \"He ([[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy]]) doubted the utility of the two-nation theory, which to my mind also had never paid any dividends to us, but after the partition, it proved positively injurious to the Muslims of India, and on a long-view basis for Muslims everywhere.\"{{sfn|Khaliquzzaman, Pathway to Pakistan|1961|p=400}}\n\nAccording to Khaliquzzaman, on August 1, 1947, [[Jinnah]] invited the Muslim League members of India's constituent assembly to a farewell meeting at his Delhi house.\n\n{{quote|Mr. Rizwanullah put some awkward questions concerning the position of Muslims, who would be left over in India, their status and their future. I had never before found Mr. Jinnah so disconcerted as on that occasion, probably because he was realizing then quite vividly what was immediately in store for the Muslims. Finding the situation awkward, I asked my friends and colleagues to end the discussion. I believe as a result of our farewell meeting, Mr. Jinnah took the earliest opportunity to bid goodbye to his two-nation theory in his speech on 11 August 1947 as the governor general-designate and President of the constituent assembly of Pakistan.{{sfn|Khaliquzzaman, Pathway to Pakistan|1961|p=321}} }}\n\nIn his August 11, 1947 speech, [[Jinnah]] had spoken of composite Pakistani nationalism, effectively negating the faith-based nationalism that he had advocated in his speech of March 22, 1940. In his August 11 speech, he said that non-Muslims would be equal citizens of Pakistan and that there would be no discrimination against them. \"You may belong to any religion or caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the state.\" On the other hand, far from being an ideological point (transition from faith-based to composite nationalism), it was mainly tactical: [[Dilip Hiro]] says that \"extracts of this speech were widely disseminated\" in order to abort the communal violence in Punjab and the NWFP, where Muslims and Sikhs-Hindus were butchering each other and which greatly disturbed Jinnah on a personal level, but \"the tactic had little, if any, impact on the horrendous barbarity that was being perpetrated on the plains of Punjab.\"<ref>Dilip Hiro, ''The

shows that Pakistan was meant to be a new Medina, an Islamic state, and not only a state for Muslims, so it was meant to be ideological from the beginning with no space for composite nationalism, in an interview also says that the speech \"was made primarily keeping in mind the tremendous violence that was going on\", that it was \"directed at protecting Muslims from even greater violence in areas where they were vulnerable\", \"it was pragmatism\", and to vindicate this, the historian goes on to say that \"after all, a few months later, when asked to open the doors of the Muslim League to all Pakistanis irrespective of their religion or creed, the same Jinnah refused, saying that Pakistan was not ready for it.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Ajaz Ashraf |date=28 June 2016

The break-up of united Pakistan should be seen as another failure of this Westphalian-inspired [[Kemalist]] model of nation-building, rather than an illustration of the inability of [[Political Islam|Muslim political identity]] to sustain a unified state structure.\"<ref>Salman Sayyid, ''Recalling the Caliphate: Decolonisation and World Order'', C.

His [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partition of Bengal in 1905]] creating two provinces, one with a Muslim majority and the other with a Hindu majority, seems to have been confirmed by Bangladesh's emergence as a Muslim state.

In addition to creoles that have European languages as their base, there are, for example, creoles based on Arabic, Chinese, and Malay. The creole with the largest number of speakers is [[Haitian Creole]], with almost ten million native speakers,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valdman|first1=Albert|title=Creole: The national language of Haiti |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~creole/creolenatllangofhaiti.html|website=www.indiana.edu|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}</ref> followed by [[Tok Pisin]] with about 4 million, most of whom are second-language speakers.\n\nThe [[lexicon]] (or, roughly, the base or essential vocabulary \u2013 such as \"say\" but not \"said, tell, told\") of a creole language is largely supplied by the parent languages, particularly that of the most dominant group in the social context of the creole's construction. However, there are often clear [[phoneme|phonetic]] and [[semantic]] shifts. On the other hand, the grammar that has evolved often has new or unique features that differ substantially from those of the parent languages.\n\n==Overview==\nA creole is believed to arise when a pidgin, developed by adults for use as a second language, becomes the native and primary language of their children \u2013 a process known as [[nativization]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|p=61}}</ref> The [[pidgin]]-creole life cycle was studied by American linguist [[Robert A.

Like most non-official and minority languages, creoles have generally been regarded in popular opinion as degenerate variants or [[dialect]]s of their parent languages. Because of that prejudice, many of the creoles that arose in the European colonies, having been stigmatized, have become [[Extinct language|extinct]]. However, political and academic changes in recent decades have improved the status of creoles, both as living languages and as object of linguistic study.<ref name=DeCamp>{{Harvcoltxt|DeCamp|1977}}</ref><ref name=Sebba>{{Harvcoltxt|Sebba|1997}}</ref> Some creoles have even been granted the status of official or semi-official languages of particular political territories.\n\nLinguists now recognize that creole formation is a universal phenomenon, not limited to the European colonial period, and an important aspect of language evolution (see {{Harvcoltxt|Vennemann|2003}}). For example, in 1933 [[Sigmund Feist]] postulated [[Germanic substrate hypothesis|a creole origin]] for the [[Germanic languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feist|first=Sigmund|date=1932|title=The Origin of the Germanic Languages and the Indo-Europeanising of North Europe|jstor=408831|journal=Language|volume=8|issue=4|pages=245\u2013254|doi=10.2307/408831}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars, such as [[Salikoko Mufwene]], argue that pidgins and creoles arise independently under different circumstances, and that a pidgin need not always precede a creole nor a creole evolve from a pidgin. Pidgins, according to Mufwene, emerged in trade colonies among \"users who preserved their native vernaculars for their day-to-day interactions.\" Creoles, meanwhile, developed in settlement colonies in which speakers of a European language, often [[indentured servants]] whose language would be far from the standard in the first place, interacted extensively with non-European [[slave]]s, absorbing certain words and features from the slaves' non-European native languages, resulting in a heavily [[basilect]]alized version of the original language. These servants and slaves would come to use the creole as an everyday vernacular, rather than merely in situations in which contact with a speaker of the superstrate was necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/mufwene/pidginCreoleLanguage.html |first=Salikoko |last=Mufwene |title=Pidgin and Creole Languages |website=Humanities.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2010-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603044826/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/mufwene/pidginCreoleLanguage.html |archive-date=2013-06-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Etymology===\nThe English term ''creole'' comes from [[wiktionary:cr\u00e9ole|French]] {{Lang-fr|cr\u00e9ole|label=none}}, which is cognate with the [[wiktionary:criollo|Spanish term]] {{Lang-es|criollo|label=none}} and [[wiktionary:crioulo|Portuguese]] {{Lang-pt|crioulo|label=none}}, all descending from the verb ''criar'' ('to breed' or 'to raise'), all coming from Latin {{Lang-la|creare|label=none}} ('to produce, create').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|1988}}.</ref> The specific sense of the term was coined in the 16th and 17th century, during the great expansion in European maritime power and trade that led to the establishment of European colonies in other continents.\n\nThe terms ''criollo'' and ''crioulo'' were originally qualifiers used throughout the Spanish and Portuguese colonies to distinguish the members of an ethnic group who were born and raised locally from those who immigrated as adults. They were most commonly applied to nationals of the colonial power, e.g. to distinguish ''[[Criollo people|espa\u00f1oles criollos]]'' (people born in the colonies from Spanish ancestors) from {{Lang-es|espa\u00f1oles peninsulares|label=none}} (those born in the Iberian Peninsula, i.e. Spain). However, in Brazil the term was also used to distinguish between ''negros crioulos'' (blacks born in Brazil from African slave ancestors) and ''negros africanos'' (born in Africa). Over time, the term and its derivatives (Creole, Kr\u00e9ol, Kreyol, [[Krey\u00f2l]], Kriol, [[Krio language|Krio]], etc.) lost the generic meaning and became the proper name of many distinct ethnic groups that developed locally from immigrant communities. Originally, therefore, the term \"creole language\" meant the speech of any of those [[creole peoples]].\n\n===Geographic distribution===\nAs a consequence of colonial European trade patterns, most of the known European-based creole languages arose in coastal areas in the equatorial belt around the world, including the [[Americas]], western [[Africa]], [[Goa]] along the west of [[India]], and along Southeast [[Asia]] up to [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], Reunion, [[Seychelles]] and [[Oceania]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Douglas B.|date=2008-12-01|title=Slave trade merchants of Spanish New Orleans, 1763\u20131803: Clarifying the colonial slave trade to Louisiana in Atlantic perspective|journal=Atlantic Studies|volume=5|issue=3|pages=335\u2013346|doi=10.1080/14788810802445024|issn=1478-8810}}</ref>\n\nMany of those creoles are now extinct, but others still survive in the [[Caribbean]], the north and east coasts of [[South America]] ([[The Guyanas]]), western [[Africa]], [[Australia]] (see [[Australian Kriol language]]), and in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n[[Atlantic Creole]] languages are based on European languages with elements from African and possibly [[Amerindian languages|Amerindian]] languages. [[Indian Ocean]] Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and possibly other Asian languages. There are, however, creoles like [[Nubi language|Nubi]] and [[Sango language|Sango]] that are derived solely from non-European languages.\n\n===Social and political status===\nBecause of the generally low status of the Creole peoples in the eyes of prior European colonial powers, creole languages have generally been regarded as \"degenerate\" languages, or at best as rudimentary \"dialects\" of the politically dominant parent languages. Because of this, the word \"creole\" was generally used by linguists in opposition to \"language\", rather than as a [[qualifier]] for it.<ref name=Meijer>See {{Harvcoltxt|Meijer|Muysken|1977}}.</ref>\n\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the relative neglect of creole languages in linguistics is that they do not fit the 19th-century [[neogrammarian]] \"tree model\" for the evolution of languages, and its postulated regularity of sound changes (these critics including the earliest advocates of the [[wave model (linguistics)|wave model]], [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]] and [[Hugo Schuchardt]], the forerunners of modern [[sociolinguistics]]). This controversy of the late 19th century profoundly shaped modern approaches to the [[comparative method]] in [[historical linguistics]] and in [[creolistics]].<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Meijer /><ref name=\"Traugott 1977\">{{Harvcoltxt|Traugott|1977}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Timoun Sy\u00e8j (Creole).jpg|thumb|[[Haitian Creole]] in use at car rental counter, USA]]\nBecause of social, political, and academic changes brought on by decolonization in the second half of the 20th century, creole languages have experienced revivals in the past few decades. They are increasingly being used in print and film, and in many cases, their community prestige has improved dramatically. In fact, some have been standardized, and are used in local schools and universities around the world.<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Sebba /><ref>Holm (1988, 1989) <!-- which one? --></ref> At the same time, linguists have begun to come to the realization that creole languages are in no way inferior to other languages. They now use the term \"creole\" or \"creole language\" for any language suspected to have undergone [[creolization]], terms that now imply no geographic restrictions nor ethnic prejudices.\n\nCreolization is widely thought to be a leading influence on the evolution of [[African-American English]] (AAE).  The controversy surrounding African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the American education system, as well as the past use of the word [[Ebonics (word)|''ebonics'']] to refer to it, mirrors the historical negative connotation of the word ''creole''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Robert L.|date=2016-07-25|title=The Ebonics Controversy|journal=Journal of Black Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=208\u2013214|doi=10.1177/00957984970233002}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n===Historic classification===\nAccording to their external history, four types of creoles have been distinguished: plantation creoles, fort creoles, [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] creoles, and creolized pidgins.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995|p=15}}</ref> By the very nature of a creole language, the [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] classification of a particular creole usually is a matter of dispute; especially when the [[pidgin]] precursor and its parent tongues (which may have been other creoles or pidgins) have disappeared before they could be documented.\n\nPhylogenetic classification traditionally relies on inheritance of the lexicon, especially of \"core\" terms, and of the grammar structure. However, in creoles, the core lexicon often has mixed origin, and the grammar is largely original. For these reasons, the issue of which language is ''the'' parent of a creole \u2013 that is, whether a language should be classified as a \"French creole\", \"Portuguese creole\" or \"English creole\", etc. \u2013 often has no definitive answer, and can become the topic of long-lasting controversies, where social prejudices and political considerations may interfere with scientific discussion.<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Sebba /><ref name=\"Traugott 1977\" />\n\n===Substrate and superstrate===\nThe terms [[substratum|substrate]] and [[superstratum|superstrate]] are often used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in [[second language acquisition]] or [[language shift|language replacement]] events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate).<ref name=Weinreich>{{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1953}}</ref> The outcome of such an event is that erstwhile speakers of the substrate will use some version of the superstrate, at least in more formal contexts. The substrate may survive as a second language for informal conversation. As demonstrated by the fate of many replaced European languages (such as [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[Breton language|Breton]], and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), the influence of the substrate on the official speech is often limited to pronunciation and a modest number of loanwords. The substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving any trace.<ref name=Weinreich />\n\nHowever, there is dispute over the extent to which the terms \"substrate\" and \"superstrate\" are applicable to the genesis or the description of creole languages.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1993}}</ref> The language replacement model may not be appropriate in creole formation contexts, where the emerging language is derived from multiple languages without any one of them being imposed as a replacement for any other.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1988}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1996}}</ref> The substratum-superstratum distinction becomes awkward when multiple superstrata must be assumed (such as in [[Papiamentu]]), when the substratum cannot be identified, or when the presence or the survival of substratal evidence is inferred from mere typological analogies.<ref name=\"Muysken 2001\"/> On the other hand, the distinction may be meaningful when the contributions of each parent language to the resulting creole can be shown to be very unequal, in a scientifically meaningful way.<ref>Recent investigations about substrates and superstrates, in creoles and other languages, includes {{Harvcoltxt|Feist|1932}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1953}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Jungemann|1955}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Martinet|1955}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hall|1974}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1983}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1988}}.</ref> In the literature on [[Atlantic Creole]]s, \"superstrate\" usually means European and \"substrate\" non-European or African.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}</ref>\n\n===Decreolization===\nSince creole languages rarely attain official status, the speakers of a fully formed creole may eventually feel compelled to conform their speech to one of the parent languages. This [[decreolization]] process typically brings about a [[post-creole speech continuum]] characterized by large-scale variation and [[hypercorrection]] in the language.<ref name=DeCamp />\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that creoles have a simpler grammar and more internal variability than older, more established languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/2013_APiCS/files/abstracts.html|title=Creole and pidgin language structure in cross-linguistic perspective|date=August 2013|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology \u2013 Department of Linguistics}}</ref> However, these notions are occasionally challenged.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995|p=9}}</ref> (See also [[language complexity]].)\n\nPhylogenetic or [[linguistic typology|typological]] comparisons of creole languages have led to divergent conclusions. Similarities are usually higher among creoles derived from related languages, such as the [[languages of Europe]], than among broader groups that include also creoles based on non-[[Indo-European languages]] (like Nubi or Sango). [[French-based creole languages|French-based creoles]] in turn are more similar to each other (and to varieties of French) than to other European-based creoles. It was observed, in particular, that [[definite article]]s are mostly prenominal in [[English-based creole languages]] and English whereas they are generally postnominal in [[French-based creole languages|French creoles]] and in the [[Quebec French|variety of French]] that was [[History of Quebec French|exported to what is now Quebec in the 17th and 18th century]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|1998}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1995}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}}.</ref> Moreover, the European languages which gave rise to the creole languages of European colonies all belong to the same subgroup of Western [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and have highly convergent grammars; to the point that [[Sapir Whorf|Whorf]] joined them into a single [[Standard Average European]] language group.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Whorf|1956}}</ref> French and English are particularly close, since English, through extensive borrowing, is typologically closer to French than to other Germanic languages.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bailey|Maroldt|1977}}</ref> Thus the claimed similarities between creoles may be mere consequences of similar parentage, rather than characteristic features of all creoles.\n\n==Creole genesis==\nThere are a variety of theories on the origin of creole languages, all of which attempt to explain the similarities among them. {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} outline a fourfold classification of explanations regarding creole genesis:\n* Theories focusing on European input\n* Theories focusing on non-European input\n* Gradualist and developmental hypotheses\n* Universalist approaches\n\nIn addition to the precise mechanism of creole genesis, a more general debate has developed whether creole languages are characterized by different mechanisms in opposition to traditional languages (which is McWhorter's 2018 main point)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Creole Debate|last=McWhorter|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=3}}</ref> or whether in that regard creole languages develop by the same mechanisms as any other languages (e.g. DeGraff 2001).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeGraff|first=Michael|date=2001|title=On the origin of creoles|url=|journal=Linguistic Typology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\n===Theories focusing on European input===\n====Monogenetic theory of pidgins and creoles====\nThe [[monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] of pidgins and creoles hypothesizes that they are all derived from a single [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], via a West African Pidgin Portuguese of the seventeenth century, [[relexification|relexified]] in the so-called \"slave factories\" of Western Africa that were the source of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. This theory was originally formulated by [[Hugo Schuchardt]] in the late nineteenth century and popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Taylor,<ref>such as in {{Harvcoltxt|Taylor|1977}}</ref> Whinnom,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Whinnom|1956}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Whinnom|1965}}</ref> Thompson,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1961}}</ref> and Stewart.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Stewart|1962}}</ref>  However, this hypothesis is no longer actively investigated, as there are examples of creoles, such as [[Hezhou language|Hezhou]], which evidently have nothing to do with the Lingua Franca.\n\n====Domestic origin hypothesis====\nProposed by {{Harvcoltxt|Hancock |1985}} for the origin of English-based creoles of the West Indies, the Domestic Origin Hypothesis argues that, towards the end of the 16th century, English-speaking traders began to settle in the Gambia and [[Sierra Leone]] rivers as well as in neighboring areas such as the Bullom and Sherbro coasts. These settlers intermarried with the local population leading to mixed populations, and, as a result of this intermarriage, an English pidgin was created. This pidgin was learned by slaves in slave depots, who later on took it to the West Indies and formed one component of the emerging English creoles.\n\n====European dialect origin hypothesis====\nThe [[French-based creole languages|French creoles]] are the foremost candidates to being the outcome of \"normal\" [[language change|linguistic change]] and their [[creoleness]] to be sociohistoric in nature and relative to their colonial origin.<ref>There are some similarities in this line of thinking with [[Ian F. Hancock|Hancock's]] domestic origin hypothesis.</ref> Within this theoretical framework, a [[French-based creole languages|French creole]] is a language [[phylogenetic]]ally based on [[French language|French]], more specifically on a 17th-century [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] French extant in [[Paris]], the French Atlantic harbours, and the nascent French colonies. Supporters of this hypothesis suggest that the non-Creole French dialects still spoken in many parts of the Americas share mutual descent from this single koin\u00e9. These dialects are found in [[Canada]] (mostly in [[Qu\u00e9bec]] and in [[Acadian]] communities), [[Louisiana]], [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy]] and as [[Language isolate|isolates]] in other parts of the Americas.<ref>Wittmann (1983, 1995, 2001), {{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|1998}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|Wittmann|1995}}; cf. the article on Quebec French and the History of Quebec French</ref> Approaches under this hypothesis are compatible with [[gradualism]] in [[Language change|change]] and models of [[Creole language#Imperfect L2 learning|imperfect language transmission]] in [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] genesis.\n\n====Foreigner talk and baby talk====\nThe Foreigner Talk (FT) hypothesis argues that a pidgin or creole language forms when native speakers attempt to simplify their language in order to address speakers who do not know their language at all. Because of the similarities found in this type of speech and speech directed to a small child, it is also sometimes called [[baby talk]].<ref>See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Ferguson|1971}}</ref>\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} suggest that four different processes are involved in creating Foreigner Talk:\n* Accommodation\n* Imitation\n* Telegraphic condensation\n* Conventions\n\nThis could explain why creole languages have much in common, while avoiding a monogenetic model. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Hinnenkamp|1984}}, in analyzing German Foreigner Talk, claims that it is too inconsistent and unpredictable to provide any model for language learning.\n\nWhile the simplification of input was supposed to account for creoles' simple grammar, commentators have raised a number of criticisms of this explanation:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|p=73}}</ref>\n# There are a great many grammatical similarities amongst pidgins and creoles despite having very different [[lexifier]] languages.<!-- That is actually a fiercely debated point, see elsewhere in the article -->\n# Grammatical simplification can be explained by other processes, i.e. the innate grammar of [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] [[language bioprogram theory]].<!-- This theory is highly controversial and presupposes the acceptance of some form of psychological nativism \u2013 which most non-Chomskyan linguists reject -->\n# Speakers of a creole's lexifier language often fail to understand, without learning the language, the grammar of a pidgin or creole.\n# Pidgins are more often used amongst speakers of different substrate languages than between such speakers and those of the lexifier language.\n\nAnother problem with the FT explanation is its potential circularity. {{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1933}} points out that FT is often based on the imitation of the incorrect speech of the non-natives, that is the pidgin.<!-- Non-native speech is not necessarily pidgin at all! --> Therefore, one may be mistaken in assuming that the former gave rise to the latter.\n\n====Imperfect L2 learning====\nThe imperfect L2 ([[second language]]) learning hypothesis claims that pidgins are primarily the result of the imperfect L2 learning of the dominant lexifier language by the slaves. Research on naturalistic L2 processes has revealed a number of features of \"interlanguage systems\" that are also seen in pidgins and creoles:\n* invariant verb forms derived from the infinitive or the least marked finite verb form;\n* loss of determiners or use as determiners of demonstrative pronouns, adjectives or adverbs;\n* placement of a negative particle in preverbal position;\n* use of adverbs to express modality;\n* fixed single word order with no inversion in questions;\n* reduced or absent nominal plural marking.\n\nImperfect L2 learning is compatible with other approaches, notably the European dialect origin hypothesis and the universalist models of language transmission.<ref>Based on 19th-century intuitions, approaches underlying the imperfect L2 learning hypothesis have been followed up in the works of {{Harvcoltxt|Schumann|1978}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Anderson|1983}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Seuren|Wekker|1986}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Geeslin|2002}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hamilton|Coslett|2008}}.</ref>\n\n===Theories focusing on non-European input===\nTheories focusing on the substrate, or non-European, languages attribute similarities amongst creoles to the similarities of African substrate languages. These features are often assumed to be transferred from the substrate language to the creole or to be preserved invariant from the substrate language in the creole through a process of [[relexification]]: the substrate language replaces the native [[lexical items]] with lexical material from the superstrate language while retaining the native grammatical categories.<ref>See the article on [[relexification]] for a discussion of the controversy surrounding the retaining of substrate grammatical features through relexification.</ref> The problem with this explanation is that the postulated substrate languages differ amongst themselves and with creoles in meaningful ways. {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1981}} argues that the number and diversity of African languages and the paucity of a historical record on creole genesis makes determining lexical correspondences a matter of chance. {{Harvcoltxt|Dillard|1970}} coined the term \"cafeteria principle\" to refer to the practice of arbitrarily attributing features of creoles to the influence of substrate African languages or assorted substandard dialects of European languages.\n\nFor a representative debate on this issue, see the contributions to {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1993}}; for a more recent view, {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall |2000}}.\n\nBecause of the sociohistoric similarities amongst many (but by no means all) of the creoles, the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the plantation system of the European colonies have been emphasized as factors by linguists such as {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1999}}.\n\n===Gradualist and developmental hypotheses===\nOne class of creoles might start as [[pidgin]]s, rudimentary second languages improvised for use between speakers of two or more non-intelligible native languages. Keith Whinnom (in {{Harvcoltxt|Hymes|1971}}) suggests that pidgins need three languages to form, with one (the superstrate) being clearly dominant over the others. The lexicon of a pidgin is usually small and drawn from the vocabularies of its speakers, in varying proportions. Morphological details like word [[inflection]]s, which usually take years to learn, are omitted; the syntax is kept very simple, usually based on strict word order. In this initial stage, all aspects of the speech \u2013 syntax, lexicon, and pronunciation \u2013 tend to be quite variable, especially with regard to the speaker's background.\n\nIf a pidgin manages to be learned by the children of a community as a native language, it may become fixed and acquire a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. Pidgins can become full languages in only a single [[generation]]. \"Creolization\" is this second stage where the pidgin language develops into a fully developed native language. The vocabulary, too, will develop to contain more and more items according to a rationale of lexical enrichment.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|pp=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\n===Universalist approaches===\n{{Further|Universal grammar}}\n[[linguistic universal| Universalist]] models stress the intervention of specific general processes during the transmission of language from generation to generation and from speaker to speaker. The process invoked varies: a general tendency towards [[semantic]] [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], first-[[language learning]] driven by universal process, or a general process of [[discourse]] [[organization]]. [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] [[language bioprogram theory]], proposed in the 1980s, remains the main universalist theory.<ref>\nSee {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1981}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1984}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1988}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1991}}\n</ref>\nBickerton claims that creoles are inventions of the children growing up on newly-founded [[plantations]]. Around them, they only heard pidgins spoken, without enough structure to function as [[natural language]]s; and the children used their own [[innate]] linguistic capacities to transform the pidgin input into a full-fledged language. The alleged common features of all creoles would then stem from those innate abilities being universal.\n\n==Recent studies==\nThe last decades have seen the emergence of some new questions about the nature of creoles: in particular, the question of how complex creoles are and the question of whether creoles are indeed \"exceptional\" languages.\n\n===Creole prototype===\nSome features that distinguish creole languages from noncreoles have been proposed (by Bickerton,<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}}</ref> for example).\n\n[[John McWhorter]]<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}} and {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2005}}</ref> has proposed the following list of features to indicate a '''creole prototype''':\n* a lack of inflectional morphology (other than at most two or three inflectional affixes),\n* a lack of tone on monosyllabic words, and\n* a lack of semantically opaque word formation.\n\nMcWhorter hypothesizes that these three properties exactly characterize a creole. However, the creole prototype hypothesis has been disputed:\n* [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and David {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} argue that languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Soninke]], [[Magoua|Magoua French]] and [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] have all these three features but show none of the sociohistoric traits of creole languages.\n* Others (see overview in {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}}) have demonstrated creoles that serve as counterexamples to McWhorter's hypothesis \u2013 the existence of [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], for example, or [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law |2001}}</ref>\n\n===Exceptionalism===\nBuilding up on this discussion, McWhorter proposed that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\", claiming that every noncreole language's grammar is at least as complex as any creole language's grammar.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2005}}</ref> Gil has replied that [[Riau Indonesian]] has a simpler grammar than [[Saramaccan]], the language McWhorter uses as a showcase for his theory.<ref name=\"Gil 2001\"/> The same objections were raised by Wittmann in his 1999 debate with McWhorter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html|title=Prototype as a Typological Yardstick to Creoleness|website=www.nou-la.org}}</ref>\n\nThe lack of progress made in defining creoles in terms of their morphology and syntax has led scholars such as [[Robert Chaudenson]], [[Salikoko Mufwene]], [[Michel DeGraff]], and [[Henri Wittmann]] to question the value of ''creole'' as a typological class; they argue that creoles are structurally no different from any other language, and that ''creole'' is a sociohistoric concept \u2013 not a linguistic one \u2013 encompassing displaced populations and slavery.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}}, Wittmann (2001)</ref>\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}} spell out the idea of creole exceptionalism, claiming that creole languages are an instance of nongenetic language change due to language shift with abnormal transmission. Gradualists question the abnormal transmission of languages in a creole setting and argue that the processes which created today's creole languages are no different from universal patterns of language change.\n\nGiven these objections to ''creole'' as a concept, DeGraff and others question the idea that creoles are exceptional in any meaningful way.<ref name=\"DeGraff 2003\" /><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|2007}}</ref> Additionally, {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2002}} argues that some [[Romance language]]s are potential creoles but that they are not considered as such by linguists because of a historical bias against such a view.\n\n==Controversy==\nCreolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be [[creole (language)|creole]]s, what {{Harvcoltxt|Schneider|1990}} calls \"the [[cline (linguistics)|cline]] of creoleness.\"  No consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is [[prototypical]] or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause.\n\n===\"Creole\", a sociohistoric concept===\n''Creoleness'' is at the heart of the controversy with [[John McWhorter]]<ref>As in {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}</ref> and Mikael Parkvall{{sfnp|Parkvall|2001}} opposing [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and [[Michel DeGraff]].<ref>As in {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2005}}</ref> In McWhorter's definition, creoleness is a matter of degree, in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness: little or no [[inflection]], little or no [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]; In McWhorter's view, less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this [[prototype]]. Along these lines, McWhorter defines [[Haitian Creole]], exhibiting all three traits, as \"the most creole of creoles.\"{{sfnp|McWhorter|1998|p=809}} A creole like [[Palenquero]], on the other hand, would be less prototypical, given the presence of inflection to mark plural, past, gerund, and participle forms.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2000}} Objections to the McWhorter-Parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological [[parameters]] of creoleness can be found in languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Sooninke]], and [[Magoua]] [[French language|French]] which are not considered creoles. Wittmann and DeGraff come to the conclusion that efforts to conceive a [[yardstick]] for measuring [[creoleness]] in any scientifically meaningful way have failed so far.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1999}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2003}} {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} comes to the same conclusion for [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}} have adduced evidence as to creole languages which respond unexpectedly to one of McWhorter's three features (for example, [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]]). {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|2001}} have argued further that Creole languages are structurally no different from any other language, and that Creole is in fact a sociohistoric concept (and not a linguistic one), encompassing displaced population and slavery. {{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|Walicek|2005}} discuss creolistics in relation to [[colonialism|colonialist]] ideologies, rejecting the notion that Creoles can be responsibly defined in terms of specific grammatical characteristics. They discuss the history of linguistics and nineteenth-century work that argues for the consideration of the sociohistorical contexts in which Creole languages emerged.\n\n===\"Creole\", a genuine linguistic concept===\nOn the other hand, McWhorter points out that in languages such as Bambara, essentially a dialect of Manding, there is ample non-transparent derivation, and that there is no reason to suppose that this would be absent in close relatives such as Mandinka itself.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|p=16}} Moreover, he also observes that Soninke has what all linguists would analyze as inflections, and that current lexicography of Soninke is too elementary for it to be stated with authority that it does not have non-transparent derivation.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|pp=35, 369}} Meanwhile, Magoua French, as described by Henri Wittmann, retains some indication of grammatical gender, which qualifies as inflection, and it also retains non-transparent derivation.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1996}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}} as interpreted by {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}.</ref> Michel DeGraff's argument has been that Haitian Creole retains non-transparent derivation from French.\n\nTo the defense of DeGraff and Wittmann it must be said that McWhorter's 2005 book is a collection of previously published papers and that it contains nothing on \"defining creole\", Manding, Sooninke or Magoua that wasn't already known when DeGraff and Wittmann published their critiques as can be seen from their published debate.<ref>[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R6278&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133249/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R6278&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R12834&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133212/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R12834&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R14907&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133219/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R14907&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R20843&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133224/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R20843&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R21590&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133229/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R21590&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&L=CREOLIST&P=R4629&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133259/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&L=CREOLIST&P=R4629&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} Also see the list at the end of [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html]</ref> As it is, McWhorter's book does not offer anything new by the way of analysis of Manding, Soninke, or Magoua that wasn't already debated on in his exchange with Wittmann on Creolist. The issues in question are, at this point, unresolved as to sustaining McWhorter's hypotheses in any significant way though DeGraff's 2005 contribution addresses their weaknesses as far as Haitian Creole is concerned adding new evidence against. The only conclusion possibly so far as the typological differences between Manding, Soninke, Magoua and Haitian are concerned is that their comparative data do not confirm McWhorter's yardstick approach to defining creole.\n\n===Proposed synthesis===\nThe answer might be that creoleness is better described and referred to as a syndrome. In some cases, the modified source language might be the [[substratum|substrate]] language when warranted by a [[homogeneous]] substrate.{{sfnp|Singler|1988}} In other cases, the modified source language clearly is what [[creolist]]s identify as the [[superstrate]] language'{{sfnp|Wittmann|2001}} and in still other cases, no single source language might be identifiable.{{sfnp|DeGraff|2001}}  The same approach must be applied to identifying individual features as inherited or non-inherited and to distilling the defining grounds which separate creole languages from [[mixed language]]s such as [[Michif]], especially when [[relexification]] is somehow claimed to be a moving factor.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1973}}{{sfnp|Singler|1996}}{{sfnp|Wittmann|Fournier|1996}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2002}}\n\nThe answer might also be, however, that creole languages (i.e. like Haitian Creole) are indeed a unique in terms of the perspective that they offer on the human language competence in terms of the nature of their grammars though there have been no new responses to the counter-claims of DeGraff and Wittmann that would warrant the reopening of the debate as for now. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|Lim|2007}} critically assesses the proposal that creole languages exist as a homogeneous structural type with shared and/ or peculiar origins.\n\nThough the call for a sane approach to creolistics goes back to {{Harvcoltxt|Giv\u00f3n|1979}}, the first unbiased overview of the scientifically meaningful characteristics of creole languages must go to the credit of {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}. In their account of approaches to creole genesis, they group theories into four categories:\n\n:* ''Theories focusing on the [[Europe]]an input''\n:* ''Theories focusing on the non-European input''\n:* ''[[Gradualist]] and [[Developmental linguistics|developmental]] hypotheses''\n:* ''[[Universalist]] approaches''\n\nThe authors also confine [[Pidgins]] and [[mixed languages]] into

These are predominantly based on European languages such as English and French<ref>{{cite web|title=Creole \u2013 Language Information & Resources|url=https://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Creole/|website=www.alsintl.com|accessdate=October 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620093817/https://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Creole/|archive-date=June 20, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> due to the European [[Age of Discovery]] and the [[Atlantic slave trade]] that arose at that time.<ref>''Linguistics'', ed.

In addition to creoles that have European languages as their base, there are, for example, creoles based on Arabic, Chinese, and Malay. The creole with the largest number of speakers is [[Haitian Creole]], with almost ten million native speakers,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Valdman|first1=Albert|title=Creole: The national language of Haiti |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~creole/creolenatllangofhaiti.html|website=www.indiana.edu|accessdate=October 9, 2017}}</ref> followed by [[Tok Pisin]] with about 4 million, most of whom are second-language speakers.\n\nThe [[lexicon]] (or, roughly, the base or essential vocabulary \u2013 such as \"say\" but not \"said, tell, told\") of a creole language is largely supplied by the parent languages, particularly that of the most dominant group in the social context of the creole's construction. However, there are often clear [[phoneme|phonetic]] and [[semantic]] shifts. On the other hand, the grammar that has evolved often has new or unique features that differ substantially from those of the parent languages.\n\n==Overview==\nA creole is believed to arise when a pidgin, developed by adults for use as a second language, becomes the native and primary language of their children \u2013 a process known as [[nativization]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|p=61}}</ref> The [[pidgin]]-creole life cycle was studied by American linguist [[Robert A. Hall, Jr.|Robert Hall]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hall|1966}}</ref>\n\nSome linguists, such as Derek Bickerton, posit that creoles share more grammatical similarities with each other than with the languages from which they are phylogenetically derived.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983|pp=116\u2013122}}</ref> However, there is no widely accepted theory that would account for those perceived similarities.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Winford|1997|p=138}}; cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002}}</ref> Moreover, no grammatical feature has been shown to be specific to creoles.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1999}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}}</ref><ref name=\"Gil 2001\">{{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}}</ref><ref name=\"Muysken 2001\">{{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Lefebvre|2002}}</ref><ref name=\"DeGraff 2003\">{{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|2003}}</ref>\n\nMany of the creoles known today arose in the last 500 years, as a result of the worldwide expansion of European maritime power and trade in the [[Age of Discovery]], which led to extensive [[European colonialism|European colonial empires]]. Like most non-official and minority languages, creoles have generally been regarded in popular opinion as degenerate variants or [[dialect]]s of their parent languages. Because of that prejudice, many of the creoles that arose in the European colonies, having been stigmatized, have become [[Extinct language|extinct]]. However, political and academic changes in recent decades have improved the status of creoles, both as living languages and as object of linguistic study.<ref name=DeCamp>{{Harvcoltxt|DeCamp|1977}}</ref><ref name=Sebba>{{Harvcoltxt|Sebba|1997}}</ref> Some creoles have even been granted the status of official or semi-official languages of particular political territories.\n\nLinguists now recognize that creole formation is a universal phenomenon, not limited to the European colonial period, and an important aspect of language evolution (see {{Harvcoltxt|Vennemann|2003}}). For example, in 1933 [[Sigmund Feist]] postulated [[Germanic substrate hypothesis|a creole origin]] for the [[Germanic languages]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feist|first=Sigmund|date=1932|title=The Origin of the Germanic Languages and the Indo-Europeanising of North Europe|jstor=408831|journal=Language|volume=8|issue=4|pages=245\u2013254|doi=10.2307/408831}}</ref>\n\nOther scholars, such as [[Salikoko Mufwene]], argue that pidgins and creoles arise independently under different circumstances, and that a pidgin need not always precede a creole nor a creole evolve from a pidgin. Pidgins, according to Mufwene, emerged in trade colonies among \"users who preserved their native vernaculars for their day-to-day interactions.\" Creoles, meanwhile, developed in settlement colonies in which speakers of a European language, often [[indentured servants]] whose language would be far from the standard in the first place, interacted extensively with non-European [[slave]]s, absorbing certain words and features from the slaves' non-European native languages, resulting in a heavily [[basilect]]alized version of the original language. These servants and slaves would come to use the creole as an everyday vernacular, rather than merely in situations in which contact with a speaker of the superstrate was necessary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/mufwene/pidginCreoleLanguage.html |first=Salikoko |last=Mufwene |title=Pidgin and Creole Languages |website=Humanities.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2010-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603044826/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/faculty/mufwene/pidginCreoleLanguage.html |archive-date=2013-06-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Etymology===\nThe English term ''creole'' comes from [[wiktionary:cr\u00e9ole|French]] {{Lang-fr|cr\u00e9ole|label=none}}, which is cognate with the [[wiktionary:criollo|Spanish term]] {{Lang-es|criollo|label=none}} and [[wiktionary:crioulo|Portuguese]] {{Lang-pt|crioulo|label=none}}, all descending from the verb ''criar'' ('to breed' or 'to raise'), all coming from Latin {{Lang-la|creare|label=none}} ('to produce, create').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Holm|1988}}.</ref> The specific sense of the term was coined in the 16th and 17th century, during the great expansion in European maritime power and trade that led to the establishment of European colonies in other continents.\n\nThe terms ''criollo'' and ''crioulo'' were originally qualifiers used throughout the Spanish and Portuguese colonies to distinguish the members of an ethnic group who were born and raised locally from those who immigrated as adults. They were most commonly applied to nationals of the colonial power, e.g. to distinguish ''[[Criollo people|espa\u00f1oles criollos]]'' (people born in the colonies from Spanish ancestors) from {{Lang-es|espa\u00f1oles peninsulares|label=none}} (those born in the Iberian Peninsula, i.e. Spain). However, in Brazil the term was also used to distinguish between ''negros crioulos'' (blacks born in Brazil from African slave ancestors) and ''negros africanos'' (born in Africa). Over time, the term and its derivatives (Creole, Kr\u00e9ol, Kreyol, [[Krey\u00f2l]], Kriol, [[Krio language|Krio]], etc.) lost the generic meaning and became the proper name of many distinct ethnic groups that developed locally from immigrant communities. Originally, therefore, the term \"creole language\" meant the speech of any of those [[creole peoples]].\n\n===Geographic distribution===\nAs a consequence of colonial European trade patterns, most of the known European-based creole languages arose in coastal areas in the equatorial belt around the world, including the [[Americas]], western [[Africa]], [[Goa]] along the west of [[India]], and along Southeast [[Asia]] up to [[Indonesia]], [[Singapore]], [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], Reunion, [[Seychelles]] and [[Oceania]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chambers|first=Douglas B.|date=2008-12-01|title=Slave trade merchants of Spanish New Orleans, 1763\u20131803: Clarifying the colonial slave trade to Louisiana in Atlantic perspective|journal=Atlantic Studies|volume=5|issue=3|pages=335\u2013346|doi=10.1080/14788810802445024|issn=1478-8810}}</ref>\n\nMany of those creoles are now extinct, but others still survive in the [[Caribbean]], the north and east coasts of [[South America]] ([[The Guyanas]]), western [[Africa]], [[Australia]] (see [[Australian Kriol language]]), and in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n[[Atlantic Creole]] languages are based on European languages with elements from African and possibly [[Amerindian languages|Amerindian]] languages. [[Indian Ocean]] Creole languages are based on European languages with elements from [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and possibly other Asian languages. There are, however, creoles like [[Nubi language|Nubi]] and [[Sango language|Sango]] that are derived solely from non-European languages.\n\n===Social and political status===\nBecause of the generally low status of the Creole peoples in the eyes of prior European colonial powers, creole languages have generally been regarded as \"degenerate\" languages, or at best as rudimentary \"dialects\" of the politically dominant parent languages. Because of this, the word \"creole\" was generally used by linguists in opposition to \"language\", rather than as a [[qualifier]] for it.<ref name=Meijer>See {{Harvcoltxt|Meijer|Muysken|1977}}.</ref>\n\nAnother factor that may have contributed to the relative neglect of creole languages in linguistics is that they do not fit the 19th-century [[neogrammarian]] \"tree model\" for the evolution of languages, and its postulated regularity of sound changes (these critics including the earliest advocates of the [[wave model (linguistics)|wave model]], [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]] and [[Hugo Schuchardt]], the forerunners of modern [[sociolinguistics]]). This controversy of the late 19th century profoundly shaped modern approaches to the [[comparative method]] in [[historical linguistics]] and in [[creolistics]].<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Meijer /><ref name=\"Traugott 1977\">{{Harvcoltxt|Traugott|1977}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Timoun Sy\u00e8j (Creole).jpg|thumb|[[Haitian Creole]] in use at car rental counter, USA]]\nBecause of social, political, and academic changes brought on by decolonization in the second half of the 20th century, creole languages have experienced revivals in the past few decades. They are increasingly being used in print and film, and in many cases, their community prestige has improved dramatically. In fact, some have been standardized, and are used in local schools and universities around the world.<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Sebba /><ref>Holm (1988, 1989) <!-- which one? --></ref> At the same time, linguists have begun to come to the realization that creole languages are in no way inferior to other languages. They now use the term \"creole\" or \"creole language\" for any language suspected to have undergone [[creolization]], terms that now imply no geographic restrictions nor ethnic prejudices.\n\nCreolization is widely thought to be a leading influence on the evolution of [[African-American English]] (AAE).  The controversy surrounding African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the American education system, as well as the past use of the word [[Ebonics (word)|''ebonics'']] to refer to it, mirrors the historical negative connotation of the word ''creole''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Robert L.|date=2016-07-25|title=The Ebonics Controversy|journal=Journal of Black Psychology|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=208\u2013214|doi=10.1177/00957984970233002}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n===Historic classification===\nAccording to their external history, four types of creoles have been distinguished: plantation creoles, fort creoles, [[Maroon (people)|maroon]] creoles, and creolized pidgins.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995|p=15}}</ref> By the very nature of a creole language, the [[phylogeny|phylogenetic]] classification of a particular creole usually is a matter of dispute; especially when the [[pidgin]] precursor and its parent tongues (which may have been other creoles or pidgins) have disappeared before they could be documented.\n\nPhylogenetic classification traditionally relies on inheritance of the lexicon, especially of \"core\" terms, and of the grammar structure. However, in creoles, the core lexicon often has mixed origin, and the grammar is largely original. For these reasons, the issue of which language is ''the'' parent of a creole \u2013 that is, whether a language should be classified as a \"French creole\", \"Portuguese creole\" or \"English creole\", etc. \u2013 often has no definitive answer, and can become the topic of long-lasting controversies, where social prejudices and political considerations may interfere with scientific discussion.<ref name=DeCamp /><ref name=Sebba /><ref name=\"Traugott 1977\" />\n\n===Substrate and superstrate===\nThe terms [[substratum|substrate]] and [[superstratum|superstrate]] are often used when two languages interact. However, the meaning of these terms is reasonably well-defined only in [[second language acquisition]] or [[language shift|language replacement]] events, when the native speakers of a certain source language (the substrate) are somehow compelled to abandon it for another target language (the superstrate).<ref name=Weinreich>{{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1953}}</ref> The outcome of such an event is that erstwhile speakers of the substrate will use some version of the superstrate, at least in more formal contexts. The substrate may survive as a second language for informal conversation. As demonstrated by the fate of many replaced European languages (such as [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], [[Breton language|Breton]], and [[Venetian language|Venetian]]), the influence of the substrate on the official speech is often limited to pronunciation and a modest number of loanwords. The substrate might even disappear altogether without leaving any trace.<ref name=Weinreich />\n\nHowever, there is dispute over the extent to which the terms \"substrate\" and \"superstrate\" are applicable to the genesis or the description of creole languages.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1993}}</ref> The language replacement model may not be appropriate in creole formation contexts, where the emerging language is derived from multiple languages without any one of them being imposed as a replacement for any other.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1988}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1996}}</ref> The substratum-superstratum distinction becomes awkward when multiple superstrata must be assumed (such as in [[Papiamentu]]), when the substratum cannot be identified, or when the presence or the survival of substratal evidence is inferred from mere typological analogies.<ref name=\"Muysken 2001\"/> On the other hand, the distinction may be meaningful when the contributions of each parent language to the resulting creole can be shown to be very unequal, in a scientifically meaningful way.<ref>Recent investigations about substrates and superstrates, in creoles and other languages, includes {{Harvcoltxt|Feist|1932}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Weinreich|1953}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Jungemann|1955}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Martinet|1955}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hall|1974}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1983}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Singler|1988}}.</ref> In the literature on [[Atlantic Creole]]s, \"superstrate\" usually means European and \"substrate\" non-European or African.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}</ref>\n\n===Decreolization===\nSince creole languages rarely attain official status, the speakers of a fully formed creole may eventually feel compelled to conform their speech to one of the parent languages. This [[decreolization]] process typically brings about a [[post-creole speech continuum]] characterized by large-scale variation and [[hypercorrection]] in the language.<ref name=DeCamp />\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that creoles have a simpler grammar and more internal variability than older, more established languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/2013_APiCS/files/abstracts.html|title=Creole and pidgin language structure in cross-linguistic perspective|date=August 2013|publisher=Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology \u2013 Department of Linguistics}}</ref> However, these notions are occasionally challenged.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995|p=9}}</ref> (See also [[language complexity]].)\n\nPhylogenetic or [[linguistic typology|typological]] comparisons of creole languages have led to divergent conclusions. Similarities are usually higher among creoles derived from related languages, such as the [[languages of Europe]], than among broader groups that include also creoles based on non-[[Indo-European languages]] (like Nubi or Sango). [[French-based creole languages|French-based creoles]] in turn are more similar to each other (and to varieties of French) than to other European-based creoles. It was observed, in particular, that [[definite article]]s are mostly prenominal in [[English-based creole languages]] and English whereas they are generally postnominal in [[French-based creole languages|French creoles]] and in the [[Quebec French|variety of French]] that was [[History of Quebec French|exported to what is now Quebec in the 17th and 18th century]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|1998}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1995}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}}.</ref> Moreover, the European languages which gave rise to the creole languages of European colonies all belong to the same subgroup of Western [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and have highly convergent grammars; to the point that [[Sapir Whorf|Whorf]] joined them into a single [[Standard Average European]] language group.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Whorf|1956}}</ref> French and English are particularly close, since English, through extensive borrowing, is typologically closer to French than to other Germanic languages.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bailey|Maroldt|1977}}</ref> Thus the claimed similarities between creoles may be mere consequences of similar parentage, rather than characteristic features of all creoles.\n\n==Creole genesis==\nThere are a variety of theories on the origin of creole languages, all of which attempt to explain the similarities among them. {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} outline a fourfold classification of explanations regarding creole genesis:\n* Theories focusing on European input\n* Theories focusing on non-European input\n* Gradualist and developmental hypotheses\n* Universalist approaches\n\nIn addition to the precise mechanism of creole genesis, a more general debate has developed whether creole languages are characterized by different mechanisms in opposition to traditional languages (which is McWhorter's 2018 main point)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Creole Debate|last=McWhorter|first=John|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=3}}</ref> or whether in that regard creole languages develop by the same mechanisms as any other languages (e.g. DeGraff 2001).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DeGraff|first=Michael|date=2001|title=On the origin of creoles|url=|journal=Linguistic Typology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \n\n===Theories focusing on European input===\n====Monogenetic theory of pidgins and creoles====\nThe [[monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] of pidgins and creoles hypothesizes that they are all derived from a single [[Mediterranean Lingua Franca]], via a West African Pidgin Portuguese of the seventeenth century, [[relexification|relexified]] in the so-called \"slave factories\" of Western Africa that were the source of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. This theory was originally formulated by [[Hugo Schuchardt]] in the late nineteenth century and popularized in the late 1950s and early 1960s by Taylor,<ref>such as in {{Harvcoltxt|Taylor|1977}}</ref> Whinnom,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Whinnom|1956}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Whinnom|1965}}</ref> Thompson,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1961}}</ref> and Stewart.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Stewart|1962}}</ref>  However, this hypothesis is no longer actively investigated, as there are examples of creoles, such as [[Hezhou language|Hezhou]], which evidently have nothing to do with the Lingua Franca.\n\n====Domestic origin hypothesis====\nProposed by {{Harvcoltxt|Hancock |1985}} for the origin of English-based creoles of the West Indies, the Domestic Origin Hypothesis argues that, towards the end of the 16th century, English-speaking traders began to settle in the Gambia and [[Sierra Leone]] rivers as well as in neighboring areas such as the Bullom and Sherbro coasts. These settlers intermarried with the local population leading to mixed populations, and, as a result of this intermarriage, an English pidgin was created. This pidgin was learned by slaves in slave depots, who later on took it to the West Indies and formed one component of the emerging English creoles.\n\n====European dialect origin hypothesis====\nThe [[French-based creole languages|French creoles]] are the foremost candidates to being the outcome of \"normal\" [[language change|linguistic change]] and their [[creoleness]] to be sociohistoric in nature and relative to their colonial origin.<ref>There are some similarities in this line of thinking with [[Ian F. Hancock|Hancock's]] domestic origin hypothesis.</ref> Within this theoretical framework, a [[French-based creole languages|French creole]] is a language [[phylogenetic]]ally based on [[French language|French]], more specifically on a 17th-century [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] French extant in [[Paris]], the French Atlantic harbours, and the nascent French colonies. Supporters of this hypothesis suggest that the non-Creole French dialects still spoken in many parts of the Americas share mutual descent from this single koin\u00e9. These dialects are found in [[Canada]] (mostly in [[Qu\u00e9bec]] and in [[Acadian]] communities), [[Louisiana]], [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy]] and as [[Language isolate|isolates]] in other parts of the Americas.<ref>Wittmann (1983, 1995, 2001), {{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|1998}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Fournier|Wittmann|1995}}; cf. the article on Quebec French and the History of Quebec French</ref> Approaches under this hypothesis are compatible with [[gradualism]] in [[Language change|change]] and models of [[Creole language#Imperfect L2 learning|imperfect language transmission]] in [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] genesis.\n\n====Foreigner talk and baby talk====\nThe Foreigner Talk (FT) hypothesis argues that a pidgin or creole language forms when native speakers attempt to simplify their language in order to address speakers who do not know their language at all. Because of the similarities found in this type of speech and speech directed to a small child, it is also sometimes called [[baby talk]].<ref>See, for example, {{Harvcoltxt|Ferguson|1971}}</ref>\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}} suggest that four different processes are involved in creating Foreigner Talk:\n* Accommodation\n* Imitation\n* Telegraphic condensation\n* Conventions\n\nThis could explain why creole languages have much in common, while avoiding a monogenetic model. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Hinnenkamp|1984}}, in analyzing German Foreigner Talk, claims that it is too inconsistent and unpredictable to provide any model for language learning.\n\nWhile the simplification of input was supposed to account for creoles' simple grammar, commentators have raised a number of criticisms of this explanation:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|p=73}}</ref>\n# There are a great many grammatical similarities amongst pidgins and creoles despite having very different [[lexifier]] languages.<!-- That is actually a fiercely debated point, see elsewhere in the article -->\n# Grammatical simplification can be explained by other processes, i.e. the innate grammar of [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] [[language bioprogram theory]].<!-- This theory is highly controversial and presupposes the acceptance of some form of psychological nativism \u2013 which most non-Chomskyan linguists reject -->\n# Speakers of a creole's lexifier language often fail to understand, without learning the language, the grammar of a pidgin or creole.\n# Pidgins are more often used amongst speakers of different substrate languages than between such speakers and those of the lexifier language.\n\nAnother problem with the FT explanation is its potential circularity. {{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1933}} points out that FT is often based on the imitation of the incorrect speech of the non-natives, that is the pidgin.<!-- Non-native speech is not necessarily pidgin at all! --> Therefore, one may be mistaken in assuming that the former gave rise to the latter.\n\n====Imperfect L2 learning====\nThe imperfect L2 ([[second language]]) learning hypothesis claims that pidgins are primarily the result of the imperfect L2 learning of the dominant lexifier language by the slaves. Research on naturalistic L2 processes has revealed a number of features of \"interlanguage systems\" that are also seen in pidgins and creoles:\n* invariant verb forms derived from the infinitive or the least marked finite verb form;\n* loss of determiners or use as determiners of demonstrative pronouns, adjectives or adverbs;\n* placement of a negative particle in preverbal position;\n* use of adverbs to express modality;\n* fixed single word order with no inversion in questions;\n* reduced or absent nominal plural marking.\n\nImperfect L2 learning is compatible with other approaches, notably the European dialect origin hypothesis and the universalist models of language transmission.<ref>Based on 19th-century intuitions, approaches underlying the imperfect L2 learning hypothesis have been followed up in the works of {{Harvcoltxt|Schumann|1978}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Anderson|1983}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Seuren|Wekker|1986}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Geeslin|2002}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Hamilton|Coslett|2008}}.</ref>\n\n===Theories focusing on non-European input===\nTheories focusing on the substrate, or non-European, languages attribute similarities amongst creoles to the similarities of African substrate languages. These features are often assumed to be transferred from the substrate language to the creole or to be preserved invariant from the substrate language in the creole through a process of [[relexification]]: the substrate language replaces the native [[lexical items]] with lexical material from the superstrate language while retaining the native grammatical categories.<ref>See the article on [[relexification]] for a discussion of the controversy surrounding the retaining of substrate grammatical features through relexification.</ref> The problem with this explanation is that the postulated substrate languages differ amongst themselves and with creoles in meaningful ways. {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1981}} argues that the number and diversity of African languages and the paucity of a historical record on creole genesis makes determining lexical correspondences a matter of chance. {{Harvcoltxt|Dillard|1970}} coined the term \"cafeteria principle\" to refer to the practice of arbitrarily attributing features of creoles to the influence of substrate African languages or assorted substandard dialects of European languages.\n\nFor a representative debate on this issue, see the contributions to {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|1993}}; for a more recent view, {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall |2000}}.\n\nBecause of the sociohistoric similarities amongst many (but by no means all) of the creoles, the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the plantation system of the European colonies have been emphasized as factors by linguists such as {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1999}}.\n\n===Gradualist and developmental hypotheses===\nOne class of creoles might start as [[pidgin]]s, rudimentary second languages improvised for use between speakers of two or more non-intelligible native languages. Keith Whinnom (in {{Harvcoltxt|Hymes|1971}}) suggests that pidgins need three languages to form, with one (the superstrate) being clearly dominant over the others. The lexicon of a pidgin is usually small and drawn from the vocabularies of its speakers, in varying proportions. Morphological details like word [[inflection]]s, which usually take years to learn, are omitted; the syntax is kept very simple, usually based on strict word order. In this initial stage, all aspects of the speech \u2013 syntax, lexicon, and pronunciation \u2013 tend to be quite variable, especially with regard to the speaker's background.\n\nIf a pidgin manages to be learned by the children of a community as a native language, it may become fixed and acquire a more complex grammar, with fixed phonology, syntax, morphology, and syntactic embedding. Pidgins can become full languages in only a single [[generation]]. \"Creolization\" is this second stage where the pidgin language develops into a fully developed native language. The vocabulary, too, will develop to contain more and more items according to a rationale of lexical enrichment.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wardhaugh|2002|pp=56\u201357}}</ref>\n\n===Universalist approaches===\n{{Further|Universal grammar}}\n[[linguistic universal| Universalist]] models stress the intervention of specific general processes during the transmission of language from generation to generation and from speaker to speaker. The process invoked varies: a general tendency towards [[semantic]] [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], first-[[language learning]] driven by universal process, or a general process of [[discourse]] [[organization]]. [[Derek Bickerton|Bickerton's]] [[language bioprogram theory]], proposed in the 1980s, remains the main universalist theory.<ref>\nSee {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1981}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1984}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1988}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1991}}\n</ref>\nBickerton claims that creoles are inventions of the children growing up on newly-founded [[plantations]]. Around them, they only heard pidgins spoken, without enough structure to function as [[natural language]]s; and the children used their own [[innate]] linguistic capacities to transform the pidgin input into a full-fledged language. The alleged common features of all creoles would then stem from those innate abilities being universal.\n\n==Recent studies==\nThe last decades have seen the emergence of some new questions about the nature of creoles: in particular, the question of how complex creoles are and the question of whether creoles are indeed \"exceptional\" languages.\n\n===Creole prototype===\nSome features that distinguish creole languages from noncreoles have been proposed (by Bickerton,<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Bickerton|1983}}</ref> for example).\n\n[[John McWhorter]]<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}} and {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2005}}</ref> has proposed the following list of features to indicate a '''creole prototype''':\n* a lack of inflectional morphology (other than at most two or three inflectional affixes),\n* a lack of tone on monosyllabic words, and\n* a lack of semantically opaque word formation.\n\nMcWhorter hypothesizes that these three properties exactly characterize a creole. However, the creole prototype hypothesis has been disputed:\n* [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and David {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} argue that languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Soninke]], [[Magoua|Magoua French]] and [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] have all these three features but show none of the sociohistoric traits of creole languages.\n* Others (see overview in {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}}) have demonstrated creoles that serve as counterexamples to McWhorter's hypothesis \u2013 the existence of [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], for example, or [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law |2001}}</ref>\n\n===Exceptionalism===\nBuilding up on this discussion, McWhorter proposed that \"the world's simplest grammars are Creole grammars\", claiming that every noncreole language's grammar is at least as complex as any creole language's grammar.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2005}}</ref> Gil has replied that [[Riau Indonesian]] has a simpler grammar than [[Saramaccan]], the language McWhorter uses as a showcase for his theory.<ref name=\"Gil 2001\"/> The same objections were raised by Wittmann in his 1999 debate with McWhorter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html|title=Prototype as a Typological Yardstick to Creoleness|website=www.nou-la.org}}</ref>\n\nThe lack of progress made in defining creoles in terms of their morphology and syntax has led scholars such as [[Robert Chaudenson]], [[Salikoko Mufwene]], [[Michel DeGraff]], and [[Henri Wittmann]] to question the value of ''creole'' as a typological class; they argue that creoles are structurally no different from any other language, and that ''creole'' is a sociohistoric concept \u2013 not a linguistic one \u2013 encompassing displaced populations and slavery.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}}, Wittmann (2001)</ref>\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Thomason|Kaufman|1988}} spell out the idea of creole exceptionalism, claiming that creole languages are an instance of nongenetic language change due to language shift with abnormal transmission. Gradualists question the abnormal transmission of languages in a creole setting and argue that the processes which created today's creole languages are no different from universal patterns of language change.\n\nGiven these objections to ''creole'' as a concept, DeGraff and others question the idea that creoles are exceptional in any meaningful way.<ref name=\"DeGraff 2003\" /><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|2007}}</ref> Additionally, {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2002}} argues that some [[Romance language]]s are potential creoles but that they are not considered as such by linguists because of a historical bias against such a view.\n\n==Controversy==\nCreolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be [[creole (language)|creole]]s, what {{Harvcoltxt|Schneider|1990}} calls \"the [[cline (linguistics)|cline]] of creoleness.\"  No consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is [[prototypical]] or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause.\n\n===\"Creole\", a sociohistoric concept===\n''Creoleness'' is at the heart of the controversy with [[John McWhorter]]<ref>As in {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}</ref> and Mikael Parkvall{{sfnp|Parkvall|2001}} opposing [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and [[Michel DeGraff]].<ref>As in {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2005}}</ref> In McWhorter's definition, creoleness is a matter of degree, in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness: little or no [[inflection]], little or no [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]; In McWhorter's view, less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this [[prototype]]. Along these lines, McWhorter defines [[Haitian Creole]], exhibiting all three traits, as \"the most creole of creoles.\"{{sfnp|McWhorter|1998|p=809}} A creole like [[Palenquero]], on the other hand, would be less prototypical, given the presence of inflection to mark plural, past, gerund, and participle forms.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2000}} Objections to the McWhorter-Parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological [[parameters]] of creoleness can be found in languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Sooninke]], and [[Magoua]] [[French language|French]] which are not considered creoles. Wittmann and DeGraff come to the conclusion that efforts to conceive a [[yardstick]] for measuring [[creoleness]] in any scientifically meaningful way have failed so far.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1999}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2003}} {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} comes to the same conclusion for [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}} have adduced evidence as to creole languages which respond unexpectedly to one of McWhorter's three features (for example, [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]]). {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|2001}} have argued further that Creole languages are structurally no different from any other language, and that Creole is in fact a sociohistoric concept (and not a linguistic one), encompassing displaced population and slavery. {{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|Walicek|2005}} discuss creolistics in relation to [[colonialism|colonialist]] ideologies, rejecting the notion that Creoles can be responsibly defined in terms of specific grammatical characteristics. They discuss the history of linguistics and nineteenth-century work that argues for the consideration of the sociohistorical contexts in which Creole languages emerged.\n\n===\"Creole\", a genuine linguistic concept===\nOn the other hand, McWhorter points out that in languages such as Bambara, essentially a dialect of Manding, there is ample non-transparent derivation, and that there is no reason to suppose that this would be absent in close relatives such as Mandinka itself.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|p=16}} Moreover, he also observes that Soninke has what all linguists would analyze as inflections, and that current lexicography of Soninke is too elementary for it to be stated with authority that it does not have non-transparent derivation.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|pp=35, 369}} Meanwhile, Magoua French, as described by Henri Wittmann, retains some indication of grammatical gender, which qualifies as inflection, and it also retains non-transparent derivation.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1996}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}} as interpreted by {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}.</ref> Michel DeGraff's argument has been that Haitian Creole retains non-transparent derivation from French.\n\nTo the defense of DeGraff and Wittmann it must be said that McWhorter's 2005 book is a collection of previously published papers and that it contains nothing on \"defining creole\", Manding, Sooninke or Magoua that wasn't already known when DeGraff and Wittmann published their critiques as can be seen from their published debate.<ref>[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R6278&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133249/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R6278&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R12834&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133212/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R12834&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R14907&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133219/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R14907&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R20843&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133224/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R20843&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R21590&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133229/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&L=CREOLIST&P=R21590&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&L=CREOLIST&P=R4629&D=0&I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133259/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&L=CREOLIST&P=R4629&D=0&I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} Also see the list at the end of [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html]</ref> As it is, McWhorter's book does not offer anything new by the way of analysis of Manding, Soninke, or Magoua that wasn't already debated on in his exchange with Wittmann on Creolist. The issues in question are, at this point, unresolved as to sustaining McWhorter's hypotheses in any significant way though DeGraff's 2005 contribution addresses their weaknesses as far as Haitian Creole is concerned adding new evidence against. The only conclusion possibly so far as the typological differences between Manding, Soninke, Magoua and Haitian are concerned is that their comparative data do not confirm McWhorter's yardstick approach to defining creole.\n\n===Proposed synthesis===\nThe answer might be that creoleness is better described and referred to as a syndrome. In some cases, the modified source language might be the [[substratum|substrate]] language when warranted by a [[homogeneous]] substrate.{{sfnp|Singler|1988}} In other cases, the modified source language clearly is what [[creolist]]s identify as the [[superstrate]] language'{{sfnp|Wittmann|2001}} and in still other cases, no single source language might be identifiable.{{sfnp|DeGraff|2001}}  The same approach must be applied to identifying individual features as inherited or non-inherited and to distilling the defining grounds which separate creole languages from [[mixed language]]s such as [[Michif]], especially when [[relexification]] is somehow claimed to be a moving factor.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1973}}{{sfnp|Singler|1996}}{{sfnp|Wittmann|Fournier|1996}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2002}}\n\nThe answer might also be, however, that creole languages (i.e. like Haitian Creole) are indeed a unique in terms of the perspective that they offer on the human language competence in terms of the nature of their grammars though there have been no new responses to the counter-claims of DeGraff and Wittmann that would warrant the reopening of the debate as for now. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|Lim|2007}} critically assesses the proposal that creole languages exist as a homogeneous structural type with shared and/ or peculiar origins.\n\nThough the call for a sane approach to creolistics goes back to {{Harvcoltxt|Giv\u00f3n|1979}}, the first unbiased overview of the scientifically meaningful characteristics of creole languages must go to the credit of {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}. In their account of approaches to creole genesis, they group theories into four categories:\n\n:* ''Theories focusing on the [[Europe]]an input''\n:* ''Theories focusing on the non-European input''\n:* ''[[Gradualist]] and [[Developmental linguistics|developmental]] hypotheses''\n:* ''[[Universalist]] approaches''\n\nThe authors also confine [[Pidgins]] and [[mixed languages]] into

Three of the four are perpendicular to [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], crossing at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] (Broadway Main Line), Lafayette Street (Lexington Avenue Line) and Centre Street (Nassau Street Line). The Broadway-Manhattan Bridge Line platforms are directly underneath Canal Street itself. The Bridge Line platforms serve as transfer passageways between all other lines. After leaving Canal Street, the Manhattan Bridge Line makes a hard right onto Broadway.\n\nThe complex was fully renovated between 1999 and 2004. The Broadway Main Line station was restored to its original look with new mosaics featuring [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, reflecting the station's location in Chinatown. The symbols on the red wall plaques mean \"money\" and \"luck\" and the \"Canal Street\" name tablet has ideographs that read \"China\" and \"Town.\" The platform walls also feature the station's name translated into Chinese characters ({{lang-zh|t=\u5805\u5c3c\u8857\u83ef\u57e0|p=Ji\u0101n n\u00ed ji\u0113 hu\u00e1 b\u00f9}}) During the most recent renovation in the 1990s, the original mosaics were uncovered but then either removed or covered over again.

There are also [[Independent Subway System|IND]]-type \"To Canal Street\" signs. New lights were installed. Non-original name tables and small \"C\" mosaics exist.\n\nEach platform has its own [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] elevator (outside [[fare control]]) that leads to either northern corner of Canal and Lafayette Streets. These elevators were installed when the complex was renovated in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The northbound platform's elevator leads to the northeastern corner of that intersection, while the southbound platform's elevator leads to the northwestern corner. Because the elevators are outside fare control, there is no free ADA-accessible transfer between the northbound and the southbound platforms; however, both of the IRT platforms are connected to the BMT Bridge Line platforms, and thus to each other and to the rest of the complex, via stairways.\n\n=== Image gallery ===\n<gallery perrow=4>\nFile:Canal Street IRT 1905.jpg|The station used to have skylights to let natural light in (1905)\nFile:Canal Street IR 001.JPG|Terra-cotta plaque by Heins & LaFarge / [[A.

Formerly, Canal Street resembled a typical express station except that the inner tracks dead-ended at [[bumper block]]s at the south end with a platform-level connection joining the southern ends of the two platforms. These stub-end tracks were last used in the early-1990s, when the station served as the southern terminus for weekend '''[[J (New York City Subway service)|J]]''' trains, and were rendered useless when weekend '''J''' service was extended to [[Chambers Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Chambers Street]] in January 1994.\n\nAfter a reconfiguration of the Nassau Street Line in 2004, the eastern (former \"northbound\") platform was abandoned and now used as a storage area and the platform-level connection was removed, allowing the former southbound express track to continue south. The westernmost (former \"southbound\") platform remains in operation and both tracks provide through service with southbound traffic using the former southbound \"local\" track and northbound traffic using the former southbound \"express\" track. The former northbound local track is now used only for non-revenue moves, train storage and emergencies while the northbound express stub track was removed. The former northbound \"local\" track merges with the former southbound \"express\" track (the latter of which is currently the northbound track) south of the station.<ref name=\"tracks\">{{NYCS const|trackref|469}}</ref>\n\nThis station was completed at the end of 1909 and included a bridge over the proposed Canal Street subway to cross underneath. The completed portion of the Canal Street subway is now the Manhattan Bridge Line platforms.<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/Canal.platf.jpg From the Abandoned Stations website: ''A Public Service Commission photo from 1909 shows the east platform with non-tiled steel columns. The view is looking south, showing the wall between the center tracks. The stepped structure at the base of wall near the image center is part of the bridge over the projected Canal St subway, not even begun at the time. The station looks completed, about four years before it opened. There is a rough strip near the platform edge.

Only the outer local tracks, provide through service via the [[Montague Street Tunnel]]. The center tracks, which have never seen revenue service, begin at the unused lower level of [[City Hall (BMT Broadway Line)|City Hall]] and run north to here, dead-ending at [[bumper block]]s about two-thirds of the way through. The center tracks can be used for layups, but this use has been completely made redundant with the nearby City Hall lower level being used as a layup yard instead.<ref name=\"tracks\"/>\n\nAs part of the [[Dual Contracts]], these center tracks were to have continued up Broadway, fed by traffic from [[Brooklyn]] and the [[Montague Street Tunnel]]; local service was to have terminated at the upper level of City Hall. That plan was dropped prior to the line's completion. A new plan favored local service via City Hall's upper level, reconstruction south of that station to join the local tracks with the rest of the line and express service via the [[Manhattan Bridge]]. Thus, City Hall's lower level was abandoned during construction and never placed in service. Today, just north of this station, the actual express tracks coming off the Manhattan Bridge curve north, rise up and replace the stub-end center tracks from City Hall's lower level.\n\nIn the late 1960s, New York City Transit extended the platforms for 10 car trains. The Main Line station was overhauled in the late 1970s. The original trim lines were replaced with white cinderblock tiles, except for small recesses in the walls, which contained blue-painted cinderblock tiles. The staircases were repaired and new platform edges were installed. The blue cinderblock field contained the station-name signs and white text pointing to the exits. The renovation also replaced [[incandescent lighting]] with [[fluorescent lighting]].\n\nIn 2001, the upper level received a major overhaul before the Bridge level reopened. Among the repairs included the staircases, re-tiling for the walls, new tiling on the floors, upgrading the station's lights and the public address system, installing [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] yellow safety treads along the platform edges, new signs, and new track beds in both directions.\n\n{{-|left}}\n\n=== {{Anchor|BMT Manhattan Bridge Line platforms}}Bridge Line platforms (lower level) ===\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{Routemap\n|title=Track layout\n|title-bg=#{{NYCS color|Broadway}}\n|style=margin-left:10px;margin-top:10px;float:right;\n|legend =track\n|map=\nuexvENDEa ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|Unbuilt Canal St.|crosstown line}}\n\\uexvSTR!~uvSTR+l\\uvSTRq!~MFADEfq ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|to [[Prince Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Prince St]] (local)|or [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (BMT Broadway Line)|14 St]] (express)}}\n\\uvSTRfg\\numN045\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\nuvSTRfg\nuvSTR!~MFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|to [[DeKalb Avenue (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|DeKalb Av]] (Brighton Line)|or [[Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Atlantic Av]] (4th Av Line)}}\n}}\n}}\n'''Canal Street''' on the Manhattan Bridge route has two tracks and two [[side platform]]s. When it originally opened, this station was known as '''Broadway'''. Although technically located on the BMT Broadway Line, it was originally a distinct station from the main line, as the two stations were not directly connected. It is located on the lower level and oriented perpendicular to the other portions of the complex. East of the station, the tracks cross the south side of the [[Manhattan Bridge]] to enter [[Brooklyn]]. West of the station, the bridge tracks curve to the north, and ramp up between the tracks from the local upper level platform to form the express tracks.\n\nUnder the [[Dual Contracts]], this station was meant to be part of a crosstown line under Canal Street, running from the Manhattan Bridge to the [[Hudson River]], or towards West Street; however, prior to the opening of the Broadway Line, the [[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]] decided to route Manhattan Bridge traffic to the Broadway express tracks instead. After the lower level tracks curve north from the Bridge Line platforms, the tunnel continues straight ahead, past the diverge to the main line. The [[Bellmouth (railroad terminology)|bellmouths]] going westward from the west end of the station are a provision from the original plans and run for about 100 feet. Also, sitting on one of the trackways is a storage building.\n\nThe original tile on this station read simply \"Broadway\" and there was a small either wood or metal sign attached to the wall beneath the tile name that read \"Canal Street.\" Like the Main Line station, the Manhattan Bridge platforms were overhauled in the late 1970s. It received similar improvements, including blue-painted cinderblock tiles, new staircases and platform edges, and new lighting.\n\nWith the exception of three months in 1990, train service to these platforms was suspended from 1988 to 2001 during the [[Manhattan Bridge#History|Manhattan Bridge reconstruction project]]. The platforms remained open for passengers transferring between the other routes, since they were the only connections between the other platforms in the complex. Service between Manhattan and Brooklyn was redirected to the Main Line platforms and used the [[Montague Street Tunnel]]. The three-month period was supposed to have allowed train service while work on the bridge was not being done, but on December 27, 1990, the discovery of missing steel plates and corrosion that threatened the bridge's integrity halted this service.<ref name=NYT-Hevesi>{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Hevesi |title=Hazards Halt Manhattan Bridge Subway Line |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/28/nyregion/hazards-halt-manhattan-bridge-subway-line.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 28, 1990 |accessdate=March 18, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=NYT-SimsJan8>{{cite news |first=Calvin |last=Sims |title=New York Reopened Bridge Subway Line In Spite of Warnings |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/08/nyregion/new-york-reopened-bridge-subway-line-in-spite-of-warnings.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 8, 1991 |accessdate=March 18, 2010 }}</ref> In 1997, a temporary art exhibit known as the ''Canal Street Canal'' by [[Alexander Brodsky]], was installed on the northbound trackway.

Three of the four are perpendicular to [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]], crossing at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] (Broadway Main Line), Lafayette Street (Lexington Avenue Line) and Centre Street (Nassau Street Line). The Broadway-Manhattan Bridge Line platforms are directly underneath Canal Street itself. The Bridge Line platforms serve as transfer passageways between all other lines. After leaving Canal Street, the Manhattan Bridge Line makes a hard right onto Broadway.\n\nThe complex was fully renovated between 1999 and 2004. The Broadway Main Line station was restored to its original look with new mosaics featuring [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, reflecting the station's location in Chinatown. The symbols on the red wall plaques mean \"money\" and \"luck\" and the \"Canal Street\" name tablet has ideographs that read \"China\" and \"Town.\" The platform walls also feature the station's name translated into Chinese characters ({{lang-zh|t=\u5805\u5c3c\u8857\u83ef\u57e0|p=Ji\u0101n n\u00ed ji\u0113 hu\u00e1 b\u00f9}}) During the most recent renovation in the 1990s, the original mosaics were uncovered but then either removed or covered over again.

The original portion has tile-covered [[I-beam]]s with small and large mosaics and an ornamental ceiling. The newer portion has 1950s green tile at the end of the platforms. There are also [[Independent Subway System|IND]]-type \"To Canal Street\" signs. New lights were installed. Non-original name tables and small \"C\" mosaics exist.\n\nEach platform has its own [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA-accessible]] elevator (outside [[fare control]]) that leads to either northern corner of Canal and Lafayette Streets. These elevators were installed when the complex was renovated in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The northbound platform's elevator leads to the northeastern corner of that intersection, while the southbound platform's elevator leads to the northwestern corner. Because the elevators are outside fare control, there is no free ADA-accessible transfer between the northbound and the southbound platforms; however, both of the IRT platforms are connected to the BMT Bridge Line platforms, and thus to each other and to the rest of the complex, via stairways.\n\n=== Image gallery ===\n<gallery perrow=4>\nFile:Canal Street IRT 1905.jpg|The station used to have skylights to let natural light in (1905)\nFile:Canal Street IR 001.JPG|Terra-cotta plaque by Heins & LaFarge / [[A.

Formerly, Canal Street resembled a typical express station except that the inner tracks dead-ended at [[bumper block]]s at the south end with a platform-level connection joining the southern ends of the two platforms. These stub-end tracks were last used in the early-1990s, when the station served as the southern terminus for weekend '''[[J (New York City Subway service)|J]]''' trains, and were rendered useless when weekend '''J''' service was extended to [[Chambers Street (BMT Nassau Street Line)|Chambers Street]] in January 1994.\n\nAfter a reconfiguration of the Nassau Street Line in 2004, the eastern (former \"northbound\") platform was abandoned and now used as a storage area and the platform-level connection was removed, allowing the former southbound express track to continue south. The westernmost (former \"southbound\") platform remains in operation and both tracks provide through service with southbound traffic using the former southbound \"local\" track and northbound traffic using the former southbound \"express\" track. The former northbound local track is now used only for non-revenue moves, train storage and emergencies while the northbound express stub track was removed. The former northbound \"local\" track merges with the former southbound \"express\" track (the latter of which is currently the northbound track) south of the station.<ref name=\"tracks\">{{NYCS const|trackref|469}}</ref>\n\nThis station was completed at the end of 1909 and included a bridge over the proposed Canal Street subway to cross underneath. The completed portion of the Canal Street subway is now the Manhattan Bridge Line platforms.<ref>http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/Canal.platf.jpg From the Abandoned Stations website: ''A Public Service Commission photo from 1909 shows the east platform with non-tiled steel columns. The view is looking south, showing the wall between the center tracks. The stepped structure at the base of wall near the image center is part of the bridge over the projected Canal St subway, not even begun at the time. The station looks completed, about four years before it opened. There is a rough strip near the platform edge.

Only the outer local tracks, provide through service via the [[Montague Street Tunnel]]. The center tracks, which have never seen revenue service, begin at the unused lower level of [[City Hall (BMT Broadway Line)|City Hall]] and run north to here, dead-ending at [[bumper block]]s about two-thirds of the way through. The center tracks can be used for layups, but this use has been completely made redundant with the nearby City Hall lower level being used as a layup yard instead.<ref name=\"tracks\"/>\n\nAs part of the [[Dual Contracts]], these center tracks were to have continued up Broadway, fed by traffic from [[Brooklyn]] and the [[Montague Street Tunnel]]; local service was to have terminated at the upper level of City Hall. That plan was dropped prior to the line's completion. A new plan favored local service via City Hall's upper level, reconstruction south of that station to join the local tracks with the rest of the line and express service via the [[Manhattan Bridge]]. Thus, City Hall's lower level was abandoned during construction and never placed in service. Today, just north of this station, the actual express tracks coming off the Manhattan Bridge curve north, rise up and replace the stub-end center tracks from City Hall's lower level.\n\nIn the late 1960s, New York City Transit extended the platforms for 10 car trains. The Main Line station was overhauled in the late 1970s. The original trim lines were replaced with white cinderblock tiles, except for small recesses in the walls, which contained blue-painted cinderblock tiles. The staircases were repaired and new platform edges were installed. The blue cinderblock field contained the station-name signs and white text pointing to the exits. The renovation also replaced [[incandescent lighting]] with [[fluorescent lighting]].\n\nIn 2001, the upper level received a major overhaul before the Bridge level reopened. Among the repairs included the staircases, re-tiling for the walls, new tiling on the floors, upgrading the station's lights and the public address system, installing [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] yellow safety treads along the platform edges, new signs, and new track beds in both directions.\n\n{{-|left}}\n\n=== {{Anchor|BMT Manhattan Bridge Line platforms}}Bridge Line platforms (lower level) ===\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{Routemap\n|title=Track layout\n|title-bg=#{{NYCS color|Broadway}}\n|style=margin-left:10px;margin-top:10px;float:right;\n|legend =track\n|map=\nuexvENDEa ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|Unbuilt Canal St.|crosstown line}}\n\\uexvSTR!~uvSTR+l\\uvSTRq!~MFADEfq ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|to [[Prince Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Prince St]] (local)|or [[14th Street\u2013Union Square (BMT Broadway Line)|14 St]] (express)}}\n\\uvSTRfg\\numN045\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\nuvSTRfg\nuvSTR!~MFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|to [[DeKalb Avenue (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|DeKalb Av]] (Brighton Line)|or [[Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Atlantic Av]] (4th Av Line)}}\n}}\n}}\n'''Canal Street''' on the Manhattan Bridge route has two tracks and two [[side platform]]s. When it originally opened, this station was known as '''Broadway'''. Although technically located on the BMT Broadway Line, it was originally a distinct station from the main line, as the two stations were not directly connected. It is located on the lower level and oriented perpendicular to the other portions of the complex. East of the station, the tracks cross the south side of the [[Manhattan Bridge]] to enter [[Brooklyn]]. West of the station, the bridge tracks curve to the north, and ramp up between the tracks from the local upper level platform to form the express tracks.\n\nUnder the [[Dual Contracts]], this station was meant to be part of a crosstown line under Canal Street, running from the Manhattan Bridge to the [[Hudson River]], or towards West Street; however, prior to the opening of the Broadway Line, the [[Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation|BMT]] decided to route Manhattan Bridge traffic to the Broadway express tracks instead. After the lower level tracks curve north from the Bridge Line platforms, the tunnel continues straight ahead, past the diverge to the main line. The [[Bellmouth (railroad terminology)|bellmouths]] going westward from the west end of the station are a provision from the original plans and run for about 100 feet. Also, sitting on one of the trackways is a storage building.\n\nThe original tile on this station read simply \"Broadway\" and there was a small either wood or metal sign attached to the wall beneath the tile name that read \"Canal Street.\" Like the Main Line station, the Manhattan Bridge platforms were overhauled in the late 1970s. It received similar improvements, including blue-painted cinderblock tiles, new staircases and platform edges, and new lighting.\n\nWith the exception of three months in 1990, train service to these platforms was suspended from 1988 to 2001 during the [[Manhattan Bridge#History|Manhattan Bridge reconstruction project]]. The platforms remained open for passengers transferring between the other routes, since they were the only connections between the other platforms in the complex. Service between Manhattan and Brooklyn was redirected to the Main Line platforms and used the [[Montague Street Tunnel]]. The three-month period was supposed to have allowed train service while work on the bridge was not being done, but on December 27, 1990, the discovery of missing steel plates and corrosion that threatened the bridge's integrity halted this service.<ref name=NYT-Hevesi>{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=Hevesi |title=Hazards Halt Manhattan Bridge Subway Line |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/28/nyregion/hazards-halt-manhattan-bridge-subway-line.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 28, 1990 |accessdate=March 18, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=NYT-SimsJan8>{{cite news |first=Calvin |last=Sims |title=New York Reopened Bridge Subway Line In Spite of Warnings |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/08/nyregion/new-york-reopened-bridge-subway-line-in-spite-of-warnings.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 8, 1991 |accessdate=March 18, 2010 }}</ref> In 1997, a temporary art exhibit known as the ''Canal Street Canal'' by [[Alexander Brodsky]], was installed on the northbound trackway.

Eleven appears to have been born [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]]. However, the use of her abilities temporarily weakens her and causes her [[nosebleeds|nose to bleed]]. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and was raised in the National Laboratory in Hawkins, Indiana as a test subject to develop her [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] skills. When placed in a [[isolation tank|sensory deprivation tank]] she can use [[Remote Viewing|remote viewing]] and access other [[parallel universes in fiction|dimension]]s, primarily for the purposes of international espionage. Eleven encounters a creature living in the Upside Down dimension, and on the evening of November 6, 1983, she finally makes contact with it. In efforts to make contact, Eleven opens a gate between the Hawkins Laboratory and the Upside Down dimension and the creature gains the ability to travel between the human world and the Upside Down.\n\nIn the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins Laboratory and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. She and the owner bond, but the owner calls social services. The responding social worker, who turns out to be a Hawkins Laboratory agent, kills the owner. Eleven flees before being taken once again. She is then found by Mike Wheeler ([[Finn Wolfhard]]), Dustin Henderson ([[Gaten Matarazzo]]) and Lucas Sinclair ([[Caleb McLaughlin]]), who are looking for their missing friend, Will Byers ([[Noah Schnapp]]). The boys learn that her name is Eleven based on a \"011\" tattoo found on her left forearm. After learning this, Mike decides to call her \"El\" for short. Mike allows Eleven to live in his basement in a blanket fort. Fearing recapture, Eleven convinces Mike not to tell any adults so the social workers will not find her.\n\nEleven helps to locate Will using her supernatural abilities, and determines that he is trapped in the Upside Down. The group sets out to find Will using their compasses, but Eleven interferes with their search when she realizes that they are being led towards the laboratory. Lucas, noticing her deception, becomes angry at her (having mistrusted her from the beginning). She flees, steals boxes of frozen waffles from a store, and consumes them in a forest. Mike and Dustin are threatened by bullies where Mike is forced to jump off a high cliff into a river with Dustin being held hostage but Eleven returns, immediately intervenes before Mike hits the water and saves both Mike and Dustin.\n\nEleven, Mike, and Dustin reunite with Lucas and make amends. They travel to the town junkyard with Dr. Brenner and his associates in close pursuit. During the chase, Eleven uses her powers to cause a laboratory van to flip through the air. The group is aided by Joyce Byers ([[Winona Ryder]]), Police Chief [[Jim Hopper (character)|Jim Hopper]] ([[David Harbour]]), [[Nancy Wheeler (character)|Nancy Wheeler]] ([[Natalia Dyer]]), and Jonathan Byers ([[Charlie Heaton]]), produce a makeshift isolation tank with a pool and bags of salt. Eleven accesses the Upside Down and confirms that Will is alive. As laboratory personnel close in on the school, Mike tells Eleven she can be a part of his family and asks her to the school dance. He then kisses her after struggling to explain his feelings towards her. Eleven helps the group escape by using her powers to kill most of the agents, although doing so leaves her drained. The monster from the Upside Down makes its way into their dimension, and Eleven seemingly sacrifices herself to destroy the creature and save her friends.\n\nOne month later, after a [[Christmas]] party, Hopper leaves the police station and drives to the woods. There, he leaves waffles in a concealed box. The whereabouts or condition of Eleven are left ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |date=July 18, 2016 |title='Stranger Things' Finale: Duffer Brothers Talk Cliffhangers, Death and Season 2 |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-duffer-brothers-interview-season-2-1201816664/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Emily |date=July 29, 2016 |title=On Stranger Things' season finale, promises are made to be broken |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/stranger-things-season-finale-promises-are-made-be-240275 |work=[[The A.V.

She escapes through a portal, leading her back to the school. With the government still searching for her, she is forced to hide in the forest. Eleven eventually finds the [[Eggos]] Hopper left for her and seeks him out. The two move into a cabin in the woods where he forbids her to leave, fearing for her safety. Hopper hides Eleven indoors for almost a year, telling no one of her whereabouts, not even Mike. During this time, Eleven gains better control over her powers; she is less weakened by the use of her telekinesis, and she is now able to project her mind without the use of a sensory deprivation tank. She uses the latter ability to listen to Mike's attempts to contact her, though she is increasingly frustrated at her inability to reply. Eleven also significantly expands her vocabulary during this time, learning from both Hopper and television.\n\nEleven becomes restless and longs to reunite with Mike, and this causes tension between her and Hopper. She runs away from home one day and travels to Hawkins Middle School. When she finds Mike, he is with Max, a new student. Eleven mistakenly thinks Max is flirting with Mike and, out of spite, uses her powers to knock her off of her skateboard before leaving. Upon returning to the cabin, she gets into a heated argument with Hopper over her leaving the cabin, ending with her using her powers to damage the cabin out of anger. The next day, cleaning the mess she made of the cabin, she discovers by looking through records in the cabin's basement her birth mother is alive, a contradiction to what Hopper had told her. She then goes to meet her birth mother, Terry, and her aunt, Becky, and discovers what happened to Terry at Hawkins Laboratory. While there, she realizes Terry is trying to talk with her, but due to her catatonic state, is unable to. Eleven, using her powers, views a flashback from her mother. Terry, after her daughter was taken from her, attempted to force her way into Hawkins Lab to save her. As a response, Brenner and his assistants captured her and subjected her to electroshock therapy, resulting in her current condition. Eleven then uses her abilities to find out she has a \"sister\"{{spaced endash}}another gifted girl taken by Dr. Brenner for experimentations{{spaced endash}}and sets out to find her.\n\nUsing her abilities once again, Eleven locates her sister and discovers that she is an older girl named Kali (\"Eight\"), with the ability to cause people to have visual hallucinations. Eleven stays with Kali and her friends{{spaced endash}}runaways who are determined to take revenge on people who have hurt them. Kali tells Eleven that while using her powers, she needs to think about what makes her most angry. When they go to get revenge on Brenner's assistant who helped hurt Eleven's mother, Eleven begins to choke him to death but stops upon realizing that he has two daughters. She then stops Kali from shooting him. Back at the hideout, Eleven witnesses Hopper and Mike in danger through the void. While the gang are about to flee, Eleven realizes she needs to go back to her friends because they need her help.\n\nEleven goes back to Hawkins and finally reunites with Mike with a heartfelt embrace and her friends after saving them from a Demodog. The group realizes that she needs to close the gate to the Upside Down, and she and Hopper head to Hawkins Laboratory. There, Eleven uses Kali's advice and focuses her anger into her powers, closing the gate and draining her powers. Afterward, it is discovered that Dr. Owens has forged a birth certificate allowing for Hopper to become her legal adoptive father as a way to help keep Eleven in hiding. Eleven's new legal name is Jane Hopper. Hopper lets her attend the Snow Ball at Hawkins Middle School. She meets up with Mike, dances with him, and they share their first kiss as a couple.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{see also|Stranger Things (season 3)}}\nAt the start of season three, Eleven and Mike have been dating for seven months, much to the dismay of Hopper, who is annoyed that El and Mike are constantly together, spending all of their time alone kissing. When Hopper confesses to Joyce that he feels uncomfortable about the situation, she asserts that he should sit down and calmly talk to El and Mike about how he feels. This backfires, however, and Hopper resorts to verbally threatening Mike to stay away from Eleven, or he will end their relationship. When Mike is forced to lie to Eleven about why he can no longer visit her, she becomes suspicious and seeks advice from Max, who asserts that Mike is pushing her aside to spend time playing games with the boys, and suggests that they have some fun of their own by going shopping at the new Starcourt mall. The girls spend quality time together, shopping, where they encounter Lucas, Will and Mike, who are attempting to buy Eleven a makeup present. When Mike lies and says the present is for his sick grandmother, Eleven angrily breaks up with him and leaves on a bus with Max, where the girls spend the night sleeping over at Hopper's house and use Eleven's telepathic powers to spy on the boys. This leads to a game they create in which they spin a bottle and spy on whoever it lands on. Eleven spies on Billy and it appears he has kidnapped someone, so the girls go to look for him and discover a fellow lifeguard has also gone missing. They discover that Billy has been taken over by the Mind Flayer. They reunite with Mike, Lucas, and Will. Mike is annoyed that El would spy on him and has an argument with Max about his feelings for Eleven while she is spying on the Flayed. She holds off the Mind Flayer when the cabin is attacked, but the Flayer wounds her and leaves a piece of itself in the wound. El and Mike make up, but the Flayer and Billy track them due to the wound. Eleven loses her powers, but the group defeat the Mind Flayer by closing the portal to the Upside Down. Hopper is presumed dead in the explosion that closes the gate and Eleven is taken in by the Byers. While the Byers are packing to leave Hawkins, El reveals to Mike that she loves him too and they share a kiss. Joyce gives her a letter written by Hopper that he intended to use when talking to her and Mike about how he felt about them dating. Eleven and the Byers then leave Hawkins.\n\n== Development ==\n\n=== Conception and writing ===\n[[The Duffer Brothers]] originally based the character of Eleven on survivors of the [[Project MKUltra]] experiments, with influences from ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' and the idea of being an outsider.

Eleven appears to have been born [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]]. However, the use of her abilities temporarily weakens her and causes her [[nosebleeds|nose to bleed]]. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and was raised in the National Laboratory in Hawkins, Indiana as a test subject to develop her [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] skills. When placed in a [[isolation tank|sensory deprivation tank]] she can use [[Remote Viewing|remote viewing]] and access other [[parallel universes in fiction|dimension]]s, primarily for the purposes of international espionage. Eleven encounters a creature living in the Upside Down dimension, and on the evening of November 6, 1983, she finally makes contact with it. In efforts to make contact, Eleven opens a gate between the Hawkins Laboratory and the Upside Down dimension and the creature gains the ability to travel between the human world and the Upside Down.\n\nIn the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins Laboratory and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. She and the owner bond, but the owner calls social services. The responding social worker, who turns out to be a Hawkins Laboratory agent, kills the owner. Eleven flees before being taken once again. She is then found by Mike Wheeler ([[Finn Wolfhard]]), Dustin Henderson ([[Gaten Matarazzo]]) and Lucas Sinclair ([[Caleb McLaughlin]]), who are looking for their missing friend, Will Byers ([[Noah Schnapp]]). The boys learn that her name is Eleven based on a \"011\" tattoo found on her left forearm. After learning this, Mike decides to call her \"El\" for short. Mike allows Eleven to live in his basement in a blanket fort. Fearing recapture, Eleven convinces Mike not to tell any adults so the social workers will not find her.\n\nEleven helps to locate Will using her supernatural abilities, and determines that he is trapped in the Upside Down. The group sets out to find Will using their compasses, but Eleven interferes with their search when she realizes that they are being led towards the laboratory. Lucas, noticing her deception, becomes angry at her (having mistrusted her from the beginning). She flees, steals boxes of frozen waffles from a store, and consumes them in a forest. Mike and Dustin are threatened by bullies where Mike is forced to jump off a high cliff into a river with Dustin being held hostage but Eleven returns, immediately intervenes before Mike hits the water and saves both Mike and Dustin.\n\nEleven, Mike, and Dustin reunite with Lucas and make amends. They travel to the town junkyard with Dr. Brenner and his associates in close pursuit. During the chase, Eleven uses her powers to cause a laboratory van to flip through the air. The group is aided by Joyce Byers ([[Winona Ryder]]), Police Chief [[Jim Hopper (character)|Jim Hopper]] ([[David Harbour]]), [[Nancy Wheeler (character)|Nancy Wheeler]] ([[Natalia Dyer]]), and Jonathan Byers ([[Charlie Heaton]]), produce a makeshift isolation tank with a pool and bags of salt. Eleven accesses the Upside Down and confirms that Will is alive. As laboratory personnel close in on the school, Mike tells Eleven she can be a part of his family and asks her to the school dance. He then kisses her after struggling to explain his feelings towards her. Eleven helps the group escape by using her powers to kill most of the agents, although doing so leaves her drained. The monster from the Upside Down makes its way into their dimension, and Eleven seemingly sacrifices herself to destroy the creature and save her friends.\n\nOne month later, after a [[Christmas]] party, Hopper leaves the police station and drives to the woods. There, he leaves waffles in a concealed box. The whereabouts or condition of Eleven are left ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |date=July 18, 2016 |title='Stranger Things' Finale: Duffer Brothers Talk Cliffhangers, Death and Season 2 |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-duffer-brothers-interview-season-2-1201816664/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Emily |date=July 29, 2016 |title=On Stranger Things' season finale, promises are made to be broken |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/stranger-things-season-finale-promises-are-made-be-240275 |work=[[The A.V.

She escapes through a portal, leading her back to the school. With the government still searching for her, she is forced to hide in the forest. Eleven eventually finds the [[Eggos]] Hopper left for her and seeks him out. The two move into a cabin in the woods where he forbids her to leave, fearing for her safety. Hopper hides Eleven indoors for almost a year, telling no one of her whereabouts, not even Mike. During this time, Eleven gains better control over her powers; she is less weakened by the use of her telekinesis, and she is now able to project her mind without the use of a sensory deprivation tank. She uses the latter ability to listen to Mike's attempts to contact her, though she is increasingly frustrated at her inability to reply. Eleven also significantly expands her vocabulary during this time, learning from both Hopper and television.\n\nEleven becomes restless and longs to reunite with Mike, and this causes tension between her and Hopper. She runs away from home one day and travels to Hawkins Middle School. When she finds Mike, he is with Max, a new student. Eleven mistakenly thinks Max is flirting with Mike and, out of spite, uses her powers to knock her off of her skateboard before leaving. Upon returning to the cabin, she gets into a heated argument with Hopper over her leaving the cabin, ending with her using her powers to damage the cabin out of anger.

The [[Rafael Guastavino]]-designed station is unique in the system for the usage of [[Romanesque Revival architecture]].\n\nThe station was built on a curve and could only accommodate five-car trains of {{convert|257|ft}}, which proved to be inefficient as subway ridership grew and trains were lengthened to 10 cars. Due to the infrastructural shortfalls, as well as its proximity to the nearby [[Brooklyn Bridge \u2013 City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Brooklyn Bridge]] station, passenger service was discontinued on December 31, 1945, although the station is still used as a turning loop for the {{NYCS trains|City Hall}}.\n\n== History ==\n{{stack|float=left|\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|width=175\n|image1=City Hall station plan.jpg|caption1=Schematic of the station\n|image2=PostcardNewYorkNYCityHallSubwayStation1913.jpg|caption2=Early postcard showing the station {{circa| 1913}}}}\n}}\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe official start of construction took place on March 24, 1900, at the front steps of City Hall, at a ceremony officiated by then-Mayor [[Robert Van Wyck]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/cityirt.html |title=Abandoned Stations : City Hall (IRT) |publisher=Columbia.edu |date=December 31, 1903 |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}</ref> After construction was complete, this station was the chosen place for hanging commemorative plaques recognizing the achievement of building the entire [[New York City Subway]] system.

In late 1998, due to perceived security risks in the area around City Hall after [[1998 United States embassy bombings|terrorist bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam]], the station was declared a \"highly secure\" area by the [[Mayoralty of Rudy Giuliani|Giuliani administration]]. Plans for the museum annex were abandoned and museum tours ceased for several years.\n\nOn the surface, all that can be seen is a concrete slab inset with glass tiles, the [[skylight (window)|skylight]]s for the platform below. This patch of concrete is in the middle of a grove of [[dogwood]]s in front of City Hall, close to [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. However, for the 2004 Centennial Celebration, one of the street entrances was restored (and presently resembles a modern station entrance), and the station was opened for the duration of the celebration.

The [[Rafael Guastavino]]-designed station is unique in the system for the usage of [[Romanesque Revival architecture]].\n\nThe station was built on a curve and could only accommodate five-car trains of {{convert|257|ft}}, which proved to be inefficient as subway ridership grew and trains were lengthened to 10 cars. Due to the infrastructural shortfalls, as well as its proximity to the nearby [[Brooklyn Bridge \u2013 City Hall (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Brooklyn Bridge]] station, passenger service was discontinued on December 31, 1945, although the station is still used as a turning loop for the {{NYCS trains|City Hall}}.\n\n== History ==\n{{stack|float=left|\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|width=175\n|image1=City Hall station plan.jpg|caption1=Schematic of the station\n|image2=PostcardNewYorkNYCityHallSubwayStation1913.jpg|caption2=Early postcard showing the station {{circa| 1913}}}}\n}}\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe official start of construction took place on March 24, 1900, at the front steps of City Hall, at a ceremony officiated by then-Mayor [[Robert Van Wyck]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/cityirt.html |title=Abandoned Stations : City Hall (IRT) |publisher=Columbia.edu |date=December 31, 1903 |accessdate=May 13, 2014}}</ref> After construction was complete, this station was the chosen place for hanging commemorative plaques recognizing the achievement of building the entire [[New York City Subway]] system.

{"title_page": "Truman Doctrine", "text_new": "[[File:HarryTruman.jpg|thumb|Presidential portrait of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry Truman]]]]\n\nThe '''Truman Doctrine''' was an American foreign policy whose stated purpose was to contain Soviet [[geopolitical]] expansion during the [[Cold War]]. It was announced to Congress by President [[Harry S. Truman]] on March 12, 1947,<ref name=DM/> and further developed on July 4, 1948, when he pledged to contain the communist uprisings in [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. Direct American military force was usually not involved, but Congress appropriated financial aid to support the economies and militaries of Greece and Turkey. More generally, the Truman Doctrine implied American support for other nations thought to be threatened by Soviet communism. The Truman Doctrine became the foundation of American foreign policy, and led, in 1949, to the formation of [[NATO]], a military alliance that is still in effect. Historians often use Truman's speech to date the start of the Cold War. \n\nTruman told Congress that \"it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Beschloss|title=Our Documents: 100 Milestone Documents From The National Archives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqDA6OGvhmUC&pg=PA194|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=194\u201399|isbn=978-0-19-530959-1}}</ref> Truman contended  that because  totalitarian regimes coerced free peoples, they automatically represented a threat to international peace and the [[national security of the United States]]. Truman made the plea in the midst of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349). He argued that if Greece and Turkey did not receive the aid, they would inevitably fall to communism with grave consequences throughout the region. Because Turkey and Greece were historic rivals, it was considered necessary to help both equally even though the crisis in  Greece was far more intense. \n\nCritics of the policy have observed that the governments of Greece and Turkey were themselves far from democratic at this time, and neither were facing Soviet subversion in the spring of 1949. Historian [[Eric Foner]] writes that the Doctrine \"set a precedent for American assistance to anticommunist regimes throughout the world, no matter how undemocratic, and for the creation of a set of global military alliances directed against the Soviet Union.\"<ref>Eric Foner, ''Give Me Liberty! An American History'' (2nd ed., 2008) p. 892</ref>\n\nFor years, the [[United Kingdom]] had supported Greece, but was now near bankruptcy and was forced to radically reduce its involvement. In February 1947, Britain formally requested for the United States to take over its role in supporting the royalist Greek government.<ref>Alan Bullock, ''Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary'' pp 368\u20139; Arnold Offner, ''Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945\u20132002'' (2002) p 197; Denise M. Bostdorff, ''Proclaiming the Truman Doctrine'' (2008) p 51</ref> The policy won the support of Republicans who controlled Congress and involved sending $400 million in American money but no military forces to the region.  The effect was to end the Greek revolt, and in 1952, both Greece and Turkey joined NATO, a military alliance, to guarantee their stability.\n\nThe Truman Doctrine was informally extended to become the basis of American Cold War policy throughout Europe and around the world.<ref name=\"MerrillTruDoct\" /> It shifted American foreign policy toward the [[Soviet Union]] from anti-fascism ally to a policy of [[containment]] of Soviet expansion as advocated by diplomat [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]. It was distinguished from [[rollback]] by implicitly tolerating the previous Soviet takeovers in Eastern Europe.\n\n== Turkish Straits crisis ==\n{{Main|Turkish Straits crisis}}\n[[File:Turkish_Strait_disambig.svg|thumb|The Turkish Straits]]\n\nAt the conclusion of World War II, Turkey was pressured by the Soviet government to allow Russian shipping to flow freely through the [[Turkish Straits]], which connected the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. As the Turkish government would not submit to the Soviet Union's requests, tensions arose in the region, leading to a show of naval force on the side of the Soviets. Since British assistance to Turkey had ended in 1947, the U.S. dispatched military aid to ensure that Turkey would retain chief control of the passage. Turkey received  $100 million in economic and military aid and the U.S sent the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt|aircraft carrier ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']]. The postwar period from 1946 started with a \"[[Multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey|multi-party period]]\" and the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]] government of [[Adnan Menderes]].<ref>Bar\u0131n Kayao\u011flu, \"Strategic imperatives, Democratic rhetoric: The United States and Turkey, 1945\u201352.\" ''Cold War History,'' Aug 2009, Vol. 9(3)  pp. 321\u2013345</ref>\n\n== Greek crisis ==\n{{Main articles | White Terror (Greece) | Greek Civil War}}\n[[File:Georgeiiofgreece.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|King [[George II of Greece]] (r. 1922\u201324, 1935\u201347), whose rule was opposed by a communist insurgency in the Greek Civil War]]\n\nSeven weeks after the [[Axis powers]] abandoned Greece in October 1944, the British helped retake Athens from the victorious [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|National Liberation Front]] (EAM), controlled effectively by the [[Communist Party of Greece|Greek Communist Party]] (KKE).

The British realized that the KKE were being directly funded by [[Josip Broz Tito]] in neighboring Yugoslavia.

In the words of historian [[James T. Patterson]], \"The Truman Doctrine was a highly publicized commitment of a sort the administration had not previously undertaken. Its sweeping rhetoric, promising that the United States should aid all 'free people' being subjugated, set the stage for innumerable later ventures that led to globalistic commitments. It was in these ways a major step.\"<ref name=JTP>{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=James T. |date=1996 |title=Grand Expectations |url=https://archive.org/details/grandexpectation00patt |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|129}}\n\nThe doctrine endured, historian Dennis Merill argues, because it addressed a broader cultural insecurity regarding modern life in a globalized world. It dealt with Washington's concern over communism's domino effect, it enabled a media-sensitive presentation of the doctrine that won [[bipartisanship|bipartisan]] support, and it mobilized American economic power to modernize and stabilize unstable regions without direct military intervention. It brought nation-building activities and modernization programs to the forefront of foreign policy.<ref name=\"MerrillTruDoct\">{{Harvnb|Merrill|2006}}.</ref> \n\nThe Truman Doctrine became a metaphor for emergency aid to keep a nation from communist influence. Truman used disease imagery not only to communicate a sense of impending disaster in the spread of communism but also to create a \"rhetorical vision\" of containing it by extending a protective shield around non-communist countries throughout the world.  It echoed the \"[[Quarantine Speech|quarantine the aggressor]]\" policy Truman's predecessor, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], had sought to impose to contain German and Japanese expansion in 1937 (\"quarantine\" suggested the role of public health officials handling an infectious disease). The medical metaphor extended beyond the immediate aims of the Truman Doctrine in that the imagery combined with fire and flood imagery evocative of disaster provided the United States with an easy transition to direct military confrontation in later years with communist forces in Korea and Vietnam. By framing ideological differences in life or death terms, Truman was able to garner support for this communism-containing policy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ivie|1999}}.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = \n |title        = Special Message to Congress on Greece and Turkey\n |description  =\n}}\n* [[Liberal internationalism]]\n* [[Eisenhower Doctrine]]\n* [[Anti-communism]]\n* [[Reverse course]]\n* [[Turkey\u2013United States relations]]\n* [[Greece-United States relations]]\n* [[Containment]]\n<!-- For formatting -->\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Beisner, Robert L.

It was announced to Congress by President [[Harry S. Truman]] on March 12, 1947,<ref name=DM/> and further developed on July 4, 1948, when he pledged to contain threats in [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]]. Direct American military force was usually not involved, but Congress appropriated financial aid to support the economies and militaries of Greece and Turkey. More generally, the Truman Doctrine implied American support for other nations thought to be threatened by Soviet communism. The Truman Doctrine became the foundation of American foreign policy, and led, in 1949, to the formation of [[NATO]], a military alliance that is still in effect. Historians often use Truman's speech to date the start of the Cold War. \n\nTruman told Congress that \"it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Michael Beschloss|title=Our Documents: 100 Milestone Documents From The National Archives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqDA6OGvhmUC&pg=PA194|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=194\u201399|isbn=978-0-19-530959-1}}</ref> Truman contended  that because  totalitarian regimes coerced free peoples, they automatically represented a threat to international peace and the [[national security of the United States]]. Truman made the plea in the midst of the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u201349). He argued that if Greece and Turkey did not receive the aid, they would inevitably fall to communism with grave consequences throughout the region. Because Turkey and Greece were historic rivals, it was considered necessary to help both equally even though the crisis in  Greece was far more intense. \n\nCritics of the policy have observed that the governments of Greece and Turkey were themselves far from democratic at this time, and neither were facing Soviet subversion in the spring of 1949. Historian [[Eric Foner]] writes that the Doctrine \"set a precedent for American assistance to anticommunist regimes throughout the world, no matter how undemocratic, and for the creation of a set of global military alliances directed against the Soviet Union.\"<ref>Eric Foner, ''Give Me Liberty! An American History'' (2nd ed., 2008) p. 892</ref>\n\nFor years, the [[United Kingdom]] had supported Greece, but was now near bankruptcy and was forced to radically reduce its involvement. In February 1947, Britain formally requested for the United States to take over its role in supporting the royalist Greek government.<ref>Alan Bullock, ''Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary'' pp 368\u20139; Arnold Offner, ''Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945\u20132002'' (2002) p 197; Denise M. Bostdorff, ''Proclaiming the Truman Doctrine'' (2008) p 51</ref> The policy won the support of Republicans who controlled Congress and involved sending $400 million in American money but no military forces to the region.  The effect was to end the Greek revolt, and in 1952, both Greece and Turkey joined NATO, a military alliance, to guarantee their stability.\n\nThe Truman Doctrine was informally extended to become the basis of American Cold War policy throughout Europe and around the world.<ref name=\"MerrillTruDoct\" /> It shifted American foreign policy toward the [[Soviet Union]] from anti-fascism ally to a policy of [[containment]] of Soviet expansion as advocated by diplomat [[George F. Kennan|George Kennan]]. It was distinguished from [[rollback]] by implicitly tolerating the previous Soviet takeovers in Eastern Europe.\n\n== Turkish Straits crisis ==\n{{Main|Turkish Straits crisis}}\n[[File:Turkish_Strait_disambig.svg|thumb|The Turkish Straits]]\n\nAt the conclusion of World War II, Turkey was pressured by the Soviet government to allow Russian shipping to flow freely through the [[Turkish Straits]], which connected the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean]]. As the Turkish government would not submit to the Soviet Union's requests, tensions arose in the region, leading to a show of naval force on the side of the Soviets. Since British assistance to Turkey had ended in 1947, the U.S. dispatched military aid to ensure that Turkey would retain chief control of the passage. Turkey received  $100 million in economic and military aid and the U.S sent the [[USS Franklin D. Roosevelt|aircraft carrier ''Franklin D. Roosevelt'']].

Vandenberg was impressed, and advised Truman to appear before Congress and \"scare the hell out of the American people.\"<ref name=JTP/>{{rp|127-8}} On March 7, Acheson warned Truman that Greece could fall to the communists within weeks without outside aid.<ref name=DM/>{{rp|545}}\n\nWhen a draft for Truman's address was circulated to policymakers, Marshall, Kennan, and others criticized it for containing excess \"rhetoric.\" Truman responded that, as Vandenberg had suggested, his request would only be approved if he played up the threat.<ref name=DM/>{{rp|546}}\n\nOn March 12, 1947, Truman appeared before a joint session of Congress.

In the words of historian [[James T. Patterson]], \"The Truman Doctrine was a highly publicized commitment of a sort the administration had not previously undertaken. Its sweeping rhetoric, promising that the United States should aid all 'free people' being subjugated, set the stage for innumerable later ventures that led to globalistic commitments. It was in these ways a major step.\"<ref name=JTP>{{cite book |last=Patterson |first=James T. |date=1996 |title=Grand Expectations |url=https://archive.org/details/grandexpectation00patt |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|129}}\n\nThe doctrine endured, historian Dennis Merill argues, because it addressed a broader cultural insecurity regarding modern life in a globalized world. It dealt with Washington's concern over communism's domino effect, it enabled a media-sensitive presentation of the doctrine that won [[bipartisanship|bipartisan]] support, and it mobilized American economic power to modernize and stabilize unstable regions without direct military intervention. It brought nation-building activities and modernization programs to the forefront of foreign policy.<ref name=\"MerrillTruDoct\">{{Harvnb|Merrill|2006}}.</ref> \n\nThe Truman Doctrine became a metaphor for emergency aid to keep a nation from communist influence. Truman used disease imagery not only to communicate a sense of impending disaster in the spread of communism but also to create a \"rhetorical vision\" of containing it by extending a protective shield around non-communist countries throughout the world.  It echoed the \"[[Quarantine Speech|quarantine the aggressor]]\" policy Truman's predecessor, [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], had sought to impose to contain German and Japanese expansion in 1937 (\"quarantine\" suggested the role of public health officials handling an infectious disease). The medical metaphor extended beyond the immediate aims of the Truman Doctrine in that the imagery combined with fire and flood imagery evocative of disaster provided the United States with an easy transition to direct military confrontation in later years with communist forces in Korea and Vietnam. By framing ideological differences in life or death terms, Truman was able to garner support for this communism-containing policy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ivie|1999}}.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = \n |title        = Special Message to Congress on Greece and Turkey\n |description  =\n}}\n* [[Liberal internationalism]]\n* [[Eisenhower Doctrine]]\n* [[Anti-communism]]\n* [[Reverse course]]\n* [[Turkey\u2013United States relations]]\n* [[Greece-United States relations]]\n* [[Containment]]\n<!-- For formatting -->\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Beisner, Robert L.

He is told that three officers of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]\u2014Lieutenants [[Breaker Morant|Harry Morant]] ([[Edward Woodward]]), [[Peter Handcock]] ([[Bryan Brown]]), and [[George Witton]] ([[Lewis Fitz-Gerald]]) -- have been arrested and charged with murdering captured [[Boer]]s and a German missionary. Explaining ominously that the Kaiser - Germany's Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] - has protested diplomatically about the latter killing, Kitchener asks Major Bolton to appear for the prosecution. To the Major's visible dismay, he is told that witnesses which would help the defence have been sent to [[British Raj|India]] and that the defence counsel is expected to give him no trouble.\n\nMeanwhile, the defence counsel, Major James Francis Thomas ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]) meets Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton the day before he is to represent them in court. He tells them that he knows only the basic facts, which don't look good. A small town [[solicitor]] from [[New South Wales]] in civilian life, Major Thomas explains that he has never handled anything except legal documents like wills. Lieut. Handcock quips, \"Might come in handy.\"\n\nAs court martial proceedings begin the following morning, Major Thomas argues, because his clients are Australians, that only the [[Australian Army]] can court martial them. Unmoved, the president of the court martial, Lt. Col. Denny, explains that the defendants may be tried for alleged crimes committed while serving under British command in the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]. Without further ado, Denny reads the indictment. The three stand accused of the murder of a Boer prisoner named Denys Visser (Michael Procanin Bernosky) and the subsequent shooting of six other captured Boers whose names are unknown. Furthermore, Lts. Morant and Handcock are also charged with the murder of the Reverend [[Daniel Heese|C.A.D. Heese]].\n\nMaj. Bolton begins by calling witnesses who describe a lack of discipline, drunkenness, widespread looting, and corruption among the Bushveldt Carbineers at Fort Edward. Maj. Thomas, however, manages to damage their credibility during [[cross examination]]. The testimony then turns to the shooting of Visser, which is shown in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nOn 5 April 1901, Lt. Morant's close friend, Captain Simon Hunt, had led a group of men to a farmhouse at [[Duiwelskloof]] intending to capture or kill [[Boer Commando]] [[Field Cornet]] Barend Viljoen. On arrival, the Carbineers found the farm swarming with far more armed men than expected. Captain Hunt was wounded, pinned down by enemy fire, and left behind when he ordered his men to retreat.\n\nWhen the patrol returned to Fort Edward without Captain Hunt, Intelligence Corps Captain [[Alfred Taylor (soldier)|Alfred Taylor]] ([[John Waters (actor)|John Waters]]) suggests Morant \"avenge Captain Hunt\". After returning to the farm and finding Captain Hunt's body mutilated with knives, Morant gave chase, ambushed Viljoen's men, and forced them to retreat with heavy losses. After capturing a Boer named Visser who was wearing Captain Hunt's jacket, an enraged Morant ordered his men to line up into a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. They obey his order.\n\nBack in the courtroom, Maj. Thomas argues that standing orders existed to shoot \"all Boers captured wearing [[khaki]]\". To the shock of Maj. Thomas and his clients, Maj. Bolton explains that those orders only applied to Boers wearing British uniforms as a [[ruse of war]]. When Morant takes the witness stand and is grilled by Bolton, he defends the shooting of Visser by saying that he fought the Boers as they fought him. When asked which of the [[rules of engagement]] justifies shooting an unarmed prisoner, Morant shouts, in reference to the caliber of his rifle, \"Rule 303.\" That night, Maj. Thomas angrily tells Morant that he was the best witness the prosecution has yet had. The following day, testimony turns to the shooting of the six Boers.\n\nCaptain Taylor testifies that, prior to his death, Captain Hunt had paid a visit to Kitchener's headquarters. Following Hunt's return to Fort Edward, Lt. Morant had brought in a group of Boers who had surrendered, only to be told by Captain Hunt that new orders from Kitchener, relayed through Col. [[Hubert Hamilton]], decreed that no more prisoners were to be taken. Saying, \"The gentlemen's war is over\", Hunt had had the prisoners all shot while Morant watched. Captain Taylor testifies, however, that Morant had continued to bring prisoners in until after Captain Hunt had been killed. Afterwards, he always ordered his men to shoot them. On cross examination, Maj. Bolton damages Taylor by forcing him to admit that he is also awaiting court martial for shooting prisoners.\n\nAccording to other witnesses, a group of six Boer guerrillas had approached Fort Edward after Captain Hunt's death, bearing [[white flag]]s. Morant ordered them disarmed, lined them up, and had them shot. One prisoner runs at Witton, who kills him.\n\nIn response, Maj. Thomas demands that Kitchener be summoned as a witness. He argues that, as his clients [[Nuremberg Defense|only followed orders]], all charges must be dropped. Lt. Col. Denny recoils at the suggestion that Kitchener, a man revered throughout the [[British Empire]], would be capable of giving such criminal orders. Equally contemptuous of the idea, Maj. Bolton privately tells Maj. Thomas that, if Kitchener testifies and denies giving the orders, the defendants' lives will be doomed. He vainly urges Maj. Thomas not to insist.\n\nIn a private conversation, Kitchener tells Col. Hamilton that, when he had issued orders to take no prisoners, he was trying to break the Boer guerrillas by waging [[total war]]. Now, however, he is trying to win the hearts and minds of the [[Afrikaner people]] and arrange a peace conference. To this end, a few soldiers \"have to be sacrificed\" for the misdeeds of the whole British Army. He orders Col. Hamilton to testify in his place and, when asked for what to say, Kitchener comments, \"I think you know what to do.\"\n\nThe following day, Col. Hamilton takes the stand and denies ever having spoken to Captain Hunt. An outraged Morant stands up and yells that the Colonel is a liar. Lt. Col. Denny, however, comments that there will be no more talk of orders to shoot prisoners. Maj. Thomas, however, explains that Col. Hamilton's testimony is irrelevant. The fact is, his clients ''believed'' that such orders existed and thus cannot be held accountable for following them. The trial then turns to the murder of the Reverend Heese.\n\nA Corporal Sharp testifies that, shortly before the massacre of the six Boers, Rev. Heese had passed through Fort Edward in a buggy. Shortly after his departure, Lt. Handcock had ridden up to Morant, spoken briefly to him, and then ridden off, looking \"agitated\", in the same direction as Rev. Heese, with a rifle. Maj. Thomas damages Sharp on cross examination by revealing his hatred of the defendants.\n\nUpon taking the stand, Morant explains that Heese was under orders to never speak to prisoners while passing through Fort Edward and violated them. When Maj. Bolton asks why such orders existed, Morant explains, \"It was for security reasons.\" When Morant had confronted the Reverend, he had been told that the prisoners had begged Heese to pray with them and that he could not refuse. Heese then left the Fort and was later found, shot to death, along the road. Bolton suggests that Heese was going to inform their commanding officer of Morant's plans to kill the prisoners and accuses Morant of ordering Handcock to silence him. Unmoved, Morant insists that his commanding officer already knew and suggests that he be recalled from India to testify. He adds, \"I don't mind waiting.\"\n\nAfter Morant stands down, Maj. Thomas requests and is granted a brief recess to confer with Lt. Handcock before putting him on the stand. Late into the night, Maj. Thomas pleads with Handcock to tell him the truth, calling the Heese murder \"the most serious charge.\" At last, Handcock opens up about his whereabouts.\n\nThe following morning, Handcock testifies that, when he left Fort Edward, he had travelled to the homes of two married Afrikaner women to 'entertain' them. As Maj. Bolton eyes him, Maj. Thomas produces signed depositions from the women to confirm Handcock's story. The court and the prosecution accept the depositions without summoning the women to give evidence.\n\nLater, in the prison courtyard, Lt. Witton wonders aloud about who really did kill Rev. Heese. Handcock smiles and says, \"Me.\" To Witton's horror, Handcock explains that his visits to his \"two lady friends\" happened afterwards. When Witton asks whether Maj. Thomas knows, Morant explains that there is no reason for him to know. Morant explains that the Bushveldt Carbineers represent a new kind of warfare \"for a new century\". As the Boers do not wear uniforms, the enemy is everyone, including men, women, children, and even missionaries. That is why, after Rev. Heese had left the Fort, Morant had told Handcock that he believed that the Reverend was a Boer spy and had said that he was going towards [[Leydsdorp]]. A seething Handcock replied that anything could happen on the way there, had ridden after Heese, and shot him.\n\nAfter a powerful summing up speech from Maj. Thomas, the defendants are acquitted of murdering Rev. Heese.\n\nThey celebrate, believing they have escaped  the [[death penalty]], but Taylor takes Morant aside and tells him that he and Handcock are almost certainly going to be shot. He offers to have a horse ready and says that many of the Highland Scots guards are sympathetic. He urges Morant to flee to [[Portuguese Mozambique]], take ship from [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], and \"see the world\". Unmoved, Morant says, \"I've seen it.\"\n\nThe next morning, all three defendants are sentenced to death, with Witton's commuted to \"life in penal servitude\". Desperate to save his clients, Maj. Thomas rushes to Kitchener's headquarters to demand a commutation. Upon arrival, he learns that Kitchener has already left. He is also told that both Whitehall and the Australian Government have expressed support for the verdict and sentences. Furthermore, there now will be a peace conference and every British and Commonwealth soldier will soon be going home.\n\nThe next morning, as Witton is led away, Morant tells him \"we are the scapegoats of Empire\". Morant's poem ''[http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/moranth/poetry/butchered.html Butchered to Make a Dutchmen's Holiday]'' is recited in [[voiceover]] while he and Handcock are led before a [[firing squad]] to be executed together. As both men are seated for their execution, Morant shouts, \"Shoot straight, you bastards! Don't make a mess of it!\" before being shot dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Edward Woodward]] as Lt. [[Breaker Morant|Harry \"Breaker\" Morant]]\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as Lt.

The distributors, Roadshow, insisted that Jack Thompson be given a role.<ref name=\"stratton\">Stratton, David. ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus & Robertson, 1980 p.55</ref> The movie was the second of two films Beresford intended to make for the [[South Australian Film Corporation]]. He wanted to make ''Breakout'', about the [[Cowra Breakout]], but could not find a script he was happy with so he turned to the story of Breaker Morant.<ref name=\"stratton\"/>\n\n==Historical inaccuracies==\n===Alleged German pressure===\nIn conversation with Maj. Bolton, Lord Kitchener states that [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] has formally protested about the murder of Rev. Heese, whom he describes as a German citizen. He elaborates that the [[German people]] support the Boer cause, that their elected representatives covet the gold and diamond mines of the [[Boer Republics]], and that the British Government fears German entry into the ongoing conflict. This, Kitchener explains, is why Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton must be convicted at all cost.\n\nAccording to South African historian Charles Leach, however, the widespread legend that the German Foreign Office protested about the case \"cannot be proved through official channels.\" Furthermore, \"no personal or direct communication\" between the Kaiser and his uncle, King [[Edward VII]], \"has been found despite widespread legend that this was definitely the case.\" Lastly, questions raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 8 April 1902 were answered by an insistence that the War Office, the Foreign Office, or Lord Kitchener had not received \"any such communication on this subject\" \"on behalf of the German government\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\">Leach (2012), page 80.</ref>\n\nUnder international law, the German government had no grounds to protest. Despite being attached to the [[Berlin Missionary Society]], Rev. Heese had been born in [[Cape Colony]] and \"was, technically speaking, a British, and not a German citizen\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/>\n\nThe scene contains a kernel of truth, however. Leach writes, \"Several eminent South African historians, local enthusiasts, and commentators share the opinion that had it not been for the murder of the Reverend Heese, none of the other [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] murders would have gone to trial.\"<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/>\n\n===Three defendants===\nAlthough only Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton are shown as being on trial, there were three other defendants:\n* Lieutenant Henry Picton, a British-born Australian officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers, was charged with Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton with \"committing the offense of murder\" for delivering a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' after the shooting of the wounded prisoner Floris Visser. Lieut. Picton was found guilty of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced to be [[Cashiering|cashiered]] from the [[British Armed Forces]].<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105-113, 117, 203.</ref>\n* Captain [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred James Taylor]], the Irish-born commander of [[military intelligence]] at Fort Edward, stood accused of the murder of six unarmed Afrikaner men and boys, the theft of their money and livestock, and the subsequent murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper. He was acquitted.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105-107.</ref>\n* Maj. Robert W. Lenehan, the Australian [[Field Commander]] of the Bushveldt Carbineers, stood accused of covering up the murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper who had disapproved of shooting prisoners. The official charge was \"When on active service by culpable neglect failing to make a report which it was duty to make.\" Maj. Lenehan was found guilty and sentenced to be reprimanded.<ref>Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\n===Role of enlisted men and Col. Hall===\nThe enlisted men from the Fort Edward garrison who testify against Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton are depicted as motivated by personal grudges against their former officers. A prime example is Corp. Sharp, who expresses a willingness to walk across South Africa to serve in the defendants' firing squad. Other prosecution witnesses have been thrown out of the Bushveldt Carbineers by the defendants for looting, drunkenness, and other offenses. Furthermore, all are portrayed with British accents.\n\nThe officer commanding at [[Pietersburg]], Col. Hall, is further depicted as having been fully aware and even complicit in the [[total war]] tactics of the Fort Edward garrison. He is also described as having been sent to India to prevent him from giving testimony favorable to the defense. Surviving documents, however, tell a very different story. The arrest of all six defendants was actually ''ordered'' by Col. Hall, in response to a letter that he had received from the enlisted men at Fort Edward. The letter, dated 4 October 1901, was written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former [[Justice of the Peace]] from [[Western Australia]], and signed by 15 members of the Fort Edward garrison.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 98-101.</ref><ref>Arthur Davey (1987), ''Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers'', Second Series No. 18. [[Van Riebeeck Society]], [[Cape Town]]. Pages 78-82.</ref>\n\nAfter listing numerous murders and [[attempted murder]]s of unarmed Boer prisoners, local civilians, and BVC personnel who disapproved, the letter concluded, \"Sir, many of us are [[Australian people|Australians]] who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are [[Afrikaner people|Africaners]] who have fought from [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]] till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to reenlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek\".<ref>Leach (2012), page 101.</ref>\n\n===Arrest at Fort Edward===\nDuring his conversation with Lieuts. Handcock and Witton in the prison courtyard, Lt. Morant alleges that the [[British Army]] has marked them for death \"ever since they arrested us at Fort Edward\". In reality, their arrests took place elsewhere. In response to the letter written by Trooper Cochrane, Col. Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and noncommissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of [[mounted infantry]] five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and \"brought into town like criminals\". Lt. Morant was arrested after returning from leave in [[Pretoria]], where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 97-98.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of deals for leniency===\nIn the film, the British military is determined to obtain the maximum penalty against the defendants. According to Australian historians Margaret Carnegie and Frank Shields, however, Lieuts. Morant and Handcock rejected an offer of full [[immunity from prosecution]] in return for turning [[king's evidence]]. Military prosecutors allegedly hoped to use them as witnesses against BVC Major Robert Lenehan, who was believed to have issued orders to [[take no prisoners]].<ref>Carnegie and Shields (1979), ''In Search of Breaker Morant'', pages 124-125.</ref> Towards the end of the film, Captain Taylor informs Morant that the British Army will never dare to prosecute him, as he really can implicate Kitchener in war crimes. According to South African historian Andries Pretorius, the trial of Alfred Taylor was almost certainly saved for the last because \"The prosecution must have been hoping\", in vain for the accused officers, \"to implicate Taylor\". Their refusal to do so seems to have ensured that Taylor was not convicted at his own trial.<ref>Leach (2012), page 189.</ref>\n\n===Capt. Hunt===\nIn the film, BVC Capt. Hunt is inaccurately depicted as having an [[Australian accent]]. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt \"was an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman.\" A surviving photograph of Hunt also reveals that he was far younger than the actor who plays him onscreen.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27.</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave ''Breaker Morant'' a 100% \"fresh\" rating, based on 22 reviews, with an average score of 8.45/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/breaker_morant/ \"Breaker Morant (1980)\"] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved 1 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe film also stirred debate on the legacy of the trial with its antiwar theme. In one analysis of the film, D. L. Kershen comments: \"''Breaker Morant'' tells the story of the court martial of Harry Morant, Peter Handcock, and George Witton in South Africa in 1902. Yet, its overriding theme is that \"war is evil\". ''Breaker Morant'' is a beautiful antiwar statement \u2014 a plea for the end of the intrigues and crimes that war entails.\"<ref>[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm \"Breaker Morant\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106034741/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm |date=6 January 2009 }} ''Oklahoma City University Law Review'' Volume 22, Number 1 (1997). Retrieved 24 July 2009.</ref>\n\nAnother comments: \"The clear issue of the film is the accountability of soldiers in war for [[command responsibility|acts condoned by their superiors]]. Another issue, which I find particularly fascinating, concerns the fairness of the hearing. We would ask whether [[due process]] was present, after accounting for the exigencies of the battlefield. Does ''Breaker Morant'' demonstrate what happens when due process is not observed?\"<ref>[http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~pyle/pla4020/Breaker.html \"Breaker Morant\"] on the [[University of Central Florida]] website Retrieved 24 July 2009</ref>\n\nBruce Beresford claimed the film is often misunderstood as the story of men [[kangaroo court|railroaded]] by the British:\n<blockquote>But that's not what it's about at all. The film never pretended for a moment that they weren't guilty. It said they were guilty. But what was interesting about it was that it analysed why men in this situation would behave as they had never behaved before in their lives. It's the pressures that are put to bear on people in war time... Look at all the things that happen in these countries committed by people who appear to be quite normal. That was what I was interested in examining. I always get amazed when people say to me that this is a film about poor Australians who were framed by the Brits.<ref name=\"bruce\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter the success of ''Breaker Morant'', Beresford was offered dozens of Hollywood scripts including ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', which he later directed. The 1983 film earned him his only [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] to date, even though 1989's ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'', which he directed, won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Beresford said that ''Breaker Morant'' was not that successful commercially:\n\n<blockquote>Critically, it was important, which is a key factor, and it has kept being shown over the years. Whenever I am in Los Angeles, it's always on TV. I get phone calls from people who say, 'I saw your movie, could you do something for us?' But, they're looking at a [then] twenty-year-old movie. At the time it never had an audience. Nobody went anywhere in the world. It opened and closed in America in less than a week. And in London, I remember it had four days in the [[West End of London|West End]]. Commercially, a disaster, but... It's a film that people talk about to me all the time.<ref name=\"bruce\">Malone.

He is told that three officers of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]\u2014Lieutenants [[Breaker Morant|Harry Morant]] ([[Edward Woodward]]), [[Peter Handcock]] ([[Bryan Brown]]), and [[George Witton]] ([[Lewis Fitz-Gerald]]) -- have been arrested and charged with murdering captured [[Boer|Boers]] and a German missionary. Explaining ominously that the Kaiser - Germany's Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] - has protested diplomatically about the latter killing, Kitchener asks Major Bolton to appear for the prosecution. To the Major's visible dismay, he is told that witnesses which would help the defence have been sent to [[British Raj|India]] and that the defence counsel is expected to give him no trouble.\n\nMeanwhile, the defence counsel, Major James Francis Thomas ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]) meets Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton the day before he is to represent them in court. He tells them that he knows only the basic facts, which don't look good. A small town [[solicitor]] from [[New South Wales]] in civilian life, Major Thomas explains that he has never handled anything except legal documents like wills. Lieut. Handcock quips, \"Might come in handy.\"\n\nAs court martial proceedings begin the following morning, Major Thomas argues, because his clients are Australians, that only the [[Australian Army]] can court martial them. Unmoved, the president of the court martial, Lt. Col. Denny, explains that the defendants may be tried for alleged crimes committed while serving under British command in the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]. Without further ado, Denny reads the indictment. The three stand accused of the murder of a Boer prisoner named Denys Visser (Michael Procanin Bernosky) and the subsequent shooting of six other captured Boers whose names are unknown. Furthermore, Lts. Morant and Handcock are also charged with the murder of the Reverend [[Daniel Heese|C.A.D. Heese]].\n\nMaj. Bolton begins by calling witnesses who describe a lack of discipline, drunkenness, widespread looting, and corruption among the Bushveldt Carbineers at Fort Edward. Maj. Thomas, however, manages to damage their credibility during [[cross examination]]. The testimony then turns to the shooting of Visser, which is shown in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nOn 5 April 1901, Lt. Morant's close friend, Captain Simon Hunt, had led a group of men to a farmhouse at [[Duiwelskloof]] intending to capture or kill [[Boer Commando]] [[Field Cornet]] Barend Viljoen. On arrival, the Carbineers found the farm swarming with far more armed men than expected. Captain Hunt was wounded, pinned down by enemy fire, and left behind when he ordered his men to retreat.\n\nWhen the patrol returned to Fort Edward without Captain Hunt, Intelligence Corps Captain [[Alfred Taylor (soldier)|Alfred Taylor]] ([[John Waters (actor)|John Waters]]) suggests Morant \"avenge Captain Hunt\". After returning to the farm and finding Captain Hunt's body mutilated with knives, Morant gave chase, ambushed Viljoen's men, and forced them to retreat with heavy losses. After capturing a Boer named Visser who was wearing Captain Hunt's jacket, an enraged Morant ordered his men to line up into a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. They obey his order.\n\nBack in the courtroom, Maj. Thomas argues that standing orders existed to shoot \"all Boers captured wearing [[khaki]]\". To the shock of Maj. Thomas and his clients, Maj. Bolton explains that those orders only applied to Boers wearing British uniforms as a [[ruse of war]]. When Morant takes the witness stand and is grilled by Bolton, he defends the shooting of Visser by saying that he fought the Boers as they fought him. When asked which of the [[rules of engagement]] justifies shooting an unarmed prisoner, Morant shouts, in reference to the caliber of his rifle, \"Rule 303.\" That night, Maj. Thomas angrily tells Morant that he was the best witness the prosecution has yet had. The following day, testimony turns to the shooting of the six Boers.\n\nCaptain Taylor testifies that, prior to his death, Captain Hunt had paid a visit to Kitchener's headquarters. Following Hunt's return to Fort Edward, Lt. Morant had brought in a group of Boers who had surrendered, only to be told by Captain Hunt that new orders from Kitchener, relayed through Col. [[Hubert Hamilton]], decreed that no more prisoners were to be taken. Saying, \"The gentlemen's war is over\", Hunt had had the prisoners all shot while Morant watched. Captain Taylor testifies, however, that Morant had continued to bring prisoners in until after Captain Hunt had been killed. Afterwards, he always ordered his men to shoot them. On cross examination, Maj. Bolton damages Taylor by forcing him to admit that he is also awaiting court martial for shooting prisoners.\n\nAccording to other witnesses, a group of six Boer guerrillas had approached Fort Edward after Captain Hunt's death, bearing [[white flag]]s. Morant ordered them disarmed, lined them up, and had them shot. One prisoner runs at Witton, who kills him.\n\nIn response, Maj. Thomas demands that Kitchener be summoned as a witness. He argues that, as his clients [[Nuremberg Defense|only followed orders]], all charges must be dropped. Lt. Col. Denny recoils at the suggestion that Kitchener, a man revered throughout the [[British Empire]], would be capable of giving such criminal orders. Equally contemptuous of the idea, Maj. Bolton privately tells Maj. Thomas that, if Kitchener testifies and denies giving the orders, the defendants' lives will be doomed. He vainly urges Maj. Thomas not to insist.\n\nIn a private conversation, Kitchener tells Col. Hamilton that, when he had issued orders to take no prisoners, he was trying to break the Boer guerrillas by waging [[total war]]. Now, however, he is trying to win the hearts and minds of the [[Afrikaner people]] and arrange a peace conference. To this end, a few soldiers \"have to be sacrificed\" for the misdeeds of the whole British Army. He orders Col. Hamilton to testify in his place and, when asked for what to say, Kitchener comments, \"I think you know what to do.\"\n\nThe following day, Col. Hamilton takes the stand and denies ever having spoken to Captain Hunt. An outraged Morant stands up and yells that the Colonel is a liar. Lt. Col. Denny, however, comments that there will be no more talk of orders to shoot prisoners. Maj. Thomas, however, explains that Col. Hamilton's testimony is irrelevant. The fact is, his clients ''believed'' that such orders existed and thus cannot be held accountable for following them. The trial then turns to the murder of the Reverend Heese.\n\nA Corporal Sharp testifies that, shortly before the massacre of the six Boers, Rev. Heese had passed through Fort Edward in a buggy. Shortly after his departure, Lt. Handcock had ridden up to Morant, spoken briefly to him, and then ridden off, looking \"agitated\", in the same direction as Rev. Heese, with a rifle. Maj. Thomas damages Sharp on cross examination by revealing his hatred of the defendants.\n\nUpon taking the stand, Morant explains that Heese was under orders to never speak to prisoners while passing through Fort Edward and violated them. When Maj. Bolton asks why such orders existed, Morant explains, \"It was for security reasons.\" When Morant had confronted the Reverend, he had been told that the prisoners had begged Heese to pray with them and that he could not refuse. Heese then left the Fort and was later found, shot to death, along the road. Bolton suggests that Heese was going to inform their commanding officer of Morant's plans to kill the prisoners and accuses Morant of ordering Handcock to silence him. Unmoved, Morant insists that his commanding officer already knew and suggests that he be recalled from India to testify. He adds, \"I don't mind waiting.\"\n\nAfter Morant stands down, Maj. Thomas requests and is granted a brief recess to confer with Lt. Handcock before putting him on the stand. Late into the night, Maj. Thomas pleads with Handcock to tell him the truth, calling the Heese murder \"the most serious charge.\" At last, Handcock opens up about his whereabouts.\n\nThe following morning, Handcock testifies that, when he left Fort Edward, he had travelled to the homes of two married Afrikaner women to 'entertain' them. As Maj. Bolton eyes him, Maj. Thomas produces signed depositions from the women to confirm Handcock's story. The court and the prosecution accept the depositions without summoning the women to give evidence.\n\nLater, in the prison courtyard, Lt. Witton wonders aloud about who really did kill Rev. Heese. Handcock smiles and says, \"Me.\" To Witton's horror, Handcock explains that his visits to his \"two lady friends\" happened afterwards. When Witton asks whether Maj. Thomas knows, Morant explains that there is no reason for him to know. Morant explains that the Bushveldt Carbineers represent a new kind of warfare \"for a new century\". As the Boers do not wear uniforms, the enemy is everyone, including men, women, children, and even missionaries. That is why, after Rev. Heese had left the Fort, Morant had told Handcock that he believed that the Reverend was a Boer spy and had said that he was going towards [[Leydsdorp]]. A seething Handcock replied that anything could happen on the way there, had ridden after Heese, and shot him.\n\nAfter a powerful summing up speech from Maj. Thomas, the defendants are acquitted of murdering Rev. Heese.\n\nThey celebrate, believing they have escaped  the [[death penalty]], but Taylor takes Morant aside and tells him that he and Handcock are almost certainly going to be shot. He offers to have a horse ready and says that many of the Highland Scots guards are sympathetic. He urges Morant to flee to [[Portuguese Mozambique]], take ship from [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], and \"see the world\". Unmoved, Morant says, \"I've seen it.\"\n\nThe next morning, all three defendants are sentenced to death, with Witton's commuted to \"life in penal servitude\". Desperate to save his clients, Maj. Thomas rushes to Kitchener's headquarters to demand a commutation. Upon arrival, he learns that Kitchener has already left. He is also told that both Whitehall and the Australian Government have expressed support for the verdict and sentences. Furthermore, there now will be a peace conference and every British and Commonwealth soldier will soon be going home.\n\nThe next morning, as Witton is led away, Morant tells him \"we are the scapegoats of Empire\". Morant's poem ''[http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/moranth/poetry/butchered.html Butchered to Make a Dutchmen's Holiday]'' is recited in [[voiceover]] while he and Handcock are led before a [[firing squad]] to be executed together. As both men are seated for their execution, Morant shouts, \"Shoot straight, you bastards! Don't make a mess of it!\" before being shot dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Edward Woodward]] as Lt. [[Breaker Morant|Harry \"Breaker\" Morant]]\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as Lt.

The distributors, Roadshow, insisted that Jack Thompson be given a role.<ref name=\"stratton\">Stratton, David. ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus & Robertson, 1980 p.55</ref> The movie was the second of two films Beresford intended to make for the [[South Australian Film Corporation]]. He wanted to make ''Breakout'', about the [[Cowra Breakout]], but could not find a script he was happy with so he turned to the story of Breaker Morant.<ref name=\"stratton\"/>\n\n==Historical inaccuracies==\n===Alleged German pressure===\nIn conversation with Maj. Bolton, Lord Kitchener states that [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] has formally protested about the murder of Rev. Heese, whom he describes as a German citizen. He elaborates that the [[German people]] support the Boer cause, that their elected representatives covet the gold and diamond mines of the [[Boer Republics]], and that the British Government fears German entry into the ongoing conflict. This, Kitchener explains, is why Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton must be convicted at all cost.\n\nAccording to South African historian Charles Leach, however, the widespread legend that the German Foreign Office protested about the case \"cannot be proved through official channels.\" Furthermore, \"no personal or direct communication\" between the Kaiser and his uncle, King [[Edward VII]], \"has been found despite widespread legend that this was definitely the case.\" Lastly, questions raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 8 April 1902 were answered by an insistence that the War Office, the Foreign Office, or Lord Kitchener had not received \"any such communication on this subject\" \"on behalf of the German government\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\">Leach (2012), page 80.</ref>\n\nUnder international law, the German government had no grounds to protest. Despite being attached to the [[Berlin Missionary Society]], Rev. Heese had been born in [[Cape Colony]] and \"was, technically speaking, a British, and not a German citizen\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/>\n\nThe scene contains a kernel of truth, however. Leach writes, \"Several eminent South African historians, local enthusiasts, and commentators share the opinion that had it not been for the murder of the Reverend Heese, none of the other [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] murders would have gone to trial.\"<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/>\n\n===Three defendants===\nAlthough only Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton are shown as being on trial, there were three other defendants:\n* Lieutenant Henry Picton, a British-born Australian officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers, was charged with Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton with \"committing the offense of murder\" for delivering a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' after the shooting of the wounded prisoner Floris Visser. Lieut. Picton was found guilty of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced to be [[Cashiering|cashiered]] from the [[British Armed Forces]].<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105-113, 117, 203.</ref>\n* Captain [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred James Taylor]], the Irish-born commander of [[military intelligence]] at Fort Edward, stood accused of the murder of six unarmed Afrikaner men and boys, the theft of their money and livestock, and the subsequent murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper. He was acquitted.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105-107.</ref>\n* Maj. Robert W. Lenehan, the Australian [[Field Commander]] of the Bushveldt Carbineers, stood accused of covering up the murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper who had disapproved of shooting prisoners. The official charge was \"When on active service by culpable neglect failing to make a report which it was duty to make.\" Maj. Lenehan was found guilty and sentenced to be reprimanded.<ref>Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\n===Role of enlisted men and Col. Hall===\nThe enlisted men from the Fort Edward garrison who testify against Lieuts. Morant, Handcock, and Witton are depicted as motivated by personal grudges against their former officers. A prime example is Corp. Sharp, who expresses a willingness to walk across South Africa to serve in the defendants' firing squad. Other prosecution witnesses have been thrown out of the Bushveldt Carbineers by the defendants for looting, drunkenness, and other offenses. Furthermore, all are portrayed with British accents.\n\nThe officer commanding at [[Pietersburg]], Col. Hall, is further depicted as having been fully aware and even complicit in the [[total war]] tactics of the Fort Edward garrison. He is also described as having been sent to India to prevent him from giving testimony favorable to the defense. Surviving documents, however, tell a very different story. The arrest of all six defendants was actually ''ordered'' by Col. Hall, in response to a letter that he had received from the enlisted men at Fort Edward. The letter, dated 4 October 1901, was written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former [[Justice of the Peace]] from [[Western Australia]], and signed by 15 members of the Fort Edward garrison.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 98-101.</ref><ref>Arthur Davey (1987), ''Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers'', Second Series No. 18. [[Van Riebeeck Society]], [[Cape Town]]. Pages 78-82.</ref>\n\nAfter listing numerous murders and [[attempted murder]]s of unarmed Boer prisoners, local civilians, and BVC personnel who disapproved, the letter concluded, \"Sir, many of us are [[Australian people|Australians]] who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are [[Afrikaner people|Africaners]] who have fought from [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]] till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to reenlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek\".<ref>Leach (2012), page 101.</ref>\n\n===Arrest at Fort Edward===\nDuring his conversation with Lieuts. Handcock and Witton in the prison courtyard, Lt. Morant alleges that the [[British Army]] has marked them for death \"ever since they arrested us at Fort Edward\". In reality, their arrests took place elsewhere. In response to the letter written by Trooper Cochrane, Col. Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and noncommissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of [[mounted infantry]] five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and \"brought into town like criminals\". Lt. Morant was arrested after returning from leave in [[Pretoria]], where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 97-98.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of deals for leniency===\nIn the film, the British military is determined to obtain the maximum penalty against the defendants. According to Australian historians Margaret Carnegie and Frank Shields, however, Lieuts. Morant and Handcock rejected an offer of full [[immunity from prosecution]] in return for turning [[king's evidence]]. Military prosecutors allegedly hoped to use them as witnesses against BVC Major Robert Lenehan, who was believed to have issued orders to [[take no prisoners]].<ref>Carnegie and Shields (1979), ''In Search of Breaker Morant'', pages 124-125.</ref> Towards the end of the film, Captain Taylor informs Morant that the British Army will never dare to prosecute him, as he really can implicate Kitchener in war crimes. According to South African historian Andries Pretorius, the trial of Alfred Taylor was almost certainly saved for the last because \"The prosecution must have been hoping\", in vain for the accused officers, \"to implicate Taylor\". Their refusal to do so seems to have ensured that Taylor was not convicted at his own trial.<ref>Leach (2012), page 189.</ref>\n\n===Capt. Hunt===\nIn the film, BVC Capt. Hunt is inaccurately depicted as having an [[Australian accent]]. According to South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt \"was an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman.\" A surviving photograph of Hunt also reveals that he was far younger than the actor who plays him onscreen.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27.</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave ''Breaker Morant'' a 100% \"fresh\" rating, based on 22 reviews, with an average score of 8.45/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/breaker_morant/ \"Breaker Morant (1980)\"] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved 1 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe film also stirred debate on the legacy of the trial with its antiwar theme. In one analysis of the film, D. L. Kershen comments: \"''Breaker Morant'' tells the story of the court martial of Harry Morant, Peter Handcock, and George Witton in South Africa in 1902. Yet, its overriding theme is that \"war is evil\". ''Breaker Morant'' is a beautiful antiwar statement \u2014 a plea for the end of the intrigues and crimes that war entails.\"<ref>[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm \"Breaker Morant\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106034741/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm |date=6 January 2009 }} ''Oklahoma City University Law Review'' Volume 22, Number 1 (1997). Retrieved 24 July 2009.</ref>\n\nAnother comments: \"The clear issue of the film is the accountability of soldiers in war for [[command responsibility|acts condoned by their superiors]]. Another issue, which I find particularly fascinating, concerns the fairness of the hearing. We would ask whether [[due process]] was present, after accounting for the exigencies of the battlefield. Does ''Breaker Morant'' demonstrate what happens when due process is not observed?\"<ref>[http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~pyle/pla4020/Breaker.html \"Breaker Morant\"] on the [[University of Central Florida]] website Retrieved 24 July 2009</ref>\n\nBruce Beresford claimed the film is often misunderstood as the story of men [[kangaroo court|railroaded]] by the British:\n<blockquote>But that's not what it's about at all. The film never pretended for a moment that they weren't guilty. It said they were guilty. But what was interesting about it was that it analysed why men in this situation would behave as they had never behaved before in their lives. It's the pressures that are put to bear on people in war time... Look at all the things that happen in these countries committed by people who appear to be quite normal. That was what I was interested in examining. I always get amazed when people say to me that this is a film about poor Australians who were framed by the Brits.<ref name=\"bruce\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter the success of ''Breaker Morant'', Beresford was offered dozens of Hollywood scripts including ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', which he later directed. The 1983 film earned him his only [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] to date, even though 1989's ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'', which he directed, won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Beresford said that ''Breaker Morant'' was not that successful commercially:\n\n<blockquote>Critically, it was important, which is a key factor, and it has kept being shown over the years. Whenever I am in Los Angeles, it's always on TV. I get phone calls from people who say, 'I saw your movie, could you do something for us?' But, they're looking at a [then] twenty-year-old movie. At the time it never had an audience. Nobody went anywhere in the world. It opened and closed in America in less than a week. And in London, I remember it had four days in the [[West End of London|West End]]. Commercially, a disaster, but... It's a film that people talk about to me all the time.<ref name=\"bruce\">Malone.
