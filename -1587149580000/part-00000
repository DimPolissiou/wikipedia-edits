Born into the [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]], a [[royal house]] with origins in [[northern Germany]], she was the eldest child of [[Frederick IX of Denmark]] and [[Ingrid of Sweden]]. She became [[heir presumptive]] to her father in 1953, when [[Danish Act of Succession|a constitutional amendment]] allowed women to inherit the throne.\n\nMargrethe succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972. On her accession, she became the first female monarch of Denmark since [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margrethe I]], ruler of the [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms in 1375\u20131412 during the [[Kalmar Union]]. In 1967, she married [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri de Laborde de Monpezat]], with whom she had two sons: [[Crown Prince Frederik]] and [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Prince Joachim]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Amalienborg cph.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg]], photographed in 2006]]\nPrincess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at [[Amalienborg]] in [[Copenhagen]] as the first child of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess (later [[King Frederick IX]] and [[Queen Ingrid]]). Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning [[King Christian X]], while her mother was the only daughter of the Crown Prince of Sweden (later [[King Gustaf VI Adolf]]). Her birth took place just one week after [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|invasion of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940.<ref name=r1/>\n\nShe was [[baptism|baptised]] on 14 May in the [[Holmen Church]] in [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=r1/> The Princess's [[godparent]]s were: [[King Christian X]] (paternal grandfather); [[Prince Knud of Denmark|Hereditary Prince Knud]] (paternal uncle); [[Prince Axel of Denmark|Prince Axel]] (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustaf V of Sweden]] (maternal great-grandfather); [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden]] (maternal grandfather); [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten]] (her maternal uncle); [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] (maternal great-grandfather).\n\nShe was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, [[Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden]], Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen Alexandrine]], and Ingrid after her mother. Since her paternal grandfather was also the [[King of Iceland]], she was given the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name \u00de\u00f3rhildur.<ref>{{cite web | title = Navnet til den ny prinsesse... | website = nfi.ku.dk | publisher = Nordisk Forskningsinstitut, [[University of Copenhagen]] | date = 18 May 2012 | url = http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | access-date = 23 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202083411/http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | archive-date = 2 February 2017 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her younger sister [[Princess Benedikte of Denmark|Princess Benedikte]] was born. Princess Benedikte later married [[Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister, [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Princess Anne-Marie]], was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II of the Hellenes]] and currently lives in [[Greece]].\n\nMargrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in [[Fredensborg Palace]] in [[North Zealand]]. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at [[Gr\u00e5sten Palace]] in [[Southern Jutland]]. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\n[[File:Margrethe II of Denmark 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Margrethe in 1966]]\nAt the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg|Gl\u00fccksburg]] branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]] would one day assume the throne.\n\nThe process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]] permitted female [[Order of succession|succession]] to the throne of Denmark, according to [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became [[heir presumptive]].<ref name=r1/>\n\nOn her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the [[Danish Council of State|Council of State]]. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to [[Los Angeles]], and to the [[Paramount Studios]], where they met several celebrities, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Elvis>{{cite web|title=Elvis Presley with Princesses Margrethe of Denmark, Astrid of Norway, and Margaretha of Sweden|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|date=7 June 1960|accessdate=11 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909182159/http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nMargrethe was educated at the private school [[N.

Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of \"His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark\" because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish [[throne]].<ref name=r1/> They were married for over fifty years, until his death on 13 February 2018.\n\nMargrethe gave birth to her first child 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik]]. A second child, named [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Joachim]], was born 7 June 1969.<ref name=r1/>\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Faroe stamp 302 Queen Margrethe.jpg|thumb|200px|Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the [[Faroese people]].

At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne at the age of 31, becoming the first female Danish [[monarch|sovereign]] under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] 15 January 1972, by [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Jens Otto Krag]]. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style \"[[By the Grace of God]], Queen of Denmark\" ({{lang-da|Margrethe den Anden, af Guds N\u00e5de Danmarks Dronning}}). The Queen chose the [[Royal mottos of Danish monarchs|motto]]: ''God's help, the love of The People, Denmark's strength.''<ref name=\"Margrethe and Henrik Biography\"/>\n\nIn her first address to the people, Queen Margrethe II said: {{quote|My beloved father, our King, is dead.

The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. \n\nAs an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.<ref name=r1/>\n\nAfter an election where the incumbent [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a \u201cDronningerunde\u201d (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the [[List of political parties in Denmark|Danish political parties]].<ref name=Todays>{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |title=The Monarchy today |publisher=Kongehuset.dk |accessdate=11 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215082552/http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |archive-date=15 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEach party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal [[Det Radikale Venstre]] did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the [[Folketing]], is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history{{when|date=January 2020}} that any party has held a majority on its own.)\n\nOnce the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State ([[privy council]]), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the [[Cabinet of Denmark]].\n\nIn addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]], an infantry regiment of the [[British Army]], following a tradition in her family.<ref name=r1/>\n\n===Ruby Jubilee===\nQueen Margrethe II celebrated her [[Ruby Jubilee]], the 40th year on the throne, on 14 January 2012.<ref name=BBC40>{{cite news |title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark marks 40 years on the throne |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16531823 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 January 2012}}</ref> This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at [[Christiansborg Palace]] and numerous TV interviews.\n\n=== Immigration debate ===\nIn an interview within the 2016 book ''De dybeste r\u00f8dder'' (''The Deepest Roots''), according to historians at the [[South Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Saxo Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] she showed a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. She further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules.

Born into the [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]], a [[royal house]] with origins in [[northern Germany]], she was the eldest child of [[Frederick IX of Denmark]] and [[Ingrid of Sweden]]. She became [[heir presumptive]] to her father in 1953, when [[Danish Act of Succession|a constitutional amendment]] allowed women to inherit the throne.\n\nMargrethe succeeded her father upon his death on 14 January 1972. On her accession, she became the first female monarch of Denmark since [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margrethe I]], ruler of the [[Scandinavia]]n kingdoms in 1375\u20131412 during the [[Kalmar Union]]. In 1967, she married [[Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark|Henri de Laborde de Monpezat]], with whom she had two sons: [[Crown Prince Frederik]] and [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Prince Joachim]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Amalienborg cph.jpg|thumb|left|Princess Margrethe's birthplace: Frederik VIII's Palace at [[Amalienborg]], photographed in 2006]]\nPrincess Margrethe was born 16 April 1940 at [[Amalienborg]] in [[Copenhagen]] as the first child of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess (later [[King Frederick IX]] and [[Queen Ingrid]]). Her father was the eldest son of the then-reigning [[King Christian X]], while her mother was the only daughter of the Crown Prince of Sweden (later [[King Gustaf VI Adolf]]). Her birth took place just one week after [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|invasion of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940.<ref name=r1/>\n\nShe was [[baptism|baptised]] on 14 May in the [[Holmen Church]] in [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=r1/> The Princess's [[godparent]]s were: [[King Christian X]] (paternal grandfather); [[Prince Knud of Denmark|Hereditary Prince Knud]] (paternal uncle); [[Prince Axel of Denmark|Prince Axel]] (her paternal grandfather's first cousin); [[Gustaf V of Sweden|King Gustaf V of Sweden]] (maternal great-grandfather); [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden]] (maternal grandfather); [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten]] (her maternal uncle); [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]] (maternal great-grandfather).\n\nShe was named Margrethe after her late maternal grandmother, [[Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden]], Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Queen Alexandrine]], and Ingrid after her mother. Since her paternal grandfather was also the [[King of Iceland]], she was given the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] name \u00de\u00f3rhildur.<ref>{{cite web | title = Navnet til den ny prinsesse... | website = nfi.ku.dk | publisher = Nordisk Forskningsinstitut, [[University of Copenhagen]] | date = 18 May 2012 | url = http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | access-date = 23 January 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170202083411/http://nfi.ku.dk/nyheder/prinsessenavn2012/ | archive-date = 2 February 2017 | url-status=dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhen Margrethe was four years old, in 1944, her younger sister [[Princess Benedikte of Denmark|Princess Benedikte]] was born. Princess Benedikte later married [[Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and lives some of the time in Germany. Her second sister, [[Queen Anne-Marie of Greece|Princess Anne-Marie]], was born in 1946. Anne-Marie later married [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II of the Hellenes]] and currently lives in [[Greece]].\n\nMargrethe and her sisters grew up in apartments at Frederick VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in [[Fredensborg Palace]] in [[North Zealand]]. She spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parent's summer residence at [[Gr\u00e5sten Palace]] in [[Southern Jutland]]. On 20 April 1947, King Christian X died and Margrethe's father ascended the throne as King Frederick IX.\n\n==Heir presumptive==\n[[File:Margrethe II of Denmark 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Princess Margrethe in 1966]]\nAt the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the [[Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg|Gl\u00fccksburg]] branch was chosen to succeed. As she had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle [[Knud, Hereditary Prince of Denmark|Prince Knud]] would one day assume the throne.\n\nThe process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after her father ascended the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederick and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred 27 March 1953. The new [[Danish Act of Succession|Act of Succession]] permitted female [[Order of succession|succession]] to the throne of Denmark, according to [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], where a female can ascend to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became [[heir presumptive]].<ref name=r1/>\n\nOn her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the [[Danish Council of State|Council of State]]. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King.<ref name=r1/>\n\nIn 1960, together with the princesses of Sweden and Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to [[Los Angeles]], and to the [[Paramount Studios]], where they met several celebrities, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Jerry Lewis]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=Elvis>{{cite web|title=Elvis Presley with Princesses Margrethe of Denmark, Astrid of Norway, and Margaretha of Sweden|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au|date=7 June 1960|accessdate=11 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909182159/http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/1960_june_7.html#sthash.ORaSOwgy.dd9JxPDB.dpbs|archivedate=9 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nMargrethe was educated at the private school [[N.

Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of \"His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark\" because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish [[throne]].<ref name=r1/> They were married for over fifty years, until his death on 13 February 2018.\n\nMargrethe gave birth to her first child 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederick or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her eldest son [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Frederik]]. A second child, named [[Prince Joachim of Denmark|Joachim]], was born 7 June 1969.<ref name=r1/>\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:Faroe stamp 302 Queen Margrethe.jpg|thumb|200px|Margrethe II of Denmark in a costume of the [[Faroese people]].

At his death 14 days later, 14 January 1972, Margrethe succeeded to the throne at the age of 31, becoming the first female Danish [[monarch|sovereign]] under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of [[Christiansborg Palace]] 15 January 1972, by [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] [[Jens Otto Krag]]. Queen Margrethe II relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style \"[[By the Grace of God]], Queen of Denmark\" ({{lang-da|Margrethe den Anden, af Guds N\u00e5de Danmarks Dronning}}).

The Queen performs the latter task by accepting invitations to open exhibitions, attending anniversaries, inaugurating bridges, etc. She receives foreign ambassadors and awards honours and medals. \n\nAs an unelected public official, the Queen takes no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she has the right to vote, she opts not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.<ref name=r1/>\n\nAfter an election where the incumbent [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]] does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen holds a \u201cDronningerunde\u201d (Queen's meeting) in which she meets the chairmen of each of the [[List of political parties in Denmark|Danish political parties]].<ref name=Todays>{{cite web |url=http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |title=The Monarchy today |publisher=Kongehuset.dk |accessdate=11 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215082552/http://kongehuset.dk/english/the-monarchy-in-denmark/the-monarchy-today |archive-date=15 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEach party has the choice of selecting a Royal Investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent Prime Minister the mandate to continue his government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as Royal Investigator, the social liberal [[Det Radikale Venstre]] did so in 2006, but often only one Royal Investigator is chosen plus the Prime Minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the [[Folketing]], is by royal decree charged with the task of forming a new government. (It has never happened in more modern history{{when|date=January 2020}} that any party has held a majority on its own.)\n\nOnce the government has been formed, it is formally appointed by the Queen. Officially, it is the Queen who is the head of government, and she therefore presides over the Council of State ([[privy council]]), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, however, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers are exercised by the [[Cabinet of Denmark]].\n\nIn addition to her roles in her own country, the Queen is also the [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]], an infantry regiment of the [[British Army]], following a tradition in her family.<ref name=r1/>\n\n===Ruby Jubilee===\nQueen Margrethe II celebrated her [[Ruby Jubilee]], the 40th year on the throne, on 14 January 2012.<ref name=BBC40>{{cite news |title=Queen Margrethe II of Denmark marks 40 years on the throne |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16531823 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 January 2012}}</ref> This was marked by a carriage procession, a gala banquet at [[Christiansborg Palace]] and numerous TV interviews.\n\n=== Immigration debate ===\nIn an interview within the 2016 book ''De dybeste r\u00f8dder'' (''The Deepest Roots''), according to historians at the [[South Campus (University of Copenhagen)|Saxo Institute]] of the [[University of Copenhagen]] she showed a change in attitude to immigration towards a more restrictive stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. She further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.<ref name=\"tv2_dk_23October2016\">{{cite news|title=Historiker om Margrethes danskheds-udtalelse: - Hun har fulgt folkesj\u00e6lens bekymringer|url=http://nyheder.tv2.dk/politik/2016-10-23-historiker-om-margrethes-danskheds-udtalelse-hun-har-fulgt-folkesjaelens|accessdate=25 October 2016|publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)]]|date=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"b_dk_22October2016\">{{cite news|title=Dronning Margrethe om integration: \"Det er ikke en naturlov, at man bliver dansker af at bo i Danmark\"|url=http://www.b.dk/politiko/dronning-margrethe-om-integration-det-er-ikke-en-naturlov-at-man-bliver-dans|accessdate=25 October 2016|newspaper=[[Berlingske Tidende]]|date=22 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and interests==\n\nThe official residences of the Queen are [[Amalienborg Palace]] in Copenhagen and [[Fredensborg Palace]].

She sent them to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. Margrethe's drawings were redrawn by the British artist [[Eric Fraser (illustrator)|Eric Fraser]] in the translation published in 1977 and re-issued in 2002. In 2000, she illustrated Henrik, the Prince Consort's [[Cantabile (book)|poetry collection ''Cantabile'']].

Globally as well as locally. There is something impressive about people for whom religion imbues their existence, from dusk to dawn, from cradle to grave. There are also Christians who feel this way. There is something endearing about people who give themselves up completely to their faith. But there is likewise something frightening about such a totality, which also is a feature of Islam. A counterbalance has to be found, and one has to, at times, run the risk of having unflattering labels placed on you. For there are some things for which one should display no tolerance.

Character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] conceived and designed Sephiroth as an antagonist to - and direct physical opposite of - the game's main character [[Cloud Strife]]. The character was voiced by voice actor [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] in Japanese. In English, Sephiroth has been voiced by [[Lance Bass]] in ''[[Kingdom Hearts (video game)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' and [[George Newbern]] in all subsequent appearances, and by [[Tyler Hoechlin]] in ''[[Final Fantasy VII Remake]]''.\n\nSephiroth is later revealed to be the result of an experiment by the [[megacorporation]] [[Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra]], in which they injected him with [[Cell (biology)|cells]] from the [[extraterrestrial life]]form [[Jenoba|Jenova]] when he was still a fetus. Upon discovering this, Sephiroth decides to follow what he believes to be his destiny and take control of [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)|the Planet]], while Cloud and the game's other protagonists attempt to stop him. Sephiroth's background and role in the story are expanded in the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]''. Additionally, he appears as a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss character]] in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and other video games developed by Square. Sephiroth has been well-received within the video game community and is highly ranked on many lists of the best video game villains and ''Final Fantasy'' characters.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In ''Final Fantasy VII''===\nSephiroth is the main antagonist in ''Final Fantasy VII'', who first appears after assassinating [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#President Shinra|President Shinra]].<ref name=\"Sephiroth reappeared\"/> As revealed over the course of the game, Sephiroth was once the most powerful member of SOLDIER, Shinra's elite military division, who was celebrated as a heroic veteran of the Shinra-Wutai war.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Final Fantasy VII|developer=Square Co|publisher=SCE America|date=September 7, 1997 |platform=PlayStation|quote='''Cloud:''' I want to join SOLDIER.

His revival in the film was introduced in the early stages of development, but the official decision as to how to bring him back was not reached until later. Nomura originally planned to have him appear from the start, but as it took the staff two years to develop his design, the idea of his presence throughout the film was scrapped, and it was decided instead to have him only appear on screen for a short time. Sephiroth was designed for the film in such a way so as to emphasize his other-worldliness, such as the fact that he never blinks or is seen breathing, and his voice remains always monotone and calm. In the film, the staff stated that his strength had considerably increased, to the point that he had \"ascended to a new level of existence.\" Despite initially encountering problems as to who would voice him, Nomura said that once [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] auditioned for the role, they knew they had their actor. Morikawa was instructed by the staff to speak all of Sephiroth's dialogue as if he felt superior to every other character in the film. The voice director and Morikawa agreed to make Sephiroth's voice sound calm to the point that he believes he ''cannot'' lose to Cloud, suggesting to Morikawa that he may reappear at some point in the future.<ref name=\"japvoice\">{{Cite book | year=2006 | editor=SoftBank | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files | language=Japanese, English | publisher=Square-Enix | isbn= 4-7973-3498-3| page=}}</ref>\n\nFor the remake of ''Final Fantasy VII'', Yoshinori Kitase wanted Sephiroth to have more scenes than in the original game due to his popularity while comparing him with the build of the film ''Jaws''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siliconera.com/sephiroth-jaws/|title=Square Enix\u2019s Kitase Says Sephiroth\u2019s Original Appearance Was Handled Like Jaws\u2019|website=Siliconera|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Musical themes==\n{{listen\n| filename = FF7 ac angel.ogg\n| title = \"Advent: One-Winged Angel\"\n| description = The revised \"One-Winged Angel\" theme in ''Advent Children''.\n}}\n\nIn ''Final Fantasy VII'', Sephiroth is the focus of three pieces of music written by series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]].

His revival in the film was introduced in the early stages of development, but the official decision as to how to bring him back was not reached until later. Nomura originally planned to have him appear from the start, but as it took the staff two years to develop his design, the idea of his presence throughout the film was scrapped, and it was decided instead to have him only appear on screen for a short time. Sephiroth was designed for the film in such a way so as to emphasize his other-worldliness, such as the fact that he never blinks or is seen breathing, and his voice remains always monotone and calm. In the film, the staff stated that his strength had considerably increased, to the point that he had \"ascended to a new level of existence.\" Despite initially encountering problems as to who would voice him, Nomura said that once [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] auditioned for the role, they knew they had their actor. Morikawa was instructed by the staff to speak all of Sephiroth's dialogue as if he felt superior to every other character in the film. The voice director and Morikawa agreed to make Sephiroth's voice sound calm to the point that he believes he ''cannot'' lose to Cloud, suggesting to Morikawa that he may reappear at some point in the future.<ref name=\"japvoice\">{{Cite book | year=2006 | editor=SoftBank | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files | language=Japanese, English | publisher=Square-Enix | isbn= 4-7973-3498-3| page=}}</ref>\n\n==Musical themes==\n{{listen\n| filename = FF7 ac angel.ogg\n| title = \"Advent: One-Winged Angel\"\n| description = The revised \"One-Winged Angel\" theme in ''Advent Children''.\n}}\n\nIn ''Final Fantasy VII'', Sephiroth is the focus of three pieces of music written by series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]].

When a robber consumes all of a flower's nectar, legitimate pollinators may avoid the flower, resulting in a negative effect on plant fitness.<ref name=\"Maloof\" />\n\nThe response of different species of legitimate pollinators also varies. Some species, like the bumble bees ''[[Bombus appositus]]'' or ''[[Western bumblebee|B. occidentalis]]'' and many species of nectar-feeding birds can distinguish between robbed and unrobbed plants and minimize their energy cost of [[foraging]] by avoiding heavily robbed flowers.<ref name=\"Irwin\" /><ref>{{cite book |author1=Bentley, Barbara |author2=Elias, Thomas |year=1983 |title=The Biology of Nectaries |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn= |pages=}}{{page needed|date=January 2018}}</ref> Pollinating birds may be better at this than insects, because of their higher sensory capability.<ref name=\"Maloof\" /> The ways that bees distinguish between robbed and unrobbed flowers have not been studied, but they have been thought to be related to the damage on [[petal]] tissue after robbery or changes in nectar quality.<ref name=\"Irwin\" /> ''[[Xylocopa sonorina]]'' steals nectar through a slit they make in the base of the petals.

She made her first journey to [[Florence]] in 1374, probably to be interviewed by the Dominican authorities at the General Chapter held in Florence in May 1374, though this is disputed (if she was interviewed, then the absence of later evidence suggests she was deemed sufficiently orthodox).<ref name=foley/> It seems that at this time she acquired Raymond of Capua as her confessor and spiritual director.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}\n\nAfter this visit, she began travelling with her followers throughout northern and central Italy advocating reform of the clergy and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through \"the total love for God.\"{{sfn|Hollister|Bennett|2002|p=342}} In Pisa, in 1375, she used what influence she had to sway that city and [[Lucca]] away from alliance with the anti-papal league whose force was gaining momentum and strength. She also lent her enthusiasm towards promoting the launch of a new crusade. It was in Pisa in 1375 that, according to Raymond of Capua's biography, she received the [[stigmata]] (visible, at Catherine's request, only to herself).{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}\n{{Christian mysticism}}\nPhysical travel was not the only way in which Catherine made her views known. From 1375{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}} onwards, she began dictating letters to scribes.<ref name=\"Siena.

She carried on a long correspondence with [[Pope Gregory XI]], asking him to reform the [[clergy]] and the administration of the [[Papal States]].\n\nTowards the end of 1375, she returned to Siena, to assist a young political prisoner, Niccol\u00f2 di Tuldo, at his execution.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}<ref>Letter T273, written by Catherine to Raymond, probably in June 1375, describes the event.</ref> In June 1376 Catherine went to [[Avignon]] as ambassador of the [[Republic of Florence]] to make peace with the Papal States (on 31 March 1376 Gregory XI had placed Florence under interdict).

During this period, in autumn 1377, she had the experience which led to the writing of her ''Dialogue'' and learned to write, although she still seems to have chiefly relied upon her secretaries for her correspondence.<ref name=\"Gardner\" /><ref>This experience is recorded in Letter 272, written to Raymond in October 1377.</ref>\n\nLate in 1377 or early in 1378 Catherine again travelled to Florence, at the order of Gregory XI, to seek peace between Florence and Rome. Following Gregory's death in [[Western Schism|March 1378 riots]], the revolts of the [[Ciompi]], broke out in Florence on 18 June, and in the ensuing violence she was nearly assassinated. Eventually, in July 1378, peace was agreed between Florence and Rome; Catherine returned quietly to Florence.\n\nIn late November 1378, with the outbreak of the [[Western Schism]], the new Pope, [[Urban VI]], summoned her to Rome. She stayed at Pope Urban VI's court and tried to convince nobles and cardinals of his legitimacy, both meeting with individuals at court and writing letters to persuade others.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}}\n\nFor many years she had accustomed herself to a rigorous abstinence.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/CSIENA.HTM Butler, Alban.

Though much of this material is heavily [[Hagiography|hagiographic]], it has been an important source for historians seeking to reconstruct Catherine's life. Various sources are particularly important, especially the works of Raymond of Capua, who was Catherine's spiritual director and close friend from 1374 until her death, and himself became [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General]] of the Order in 1380. Raymond began writing what is known as the ''Legenda Major'', his ''Life'' of Catherine, in 1384, and completed it in 1395.\n\nAnother important work written after Catherine's death was ''Libellus de Supplemento'' (''Little Supplement Book''), written between 1412 and 1418 by Tommaso d'Antonio Nacci da Siena (commonly called Thomas of Siena, or Tommaso Caffarini): the work is an expansion of Raymond's ''Legenda Major'' making heavy use of the notes of Catherine's first confessor, Tommaso della Fonte (notes that do not survive anywhere else). Caffarini later published a more compact account of Catherine's life, entitled the ''Legenda Minor''.\n\nFrom 1411 onwards, Caffarini also co-ordinated the compiling of the ''Processus'' of Venice, the set of documents submitted as part of the process of [[canonisation]] of Catherine, which provides [[Christian testimony|testimony]] from nearly all of Catherine's disciples. There is also an anonymous piece entitled \"Miracoli della Beata Caterina\" (''Miracle of Blessed Catherine''), written by an anonymous Florentine. A few other relevant pieces survive.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 2}}\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Caterina - Libro della divina dottrina, circa 1475 - 2367969.jpg|thumb|'' Libro della divina dottrina'' (commonly known as ''The Dialogue of Divine Providence''), c.1475]]\n[[File:L'epistole della serafica vergine s.

As a tertiary, she lived outside the convent, at home with her family like before.

Her early pious activities in Siena attracted a group of followers, women and men, who gathered around her.<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nAs social and political tensions mounted in Siena, Catherine found herself drawn to intervene in wider politics. She made her first journey to [[Florence]] in 1374, probably to be interviewed by the Dominican authorities at the General Chapter held in Florence in May 1374, though this is disputed (if she was interviewed, then the absence of later evidence suggests she was deemed sufficiently orthodox).<ref name=foley/> It seems that at this time she acquired Raymond of Capua as her confessor and spiritual director.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}\n\nAfter this visit, she began travelling with her followers throughout northern and central Italy advocating reform of the clergy and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through \"the total love for God.\"{{sfn|Hollister|Bennett|2002|p=342}} In Pisa, in 1375, she used what influence she had to sway that city and [[Lucca]] away from alliance with the anti-papal league whose force was gaining momentum and strength. She also lent her enthusiasm towards promoting the launch of a new crusade. It was in Pisa in 1375 that, according to Raymond of Capua's biography, she received the [[stigmata]] (visible, at Catherine's request, only to herself).{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}\n{{Christian mysticism}}\nPhysical travel was not the only way in which Catherine made her views known. From 1375{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}} onwards, she began dictating letters to scribes.<ref name=\"Siena. Available Means 2001\"/> These letters were intended to reach men and women of her circle, increasingly widening her audience to include figures in authority as she begged for peace between the republics and principalities of Italy and for the return of the [[Papacy]] from [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]] to [[Rome]]. She carried on a long correspondence with [[Pope Gregory XI]], asking him to reform the [[clergy]] and the administration of the [[Papal States]].\n\nTowards the end of 1375, she returned to Siena, to assist a young political prisoner, Niccol\u00f2 di Tuldo, at his execution.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}}<ref>Letter T273, written by Catherine to Raymond, probably in June 1375, describes the event.</ref> In June 1376 Catherine went to [[Avignon]] as ambassador of the [[Republic of Florence]] to make peace with the Papal States (on 31 March 1376 Gregory XI had placed Florence under interdict). She was unsuccessful and was disowned by the Florentine leaders, who sent ambassadors to negotiate on their own terms as soon as Catherine's work had paved the way for them.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 5}} Catherine sent an appropriately scorching letter back to Florence in response.<ref>Letter 234 in Tommaseo's numbering.</ref> While in Avignon, Catherine also tried to convince Pope Gregory XI, the last [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon Pope]], to return to Rome.{{sfn|Hollister|Bennett|2002|p=343}} Gregory did indeed return his administration to Rome in January 1377; to what extent this was due to Catherine's influence is a topic of much modern debate.<ref>See Bernard McGinn, ''The Varieties of Vernacular Mysticism'', (Herder & Herder, 2012), p561.</ref>\n\nCatherine returned to Siena and spent the early months of 1377 founding a women's monastery of strict observance outside the city in the old fortress of Belcaro.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}} She spent the rest of 1377 at Rocca d'Orcia, about twenty miles from Siena, on a local mission of peace-making and preaching. During this period, in autumn 1377, she had the experience which led to the writing of her ''Dialogue'' and learned to write, although she still seems to have chiefly relied upon her secretaries for her correspondence.<ref name=\"Gardner\" /><ref>This experience is recorded in Letter 272, written to Raymond in October 1377.</ref>\n\nLate in 1377 or early in 1378 Catherine again travelled to Florence, at the order of Gregory XI, to seek peace between Florence and Rome. Following Gregory's death in [[Western Schism|March 1378 riots]], the revolts of the [[Ciompi]], broke out in Florence on 18 June, and in the ensuing violence she was nearly assassinated. Eventually, in July 1378, peace was agreed between Florence and Rome; Catherine returned quietly to Florence.\n\nIn late November 1378, with the outbreak of the [[Western Schism]], the new Pope, [[Urban VI]], summoned her to Rome. She stayed at Pope Urban VI's court and tried to convince nobles and cardinals of his legitimacy, both meeting with individuals at court and writing letters to persuade others.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 6}}\n\nFor many years she had accustomed herself to a rigorous abstinence.<ref>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/CSIENA.HTM Butler, Alban. ''The Lives or the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints'', Vol. IV, D. & J. Sadlier, & Company, (1864)]</ref> She received the Holy [[Eucharist]] almost daily. This extreme fasting appeared unhealthy in the eyes of the clergy and her own sisterhood. Her confessor, Raymond, ordered her to eat properly. But Catherine claimed that she was unable to, describing her inability to eat as an ''infermit\u00e0'' (illness). From the beginning of 1380, Catherine could neither eat nor swallow water.

Though much of this material is heavily [[Hagiography|hagiographic]], it has been an important source for historians seeking to reconstruct Catherine's life. Various sources are particularly important, especially the works of Raymond of Capua, who was Catherine's spiritual director and close friend from 1374 until her death, and himself became [[Master of the Order of Preachers|Master General]] of the Order in 1380. Raymond began writing what is known as the ''Legenda Major'', his ''Life'' of Catherine, in 1384, and completed it in 1395.\n\nAnother important work written after Catherine's death was ''Libellus de Supplemento'' (''Little Supplement Book''), written between 1412 and 1418 by Tommaso d'Antonio Nacci da Siena (commonly called Thomas of Siena, or Tommaso Caffarini): the work is an expansion of Raymond's ''Legenda Major'' making heavy use of the notes of Catherine's first confessor, Tommaso della Fonte (notes that do not survive anywhere else). Caffarini later published a more compact account of Catherine's life, entitled the ''Legenda Minor''.\n\nFrom 1411 onwards, Caffarini also co-ordinated the compiling of the ''Processus'' of Venice, the set of documents submitted as part of the process of [[canonisation]] of Catherine, which provides [[Christian testimony|testimony]] from nearly all of Catherine's disciples. There is also an anonymous piece entitled \"Miracoli della Beata Caterina\" (''Miracle of Blessed Catherine''), written by an anonymous Florentine. A few other relevant pieces survive.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 2}}\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Caterina - Libro della divina dottrina, circa 1475 - 2367969.jpg|thumb|'' Libro della divina dottrina'' (commonly known as ''The Dialogue of Divine Providence''), c.1475]]\n[[File:L'epistole della serafica vergine s.

This had probably begun in October 1377 and was certainly finished by November 1378. Contemporaries of Catherine are united in asserting that much of the book was dictated while Catherine was in ecstasy, though it also seems possible that Catherine herself may then have re-edited many passages in the book.{{sfn|Noffke, p. 13}} It is a dialogue between a soul who \"rises up\" to God and God himself.\n* Catherine's letters are considered one of the great works of early Tuscan literature. Many of these were dictated, although she herself learned to write in 1377; 382 have survived.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported. It led President Trump to issue an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the Department of Health and Human Services ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded|date=March 19, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 20, 2020|last2=Lipton|first2=Eric|issn=0362-4331|last3=Sullivan|first3=Eileen|last4=Crowley|first4=Michael}}</ref> White House economists published a study in September 2019 that warned a pandemic could kill half a million Americans and devastate the economy.<ref>''[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-economy-trump.html White House Economists Warned in 2019 a Pandemic Could Devastate America]'' March 31, 2020 New York Times</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the WHO also ran a simulation exercise of a global pandemic response involving more than 40 countries, although the results appear to be unavailable.<ref>[https://www.who.int/ihr/eoc-exercise/en/ \"Simulation exercise puts global pandemic readiness to the test\"], World Health Organization, Dec. 3, 2018</ref>\n\n===Centralized biodefense strategy===\n\nCiting lessons learned from the swine flu pandemic, Ebola outbreak, and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], President Trump released a [[National Biodefense Strategy]] on September 18, 2018 in response to a Congressional directive.<ref name=\"statement\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Statement from the President on the National Biodefense Strategy and National Security Presidential Memorandum |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-national-biodefense-strategy-national-security-presidential-memorandum/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"UPI\">{{cite news |last1=Brokaw |first1=Sommer |title=Trump signs presidential memo on national biodefense |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/09/18/Trump-signs-presidential-memo-on-national-biodefense/2071537290820/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |agency=United Press International |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/4c21af485a7d4ccebb22f7316b55d014/White-House-sets-'new-direction'-in-biodefense-strategy|title=White House Sets 'New Direction' in Biodefense Strategy|date=September 18, 2018|agency=Associated Press|access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=BartholomewOmberg>Rachel Bartholomew & Kristin Omberg, [https://thebulletin.org/2019/01/making-sense-of-the-2018-national-biodefense-strategy/ Making sense of the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' (January 18, 2019).</ref> According to Trump, the new strategy was designed to strengthen the nation's defenses against disease outbreaks and bioterrorism and to make responses to them more efficient and better coordinated.<ref name=\"statement\" /><ref name=\"UPI\" /> Concurrently, he released a National Security Presidential Memorandum that appointed Secretary of HHS [[Alex Azar]] to oversee implementation of the government's new biodefense strategy and directed [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[John Bolton]] to assist in reviewing and improving the nation's biodefenses.<ref name=\"Owermohle\">{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/trump-hhs-biodefense-827973|title=Trump puts HHS in charge of defense against biological threats|last=Owermohle|first=Sarah|website=Politico|access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Memo\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Presidential Memorandum on the Support for National Biodefense |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-support-national-biodefense/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"statement\" /> At a time when multiple agencies and departments shared responsibility for biodefense,<ref name=BartholomewOmberg /> Bolton and Azar claimed this centralization of primary authority for biodefense in the HHS would provide greater accountability.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Kathryn |title=Trump administration outlines new biodefense approach |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-rolling-out-new-biodefense-strategy/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |publisher=CBS |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Reorganization and departures===\n\nIn May 2018, Bolton reorganized the executive branch's [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC), largely merging the group responsible for global [[health security]] and [[biodefense]] into a bigger group responsible for [[counter-proliferation]] and biodefense.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Jack Larsen is a recent transfer to the LAPD Threat Assessment Unit from the NYPD homicide division, whose confidence, strong personality, and questionable behavior has landed him in trouble before\u2014but whose past behavior may also prove valuable in his new job. His boss, Lt. Beth Davis, is strong, focused and an expert in the field, driven by her traumatic personal experience as a victim. With the rest of their team, young but eager Det. Ben Caldwell and deceptively smart Det. Janice Lawrence, Larsen and Davis assess the threat level of cases and respond before the stalking and intimidation spirals out of control, all while trying to keep their personal obsessions at bay.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n*[[Maggie Q]] as Beth Davis: a victim of stalking.

He recently transferred to the TAU from the [[NYPD]] Homicide Division to be near his son.

The TAU acts on further clues that lead them to the theory that Thomas was the intended target and not Hannah. They find a neighboring woman who lost a son about Thomas' age. Perry returns to confront Beth, who punched him in a parking lot in the previous episode. Janice invites Jack out for drinks to celebrate the collar in the Thomas case, but he politely refuses. Near the end of the episode, Amanda gives Jack a stern warning to leave L.A. within two weeks or she will reveal a damaging secret from his past.

But, in a twist, the team finds that Cara's father Jimmy ([[Louis Herthum]]), an LA policeman, has enemies\u2014including Silas Martin ([[Michael Irby]]), a [[Special Forces]] veteran whom Jimmy fired for being unstable. At the end of the episode, Jack learns he only got the TAU job because his former captain in New York was owed a favor by the L.A. captain, Trent, who is Beth's boss. Beth says there were 372 applicants and Jack wasn't even in the top 20, but she acknowledges, \"you're lucky you don't suck\".

Upon further investigation, Jack offers a theory that the suspect is motivated by excitement to terrorize his victims rather than kill them. This leads them to [[dating websites]] that connect the victims, and a past rape case in which the suspect, Chris Powell ([[David Chisum]]), was able to escape conviction. The rape victim reveals she moved to a top floor of a high-rise building because Powell has a fear of heights. After he and Beth locate the suspect in an abandoned office building, Jack uses Powell's fear to get him to reveal the location of his current victim. Elsewhere, Beth's friend Tracy talks about her romantic interest, a much younger man who is later revealed to be Perry. Perry extracts information about Beth from Tracy. He uses it to discover that \"Beth Davis\" did not exist until she enrolled in the police academy. It is also revealed that Perry has drawn several gruesome sketches of Beth and himself, including one in which he is choking her on a bed.

Ben finds evidence online that it was the ex-boyfriend's roommate, acting on his behalf. The girl and her roommate rent a house that is rumored to [[haunted house|be haunted]] after a woman Amy hung herself in the basement and her husband Greg committed suicide after discovering her body. When the girl is stalked again at the house, her ex-boyfriend and his roommate have indisputable alibis. Jack finds evidence in the basement, pointing the TAU team toward a professor of [[paranormal]] and [[occult]] studies at the college. However the professor dies when the girls throw a Halloween party at the house. Ben and Janice research the house's former owners. They call Jack to tell him the legend is only half true. Amy committed suicide, but there is no record of Greg's death. Jack discovers a hidden room in the basement. He is attacked by Greg, who is quickly neutralized by Beth. Elsewhere, Perry learns that Beth's real name is Michelle Webber. He reads an article that says Michelle had lost her family (father, mother, sister and family dog) in a house fire and she was the only survivor. A masked Perry later follows Beth around at the Halloween party, and she discovers him. He calls her Michelle in a low voice. At home, Beth calls a psychiatric institution and confirms that a certain patient number 5679 is still confined there and asks if he has had any visitors.

The home has been vandalized with graffiti about greed and evil. Andrea, the chair of an arts foundation, has a restraining order against her ex-husband, Kenneth ([[Alex Carter (Canadian actor)|Alex Carter]]). Detective Janice Lawrence is her case manager. They confront Kenneth in his new home with his new girlfriend, Melissa ([[Caity Lotz]]). The two insist it is they who are being harassed by Andrea. Next, Andrea returns home and opens a package addressed to her. It contains the dead body of her dog with a passage from the Bible about greed. Because of the Bible passage, the TAU team considers Melissa a suspect due to her father being a pastor. Andrea is then brutally attacked in a parking garage. Later at a charity event, Jack notes the [[font]] on some posters is the same as that used in the graffiti. The team then considers the artist (Michael Roark) a suspect. The artist has been sleeping with Andrea and says Andrea paid him to attack her. After the interview, Andrea's story begins to unravel. Meanwhile, Ethan bumps into Jack while Jack is watching him leave for school. Amanda confronts Jack and insists he must relocate immediately; her waiting time has ended. She mentions an incident in New York in which Jack had a romance with a witness, which she will report to Beth. Jack says if she does, Amanda will also be exposed for wrongdoing because she knew about the incident and did nothing. Jack tries to preempt any action by revealing the incident to Beth, who simply tells Jack to \"fix it\".

While she is home, her home is invaded; music plays, candles burn, a dinner has been prepared and flower petals are spread on the bed, but she does not get a good look at the invader. She has had four stalkers in the past three years. The team first investigates Heather Miller (Bethany Orr), a delusional, potentially violent stalker who had been arrested in the past, but she does not appear to fit the profile of the crime scene. They also investigate [[paparazzi|paparazzo]] Edward Gaines ([[Scott Michael Campbell]]), who has a knack for knowing exactly where Nina will be. Gaines reveals he has an [[inside job|inside]] [[informant]], Nina's sister and assistant Emily ([[Heather Matarazzo]]). When Nina learns of this betrayal, she and Emily have a bad fight. Nina banishes her from the house. Outside the house, Emily is attacked in a manner reminiscent of a scene from ''Savage Shore''. The team finds out the attacker, Robbie ([[Brendan Sexton III]]), has a delusional disorder but has stopped taking his [[anti-psychotic medication]]. Robbie's domineering and overprotective mother, Nancy ([[Molly Hagan]]), is revealed to have acted on her son's behalf. Meanwhile, Tracy's boyfriend \"Brody\" (Perry) steals Beth's personal information from Tracy's phone. He later breaks into Beth's home and makes himself comfortable while she is not there.

Without his shirt on, his tattoos reveal his [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathizing, [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] past to his neighbors. The team questions him about his past to assess the threat to his family. He explains that he changed his ways after falling in love with his Hispanic wife. Later Mark receives a phone call in which his family is threatened. He tells the team he recognizes the voice as Chad Hewitt (Darri Ingolfsson), a former protege who leads a white separatist group that Hewitt claims is a non-violent political organization. After the team questions Chad in his home, a bomb nearly kills Mark's son in his backyard. Mark assaults Chad in revenge, but after the TAU team questions Chad, they realize he did not plant the bomb. Attention turns to Mark's neighbors, one of whom is an Asian American who was the victim of a racially-motivated hate crime in the past. Elsewhere, Trent correctly deduces that Ethan is Jack's son. Trent asks Amanda why she will not let Jack have contact with Ethan. Amanda explains \"it's complicated,\" as Ethan listens from behind a wall.

At Claudia's home, Jack and Janice discover her attempting suicide in her garage. Verifying Claudia's alibi for the night of Lewis' office break-in, the team investigates other patients who had issues with Dr. Lewis. Ben finds negative reviews on a website, and Lewis suggests they were written by a former patient named Shelly Walker (Vedette Lim), an alcoholic whose posts blame Lewis for ruining her marriage. At Shelly's home, Jack and Ben find only her husband, Jason Walker ([[Wes Ramsey]]). Jason confirms Shelly left him when he became sober and she could not, but an interview with Shelly reveals it is Jason who is still drinking, while she is the sober one. The team returns to the house and finds liquor bottles along with proof that Jason wrote the damning web reviews of Lewis, posing as Shelly.

Later, Sophia ([[Chasty Ballesteros]]), a hairdresser, is attacked by a client, \"Danielle\", after hours in her hair salon. The TAU makes a connection and identifies \"Danielle\" as Cory James (A Leslie Kies). Cory had been reported missing by her mother (Jennifer Parsons) who explains her daughter changed drastically after the [[drug overdose]] death of her best friend. The TAU find a [[yearbook]] in Cory's room with pictures of Henry and Sophia blacked out. From this connection, Cory's motivation for the attacks is revealed: she and her friend were raped in high school. They eventually take Cory into custody, but they inform her they have caught and will prosecute her rapist which provides closure for her. Meanwhile, Beth explains to Tracy she has identified boyfriend \"Brody\" as Perry Whitley, a stalker she had previously arrested and tells her about the photos found in Perry's apartment. The TAU team ask Beth what is wrong, but she rebuffs their offers for help until after Perry confronts her in the parking lot, telling her he knows about her old life, especially about Ray burning down the house and killing her family.\n |LineColor       = 5A5953\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 11\n |Title           = Tell All\n |DirectedBy      = David Rodriguez\n |WrittenBy       = Sean Hennen\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|12|10}}\n |Viewers         = 7.25<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/12/11/wednesday-final-ratings-arrow-hells-kitchen-chicago-p-d-adjusted-up/338283/|title=Wednesday Final Ratings: 'Arrow', 'Hell's Kitchen' & 'Chicago P.D.'

Suspicion falls on Tom, but he appears to have a solid alibi. The TAU team finds that Stella has written a tell-all book that has yet to be published, and they start investigating people who were shown in a negative light in the book. But when a few of these people wind up missing, they learn the publisher has been leaking drafts of the book to create a pre-release anticipatory excitement and resulting chatter. The team finds that the missing people have disappeared in the order of the book's chapters. When the next victim that disappears is out of order, Ben deduces that the real suspect has an earlier draft of the book, leading the team via a [[ghostwriter]] back to Tom. Elsewhere, Beth finally asks Janice for help, revealing the issues with Perry. Beth says Perry is very intelligent, and he has not left behind clues that can get him arrested, so Janice provokes Perry until he explodes, after which he is arrested for attacking an officer. Ethan approaches Jack in the street, and Jack then goes to Amanda with suspicions that Ethan knows who he is. Amanda remembers the conversation with Trent and realizes that Ethan must have overheard.

Nicole's ex, Mike Harris ([[Samuel Page|Sam Page]]) is her boss in her lifeguard position at the beach. He agrees he didn't take the break-up well, but that he is happy for her.

The TAU acts on further clues that lead them to the theory that Thomas was the intended target and not Hannah. They find a neighboring woman who lost a son about Thomas' age. Perry returns to confront Beth, who punched him in a parking lot in the previous episode. Janice invites Jack out for drinks to celebrate the collar in the Thomas case, but he politely refuses.

This leads them to [[dating websites]] that connect the victims, and a past rape case in which the suspect, Chris Powell ([[David Chisum]]), was able to escape conviction. The rape victim reveals she moved to a top floor of a high-rise building because Powell has a fear of heights. After he and Beth locate the suspect in an abandoned office building, Jack uses Powell's fear to get him to reveal the location of his current victim. Elsewhere, Beth's friend Tracy talks about her romantic interest, a much younger man who is later revealed to be Perry. Perry extracts information about Beth from Tracy. He uses it to discover that \"Beth Davis\" did not exist until she enrolled in the police academy. It is also revealed that Perry has drawn several gruesome sketches of Beth and himself, including one in which he is choking her on a bed.

Ben finds evidence online that it was the ex-boyfriend's roommate, acting on his behalf. The girl and her roommate rent a house that is rumored to [[haunted house|be haunted]] after a woman Amy hung herself in the basement and her husband Greg committed suicide after discovering her body. When the girl is stalked again at the house, her ex-boyfriend and his roommate have indisputable alibis. Jack finds evidence in the basement, pointing the TAU team toward a professor of [[paranormal]] and [[occult]] studies at the college. However the professor dies when the girls throw a Halloween party at the house. Ben and Janice research the house's former owners. They call Jack to tell him the legend is only half true. Amy committed suicide, but there is no record of Greg's death. Jack discovers a hidden room in the basement. He is attacked by Greg, who is quickly neutralized by Beth. Elsewhere, Perry learns that Beth's real name is Michelle Webber. He reads an article that says Michelle had lost her family (father, mother, sister and family dog) in a house fire and she was the only survivor. A masked Perry later follows Beth around at the Halloween party, and she discovers him. He calls her Michelle in a low voice. At home, Beth calls a psychiatric institution and confirms that a certain patient number 5679 is still confined there and asks if he has had any visitors.

They confront Kenneth in his new home with his new girlfriend, Melissa ([[Caity Lotz]]). The two insist it is they who are being harassed by Andrea. Next, Andrea returns home and opens a package addressed to her. It contains the dead body of her dog with a passage from the Bible about greed. Because of the Bible passage, the TAU team considers Melissa a suspect due to her father being a pastor. Andrea is then brutally attacked in a parking garage. Later at a charity event, Jack notes the [[font]] on some posters is the same as that used in the graffiti. The team then considers the artist (Michael Roark) a suspect. The artist has been sleeping with Andrea and says Andrea paid him to attack her. After the interview, Andrea's story begins to unravel. Meanwhile, Ethan bumps into Jack while Jack is watching him leave for school. Amanda confronts Jack and insists he must relocate immediately; her waiting time has ended. She mentions an incident in New York in which Jack had a romance with a witness, which she will report to Beth. Jack says if she does, Amanda will also be exposed for wrongdoing because she knew about the incident and did nothing. Jack tries to preempt any action by revealing the incident to Beth, who simply tells Jack to \"fix it\".

While she is home, her home is invaded; music plays, candles burn, a dinner has been prepared and flower petals are spread on the bed, but she does not get a good look at the invader. She has had four stalkers in the past three years. The team first investigates Heather Miller (Bethany Orr), a delusional, potentially violent stalker who had been arrested in the past, but she does not appear to fit the profile of the crime scene. They also investigate [[paparazzi|paparazzo]] Edward Gaines ([[Scott Michael Campbell]]), who has a knack for knowing exactly where Nina will be. Gaines reveals he has an [[inside job|inside]] [[informant]], Nina's sister and assistant Emily ([[Heather Matarazzo]]). When Nina learns of this betrayal, she and Emily have a bad fight. Nina banishes her from the house. Outside the house, Emily is attacked in a manner reminiscent of a scene from ''Savage Shore''. The team finds out the attacker, Robbie ([[Brendan Sexton III]]), has a delusional disorder but has stopped taking his [[anti-psychotic medication]]. Robbie's domineering and overprotective mother, Nancy ([[Molly Hagan]]), is revealed to have acted on her son's behalf. Meanwhile, Tracy's boyfriend \"Brody\" (Perry) steals Beth's personal information from Tracy's phone. He later breaks into Beth's home and makes himself comfortable while she is not there.

Without his shirt on, his tattoos reveal his [[Nazism|Nazi]] sympathizing, [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] past to his neighbors. The team questions him about his past to assess the threat to his family. He explains that he changed his ways after falling in love with his Hispanic wife. Later Mark receives a phone call in which his family is threatened. He tells the team he recognizes the voice as Chad Hewitt (Darri Ingolfsson), a former protege who leads a white separatist group that Hewitt claims is a non-violent political organization. After the team questions Chad in his home, a bomb nearly kills Mark's son in his backyard. Mark assaults Chad in revenge, but after the TAU team questions Chad, they realize he did not plant the bomb. Attention turns to Mark's neighbors, one of whom is an Asian American who was the victim of a racially-motivated hate crime in the past. Elsewhere, Trent correctly deduces that Ethan is Jack's son. Trent asks Amanda why she will not let Jack have contact with Ethan. Amanda explains \"it's complicated,\" as Ethan listens from behind a wall.

Verifying Claudia's alibi for the night of Lewis' office break-in, the team investigates other patients who had issues with Dr. Lewis.

At Shelly's home, Jack and Ben find only her husband, Jason Walker ([[Wes Ramsey]]). Jason confirms Shelly left him when he became sober and she could not, but an interview with Shelly reveals it is Jason who is still drinking, while she is the sober one. The team returns to the house and finds liquor bottles along with proof that Jason wrote the damning web reviews of Lewis, posing as Shelly.
