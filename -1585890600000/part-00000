The manga provides a fictionalized account of the [[Warring States period]] primarily through the experiences of the war orphan [[Li Xin (Qin)|Xin]] and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens, and in doing so, unifying [[China]] for the first time in 500 years. \n\nThe series was adapted into a two-season [[anime]] television series by studio [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]]. The first season of 38 episodes aired from June 4, 2012 to February 25, 2013. A second season was announced, and aired for 39 episodes from June 8, 2013 to March 1, 2014. A third season by [[Studio Signpost]] will premiere in April 2020. A [[Kingdom (film)|live-action film]] was released in April 2019.\n\nThe anime has been licensed for an English language release by [[Funimation]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Historical context===\nThe story of ''Kingdom'' is a fictional adaptation of the Chinese history period known as the [[Warring States period]], which ended in 221 BC when [[Ying Zheng]], king of Qin, succeeded in [[Qin's wars of unification|conquering the other states]] and unifying China.\n\nSeveral of the characters are based on historical figures. Many times characters will take the names of people in history, and other times they will have completely different names. Oftentimes this is a result of Japanese [[Kanji]] borrowing from Chinese characters, meaning that there are some Chinese names that have no equivalent characters in [[Kanji]]. For example, Ou Ki's (\u738b\u9a0e), name is a slightly altered version of Wang Yi, \u738b\u9f6e, because the last character of his name, \u9f6e, does not exist in Kanji.\n\n===Plot===\nBorn in the [[Warring States period]] of ancient China, Xin and Piao are war-orphans in the kingdom of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] who dream of becoming \"Great Generals of the Heavens\" to rise from their lowly stations in life. One day, however, Piao is taken to the palace by a minister to be used for an unknown purpose, leaving Xin alone as a household slave in a peasant village. A few months later, Piao returns to the village on the verge of death, urging Xin to travel to another village. There he meets a boy who looks nearly identical to Piao, [[Ying Zheng]], the current King of Qin. Xin learns that Piao served as a body double for Ying Zheng, and was mortally wounded in a power struggle for the throne. Though initially furious at Ying Zheng for causing Piao's death, Xin decides to seize the opportunity and aid Ying Zheng in defeating his brother and reclaiming the Qin throne. Successful in this endeavor, Xin officially starts his life as a Qin commander on the battlefields of Warring States China with the goal of becoming the \"Greatest General in the World\", and to help King Zheng of Qin achieve his dream of total unification, ending the incessant warfare once and for all.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|[[Li Xin (Qin)|Li Xin]]|\u674e\u4fe1| Ri Shin}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Masakazu Morita]]|[[Cole Howard (voice actor)|Cole Howard]]}}\n:Xin (Shin in the Japanese version) is an orphan boy who grew up as a servant with his best friend Piao. Xin's behavior is predominantly impulsive, and despite that, he gives courage to the comrades around him. After Piao's death in episode 1, Xin decides to help the King of Qin, Ying Zheng (Ei Sei), escape from his enemies with He Liao Diao. Xin enlists in the State of Qin army soon after, and under Wang Qi (Ou Ki), he is appointed as the leader of the Feixin Unit (Hi Shin Unit), the newly formed 100-Man special unit. Appointing Qiang Lei (Kyou Kai) and Yuan (En) as his lieutenants, Xin joins Wang Qi in his conquest of the State of Zhao Army. During the conflict with the State of Wei, he proclaims to the supreme commander of the Wei Army that he will unify all of China, signifying that his and Ying Zheng's \"paths\" have become interlocked. \n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Ying Zheng]]|\u5b34\u653f|Ei Sei}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Jun Fukuyama]]|[[Micah Solusod]]}}\n:Ying Zheng is the 31st king of the State of Qin. Piao is identical to him, and thus becomes Ying Zheng's double in his escape. He has stated that he will unify all of China, but has only a few years to do so due to the enemies that lay outside of the Qin state (the Zhao, Wie, Chu, and other remaining nations) and internal problems within the country, such as political rivalries with the Queen Dowager and the Royal Harem. Although king, Ying Zheng's power is limited due to the political turmoil with his minister who plans to take the throne. His and Xin's goals became unified when Xin declared that he would be Ying Zheng's \"sword\" in the unification of China. He has a child with the servant woman Xiang (Kou) named Rei.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Piao|\u6f02|Hy\u014d}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Jun Fukuyama]]|}}\n:Xin's childhood best friend and fellow war orphan who also aims to become a general renowned throughout all of China, he is offered a position in the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] palace as Zheng's body double, which he accepts, only to die at the hands of an assassin hired by the Cheng Jiao Faction. Piao is a fictional character created by the author and does not exist in history.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Heliao Diao|\u6cb3\u4e86\u8c82|Kary\u014d Ten}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Rie Kugimiya]]|Shannon Chan-Kent}}\n:He Liao Diao (Ka Ryo Ten) is the last descendant of a mountain tribe who joins Xin in helping Ying Zheng escape from the soldiers chasing him. After witnessing Wang Qi and Xin's war against the Zhao, she (keeping her identity a secret and calling herself a male due to her boyish and childish appearance) is forced to stay at Xin's newly constructed, but poor looking, house. Soon after his return, she states that she will [[Women in ancient warfare|join]] the State of Qin Army but is laughed at. Later in the story, He Liao Diao is taken in as an apprentice of strategic warfare, soon after becoming the strategist for the Feixin Unit. Her first kiss was with Xin, albeit accidentally, and he has groped her several times, also on accident. It is hinted that she has feelings for Xin, however, his relationship with her is seen as a brother-sister one.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chang Wen Jun|[[:zh:\u660c\u6587\u541b|\u660c\u6587\u541b]]|Sh\u014dbun-kun}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Yutaka Nakano]]|}}\n:A formerly skilled warrior who worked his way up to \u201c[[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] of the Left\u201d (chapter 256), a senior adviser of the king. He is shown to be extremely loyal to the Ying Zheng faction, aiding him in both reclaiming the throne and the current in political struggle against L\u00fc Buwei.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Bi|\u58c1|Heki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Koji Yusa]]|}}\n:Chang Wen Jun's loyal subordinate. At the series start, Heki was a 1000-man commander (chapter 51). By chapter 218, he commands a 1000-man army. Heki is the 3000-man commander in chapter 294. After fighting alongside Xin in many military campaigns, he rises to the rank of General (chapter 372) and is currently seeking greater heights to earn more influence for Ying Zheng (since chapter 51). Xin is shown to rely on him and he has had a crush on Y\u014dtanwa since chapter 22.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Qiang Lei|[[:zh:\u7f8c\u7623|\u7f8c\u7623]]|Ky\u014d Kai}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|}}\n:Qiang Lei (Kyou Kai) is a former heir to the Shi Y\u016b ([[Chi You]]), an assassin group with barbaric traditions used to cultivate strong assassins at the expense of killing undesirable candidates. After the death of her sister, Qiang Xiang (Kyou Shou),  in one of these traditions, Qiang Lei vowed revenge against the woman who had killed her. She joined the Feixin Unit (as a young boy, keeping her sex a secret like He Liao Diao) after its formation and became a vice commander, despite the fact that she is stronger and smarter than Xin (as shown by her power and the fact that she created the strategies for them). She reveals her identity to Xin and becomes more friendly and open towards he alone before finally accepting her place in the unit and calling it her home. She may have feelings for Xin which have been hinted at on many occasions, one being her confession of wanting to have a child with him (she did not know about intercourse at the time).\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n''Kingdom'' is written and illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara and originated from two one-shots he drew on Li Mu and Meng Wu.

The manga provides a fictionalized account of the [[Warring States period]] primarily through the experiences of the war orphan [[Li Xin (Qin)|Xin]] and his comrades as he fights to become the greatest general under the heavens, and in doing so, unifying [[China]] for the first time in 500 years. \n\nThe series was adapted into a two-season [[anime]] television series by studio [[Pierrot (company)|Pierrot]]. The first season of 38 episodes aired from June 4, 2012 to February 25, 2013. A second season was announced, and aired for 39 episodes from June 8, 2013 to March 1, 2014. A third season by [[Studio Signpost]] will premiere in April 2020. A [[Kingdom (film)|live-action film]] was released in April 2019.\n\nThe anime has been licensed for an English language release by [[Funimation]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Historical context===\nThe story of ''Kingdom'' is a fictional adaptation of the Chinese history period known as the [[Warring States period]], which ended in 221 BC when [[Ying Zheng]], king of Qin, succeeded in [[Qin's wars of unification|conquering the other states]] and unifying China.\n\nSeveral of the characters are based on historical figures. Many times characters will take the names of people in history, and other times they will have completely different names. Oftentimes this is a result of Japanese [[Kanji]] borrowing from Chinese characters, meaning that there are some Chinese names that have no equivalent characters in [[Kanji]]. For example, Ou Ki's (\u738b\u9a0e), name is a slightly altered version of Wang Yi, \u738b\u9f6e, because the last character of his name, \u9f6e, does not exist in Kanji.\n\n===Plot===\nBorn in the [[Warring States period]] of ancient China, Xin and Piao are war-orphans in the kingdom of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] who dream of becoming \"Great Generals of the Heavens\" to rise from their lowly stations in life. One day, however, Piao is taken to the palace by a minister to be used for an unknown purpose, leaving Xin alone as a household slave in a peasant village. A few months later, Piao returns to the village on the verge of death, urging Xin to travel to another village. There he meets a boy who looks nearly identical to Piao, [[Ying Zheng]], the current King of Qin. Xin learns that Piao served as a body double for Ying Zheng, and was mortally wounded in a power struggle for the throne. Though initially furious at Ying Zheng for causing Piao's death, Xin decides to seize the opportunity and aid Ying Zheng in defeating his brother and reclaiming the Qin throne. Successful in this endeavor, Xin officially starts his life as a Qin commander on the battlefields of Warring States China with the goal of becoming the \"Greatest General in the World\", and to help King Zheng of Qin achieve his dream of total unification, ending the incessant warfare once and for all.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|[[Li Xin (Qin)|Li Xin]]|\u674e\u4fe1| Ri Shin}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Masakazu Morita]]|[[Cole Howard (voice actor)|Cole Howard]]}}\n:Xin (Shin in the Japanese version) is an orphan boy who grew up as a servant with his best friend Piao. Xin's behavior is predominantly impulsive, and despite that, he gives courage to the comrades around him. After Piao's death in episode 1, Xin decides to help the King of Qin, Ying Zheng (Ei Sei), escape from his enemies with He Liao Diao. Xin enlists in the State of Qin army soon after, and under Wang Qi (Ou Ki), he is appointed as the leader of the Feixin Unit (Hi Shin Unit), the newly formed 100-Man special unit. Appointing Qiang Lei (Kyou Kai) and Yuan (En) as his lieutenants, Xin joins Wang Qi in his conquest of the State of Zhao Army. During the conflict with the State of Wei, he proclaims to the supreme commander of the Wei Army that he will unify all of China, signifying that his and Ying Zheng's \"paths\" have become interlocked. \n\n;{{Nihongo|[[Ying Zheng]]|\u5b34\u653f|Ei Sei}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Jun Fukuyama]]|Micah Solusod}}\n:Ying Zheng is the 31st king of the State of Qin. Piao is identical to him, and thus becomes Ying Zheng's double in his escape. He has stated that he will unify all of China, but has only a few years to do so due to the enemies that lay outside of the Qin state (the Zhao, Wie, Chu, and other remaining nations) and internal problems within the country, such as political rivalries with the Queen Dowager and the Royal Harem. Although king, Ying Zheng's power is limited due to the political turmoil with his minister who plans to take the throne. His and Xin's goals became unified when Xin declared that he would be Ying Zheng's \"sword\" in the unification of China. He has a child with the servant woman Xiang (Kou) named Rei.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Piao|\u6f02|Hy\u014d}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Jun Fukuyama]]|}}\n:Xin's childhood best friend and fellow war orphan who also aims to become a general renowned throughout all of China, he is offered a position in the [[Qin (state)|Qin]] palace as Zheng's body double, which he accepts, only to die at the hands of an assassin hired by the Cheng Jiao Faction. Piao is a fictional character created by the author and does not exist in history.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Heliao Diao|\u6cb3\u4e86\u8c82|Kary\u014d Ten}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Rie Kugimiya]]|Shannon Chan-Kent}}\n:He Liao Diao (Ka Ryo Ten) is the last descendant of a mountain tribe who joins Xin in helping Ying Zheng escape from the soldiers chasing him. After witnessing Wang Qi and Xin's war against the Zhao, she (keeping her identity a secret and calling herself a male due to her boyish and childish appearance) is forced to stay at Xin's newly constructed, but poor looking, house. Soon after his return, she states that she will [[Women in ancient warfare|join]] the State of Qin Army but is laughed at. Later in the story, He Liao Diao is taken in as an apprentice of strategic warfare, soon after becoming the strategist for the Feixin Unit. Her first kiss was with Xin, albeit accidentally, and he has groped her several times, also on accident. It is hinted that she has feelings for Xin, however, his relationship with her is seen as a brother-sister one.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Chang Wen Jun|[[:zh:\u660c\u6587\u541b|\u660c\u6587\u541b]]|Sh\u014dbun-kun}}\n:{{animevoices|Nakano Yutaka|}}\n:A formerly skilled warrior who worked his way up to \u201c[[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] of the Left\u201d (chapter 256), a senior adviser of the king. He is shown to be extremely loyal to the Ying Zheng faction, aiding him in both reclaiming the throne and the current in political struggle against L\u00fc Buwei.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Bi|\u58c1|Heki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Koji Yusa]]|}}\n:Chang Wen Jun's loyal subordinate. At the series start, Heki was a 1000-man commander (chapter 51). By chapter 218, he commands a 1000-man army. Heki is the 3000-man commander in chapter 294. After fighting alongside Xin in many military campaigns, he rises to the rank of General (chapter 372) and is currently seeking greater heights to earn more influence for Ying Zheng (since chapter 51). Xin is shown to rely on him and he has had a crush on Y\u014dtanwa since chapter 22.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Qiang Lei|[[:zh:\u7f8c\u7623|\u7f8c\u7623]]|Ky\u014d Kai}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Hikasa Yoko]]|}}\n:Qiang Lei (Kyou Kai) is a former heir to the Shi Y\u016b ([[Chi You]]), an assassin group with barbaric traditions used to cultivate strong assassins at the expense of killing undesirable candidates. After the death of her sister, Qiang Xiang (Kyou Shou),  in one of these traditions, Qiang Lei vowed revenge against the woman who had killed her. She joined the Feixin Unit (as a young boy, keeping her sex a secret like He Liao Diao) after its formation and became a vice commander, despite the fact that she is stronger and smarter than Xin (as shown by her power and the fact that she created the strategies for them). She reveals her identity to Xin and becomes more friendly and open towards he alone before finally accepting her place in the unit and calling it her home. She may have feelings for Xin which have been hinted at on many occasions, one being her confession of wanting to have a child with him (she did not know about intercourse at the time).\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n''Kingdom'' is written and illustrated by Yasuhisa Hara and originated from two one-shots he drew on Li Mu and Meng Wu.

The State Government identified the Capital City area between Vijayawada and Guntur cities on the Southern bank of River Krishna upstream of Prakasam Barrage. The Amaravati Capital City has an area of 217.23 km<sup>2</sup> and is spread across 25 villages in 3 mandals (Thulluru, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli) of Guntur district. The 25 villages in the Capital City area have about 1 lakh population in about 27,000 households. The nearest cities are Vijayawada at a distance of 30 km and Guntur at a distance of 18 km. The nearest railway station is KC Canal railway station near Tadepalli and the nearest airport is Gannavaram which is at a distance of 22 km. The city is planned to spread over 217 km<sup>2</sup> area with a total cost of \u20b9 553.43 billions to the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) out of which state government contribution is only \u20b9 126 billion (equity \u20b9 66.29 billion and supporting grant \u20b9 59.71 billion) spread over a period of 8 years from April 2018 to March 2026 (\u20b9 5 billion in 2018\u201319, \u20b9 18 billion per year for later six years and \u20b9 13 billion in 2025\u201326).<ref name=\"amr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eenadu.net/eenadu-exclusive/newsarticle/general/1500/120008374|title=Amaravati city a self financed project |language=Telugu|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA)\n|'''City area details:'''\n|'''Land utilization'''\n|-\n|Roads, public utilities, parks, natural streams, water bodies\n|27,885 acres\n|-\n|Plots for residential area allotted to the Land contributors(Farmers)\n|11,826 acres\n|-\n|For the needs of other developments presently owned by the CRDA\n|14,037 acres\n|-\n|Total area under the jurisdiction of CRDA\n|53,748 acres\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Amaravati City Land Usage\n!Land use\n!Area (Sq.&nbsp;km)\n!'''%'''\n|-\n|Residential\n|60.77\n|27.9\n|-\n|Commercial\n|20.99\n|9.34\n|-\n|Public and Semi Public\n|11.49\n|5.29\n|-\n|Open spaces and Recreation\n|52.78\n|24.29\n|-\n|Industrial\n|12.26\n|5.64\n|-\n|Water Bodies\n|25.78\n|11.87\n|-\n|Traffic and Transportation\n|23.04\n|10.61\n|-\n|Cultural Heritage\n|0.15\n|0.07\n|-\n|Seed Capital\n|10.67\n|4.91\n|-\n|Total\n|217.23\n|100\n|}\nThe contribution from the government is to be repaid by the CRDA after the year 2037.
