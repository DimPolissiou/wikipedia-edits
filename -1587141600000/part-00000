In the UK, it is produced by the BBC. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9- to12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although they do not address the viewer's directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final.  Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

introduced in 2008.\n\n==''Junior MasterChef''==\n{{main article|Junior MasterChef}}\n''Junior MasterChef'' originally ran from 1994 to 1999 for under-16s. It was revived in 2010 with an age range of nine to twelve. A second series of the revived format ran in 2012, with a third following in 2014.\n\n== 2018 ''Rendang'' controversy ==\n''MasterChef'' was involved in a controversy (during Series 14, Episode 13) when Zaleha Kadir Olpin, a Malaysian-born contestant who had cooked ''[[nasi lemak]]'' and [[rendang]], native Southeast Asian dishes, was criticised by judges Gregg Wallace and John Torode because the dish was of poor quality. She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available.  Many commentators (who did not realise what the competition was about), particularly from Malaysia and Indonesia, pointed out that rendang is usually cooked as a stew and is not crispy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title='I would rendang his head': UK MasterChef judges stir up a storm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/i-would-rendang-his-head-uk-masterchef-judges-stir-up-a-storm|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The judges failed to differentiate between \"crispy\" and \"undercooked\".

competitive cooking show produced by [[Endemol Shine Group]] and is broadcasted in 60 countries around the world. In the UK, it is produced by the BBC. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''MasterChef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9-to-12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final, in which they competed for the title of ''MasterChef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, in addition to which they could bring in up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants and finally ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the programme asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant could only use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone, with Rhodes' advice to contestants being more critical in style than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although they don't address the viewer's directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voiceover by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programmes, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final.  Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''MasterChef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''MasterChef Live''==\n''MasterChef Live'' is an extension of the television programme. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theatre, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity MasterChef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity MasterChef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

It was a transitional tournament after the schism of [[Football in Uruguay|Uruguayan football]] in 1922, when the [[Uruguayan Football Federation|Federaci\u00f3n Uruguaya de Football]] (FUF) was established as a dissident body from official [[Uruguayan Football Association]] (AUF). [[Pe\u00f1arol]] was the champion.\n\n==History==\nAfter the schism of 1922, [[Central Football Club|Central]] and [[Pe\u00f1arol]] were disaffiliated from the association. Both associations, FUF and AUF, organised their own tournaments separately. With several attempts to reunification failed, the Government of Uruguay intervened to solve the problem and as a result, the AUF decided not to held a championship in 1925.\n\nAs the situation had not significantly changed in 1926, the AUF did not organise an official championship either. With the purpose of joining both associations, AUF and FUF, the National Government established a provisional championship, named \"H\u00e9ctor R. G\u00f3mez\", to be played in two series.\n\nIt was played in two groups, \"serie A\", with all the clubs of [[Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] (with the exception of Charley and Dublin, that had left the league some time ago). It was also stated that all of them would play the [[1927 Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1927 Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] championship. On the other hand, the \"serie B\" included the rest of the teams of both associations. The ten clubs best placed at the end of the tournament, would qualify to play the 1927 Primera Divisi\u00f3n season with the other 10 clubs of serie A. \n\nAs the AUF didn't organise the Consejo Provisorio championship, the association has not recognised it as official.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110903091908/http://www.observa.com.uy/deporte/campeones.aspx Campeones Torneo Uruguayo] on ''El Observador''</ref><ref>[http://www.ovaciondigital.com.uy/futbol/campeonato-uruguayo-penarol-nacional-titulos-futbol.html Hasta ahora se jugaron 109 Uruguayos] on Ovaci\u00f3n Digital</ref>\n\n==League standings==\n{{#invoke:sports table|main|style=WDL\n|res_col_header=Q\n|sortable_table=y\n|winpoints=2\n\n|team1=PE\u00d1|name_PE\u00d1=[[Pe\u00f1arol]]\n|team2=WAN|name_WAN=[[Montevideo Wanderers F.C.|Montevideo Wanderers]]\n|team3=RAJ|name_RAJ=[[Rampla Juniors]]\n|team4=NAC|name_NAC=[[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]]\n|team5=LIT|name_LIT=[[Centro Atl\u00e9tico Lito|Lito]]\n|team6=CES|name_CES=[[Central Espa\u00f1ol|Central]]\n|team7=LIV|name_LIV=[[Liverpool FC (Montevideo)|Liverpool]]\n|team8=BEL|name_BEL=[[Belgrano Football Club|Belgrano]]\n|team9=ONW|name_ONW=[[Uruguay Onward]]\n|team10=UNV|name_UNV=[[Universal Football Club|Universal]]\n|win_PE\u00d1=13|draw_PE\u00d1=5|loss_PE\u00d1=0|gf_PE\u00d1=27|ga_PE\u00d1=5\n|win_WAN=11|draw_WAN=3|loss_WAN=4|gf_WAN=35|ga_WAN=17\n|win_RAJ=12|draw_RAJ=1|loss_RAJ=5|gf_RAJ=29|ga_RAJ=14\n|win_NAC=11|draw_NAC=2|loss_NAC=5|gf_NAC=36|ga_NAC=16\n|win_LIT=10|draw_LIT=4|loss_LIT=4|gf_LIT=42|ga_LIT=20\n|win_CES=8|draw_CES=2|loss_CES=8|gf_CES=24|ga_CES=25\n|win_LIV=5|draw_LIV=3|loss_LIV=10|gf_LIV=16|ga_LIV=25\n|win_BEL=4|draw_BEL=2|loss_BEL=12|gf_BEL=19|ga_BEL=32\n|win_ONW=3|draw_ONW=2|loss_ONW=13|gf_ONW=15|ga_ONW=45\n|win_UNV=1|draw_UNV=0|loss_UNV=17|gf_UNV=10|ga_UNV=54\n<!--\n|adjust_points_ONW=1|hth_ONW=1 bonus point?\n-->\n|col_C=green1|text_C=\n|result1=C\n|update=complete|source=[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/uruhist.html rsssf.com]\n}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n*[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesu/uruhist.html Uruguay - List of final tables (RSSSF)]\n\n{{Primera Divisi\u00f3n Uruguaya seasons}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1926 Uruguayan Primera Division}}\n[[Category:Uruguayan Primera Divisi\u00f3n seasons]]\n[[Category:1926 in South American football leagues|Uru]]\n[[Category:1926 in Uruguayan football]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox football league season\n| competition               = Primera Divisi\u00f3n (CP) <br> Serie A\n| logo                      =\n| image                     =\n| pixels                    = <!-- width of image in pixels (px) -->\n| alt                       =\n| caption                   =\n| season                    = 1926\n| dates                     = \n| winners                   = [[Pe\u00f1arol]]\n| American                  = <!-- changes \"Champions\" to \"Champion(s)\" -->\n| shieldtitle               =\n| shield                    =\n| premiers                  = \n| promoted                  = (None)\n| relegated                 = (None)\n| continentalcup1           =\n| continentalcup1qualifiers =\n| continentalcup2           =\n| continentalcup2qualifiers =\n| continentalcup3           =\n| continentalcup3qualifiers =\n| continentalcup4           =\n| continentalcup4qualifiers =\n| matches                   = 90\n| matches footnote          =\n| total goals               = 253\n| total goals footnote      =\n| average goals             =\n| best player               =\n| league topscorer          =\n| best goalkeeper           =\n| biggest home win          =\n| biggest away win          =\n| highest scoring           =\n| longest wins              =\n| longest unbeaten          =\n| longest winless           =\n| longest losses            =\n| highest attendance        =\n| lowest attendance         =\n| attendance                =\n| average attendance        =\n| prevseason                =\n| nextseason                =\n| updated                   =\n| extra information         =\n}}\n\nThe '''Torneo del Consejo Provisorio''' was a [[association football|football]] championship organised by an Interim Council (\"Consejo Provisorio\") in 1926.

The term, however, was being incorrectly applied to former ''[[alipin]]'' (commoner and slave class) who have escaped bondage by payment, favor, or flight. Moreover, the Tagalog ''timawa'' did not have the military prominence of the Visayan ''timawa''. The equivalent warrior class in the Tagalog society was present only in Laguna, and they were known as the ''[[maharlika]]'' class.\n\nAt the bottom of the social hierarchy are the members of the ''alipin'' class. There are two main subclasses of the ''alipin'' class. The ''[[aliping namamahay]]'' who owned their own houses and served their masters by paying tribute or working on their fields were the commoners and [[serf]]s, while the ''[[aliping sa gigilid]]'' who lived in their masters' houses were the servants and slaves.\n\nThe more complex social structure of the Tagalogs was less stable during the arrival of the Spaniards because it was still in a process of differentiating.<ref name=\"Scott1982\"/>{{rp|pages=\"124\u2013125\"}}{{vague|date=June 2017}}\n\n=== Political leadership structure ===\n{{Main|Paramount rulers in early Philippine history}}\nTondo was a large coastal settlement led by several leaders, called [[Datu]], who had their own followings, called either \"Dulohan\" or \"Barangay\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/> These Datus with their respective Barangays in turn acknowledged the leadership of a datu with the most senior rank - a \"paramount ruler\"<ref name=\"Junker1998\"/> or \"paramount datu\",<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/> who was called a \"Lakan\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/> According to San Buenaventura, a large coastal settlement with this kind of leadership structure was called a \"Bayan\".<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/>\n\nThe equivalent Paramount Datus who led the southern polity of Maynila were referred to using the term \"[[Raja]]h\", and in Mindanao, a similar title in more Islamized polities was that of \"[[Sultan]]\".<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>\n\nThe term for the [[Barangay state|Barangay]] social groupings refers to the large ships called ''[[balangay]]'', which were common on such coastal polities, and is used by present-day scholars to describe the leadership structure of settlements in early Philippine history. This leads to some confusion for modern readers, because the term \"barangay\" was also later adapted (through the 1991 [[Philippine legal codes#Local Government Code|Local Government Code]]) as a replacement for the Spanish term ''[[barrio]]'' to describe the smallest [[administrative division]] in the [[Philippines|modern Republic of the Philippines]] - a government structure very different from the original meaning of the word.<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/><ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\nIn addition, Jocano warns that there were significant differences between \"smaller\" barangays, which were only 30 to 100 households in size, and considerably larger barangays, which according to Buenaventura were called \"Bayan\".<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/> Jocano asserted that the social and governance structures of these larger Barangays, with high levels of economic specialization and a clear system of social stratification, should be the primary model for the analysis of social structures in early Philippine history, rather than the \"smaller\" barangays.<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>\n\nPopular literature has described these political entities as either chiefdoms or kingdoms.<ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/><ref name=\"Joaquin1990\"/> Although modern scholars such as Renfew note that these are not appropriate technical descriptions.<ref name=\"RenfewandShennan1982\"/><ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/>\n\nContemporary historiographers specializing in early Philippine history prefer to use the generic term \"[[polity]]\" in international journals,<ref name=\"RenfewandShennan1982\"/><ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/> avoiding the terms \"chiefdom\" and \"kingdom\" altogether.\n\nScholars such as [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] and [[F.

Buenaventura was informed that this was because the Tagalogs believed Bathala was too mighty and distant to be bothered with the concerns of mortal man, and so the Tagalogs focused their acts of appeasement to \"lesser\" deities and powers,<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> immediate spirits which they believed had control over their day-to-day life.<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\nBecause the Tagalogs did not have a collective word to describe all these spirits together, Spanish missionaries eventually decided to call them \"anito,\" since they were the subject of the Tagalog's act of ''pag-aanito'' (worship).<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> According to Scott, accounts and early dictionaries describe them as intermediaries (\"Bathala's agents\"), and the dictionaries used the word ''abogado'' (advocate) when defining their realms. These sources also show, however, that in practice, they were addressed directly: \"''in actual prayers, they were petitioned directly, not as intermediaries.''\" Modern day writers divide these spirits are broadly into the categories of \"Ancestor spirits, nature spirits, and guardian spirits,\" although they also note that the dividing line between these categories is often blurred.<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/>\n\nDemetrio, Cordero-Fernando, and Nakpil Zialcita<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> observe that the Luzon Tagalogs and Kapampangans' use of the word \"Anito\", instead of the word \"Diwata\" which was more predominant in the Visayan regions, indicated that these peoples of Luzon were less influenced by the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs of the Majapahit empire than the Visayans were.<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> They also observed that the words were used alternately amongst the peoples in the southernmost portions of Luzon - the [[Bicol Region]], [[Marinduque]], [[Mindoro]], etc. They suggested that this have represented transitional area, the front lines of an increased \"Indianized\" Majapahit influence which was making its way north<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> the same way Islam was making its way north from Mindanao.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n=== Localization of other beliefs ===\nAlthough most contemporary historians,<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> approaching Philippines from the point of view of [[critical historiography]], assert the predominance of indigenous religious beliefs,<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> they also note that there are significant manifestations of other belief systems in early Tagalog history.<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>  While it was common among mid-20th century historians and in earlier texts to use these manifestations as evidence of \"influence,\"<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/> more contemporary scholars of southeast Asian history have emphasized that the manifestations of these beliefs do not necessarily reflect outright adoption of these religions, but rather of syncretistic adaptation<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> or \"localization.\"<ref name=\"Milner2011\"/><ref name=\"Wolters1999\"/>\n\nOsborne (2004) describes a process of \"adaptation\" happening in connection with Hindu and Buddhist influences in the various cultures of Maritime Southeast Asia,<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> and emphasizes that this \"indianization\" of Southeast Asia did not per-se overwrite existing indigenous patterns, cultures, and beliefs: <blockquote>\"''Because Indian culture \u201ccame\u201d to Southeast Asia, one must not think that Southeast Asians lacked a culture of their own.

The Bruneians installed the Muslim rajahs, [[Rajah Salalila]] and [[Rajah Matanda]] in the south (now the [[Intramuros]] district) and the Buddhist-Hindu settlement was ruled under Lakan Dula in northern Tundun (now in modern [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]]).<ref>Teodoro Agoncillo, History of the Filipino People, p. 22</ref> Islamization of Luzon began in the 16th century when traders from Brunei settled in the Manila area and married locals while maintaining kinship and trade links with Brunei and thus other Muslim centres in Southeast Asia. The Muslims were called \"[[Moro people|Moros]]\" by the Spanish who assumed they occupied the whole coast. There is no evidence that Islam had become a major political or religious force in the region, with Father Diego de Herrera recording that the Moros lived only in some villages and were Muslim in name only.<ref name=\"Newson2009\"/>\n\n==Economic activities==\nHistorians widely agree that the larger coastal polities which flourished throughout the Philippine archipelago in the period immediately prior to the arrival of the Spanish colonizers (including Tondo and Maynila) were \"organizationally complex\", demonstrating both economic specialization and a level of social stratification which would have led to a local demand for \"prestige goods\".<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>\n\nSpecialized industries in the Tagalog and Kapampangan regions, including Tondo and Maynila, included agriculture, textile weaving, basketry, metallurgy, hunting, among others.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> The social stratification which gave birth to the Maginoo class created a demand for prestige products including ceramics, textiles, and precious stones.<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> This demand, in turn, served as the impetus for both internal and external trade.\n\nJunker notes that significant work still needs to be done in analyzing the internal/local supply and demand dynamics in pre-Spanish era polities, because much of the prior research has tended to focus on their external trading activities.<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> Scott notes that early Spanish lexicons are particularly useful for this analysis, because these early dictionaries captured many words which demonstrate the varied nuances of these local economic activities.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n=== Trade ===\nJunker describes coastal polities of Tondo and Maynila's size as \"administrative and commercial centers functioning as important nodes in networks of external and internal trade.\"<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> While the basic model for the movement of trade goods in early Philippine history saw coastal settlements at the mouth of large rivers (in this case, the Pasig river delta) controlling the flow of goods to and from settlements further upriver (in this case, the upland polities on the Laguna Lake coast),<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> Tondo and Maynila had trade arrangements which allowed them to control trade throughout the rest of the archipelago.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott observes that while the port of Tondo had the monopoly on arriving Chinese merchant ships, it was Manila's fleet of trading vessels which in turn retailed them to settlements throughout the rest of the archipelago, so much so that Manyila's ships came to be known as \"Chinese\" (sinina).<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n==== Redistribution of Chinese goods ====\n[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tondo and Maynila's shared trade relations with China make the Manila bay area one of the northernmost points on the route of the [[Silk Road]].]]\nThe most lucrative of Tondo's economic activities involved the redistribution of Chinese goods, which would arrive in Manila bay through Tondo's port and be  distributed throughout the rest of the archipelago, mostly through Maynila's extensive shipping activities.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\nThe Chinese migrations to [[Malaysia|Malaya]] and the [[Philippines]] shore began in the 7th century and reached their peak after 1644 owing to the [[Manchu]] conquest of [[Ancient China|China]]. These Chinese immigrants settled in [[Manila]], [[Pasig]] included, and in the other ports, which were annually visited by their trade [[junks]], they have cargoes of [[silk]], [[tea]], [[ceramics]], and their precious [[jade]] stones.<ref>http://beta.pasigcity.gov.ph/subpages/aboutpasig/timeline-pc.aspx</ref>\n\nAccording to William Henry Scott (1982), when ships from China came to Manila bay, Lakandula would remove the sails and rudders of their ships until they paid him duties and anchorage fees, and then he would then buy up all their goods himself, paying half its value immediately and then paying the other half upon their return the following year.  In the interim, these goods would be traded throughout the rest of the archipelago. The end result was that other locals were not able to buy anything from the Chinese directly, but from Tondo<ref name=\"Scott1982\"/> and Maynila,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> who made a tidy profit as a result.\n\nAugustinian Fray Martin de Rada Legaspi says that the Tagalogs were \"''more traders than warriors''\",<ref name=\"Scott1982\"/> and Scott notes in a later book (1994)<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> that Maynila's ships got their goods from Tondo and then dominated trade through the rest of the archipelago.

The Sultan responded by giving Ache a position as commander of his naval force.<ref name=\"AganduruMoriz1882\"/>\n\nIn 1521, Prince Ache was coming fresh from a military victory at the helm of the Bruneian navy and was supposedly on his way back to Maynila with the intent of confronting his cousin when he came upon and attacked the remnants of the Magellan expedition, then under the command of [[Sebastian Elcano]]. Some historians<ref name=\"Dery2001\"/><ref name=\"RizalAche\">Jose Rizal, as cited by Dery, 2001</ref><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> suggest that Ache's decision to attack must have been influenced by a desire to expand his fleet even further as he made his way back to Lusong and Maynila,<ref name=\"Dery2001\"/> where he could use the size of his fleet as leverage against his cousin, the ruler of Tondo.<ref name=\"Dery2001\"/>\n\n=== Exclusion from the Battle of Manila (May 1570) ===\n{{main|Battle of Manila (1570)}}\nTondo and its rulers were initially ignored by the Spanish during the conquest of Manila bay, because the Spanish focused their attention on Manila, which had fortifications that Tondo did not.<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\nWhile Spanish colonizers first arrived in the Philippines in 1521, the Spanish only reached the [[Manila Bay]] area and its settlements in 1570, when Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi sent [[Mart\u00edn de Goiti]] to investigate reports of a prosperous [[Moro people|Moro]] settlement on the island of Luzon.<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Dery2001\"/>\n\nDe Goiti arrived in mid-1570 and was initially well received by Maynila's ruler [[Rajah Matanda]], who, as former commander of the Naval forces of Brunei, had already had dealings with the Magellan expedition in late 1521.  Negotiations broke down, however, when another ruler, [[Rajah Sulayman]], arrived and began treating the Spanish belligerently, saying that the Tagalog people would not surrender their freedoms as easily as the \"painted\" Visayans did.<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Dery2001\"/> The accounts of the De Goiti mission report that Tondo's ruler, [[Lakandula]], sought to participate in these negotiations early on, but De Goiti intentionally ignored Lakandula because he wanted to focus on Maynila, which Legaspi wanted to use as a headquarters because it was already fortified, whereas Tondo was not.<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/>\n\nBy May 24, 1570, negotiations had broken down, and according to the Spanish accounts, their ships fired their cannon as a signal for the expedition boats to return.  Whether or not this claim was true, the rulers of Maynila perceived this to be an attack and as a result, Sulayman ordered an attack on the Spanish forces still within the city.  The battle was very brief because it concluded with the settlement of Maynila being set ablaze.<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Dery2001\"/>\n\nThe Spanish accounts claim that De Goiti ordered his men to set the fire,<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/> historians today still debate whether this was true.  Some historians believe it is more likely that the Maynila forces themselves set fire to their settlement, because scorched-earth retreats were a common military tactic among the peoples of the Philippine archipelago at the time.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\nDe Goiti proclaimed victory, symbolically claimed Maynila on behalf of Spain, then quickly returned to Legaspi because he knew that his naval forces were outnumbered.<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Contemporary writers believe the survivors of Maynila's forces would have fled across the river to Tondo and other neighboring towns.\n\n=== Establishment of Maynila (May 1571)===\nL\u00f3pez de Legazpi himself returned to assert the Spanish claim on Maynila a year later in 1571.

The term, however, was being incorrectly applied to former ''[[alipin]]'' (commoner and slave class) who have escaped bondage by payment, favor, or flight. Moreover, the Tagalog ''timawa'' did not have the military prominence of the Visayan ''timawa''. The equivalent warrior class in the Tagalog society was present only in Laguna, and they were known as the ''[[maharlika]]'' class.\n\nAt the bottom of the social hierarchy are the members of the ''alipin'' class. There are two main subclasses of the ''alipin'' class. The ''[[aliping namamahay]]'' who owned their own houses and served their masters by paying tribute or working on their fields were the commoners and [[serf]]s, while the ''[[aliping sa gigilid]]'' who lived in their masters' houses were the servants and slaves.\n\nThe more complex social structure of the Tagalogs was less stable during the arrival of the Spaniards because it was still in a process of differentiating.<ref name=\"Scott1982\"/>{{rp|pages=\"124\u2013125\"}}{{vague|date=June 2017}}\n\n=== Political leadership structure ===\n{{Main|Paramount rulers in early Philippine history}}\nTondo was a large coastal settlement led by several leaders, called [[Datu]], who had their own followings, called either \"Dulohan\" or \"Barangay\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/> These Datus with their respective Barangays in turn acknowledged the leadership of a datu with the most senior rank - a \"paramount ruler\"<ref name=\"Junker1998\"/> or \"paramount datu\",<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/> who was called a \"Lakan\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/> According to San Buenaventura, a large coastal settlement with this kind of leadership structure was called a \"Bayan\".<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"PCDSPO2015\"/>\n\nThe equivalent Paramount Datus who led the southern polity of Maynila were referred to using the term \"[[Raja]]h\", and in Mindanao, a similar title in more Islamized polities was that of \"[[Sultan]]\".<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>\n\nThe term for the [[Barangay state|Barangay]] social groupings refers to the large ships called ''[[balangay]]'', which were common on such coastal polities, and is used by present-day scholars to describe the leadership structure of settlements in early Philippine history.

These sources also show, however, that in practice, they were addressed directly: \"''in actual prayers, they were petitioned directly, not as intermediaries.''\" Modern day writers divide these spirits are broadly into the categories of \"Ancestor spirits, nature spirits, and guardian spirits,\" although they also note that the dividing line between these categories is often blurred.<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/>\n\nDemetrio, Cordero-Fernando, and Nakpil Zialcita<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> observe that the Luzon Tagalogs and Kapampangans' use of the word \"Anito\", instead of the word \"Diwata\" which was more predominant in the Visayan regions, indicated that these peoples of Luzon were less influenced by the Hindu and Buddhist beliefs of the Majapahit empire than the Visayans were.<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> They also observed that the words were used alternately amongst the peoples in the southernmost portions of Luzon - the [[Bicol Region]], [[Marinduque]], [[Mindoro]], etc. They suggested that this have represented transitional area, the front lines of an increased \"Indianized\" Majapahit influence which was making its way north<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> the same way Islam was making its way north from Mindanao.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n=== Localization of other beliefs ===\nAlthough most contemporary historians,<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> approaching Philippines from the point of view of [[critical historiography]], assert the predominance of indigenous religious beliefs,<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/><ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> they also note that there are significant manifestations of other belief systems in early Tagalog history.<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>  While it was common among mid-20th century historians and in earlier texts to use these manifestations as evidence of \"influence,\"<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/> more contemporary scholars of southeast Asian history have emphasized that the manifestations of these beliefs do not necessarily reflect outright adoption of these religions, but rather of syncretistic adaptation<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> or \"localization.\"<ref name=\"Milner2011\"/><ref name=\"Wolters1999\"/>\n\nOsborne (2004) describes a process of \"adaptation\" happening in connection with Hindu and Buddhist influences in the various cultures of Maritime Southeast Asia,<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> and emphasizes that this \"indianization\" of Southeast Asia did not per-se overwrite existing indigenous patterns, cultures, and beliefs: <blockquote>\"''Because Indian culture \u201ccame\u201d to Southeast Asia, one must not think that Southeast Asians lacked a culture of their own.

The Bruneians installed the Muslim rajahs, [[Rajah Salalila]] and [[Rajah Matanda]] in the south (now the [[Intramuros]] district) and the Buddhist-Hindu settlement was ruled under Lakan Dula in northern Tundun (now in modern [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]]).<ref>Teodoro Agoncillo, History of the Filipino People, p. 22</ref> Islamization of Luzon began in the 16th century when traders from Brunei settled in the Manila area and married locals while maintaining kinship and trade links with Brunei and thus other Muslim centres in Southeast Asia. The Muslims were called \"[[Moro people|Moros]]\" by the Spanish who assumed they occupied the whole coast. There is no evidence that Islam had become a major political or religious force in the region, with Father Diego de Herrera recording that the Moros lived only in some villages and were Muslim in name only.<ref name=\"Newson2009\"/>\n\n==Economic activities==\nHistorians widely agree that the larger coastal polities which flourished throughout the Philippine archipelago in the period immediately prior to the arrival of the Spanish colonizers (including Tondo and Maynila) were \"organizationally complex\", demonstrating both economic specialization and a level of social stratification which would have led to a local demand for \"prestige goods\".<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>\n\nSpecialized industries in the Tagalog and Kapampangan regions, including Tondo and Maynila, included agriculture, textile weaving, basketry, metallurgy, hunting, among others.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> The social stratification which gave birth to the Maginoo class created a demand for prestige products including ceramics, textiles, and precious stones.<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> This demand, in turn, served as the impetus for both internal and external trade.\n\nJunker notes that significant work still needs to be done in analyzing the internal/local supply and demand dynamics in pre-Spanish era polities, because much of the prior research has tended to focus on their external trading activities.<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> Scott notes that early Spanish lexicons are particularly useful for this analysis, because these early dictionaries captured many words which demonstrate the varied nuances of these local economic activities.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n=== Trade ===\nJunker describes coastal polities of Tondo and Maynila's size as \"administrative and commercial centers functioning as important nodes in networks of external and internal trade.\"<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> While the basic model for the movement of trade goods in early Philippine history saw coastal settlements at the mouth of large rivers (in this case, the Pasig river delta) controlling the flow of goods to and from settlements further upriver (in this case, the upland polities on the Laguna Lake coast),<ref name=\"Junker1990\"/> Tondo and Maynila had trade arrangements which allowed them to control trade throughout the rest of the archipelago.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott observes that while the port of Tondo had the monopoly on arriving Chinese merchant ships, it was Manila's fleet of trading vessels which in turn retailed them to settlements throughout the rest of the archipelago, so much so that Manyila's ships came to be known as \"Chinese\" (sinina).<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n==== Redistribution of Chinese goods ====\n[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tondo and Maynila's shared trade relations with China make the Manila bay area one of the northernmost points on the route of the [[Silk Road]].]]\nThe most lucrative of Tondo's economic activities involved the redistribution of Chinese goods, which would arrive in Manila bay through Tondo's port and be  distributed throughout the rest of the archipelago, mostly through Maynila's extensive shipping activities.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\nThe Chinese migrations to [[Malaysia|Malaya]] and the [[Philippines]] shore began in the 7th century and reached their peak after 1644 owing to the [[Manchu]] conquest of [[Ancient China|China]]. These Chinese immigrants settled in [[Manila]], [[Pasig]] included, and in the other ports, which were annually visited by their trade [[junks]], they have cargoes of [[silk]], [[tea]], [[ceramics]], and their precious [[jade]] stones.<ref>http://beta.pasigcity.gov.ph/subpages/aboutpasig/timeline-pc.aspx</ref>\n\nAccording to William Henry Scott (1982), when ships from China came to Manila bay, Lakandula would remove the sails and rudders of their ships until they paid him duties and anchorage fees, and then he would then buy up all their goods himself, paying half its value immediately and then paying the other half upon their return the following year.  In the interim, these goods would be traded throughout the rest of the archipelago. The end result was that other locals were not able to buy anything from the Chinese directly, but from Tondo<ref name=\"Scott1982\"/> and Maynila,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> who made a tidy profit as a result.\n\nAugustinian Fray Martin de Rada Legaspi says that the Tagalogs were \"''more traders than warriors''\",<ref name=\"Scott1982\"/> and Scott notes in a later book (1994)<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> that Maynila's ships got their goods from Tondo and then dominated trade through the rest of the archipelago.

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was far too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as he described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community about Fairbairn's theory of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>This assertion by Fairbairn: that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures was simply too much for the analytic community to bear. He dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were seen to be (at that time)  the fundamental motivator of humankind. In Fairbairn's model, the dissociated memories  in the unconscious resonate throughout the individual's life. Note that Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Also note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event that occurred in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once the memory of the event is there it is held out of awareness by repression.           \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway from dissociated memories of neglect and abuse to adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories coalesce and form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second point in the quote describes how the individual's identification with the abuser can exacerbate the impact of the dissociated memories. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\" is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood. As a consequence, these individuals  have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other (the abuser of the victim) because they  have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highly defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and realize how their early history  influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                  \n\nFairbairn also noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the '''\"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\"'''. Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he/she is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is using logic to explain to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern used by children to support the illusion that they are living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt and indifferent to his welfare. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                 \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                                                                \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. In this section of the paper he begins to think about the effects of a '''Good Object-''' one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  At the outset of treatment most patients stubbornly cling to their  illusions that they were raised in a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that they are somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to give up all his fantasies of being a member of a family and instead, see himself as an unloved and discarded child. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's clinical observation regarding the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they '''had already suffered through,''' is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br />\n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn, as mentioned, was continually amplifying and refining his observations regarding children's dependency on their parents. This was also true for his 1944 paper, which contains a detailed description of the impossible dilemma that the rejected child faces. Here, he highlights the crushing emotionality experienced by the child when his needs are rejected, and the impossibly  frustrating position he is forced into, one in which he cannot complain about his rejection for fear of increased rejection while simultaneously he cannot express his love or his need. The following quote demonstrates Fairbairn's writing at its best along with his unparalleled sensitivity to children's needs.   <blockquote>From the latter standpoint, what he experiences is a sense of lack of love, and indeed of emotional ''rejection'' on his mother's part. This being so, the expression of hate toward her as a rejecting object becomes in his eyes a very dangerous procedure. On the one hand, it is calculated to make her reject him all the more, and thus increase her badness and make her seem ''more real'' in her capacity as a bad object. On the other hand it is calculated to make her love him less, and thus to decrease her \"goodness' and make her seem ''less real'' (ie: destroy her) in her capacity of a good object. At the same time it also becomes a dangerous procedure for the child to express his libidinal need , i.e.his nascent love, of his mother in the face of rejection at her hands...In an older child this experience (showing love to a parent and having it rejected) is one of intense humiliation over the depreciation of his love, which seems to be involved. At a somewhat deeper level, or at an earlier stage, the experience is one of shame over the display of needs which are disregarded or belittled. In virtue of these experiences of humiliation and shame he feels reduced to a state of '''worthlessness,''' '''destitution''' or '''beggardom'''. His sense of his own value is threatened: and he feels bad in the sense of \"inferior (Fairbairn, 1952,pp.112-113)<ref name=\":2\" />   </blockquote>Thus the child can neither complain about his treatment for fear that he will be treated even more horribly, nor does he dare to offer his love to a parent who might reject and belittle him, as he has experienced in the past. The child has no where to go and no one from whom he can seek help or appeal to, which is the position that millions of children are caught in at any given moment in time. Fairbairn gained his many insights to the plight of children from his work in the orphanage attached to the hospital in Edinburgh in which he worked (1927-1935)<ref name=\":7\" />, and he never forgot those experiences. \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.<blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain multiplicity of egos (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has been de-repressed and temporarily is \"known\" to the central ego has to be suddenly forced out of awareness and replaced by another view of reality. His model sees psychopathology as an endless series of shifting ego states which protect the individual from the harsh realities of their childhood, but simultaneously, disrupts their life because of the incomplete views of themselves and the incomplete views of people around them.     \n\nFairbairn's 1944  structural theory emerged from his careful and detailed analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates, thus every pair of structures contains a version of self paired with a version of the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure, which Fairbairn originally called the \"internal saboteur\") is an internal  representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and his relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future. In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model '''the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent''' out of fantasy and hope.  This  second vision of the parent (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that the child has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the antilibidinal ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the rejecting object in an attempt to reform it, while the libidinal ego seeks ways to find out how to please the exciting object which promises it love which is always out of reach. Neither part-self (antilibidinal ego, libidinal ego) is willing to give up their quest, and neither part object (rejecting object and exciting object) is willing to concede defeat, and neither of the object representations (rejecting or exciting) is willing to give either of the child's two selves any satisfaction.      \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego'''  \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage convinced him that  children separated from their families had experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation that cannot be tolerated consciously.     \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the exciting object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of psychological  development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as '''\"all bad\"''' and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"'''all good'''\". This style of relating to the world defines the Borderline Personality disorder (Celani, 1993,2010 <ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Treatment of the Borderline Patient: Applying Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|publisher=International Universities Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8236-6644-1|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" />. Fairbairn described this shift in ego states in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state, resulting in a person who experiences the world through a \"multiplicity of egos\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which has just been repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the central ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history, and is unable to hold onto a single view of their interpersonal world<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|url=|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=|pages=|oclc=}}</ref>. \n\n==== Resistance Based on the Two Sub Ego's Mission to Reform the Object ====\n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships in which there are constant dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes  typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the internalized rejecting object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,,2010,p.109)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Fairbairn's first quote on source of resistance that he discussed in the 1943 paper, about the de-repression of internalized objects creating a frightening world \"peopled with  devils\", he mentioned \"another factor\" which created resistance, which he discussed in his 1944 paper. This second factor is the intense is the attachment between the the libidinal ego and its exciting object, which is an attachment that is fueled by need and unfulfilled desire.The libidinal ego of  the neglected child lives in a world of hopeful fantasies and he/she cannot give up hope in their parents because his/her entire world would crash down upon them if he/she were to accept that indeed, there was no hope. <blockquote>There can be no room for doubt that the obstinate attachment of the libidinal ego to the exciting object and its reluctance to renounce this object constitute a particularly formidable source of resistance -and one which plays no small part in determining what is known as the as the negative therapeutic reaction...The truth is that, however well the fact may be disguised, the individual is extremely reluctant to abandon his original hate, no less than his original need of his original objects in childhood (Fairbairn, 1952,p.117)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn uses the concept of \"Negative Therapeutic Reaction\" in this quote, which  is defined as a hostile reaction by a patient to treatment regardless of the skill or experience of the therapist. Patient's who are deeply involved in their inner world, and who are re-fighting all the battles of their childhood, will tolerate no interference of their  ongoing battles and will  experience the therapist as an unwelcome intruder. These two quotes demonstrate that  '''resistance to change is fueled by both sub-egos in the inner world.''' The antilibidinal ego does not want to give up its quest to reform the rejecting object's view of him, while the libidinal ego refuses to give up on the fantasy that there is still some hidden love in his objects. Clinically, if the therapist insists at the outset of treatment that the patient separate from his/her parents and live on their own, he/she might precipitate an abandonment crisis that may endanger further treatment. The patient needs a secure attachment to an external object before any of these internal ties can be given up. Once again, Fairbairn's model is consistent and logical in that the original source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects. Once internalized,  the original motives of the sub egos as they struggle with the two internalized objects, continues to operate in the inner world. When this factor is combined with the earlier description of resistance as coming from the patients fear of the powerful emotions associated with the de-repression of internalized bad objects, coupled with the emotional loss of all of his fantasies about belonging to a family, resistance becomes completely understandable within this model.\n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the central ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced with their parents during the course of  their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in the external world are internalized and  summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with peers  and adults and he is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's central ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. Its focus is a finely attuned search for any positive, supportive responses from his parents. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his central ego loses sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego. A powerful unconscious that is filled with constant dialogues influences the weakened central ego which interprets all of reality in terms of the rigid role-relationships that are active in his unconscious. These internal templates cloud reality and become the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference and  Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his rejecting object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This occurs in individuals who have richly suffused unconscious structures which easily override the perceptions of the central ego.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as a psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn:  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairbairn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. (Today we would call these patients Personality Disordered.) The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics: <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment. In his later papers (1943 &1944),he observed that the child protected himself from remembering these traumatic events by using  the dissociative defense to erase them form his conscious memory. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child '''blames himself''' for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was far too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the development proceeds, the child gradually realizes that he is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object in the Splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's has been validated by the millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individuals who either live at home with their aging parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp, is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal \"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues:  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought, is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as he described his unique  vision of the child's motivation. He saw that all children sought out  good objects, in the hope of establishing  a loving  relationship with another human being. He then then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather a compendium of memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's \"challenge\" of the Freudian model did not pose a problem for the analytic community, despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored for forty years until 1983, until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book \"Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory\",<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community about Fairbairn's theory of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>This assertion by Fairbairn: that the unconscious is composed of dissociated memories of parental failures was simply too much for the analytic community to bear. He dismissed Freud's notion of an unconscious populated by biological forces that were were seen to be (at that time)  the fundamental motivator of humankind. In Fairbairn's model, the dissociated memories  in the unconscious resonate throughout the individual's life. Note that Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love, help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Also note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" an overwhelmingly traumatic event that occurred in the external world, and instantaneously forcing it into the unconscious. Once the memory of the event is there it is held out of awareness by repression.           \n\nFairbairn also offered a clear pathway from dissociated memories of neglect and abuse to adult psychopathology in the following passage.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious, and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories coalesce and form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second point in the quote describes how the individual's identification with the abuser can exacerbate the impact of the dissociated memories. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor, \"Defensiveness\" is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood. As a consequence, these individuals  have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other (the abuser of the victim) because they  have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, the highly defended individual will never comprehend what happened to them, and realize how their early history  influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                  \n\nFairbairn also noticed that children who had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they themselves were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the '''\"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\"'''. Once again the child is desperate to support his illusion that he/she is living within a loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife.         <blockquote>It becomes obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good\". In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so, he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is using logic to explain to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern used by children to support the illusion that they are living in a loving family. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being lazy, disrespectful, or being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt and indifferent to his welfare. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that the parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense, and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                 \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to his earlier discussion, that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers, on different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually creates a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic. Here he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated:        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also, and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that their own unmet dependency needs pressure them to remain with their abusive parents.They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents, and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all young patients.                                                                                \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in the same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper, which will be described in the next section). The two topics were (1) his theory of treatment and (2) his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the Bad Object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. In this section of the paper he begins to think about the effects of a '''Good Object-''' one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects which are available and conscious (and which ideally should be present in every child's life) have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved--albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship with the analyst, as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69).<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn identifies one of the key mutative factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to an internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway,  At the outset of treatment most patients stubbornly cling to their  illusions that they were raised in a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that they are somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests that Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history, as he has to give up all his fantasies of being a member of a family and instead, see himself as an unloved and discarded child. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and to the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for when such bad objects are released, the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of the chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe \"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released, however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's clinical observation regarding the difficulty for patients to actually reexamine and tolerate the events that they '''had already suffered through,''' is absolutely correct. Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object, and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst, and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" />\n<br />\n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn, as mentioned, was continually amplifying and refining his observations regarding children's dependency on their parents. This was also true for his 1944 paper, which contains a detailed description of the impossible dilemma that the rejected child faces. Here, he highlights the crushing emotionality experienced by the child when his needs are rejected, and the impossibly  frustrating position he is forced into, one in which he cannot complain about his rejection for fear of increased rejection while simultaneously he cannot express his love or his need. The following quote demonstrates Fairbairn's writing at its best along with his unparalleled sensitivity to children's needs.   <blockquote>From the latter standpoint, what he experiences is a sense of lack of love, and indeed of emotional ''rejection'' on his mother's part. This being so, the expression of hate toward her as a rejecting object becomes in his eyes a very dangerous procedure. On the one hand, it is calculated to make her reject him all the more, and thus increase her badness and make her seem ''more real'' in her capacity as a bad object. On the other hand it is calculated to make her love him less, and thus to decrease her \"goodness' and make her seem ''less real'' (ie: destroy her) in her capacity of a good object. At the same time it also becomes a dangerous procedure for the child to express his libidinal need , i.e.his nascent love, of his mother in the face of rejection at her hands...In an older child this experience (showing love to a parent and having it rejected) is one of intense humiliation over the depreciation of his love, which seems to be involved. At a somewhat deeper level, or at an earlier stage, the experience is one of shame over the display of needs which are disregarded or belittled. In virtue of these experiences of humiliation and shame he feels reduced to a state of '''worthlessness,''' '''destitution''' or '''beggardom'''. His sense of his own value is threatened: and he feels bad in the sense of \"inferior (Fairbairn, 1952,pp.112-113)<ref name=\":2\" />   </blockquote>Thus the child can neither complain about his treatment for fear that he will be treated even more horribly, nor does he dare to offer his love to a parent who might reject and belittle him, as he has experienced in the past. The child has no where to go and no one from whom he can seek help or appeal to, which is the position that millions of children are caught in at any given moment in time. Fairbairn gained his many insights to the plight of children from his work in the orphanage attached to the hospital in Edinburgh in which he worked (1927-1935)<ref name=\":7\" />, and he never forgot those experiences. \n\n==== An Outline of Fairbairn's Structural Model ====\nFairbairn's 1944 paper introduced the psychoanalytic community to his alternative view of the structure of the human personality which he saw as being the result of dissociation of intolerably frustrating experiences with the individuals parents. Before he introduced his model he commented on the ability of one structure (or sub-self) to repress another sub-self, and in so doing, become the executive (dominant) ego structure.<blockquote>It is not inconceivable that one part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge should repress another part of the \"ego\" with a dynamic charge..In order to account for repression, we thus appear to be driven to the necessity of assuming a certain multiplicity of egos (Fairbairn, 1952, p.90)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>The ability of one ego state to repress another ego state is the central dynamic of the unconscious in Fairbairn's model. It accounts for the shifting of ego states that can occur when dissociated material has been de-repressed and temporarily is \"known\" to the central ego has to be suddenly forced out of awareness and replaced by another view of reality. His model sees psychopathology as an endless series of shifting ego states which protect the individual from the harsh realities of their childhood, but simultaneously, disrupts their life because of the incomplete views of themselves and the incomplete views of people around them.     \n\nFairbairn's 1944  structural theory emerged from his careful and detailed analysis of a patient's dream (Fairbairn, 1952, pp.95-106)<ref name=\":2\" />. He observed that the patient had separate views of herself and of her significant others that could be understood as part-selves and part objects. Fairbairn saw that there were three pairs of structures- one pair was conscious and the other two pairs were largely unconscious.The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates, thus every pair of structures contains a version of self paired with a version of the object (other person) to whom the self structure was relating. The two conscious structures are the  '''The Central Ego''' (the self structure) and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''' (the other) , and '''two pairs of unconscious structures.''' The first pair of (mostly unconscious structures) are  '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' (the self structure, which Fairbairn originally called the \"internal saboteur\") is an internal  representation of the neglected, humiliated and enraged child in a relationship to the '''Rejecting Object''', (the object structure) which is an internal representation of the abusive parent. The second pair of unconscious structures are  '''The Libidinal Ego''' (the self structure) which is the child's fantasy of the good parent whom he wishes for and his relationship to the '''Exciting Object''' (the object structure) which is a fantasy representation of the loving parent who offers him hope for the future. In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model '''the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that the deprived child creates a \"good\" parent''' out of fantasy and hope.  This  second vision of the parent (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that the child has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  The attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the antilibidinal ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the rejecting object in an attempt to reform it, while the libidinal ego seeks ways to find out how to please the exciting object which promises it love which is always out of reach. Neither part-self (antilibidinal ego, libidinal ego) is willing to give up their quest, and neither part object (rejecting object and exciting object) is willing to concede defeat, and neither of the object representations (rejecting or exciting) is willing to give either of the child's two selves any satisfaction.      \n\n'''Dissociation and the Splitting of the Ego'''  \n\nPrior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage convinced him that  children separated from their families had experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent already described as the rejecting object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions into the antilibidinal ego. These memories of the child's self as suffused with fear, defeat, shame and humiliation that cannot be tolerated consciously.     \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the exciting object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  '''never develops \"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of psychological  development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as '''\"all bad\"''' and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"'''all good'''\". This style of relating to the world defines the Borderline Personality disorder (Celani, 1993,2010 <ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=The Treatment of the Borderline Patient: Applying Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting|publisher=International Universities Press|year=1993|isbn=0-8236-6644-1|location=|pages=}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" />. Fairbairn described this shift in ego states in the earlier quote that addressed the fact that one ego state could repress another ego state, resulting in a person who experiences the world through a \"multiplicity of egos\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and moments  later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no awareness of the other ego state which has just been repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the central ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history, and is unable to hold onto a single view of their interpersonal world<ref>{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|url=|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=|pages=|oclc=}}</ref>. \n\n==== Resistance Based on the Two Sub Ego's Mission to Reform the Object ====\n\nThe reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community, as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It also forces the user to think in terms of self and object, rather that the individual in isolation. This model represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different to the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships in which there are constant dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized during childhood includes  typical dialogues that were originally experienced in the external world, but now continue in the internal world. For example the antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the antilibidinal ego and the internalized rejecting object  continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden.  <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,,2010,p.109)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Fairbairn's first quote on source of resistance that he discussed in the 1943 paper, about the de-repression of internalized objects creating a frightening world \"peopled with  devils\", he mentioned \"another factor\" which created resistance, which he discussed in his 1944 paper. This second factor is the intense is the attachment between the the libidinal ego and its exciting object, which is an attachment that is fueled by need and unfulfilled desire.The libidinal ego of  the neglected child lives in a world of hopeful fantasies and he/she cannot give up hope in their parents because his/her entire world would crash down upon them if he/she were to accept that indeed, there was no hope. <blockquote>There can be no room for doubt that the obstinate attachment of the libidinal ego to the exciting object and its reluctance to renounce this object constitute a particularly formidable source of resistance -and one which plays no small part in determining what is known as the as the negative therapeutic reaction...The truth is that, however well the fact may be disguised, the individual is extremely reluctant to abandon his original hate, no less than his original need of his original objects in childhood (Fairbairn, 1952,p.117)<ref name=\":2\" />.</blockquote>Fairbairn uses the concept of \"Negative Therapeutic Reaction\" in this quote, which  is defined as a hostile reaction by a patient to treatment regardless of the skill or experience of the therapist. Patient's who are deeply involved in their inner world, and who are re-fighting all the battles of their childhood, will tolerate no interference of their  ongoing battles and will  experience the therapist as an unwelcome intruder. These two quotes demonstrate that  '''resistance to change is fueled by both sub-egos in the inner world.''' The antilibidinal ego does not want to give up its quest to reform the rejecting object's view of him, while the libidinal ego refuses to give up on the fantasy that there is still some hidden love in his objects. Clinically, if the therapist insists at the outset of treatment that the patient separate from his/her parents and live on their own, he/she might precipitate an abandonment crisis that may endanger further treatment. The patient needs a secure attachment to an external object before any of these internal ties can be given up. Once again, Fairbairn's model is consistent and logical in that the original source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects. Once internalized,  the original motives of the sub egos as they struggle with the two internalized objects, continues to operate in the inner world. When this factor is combined with the earlier description of resistance as coming from the patients fear of the powerful emotions associated with the de-repression of internalized bad objects, coupled with the emotional loss of all of his fantasies about belonging to a family, resistance becomes completely understandable within this model.\n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nFairbairn's  structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the central ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego '''varies from child to child''' according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced with their parents during the course of  their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in the external world are internalized and  summate in both the conscious central ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's central ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with peers  and adults and he is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's central ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his central ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. Its focus is a finely attuned search for any positive, supportive responses from his parents. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his central ego loses sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the antilibidinal ego and the rejecting object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the libidinal ego. A powerful unconscious that is filled with constant dialogues influences the weakened central ego which interprets all of reality in terms of the rigid role-relationships that are active in his unconscious. These internal templates cloud reality and become the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference and  Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his rejecting object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This occurs in individuals who have richly suffused unconscious structures which easily override the perceptions of the central ego.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

The ''BioShock'' games combine [[first-person shooter]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements, giving the player freedom for how to approach combat and other situations, and are considered part of the [[immersive sim]] genre. Additionally, the series is notable for exploring philosophical and moral concepts with a strong in-game narrative influenced by concepts such as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]] and [[American exceptionalism]].\n\nThe series consists of three main games. ''[[BioShock]]'' and ''[[BioShock 2]]'' were released in 2007 and 2010, respectively, and take place in 1960 and 1968 in the fictional underwater city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]]. ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'', released in 2013, is thematically and narratively tied to the first games, but takes place in 1912 aboard the floating city of Columbia.

The series is considered the [[spiritual successor]] to ''[[System Shock 2]]'', which many of the developers were previously involved with through [[Irrational Games]]. While specific mechanics differ between all three games, they share a common theme of having the player use a combination of physical weapons such as guns and melee weapons, superhuman powers\u2014including both active and passive abilities\u2014granted by genetic alterations (plasmids in the first two games, vigors in ''Infinite''), and features of the game environment to strategically work their way through enemy forces and tactical situations. These weapons and powers can be used in various combinations to aid in defeating foes; for example, electrocuting an enemy makes them prone to being knocked out from a subsequent melee attack. Scenarios in the game often feature multiple approaches that the player can take, such as opting to avoid enemies through stealth and deception, [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] a security turret to turn against enemy forces, or directly engaging in combat. The player is able to customize their weapons and genetic enhancements for the style of play they prefer. In addition to collecting new weapons and genetic modifications, the player gains ammunition, mana-like power required to engage the genetic modifications (EVE in the first two games, Salt in ''Infinite''), restorative items, scrap items used to craft new materials, and in-game money to buy various improvements at vending machines throughout the game.\n\n==Games==\n\n===''BioShock''===\n{{Main|BioShock}}\n''BioShock'' was released on August 21, 2007 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360.

Built in the late 1940s by business tycoon [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]], it was meant to be a [[laissez-faire]] social environment for individuals to work, live, and prosper out of the increasingly oppressive hands of the world's governments and authorities. Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, Dr. Yi Suchong, and other scientists discovered a substance called ADAM, harvested from [[sea slugs]] that could be made into [[plasmids]] that gave the user psychokinetic powers. Frank Fontaine, a former gangster and businessman who brought black market goods to Rapture, found a way to harvest ADAM by implanting the slugs in the bodies of young girls, \"Little Sisters\", and profited from this. Ryan led an attack that apparently killed Fontaine and seized his ADAM production facilities. To protect the Little Sisters, Ryan created [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddies]] by conditioning and mutating humans into armored diving suits, designed to protect the Little Sisters. Leading up to New Year's Eve 1959, a new figure, Atlas, rose from the worker classes to lead a new revolt against Ryan, killing many and leading Ryan to mutate a number of his followers into Splicers to protect himself, creating the downfall of Rapture's utopia.\n\nIn 1960, Jack, the player-character, is in a plane crash over the ocean that is near the lighthouse that houses a bathysphere that takes him to Rapture. Atlas contacts Jack to ask his help against Ryan's forces. Jack discovers the Little Sisters and is warned by Tenenbaum not to harm them. After fighting through the failing city, Jack makes it to Ryan's offices. Ryan, patiently playing golf while waiting for Jack, reveals that Jack is his illegitimate son, and had been mentally conditioned by Fontaine to coerce his actions, specifically following any order preceded by the phrase \"Would you kindly...?\". Jack realizes Atlas has been using this phrase since his arrival. Ryan accepts his fate, using the phrase to make Jack kill him with a golf club, and Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, having gone into hiding to plan a new strategy against Ryan. Fontaine leaves Jack to die, but he is rescued by Tenenbaum and the Little Sisters. Tenenbaum removes the conditioning from Jack's mind and urges him to defeat Fontaine and take the Little Sisters to the surface. In a final battle against Jack, Fontaine injects himself with numerous plasmids, but Jack and the Little Sisters overpower him, allowing for them to escape.\n\n===''BioShock 2''===\n{{Main|BioShock 2}}\n''BioShock 2'' was released worldwide on February 9, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock2/similar.html?mode=versions|title=Bioshock 2 for Xbox 360|website=|publisher=Gamespot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515005121/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock2/similar.html?mode=versions|archive-date=May 15, 2011|url-status=live|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}</ref> The game was developed by a new design team, although it contained members of the team for the original ''BioShock''.

[[2K Boston]], formerly [[Irrational Games]], also assisted the game's development, with series creator [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]] providing input. The story received major changes over the course of development. [[Garry Schyman]], the composer of the first game, returned to create the score for ''BioShock 2''.\n\n''BioShock 2'' takes place eight years after the events of ''BioShock'', with the city having fallen into a [[dystopia]]. A new leader, Sofia Lamb, has risen up in the power vacuum after the death of Ryan and Fontaine, and has created a [[Utilitarianism]] and [[Collectivism]]-type cult of personality. Prior to the events of ''BioShock'', Lamb had severed the bond between the Big Daddy Delta (the player-character) and her daughter Eleanor, the Little Sister he was assigned to protect. Delta, left for dead, wakes years later by Tenenbaum and the Little Sisters, and told he must re-establish his bond with Eleanor soon or will fall into a coma. Delta fights his way through Splicers as well as those loyal to Lamb, defeats Lamb, and sacrifices himself to help Eleanor, Tenenbaum, and other Little Sisters to escape Rapture.\n\n''[[Minerva's Den]]'' is a [[downloadable content]] campaign for ''BioShock 2'', in which the player assumes the role of Subject Sigma, another Alpha Series Big Daddy, as he travels through Minerva's Den, home to Rapture's Central Computing.

It was built and launched in 1893 by the American government, during the Worlds' Fair in Chicago, to much fanfare and publicity. However, it was later involved in an \"international incident\" by firing upon a group of Chinese civilians during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. The city was disavowed by the United States government, and the location of the city was soon lost to everyone else. As with Rapture, Columbia's intellectuals were able to develop new technology, including Vigors that grant the user new psychokinetic powers. At the same time, strange rifts in the [[space-time continuum]] called \"Tears\" appear across the city, and anachronistic elements can be seen and heard.\n\nThe player-character, [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Booker DeWitt|Booker DeWitt]], a disgraced member of the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] discharged after his actions at the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], is sent to Columbia by Robert and Rosalind Lutece (the Lutece Twins) to recover [[Elizabeth (BioShock)|Elizabeth]], a young woman that had been kidnapped by Columbia's leader, Zachary Comstock, and protected by the robotic Songbird.

Booker comes to discover that Elizabeth is his daughter from one of numerous [[Multiverse|parallel universes]], and that Comstock is a version of himself from yet another parallel universe whom had accepted a [[baptism]] to atone for his actions at Wounded Knee and established the beliefs that led to Columbia's founding. Comstock had kidnapped Elizabeth from Booker while she was an infant with the help of Tear technology provided by the Lutece Twins (in essence the same person from alternate dimensions), but in his escape, Elizabeth's finger was severed by the closure of a Tear, giving her the power over Tears. Booker eventually defeats Songbird and Comstock with the help of Elizabeth and the Twins, as Comstock had turned on them. Elizabeth shows Booker that these events will always repeat through the multitude of parallel universes, and the only way to end the cycle is to kill all versions of Booker before he can turn into Comstock at the baptism.

It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/|title=Q&A: Diving deeper into ''BioShock''s story|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan|date=September 20, 2007|website=|publisher=Gamespot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011144853/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/|archive-date=October 11, 2014|url-status=live|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther elements came into the story design. Levine had an interest in \"stem cell research and the moral issues that go around [it]\".<ref name=\"ign myths4\" /> In regard to artistic influences, Levine cited the books ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''[[Logan's Run]]'', representing societies that have \"really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456|title=Big Daddy speaks|last=Minkley|first=Johnny|date=June 8, 2007|website=Eurogamer.com|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821030637/http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456|archive-date=August 21, 2007|url-status=live|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref> The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not. The team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature. Levine happened upon \"Would you kindly\" after working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as \"Would you kill people, even innocent people, to survive?\", later working that phrase into the first script for the game.<ref name=\"edge history3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/making-bioshock/|title=The Making Of:

Levine stated that after Warner's ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' film in 2009 did not do as well as the studio expected, they had concerns with the $200 million budget that Verbinski had for the ''BioShock'' film. They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $80 million budget, but Verbinski did not want to accept this. Universal subsequently brought a new director in to work with the smaller budget but with whom Levine and 2K Games did not feel was a good fit to the material.

by [[2K Games]] and developed by several studios, including [[Irrational Games]] and [[2K Marin]]. The ''BioShock'' games combine [[first-person shooter]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements, giving the player freedom for how to approach combat and other situations, and are considered part of the [[immersive sim]] genre. Additionally, the series is notable for exploring philosophical and moral concepts with a strong in-game narrative influenced by concepts such as [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]] and [[American exceptionalism]].\n\nThe series consists of three main games.

The series is considered the [[spiritual successor]] to ''[[System Shock 2]]'', which many of the developers were previously involved with through [[Irrational Games]]. While specific mechanics differ between all three games, they share a common theme of having the player use a combination of physical weapons such as guns and melee weapons, superhuman powers\u2014including both active and passive abilities\u2014granted by genetic alterations (plasmids in the first two games, vigors in ''Infinite''), and features of the game environment to strategically work their way through enemy forces and tactical situations. These weapons and powers can be used in various combinations to aid in defeating foes; for example, electrocuting an enemy makes them prone to being knocked out from a subsequent melee attack. Scenarios in the game often feature multiple approaches that the player can take, such as opting to avoid enemies through stealth and deception, [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] a security turret to turn against enemy forces, or directly engaging in combat. The player is able to customize their weapons and genetic enhancements for the style of play they prefer. In addition to collecting new weapons and genetic modifications, the player gains ammunition, mana-like power required to engage the genetic modifications (EVE in the first two games, Salt in ''Infinite''), restorative items, scrap items used to craft new materials, and in-game money to buy various improvements at vending machines throughout the game.\n\n==Games==\n\n===''BioShock''===\n{{Main|BioShock}}\n''BioShock'' was released on August 21, 2007 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360.

Built in the late 1940s by business tycoon [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]], it was meant to be a [[laissez-faire]] social environment for individuals to work, live, and prosper out of the increasingly oppressive hands of the world's governments and authorities. Dr. Brigid Tenenbaum, Dr. Yi Suchong, and other scientists discovered a substance called ADAM, harvested from [[sea slugs]] that could be made into [[plasmids]] that gave the user psychokinetic powers. Frank Fontaine, a former gangster and businessman who brought black market goods to Rapture, found a way to harvest ADAM by implanting the slugs in the bodies of young girls, \"Little Sisters\", and profited from this. Ryan led an attack that apparently killed Fontaine and seized his ADAM production facilities. To protect the Little Sisters, Ryan created [[Big Daddy (BioShock)|Big Daddies]] by conditioning and mutating humans into armored diving suits, designed to protect the Little Sisters. Leading up to New Years Eve 1959, a new figure, Atlas, rose from the worker classes to lead a new revolt against Ryan, killing many and leading Ryan to mutate a number of his followers into Splicers to protect himself, creating the downfall of Rapture's utopia.\n\nIn 1960, Jack, the player-character, is in a plane crash over the ocean that is near the lighthouse that houses a bathysphere that takes him to Rapture. Atlas contacts Jack to ask his help against Ryan's forces. Jack discovers the Little Sisters and is warned by Tenenbaum not to harm them. After fighting through the failing city, Jack makes it to Ryan's offices. Ryan, patiently playing golf while waiting for Jack, reveals that Jack is his illegitimate son, and had been mentally conditioned by Fontaine to coerce his actions, specifically following any order preceded by the phrase \"Would you kindly...?\". Jack realizes Atlas has been using this phrase since his arrival. Ryan accepts his fate, using the phrase to make Jack kill him with a golf club, and Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, having gone into hiding to plan a new strategy against Ryan. Fontaine leaves Jack to die, but he is rescued by Tenenbaum and the Little Sisters. Tenenbaum removes the conditioning from Jack's mind and urges him to defeat Fontaine and take the Little Sisters to the surface. In a final battle against Jack, Fontaine injects himself with numerous plasmids, but Jack and the Little Sisters overpower him, allowing for them to escape.\n\n===''BioShock 2''===\n{{Main|BioShock 2}}\n''BioShock 2'' was released worldwide on February 9, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock2/similar.html?mode=versions|title=Bioshock 2 for Xbox 360|website=|publisher=Gamespot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515005121/http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock2/similar.html?mode=versions|archive-date=May 15, 2011|url-status=live|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}</ref> The game was developed by a new design team, although it contained members of the team for the original ''BioShock''. ''BioShock 2'' was mainly developed by [[2K Marin]], with [[2K Australia]], [[Arkane Studios]], and [[Digital Extremes]] providing additional support. [[2K Boston]], formerly [[Irrational Games]], also assisted the game's development, with series creator [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]] providing input. The story received major changes over the course of development. [[Garry Schyman]], the composer of the first game, returned to create the score for ''BioShock 2''.\n\n''BioShock 2'' takes place eight years after the events of ''BioShock'', with the city having fallen into a [[dystopia]]. A new leader, Sofia Lamb, has risen up in the power vacuum after the death of Ryan and Fontaine, and has created a [[Utilitarianism]] and [[Collectivism]]-type cult of personality. Prior to the events of ''BioShock'', Lamb had severed the bond between the Big Daddy Delta (the player-character) and her daughter Eleanor, the Little Sister he was assigned to protect. Delta, left for dead, wakes years later by Tenenbaum and the Little Sisters, and told he must re-establish his bond with Eleanor soon or will fall into a coma. Delta fights his way through Splicers as well as those loyal to Lamb, defeats Lamb, and sacrifices himself to help Eleanor, Tenenbaum, and other Little Sisters to escape Rapture.\n\n''[[Minerva's Den]]'' is a [[downloadable content]] campaign for ''BioShock 2'', in which the player assumes the role of Subject Sigma, another Alpha Series Big Daddy, as he travels through Minerva's Den, home to Rapture's Central Computing.

It was built and launched in 1893 by the American government, during the Worlds' Fair in Chicago, to much fanfare and publicity. However, it was later involved in an \"international incident\" by firing upon a group of Chinese civilians during the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. The city was disavowed by the United States government, and the location of the city was soon lost to everyone else. As with Rapture, Columbia's intellectuals were able to develop new technology, including Vigors that grant the user new psychokinetic powers. At the same time, strange rifts in the [[space-time continuum]] called \"Tears\" appear across the city, and anachronistic elements can be seen and heard.\n\nThe player-character, [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Booker DeWitt|Booker DeWitt]], a disgraced member of the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] discharged after his actions at the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], is sent to Columbia by Robert and Rosalind Lutece (the Lutece Twins) to recover [[Elizabeth (BioShock)|Elizabeth]], a young woman that had been kidnapped by Columbia's leader, Zachary Comstock, and protected by the robotic Songbird.

Booker comes to discover that Elizabeth is his daughter from one of numerous [[Multiverse|parallel universes]], and that Comstock is a version of himself from yet another parallel universe whom had accepted a [[baptism]] to atone for his actions at Wounded Knee and established the beliefs that led to Columbia's founding. Comstock had kidnapped Elizabeth from Booker while she was an infant with the help of Tear technology provided by the Lutece Twins (in essence the same person from alternate dimensions), but in his escape, Elizabeth's finger was severed by the closure of a Tear, giving her the power over Tears. Booker eventually defeats Songbird and Comstock with the help of Elizabeth and the Twins, as Comstock had turned on them. Elizabeth shows Booker that these events will always repeat through the multitude of parallel universes, and the only way to end the cycle is to kill all versions of Booker before he can turn into Comstock at the baptism.

He saw the uniqueness of the [[art deco]] styling of the building along with imagery around the building such as the [[Atlas (statue)|statue of Atlas]] near it, and recognized that these were spaces that had not been experienced in the first-person shooter genre.<ref name=\"edge history3\" /> The history of the Rockefeller Center fed into the story concept; Levine noted how the Center had started construction prior to the [[Great Depression]] of the 1920s; when the primary financiers had pulled out, [[John D. Rockefeller]] backed the remaining construction to complete the project himself, as \"a great man building an architectural triumph against all the odds\".<ref name=\"edge history3\" /> The history of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]] and the character of [[Andrew Ryan (BioShock)|Andrew Ryan]] is loosely based on Rockefeller's story.<ref name=\"edge history3\" /> He also considered that many of the characters of Rapture were all people who were oppressed once before in the lives and now free of that oppression, have turned around and become the oppressors, a fact he felt resonated throughout human history.<ref name=\"glixel sept20163\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921|title=Inside the Making of 'BioShock' Series With Creator Ken Levine|last=Suellentrop|first=Chris|date=September 14, 2016|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112859/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921|archive-date=September 16, 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe team wanted to have the player care for the drones in some way and create ''pathos'' for these characters. The idea of using little girls came out of brainstorming, but was controversial and shocking within the team at first, recognizing that they could easily be killed and make the game more horrific in the style of ''[[Night Trap]]''.<ref name=\"edge history3\" /> However, as Levine worked on the story, he started to incorporate the ideas of dystopian and utopian thinkers from the twentieth century, including [[Ayn Rand]], [[Aldous Huxley]], and [[George Orwell]], and considered their ideas \"fascinating\".<ref name=\"ign myths4\" /> He brought in the ideas of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] that Rand primarily outlined in the book ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', that man should be driven by selfishness and not altruism, and used this to inform the philosophy behind the city of Rapture and Andrew Ryan's work, tied in with his previous observations on Rockefeller and his writings.<ref name=\"edge history3\" /> This was extended to the use of the little girls as drones (now Little Sisters), particularly the question whether the player should try to save the girls or harvest the ADAM for their own benefit.<ref name=\"edge history3\" /> 2K Games expressed concern about the initial mechanic of the Little Sisters, where the player would actively prey on the Little Sister, which would have alerted a Big Daddy and setting up the fight with the player. This approach did not sit well with Levine, and 2K Games asserted that they would not ship a game \"where the player gets punished for doing the right thing\".<ref name=\"edge history3\" /> They altered this approach where the Little Sisters would be invulnerable until the player had dealt with their Big Daddy, though LeBreton considered this \"a massive kludge\" into the game's fiction.<ref name=\"edge history3\" /> The idea of creating the Little Sisters and presenting the player with this choice became a critical part of the game's appeal to the larger gaming market though would still be met with criticism from some outlets.<ref name=\"edge history3\" /> Levine desired to have only one ending to the game, something that would have left the fate of the characters \"much more ambiguous\", but publisher pressure directed them to craft multiple endings depending on the choice of harvesting Little Sisters.<ref name=\"glixel sept20163\" /> Levine also noted that \"it was never my intention to do two endings for the game. It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/|title=Q&A: Diving deeper into ''BioShock''s story|last=Sinclair|first=Brendan|date=September 20, 2007|website=|publisher=Gamespot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011144853/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/qanda-diving-deeper-into-bioshocks-story/1100-6179423/|archive-date=October 11, 2014|url-status=live|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOther elements came into the story design. Levine had an interest in \"stem cell research and the moral issues that go around [it]\".<ref name=\"ign myths4\" /> In regard to artistic influences, Levine cited the books ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and ''[[Logan's Run]]'', representing societies that have \"really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456|title=Big Daddy speaks|last=Minkley|first=Johnny|date=June 8, 2007|website=Eurogamer.com|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821030637/http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=77456|archive-date=August 21, 2007|url-status=live|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref> The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not. The team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature. Levine happened upon \"Would you kindly\" after working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as \"Would you kill people, even innocent people, to
