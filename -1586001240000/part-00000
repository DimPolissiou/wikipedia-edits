Only two made the attempt, but the charter was extended, in 1769, for another five years.  Eleven of the original 64 grantees were named Lyman. In that same year, Wentworth also granted to one Colonel John Hurd of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] part of the land which is today within the bounds of Monroe. The grant was named Hurd's Location and included five small islands in the [[Connecticut River]], known as \"Deer Islands,\" and a parcel of land from below the present Village Bridge to the foot of Fifteen Mile Falls.<ref name=MH>{{cite book | author = Frances Ann Johnson |title = The History of Monroe, New Hampshire | publisher = Courier Printing Company | year = 1955}} (reprint by Higginson Book Company, Salem, MA)</ref>{{rp|13, 29}}\n\nIn addition to Hurd's Location and the governor's {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, there were 23 lots of the 64 portions of Lyman located in \"West Lyman,\" or the \"Lyman Plain,\" now Monroe, making up less than {{convert|7500|acre|km2}} of the present area.

When Colonel Hurd learned of Hyndman's structure, he sued to have him evicted. A Barnet benefactor settled the controversy by purchasing the title from Hurd.\n\nThe first permanent settlers also came in the 1780s.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Sir Keir Starmer]]. According to a number of studies, media coverage of Corbyn has often been hostile, with many [[Smear campaign|unfounded claims]] laid against him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He has condemned [[antisemitism]], but has been criticised for his past associations and responses to allegations of [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|antisemitism within the Labour Party]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams' Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n{{Jeremy Corbyn sidebar}}\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

Moving to London, he became a [[List of trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] [[Union representative|representative]]. In 1974, he was elected to [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey Council]] and became Secretary of [[Hornsey (UK Parliament constituency)|Hornsey]] [[Constituency Labour Party]], until being elected as the MP for Islington North in 1983. His activism has included roles in [[Anti-Fascist Action]], the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] and the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and advocating for a [[united Ireland]]. As a [[Backbencher|backbench MP]], he frequently voted against the Labour [[Whip (politics)|whip]], including [[New Labour]] governments under [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]]. A vocal opponent of the [[Iraq War]], he chaired the [[Stop the War Coalition]] from 2011 to 2015. Corbyn received the [[Gandhi International Peace Award]] in 2013 and the [[Se\u00e1n MacBride Peace Prize]] in 2017.\n\nCorbyn was elected Labour leader in 2015. The party's membership increased sharply, both during the leadership campaign and following his election.<ref name=\"ibtimes\"/> Taking the party to the left, he advocated [[renationalisation]] of public utilities and [[Renationalisation of British Rail|the railways]], a less [[non-interventionism|interventionist]] military policy, and reversals of [[United Kingdom government austerity programme|austerity cuts]] to welfare and public services. Although critical of the [[European Union]], he supported continued membership in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|2016 referendum]]. After Labour MPs sought to remove him in 2016, he won a [[2016 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|second leadership contest]]. In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 general election]], Labour increased its share of the vote to 40%, with Labour's 9.6% vote swing being its largest since the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]. Under Corbyn, Labour achieved a net gain of 30 seats and a [[hung parliament]], but the party remained in Opposition.\n\nIn 2019, Corbyn endorsed holding a [[Proposed referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement|referendum on any Brexit withdrawal agreement]], with a personal stance of neutrality. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Labour's vote share fell to 32%, its lowest since 2015, leading to a net loss of 60 seats and leaving it with 202, its fewest since [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]]. Corbyn said that he would not lead Labour into the next election, triggering a [[2020 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election in 2020]] that was won by [[Sir Keir Starmer]]. According to a number of studies, media coverage of Corbyn has often been hostile, with many [[Smear campaign|unfounded claims]] laid against him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} He has condemned [[antisemitism]], but has been criticised for his past associations and responses to allegations of [[Antisemitism in the UK Labour Party|antisemitism within the Labour Party]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|header= |header_align=center\n |header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1=Castle House School.jpg|width1=217|caption1=[[Castle House School]] where Corbyn attended [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]]|image2=Adams' - Big School.png|width2=217|caption2=[[Haberdashers' Adams|Adams' Grammar School]], where Corbyn attended secondary school}}\n{{Jeremy Corbyn sidebar}}\nCorbyn was born on 26 May 1949<ref name=\"parliament.uk\">[http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ \"Government and Opposition roles\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924104507/http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/principal/government-opposition/ |date=24 September 2015 }}.

The shallow stations comprise 79 [[Shallow column station|spanned column]] stations (a large portion of them following the \"centipede\" design), 33 [[Shallow single-vault station|single-vaulted stations]] (Kharkov technology), and three single-spanned stations. In addition, there are 12 ground-level stations, four elevated stations, and one station ([[Vorobyovy Gory (Moscow Metro)|Vorobyovy Gory]]) on a bridge. Two stations have three tracks, and one has double halls. Seven of the stations have side platforms (only one of which is subterranean). In addition, there were two temporary stations within rail yards. One station is reserved for future service ([[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko\u2013Solntsevskaya line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] for the [[Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line]]).\n\nThe stations being constructed under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] [[Stalinism|regime]], in the style of [[socialist classicism]], were meant as underground \"palaces of the people\". Stations such as [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya line)|Komsomolskaya]], [[Kiyevskaya (Koltsevaya line)|Kiyevskaya]] or [[Mayakovskaya]] and others built after 1935 in the second phase of the evolution of the network are tourist landmarks, their photogenic architecture, large chandeliers and detailed decoration unusual for an urban transport system.\n\n{{wide image|\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u041a\u0421\u041b \u041c\u0438\u0447\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442.jpg|700px|align-cap=center|[[Michurinsky Prospekt]] is the first semi-underground station in the Moscow Metro}}\n\n===Lines===\n[[File:Moscow metro tunnels - view from cab of Synergy train.webm|thumbtime=5:47|thumb|A Moscow Metro train passes through [[Sokolnicheskaya line|Sokolnicheskaya]] and [[Koltsevaya Line|Koltsevaya]] lines.

In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. In January 1932 the plan for the first lines was approved, and on 21 March 1933 the Soviet government approved a plan for 10 lines with a total route length of {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first lines were built using the Moscow general plan designed by [[Lazar Kaganovich]], along with his project managers (notably Ivan M. Kuznetsov and, later, Isaac Y. Segal) in the 1930s-1950s, and the Metro was named after him until 1955 ''({{lang|ru-Latn|Metropoliten im. L.M.

In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]] station (now the dark-blue [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]). In September 1938, the [[Zamoskvoretskaya Line|Gorkovskaya Line]] opened between [[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol]] and [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first [[Deep column station|deep-level column station]] [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] was built at the same time.\n\nBuilding work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during [[World War II]], and two Metro sections were put into service; [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]\u2013[[Avtozavodskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line)|Avtozavodskaya]] (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]]\u2013[[Partizanskaya (Metro)|Partizanskaya]] (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the [[Battle of Moscow|Siege of Moscow]] in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] moved its offices to the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The [[Chistye Prudy (Metro)|Chistiye Prudy]] station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the [[Koltsevaya Line]], a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] to [[Kievskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya)|Kievskaya]] and a surface extension to [[Pervomaiskaya (closed)|Pervomaiskaya]] during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The [[Koltsevaya Line]] was first planned as a line running under the [[Garden Ring]], a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow's city centre. The first part of the line \u2013 from [[Park Kultury (Koltsevaya Line)|Park Kultury]] to [[Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Kurskaya]] (1950) \u2013 follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs {{convert|1|-|1.5|km}} outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya\u2013[[Belorusskaya-Koltsevaya|Belorusskaya]]), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.\n\n===Cold War era===\n[[File:Novoslobodskaya 04.jpg|thumb|left|Novoslobodskaya station]]\n[[File:MosMetro KomsomolskayaKL img2 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb| [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Komsomolskaya station]]]]\n[[File:Metro MSK Line2 Sokol.jpg|thumb|[[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol station]]]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cold War]] led to the construction of a deep section of the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] and [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. In the further development of the Metro the term \"stages\" was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957\u20131959 are referred to as the \"fifth stage\".\n\nOther stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as nuclear shelters.\n\nDuring the late 1950s the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was toned down, and decorations at some stations (such as [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh]] and [[Alexeyevskaya (Metro)|Alexeyevskaya]]) were simplified by comparison with the original plans. This was done on the orders of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who favoured more spartan decoration. A typical layout (which quickly became known as ''Sorokonozhka''\u2013\"centipede\", from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, less-costly technology; this was not always appropriate, and resulted in utilitarian design. For example, walls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train vibration and some tiles eventually fell off. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the same color, which eventually led to [[:wikt:variegated|variegated]] parts of the walls. Not until the mid-1970s was the architectural extravagance restored and original designs again popular. However, the newer design of \"centipede\" stations (with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate.\n\n===Stalinist ideals===\n{{see also|Stalinist architecture}}\n\n====Publicizing the metro====\nThe Moscow Metro was one of the USSR's most ambitious architectural projects. The metro's artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied ''svet'' (radiance or brilliance) and ''svetloe budushchee'' (a radiant future).<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\">{{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Catherine |title=Beauty as a Route to 'the Radiant Future': Responses of Soviet Architecture |journal=Journal of Design History |year=1997 |volume=10 |series=Design, Stalin and the Thaw |issue=2 |pages=137\u2013160 |jstor=1316129 |doi=10.1093/jdh/10.2.137}}</ref> With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an \"artificial underground sun\".<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\">{{cite journal |last=Bowlt |first=John E. |title=Stalin as Isis and Ra: Socialist Realism and the Art of Design |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |year=2002 |volume=24 |series=Design, Culture, Identity: The Wolfsonian Collection |pages=34\u201363 |jstor=1504182 |doi=10.2307/1504182}}</ref> This palatial underground environment<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\"/> reminded riders that their tax rubles had been well spent on ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\nThe chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow's Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the ''Metrostroi'' (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\">{{cite journal |last=Damsky |first=Abram |title=Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950 |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |date=Summer 1987 |volume=5 |issue=Russian/Soviet Theme |pages=90\u2013111 |jstor=1503938 |doi=10.2307/1503938}}</ref> Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form. His team experimented with different materials (most often cast bronze, aluminum, sheet brass, steel, and milk glass) and methods to optimize the technology.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/> Damsky's discourse on \"Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950\" describes in detail the epic chandeliers installed in the Kaluzhskaia (now called the Oktiabrskaia) Station and the Taganskaia Station:\n\n{{quote|The Kaluzhskaya Station was designed by the architect [Leonid] Poliakov. Poliakov's decision to base his design on a reinterpretation of Russian classical architecture clearly influenced the concept of the lamps, some of which I planned in collaboration with the architect himself. The shape of the lamps was a torch \u2013 the torch of victory, as Poliakov put it... The artistic quality and stylistic unity of all the lamps throughout the station's interior made them perhaps the most successful element of the architectural composition. All were made of cast aluminum decorated in a black and gold anodized coating, a technique which the Metrostroi factory had only just mastered.\n<br /> \nThe Taganskaia Metro Station on the Ring Line was designed in...quite another style by the architects K.S. Ryzhkov and A. Medvedev... Their subject matter dealt with images of war and victory...The overall effect was one of ceremony ... In the platform halls the blue ceramic bodies of the chandeliers played a more modest role, but still emphasised the overall expressiveness of the lamp.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/>|Abram Damsky|Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950}}\n\nThe work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\n====Industrialization====\nStalin's [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin's fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and smart resource distribution that kept up the incredible pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough [[steel]] to incorporate it into the metro's design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.\n\nThe Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union#Second Plan, 1933\u20131937|second five-year plan]]. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow's population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933.  The Metro also bolstered Moscow's shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\">{{cite journal |last=Jenks |first=Andrew |title=A Metro on the Mount: The Underground as a Church of Soviet Civilization |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2000 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=697\u2013724 |jstor=2517594 |doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0160}}</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nThe [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources and inspire its people. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.\n\nThe person in charge of Metro mobilization was [[Lazar Kaganovich]]. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the \"Iron Commissar\"; he shared Stalin's fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich's managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the [[Palace of the soviets|Palace of the Soviets]]: failure.\n\nThis was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O'Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:\n\n{{quote|A specialist workforce had been drawn from many different regions, including miners from the Ukrainian and Siberian coalfields and construction workers from the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk, the Dniepr hydroelectric power station, and the Turkestan-Siberian railway... materials used in the construction of the metro included iron from Siberian Kuznetsk, timber from northern Russia, cement from the Volga region and the norther Caucasus, bitumen from Baku, and marble and granite from quarries in Karelia, the Crimea, the Caucasus, the Urals, and the Soviet Far East<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Mahoney |first=Mike |title=Archaeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro |journal=The Modern Language Review |date=January 2003 |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=138\u2013150 |jstor=3738180 |doi=10.2307/3738180}}</ref>|Mike O'Mahoney|Archeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro}}\n\nSkilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The ''Metrostroi'' (the organization responsible for the Metro's construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of ''Udarnik metrostroia'' (''Metrostroi Shock Worker'', its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the [[Komsomol]] generation because of its strength and youth.\n\n====Patriotic influences====\nWhen the Metro opened in 1935 it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that, it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new \"[[Homo Sovieticus]]\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref> The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>\n\nThe Metro was iconic also because it showcased [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realism]] in public art. Socialist Realism was in fact a method, not a style.<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\"/> This method was influenced by [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] favorite 19th-century [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]], who stated that \"art is no use unless it serves politics\".<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> This maxim explains why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology. Any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected. Without this cohesion, the Metro would not reflect Socialist Realism. If the Metro did not utilize Socialist Realism, it would fail to illustrate Stalinist values and transform Soviet citizens into socialists. Anything less than Socialist Realism's grand artistic complexity would fail to inspire a long-lasting, nationalistic attachment to Stalin's new society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Voyce |first=Arthur |title=Soviet Art and Architecture: Recent Developments |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=January 1956 |volume=303 |series=Russia Since Stalin: Old Trends and New Problems |pages=104\u2013115 |jstor=1032295 |doi=10.1177/000271625630300110}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14)===\n{{main|Moscow Central Circle}}\n[[File:MCC 12LUZH 7041 PLAT.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, light outdoor station|[[Luzhniki (Moscow Central Circle)|Luzhniki]] MCC station]]\nA proposal to convert the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] into a [[Urban rail transit|metropolitan railway]] with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012.

Effective February 2017, one ride costs 55 rubles (approx. 1 US dollar). Discounts (up to 33 percent) are available when buying a multiple-trip ticket (starting with twenty-trip cards), and children under age seven can travel free with their parents.\n\nTickets are available for a fixed number of trips, regardless of distance traveled or number of transfers. Monthly and yearly passes are also available. Fare enforcement takes place at the points of entry. Once a passenger has entered the Metro system, there are no further ticket checks \u2013 one can ride to any number of stations and make transfers within the system freely. Transfers to other public-transport systems (such as bus, tram, trolleybus) are not covered by the ticket. Transfer to monorail is free within 90 minutes.\n\nBefore 1991, turnstiles accepted coins; however, with the start of [[hyperinflation]] plastic tokens of various design were used. Disposable [[magnetic stripe card]]s were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of trips.\n\nOn 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement contactless [[smart cards]], known as Transport Cards. The card has an unlimited number of trips and may be programmed for 30, 90 or 365 days. The first purchase includes a one-time cost of 50 rubles, and its active lifetime is projected as 3\u00bd years; defective cards are exchanged at no cost. Unlimited cards are also available for students at reduced price (as of 2017, 365 rubles\u2014or about $US6\u2014for a calendar month of unlimited usage) for a one-time cost of 70 rubles. Transport Cards impose a delay for each consecutive use; i.e. the card can not be used for seven minutes after the user has passed through the turnstile.\n\nIn January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing magnetic cards with [[Smart card#Contactless smart cards|contactless]] disposable tickets based on [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP's]] [[MIFARE|MIFARE Ultralight]] technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards stopped 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.<ref name=mifareinmoscow>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1518.html |title=Moscow Metro: the World's First Major Transport System to operate fully contactless with NXP's MIFARE Technology |publisher=[[NXP Semiconductors]] |accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, the [[Government of Moscow|city government]] launched the Muscovite's Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the [[Moscow region]]; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the [[Bank of Moscow]]. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city's public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.\n\nSince 2006, [[Banking in Russia|several banks]] have issued [[credit card]]s which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner's bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles).<ref name=rates_2010/> Partner banks include the [[Bank of Moscow]], [[CitiBank]], [[Rosbank]], [[Alfa-Bank]] and [[Avangard Bank]].<ref name=creditcards>{{cite web |url=http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |title=\u0411\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 |publisher=Moscow metro |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727014525/http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2013 Moscow Transport Department introduced a smart card based transport electronic wallet called ''Troika''.

Major projects include:\n*[[Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line]]: The construction is now underway of the line's fifth stage, that will add six stations and {{convert|9.5|km|abbr=on}} of track bringing the northern terminus to [[Beskudnikovsky District]]. The extension will involve building of a new train yard in Likhobory. Afterwards, the line may continue northwards, likely into the [[Severny District, Moscow|Severny District]] beyond the [[MKAD]] and potentially into the adjacent city of [[Dolgoprudny]] after 2025.\n*Light Metro lines: Originally developed as a way of reducing costs by building an elevated Metro line to distant regions of Moscow, the only one of these (the [[Butovskaya Line]]) has been the subject of criticism. The project of Solntsevskaya Light Metro Line was cancelled in favour of the underground Solntsevskaya Metro Line (see below). The line 12 southwards extension is planned to include three stations (also {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} in length) and new depot. All the listed light-metro work has been removed from Moscow Metro's expansion programme until 2015.\n*[[Solntsevskaya Line]]: Following cancellation of the second \"Light Metro\" line, an old project was revived to bring the Metro to the [[Solntsevo District]] outside Moscow. Initially foreseen as part of a major Solntsevo-Mytischinskaya chordial line, it was revised as a continuation of [[Kalininskaya Line]], starting from the second set of tracks at [[Park Pobedy (Moscow Metro)|Park Pobedy]] and having the line curve out along Michurin Avenue with three stations: Minskaya, Lomonosovsky Prospekt and Ramenki. This is planned for 2015, and would be the first stage of the line; the second stage would reach Solntsevo. The [[Kalininskaya Line]] is planned for extension from Tretyakovskaya to [[Ostozhenka]], Kadashevskaya and [[Smolenskaya (Filyovskaya Line)|Smolenskaya]] (where it will unite nearby stations into one transfer unit) and continue westwards towards [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]].\n*Ghost stations: Moscow Metro does not have [[ghost station]]s in the conventional sense; of the three stations that were closed, two&nbsp;\u2014 [[Pervomayskaya (closed)|Pervomayskaya]] (1954\u201361) and [[Kaluzhskaya (closed)|Kaluzhskaya]] (1964\u201374)&nbsp;\u2014 were temporary; one (Leninskiye Gory) was built on a bridge closed due to faulty construction; it was rebuilt and opened in 2002 as [[Vorobyovy Gory (Moscow Metro)|Vorobyovy Gory]]. Several planned stations were omitted; some were later completed, but some exist only on paper. The best-known was [[Spartak (Moscow Metro)|Spartak]], which was left unfinished in 1975 due to low ridership potential and only opened in 2014. Other stations which may open are [[Khmelnitskaya]] (also known as Maroseyka) on the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]], which will offer a transfer to [[Kitay-gorod (Moscow Metro)|Kitay-gorod]]; Yakimanka on the [[Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line]] (transfer to [[Polyanka (Moscow Metro)|Polyanka]]); and [[Suvorovskaya]] on the [[Koltsevaya Line]], which was to be built with [[Dostoyevskaya (Moscow Metro)|Dostoyevskaya]] but has since been postponed.\n\nAccording to plans by the [[Government of Moscow|Moscow city government]] and [[Ministry of Transport (Russia)|Russia's Transport Ministry]] (announced in September 2008), by 2015 {{convert|79|km}} of new lines, 43 new underground stations and 7 metro depots should be added to the system.\n\n==={{anchor|Distant projects}}Future proposals===\nPlans exist for the following projects:\n*Chordal Lines: Projects for these appeared in the mid-1980s; they called for conventional radial lines but instead of passing through the city centre within the [[Koltsevaya Line]], they would bypass them on the outside.<ref>[http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif Map in Russian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003020857/http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif |date=3 October 2008 }} Retrieved 28 September 2011.</ref> After four of these are completed, they will be used to form the new Second Ring service (see below). Construction began only on the [[Strogino-Mitino extension|Mitino-Butovskaya Line]] during the early 1980s. In the wake of the 1990s crises these projects were abandoned, replaced by more cost-effective means (including the Light Metro lines) and using existent segments. However (despite the Mitino-Butovo chord replacement), the Solntsevsky radius of the Solntsevo-Mytishchinskaya line has been regenerated in its original path. It is unknown whether it would cross all the northern radii before travelling to the adjacent city of [[Mytishchi]] along the Yaroslav Highway, since there is now a fast connection to Mytishchi via the Sputnik rail link from the [[Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal]] and a new plan to build a line from [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] to [[Moscow Savyolovsky railway station|Savyolovskaya]] would effectively duplicate the path. The fates of the Balashikha-Troparevskaya (southwest bypass) and the Khimsko-Lyuberetskaya (northeast bypass) chordal lines are unknown.\n*Second (large) Ring: This plan for a second ring line dates back to the 1960s.\n**The original 1960s project called for a ring of 3\u20136 stations on the radius; several provisions for the future line were built (including transfer space at [[Bratislavskaya (Moscow Metro)|Bratislavskaya]]), the [[Kakhovskaya Line]] and the [[Cherkizovskaya]]\u2013[[Bulvar Rokossovskogo (Sokolnicheskaya Line)|Ulitsa Podbelskogo]] section of the [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]] (allowing it to expand westwards into Izmaylovo).<ref>http://metro.molot.ru/img/genplan_71.gif</ref>\n**During the 1980s chordal line proposals the ring was to be formed out of the space enclosed by it, with a circular service operating at off-peak hours.<ref>[http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302210610/http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif|date=2 March 2010}}</ref>\n**In 2006 Moscow Metro announced plans for a second transfer contour, which would build a line from [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] to [[Moscow Savyolovsky railway station|Savyolovskaya]] on a large diameter; this would in the future become enclosed into a ring, one to three stations along the radius.\n\n==Metro 2==\n{{Main|Metro-2}}\n\nIt has been alleged that a second and deeper metro system code-named \"D-6\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Moscow Metro 2 \u2013 The dark legend of Moscow |url=http://www.moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com/moscow-metro-2.html |publisher=Moscow Russia Insider's Guide}}</ref> designed for emergency evacuation of key city personnel in case of nuclear attack during the [[Cold War]], exists under military jurisdiction. It is believed that it consists of a single track connecting the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], chief HQ ([[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|General Staff]]\u2013''Genshtab''), Lubyanka ([[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] Headquarters), the Ministry of Defence and several other secret installations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} There are alleged to be entrances to the system from several civilian buildings, such as the [[Russian State Library]], [[Moscow State University]] (MSU) and at least two stations of the regular Metro. It is speculated that these would allow for the evacuation of a small number of randomly chosen civilians, in addition to most of the elite military personnel. A suspected junction between the secret system and the regular Metro is supposedly behind the [[Sportivnaya (Moscow Metro)|Sportivnaya]] station on the [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]]. The final section of this system was supposedly completed in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metro.ru/metro2/ |title=\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e-2 |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n{{Update section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Moscow MetroCrowded (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Moscow Metro is [[Metro systems by annual passenger rides|one of the busiest metro systems in the world]].]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border: solid 1px #ddd; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. In January 1932 the plan for the first lines was approved, and on 21 March 1933 the Soviet government approved a plan for 10 lines with a total route length of {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first lines were built using the Moscow general plan designed by [[Lazar Kaganovich]], along with his project managers (notably Ivan M. Kuznetsov and, later, Isaac Y. Segal) in the 1930s-1950s, and the Metro was named after him until 1955 ''({{lang|ru-Latn|Metropoliten im. L.M.

In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]] station (now the dark-blue [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]). In September 1938, the [[Zamoskvoretskaya Line|Gorkovskaya Line]] opened between [[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol]] and [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first [[Deep column station|deep-level column station]] [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] was built at the same time.\n\nBuilding work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during [[World War II]], and two Metro sections were put into service; [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]\u2013[[Avtozavodskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line)|Avtozavodskaya]] (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]]\u2013[[Partizanskaya (Metro)|Partizanskaya]] (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the [[Battle of Moscow|Siege of Moscow]] in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] moved its offices to the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The [[Chistye Prudy (Metro)|Chistiye Prudy]] station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the [[Koltsevaya Line]], a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] to [[Kievskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya)|Kievskaya]] and a surface extension to [[Pervomaiskaya (closed)|Pervomaiskaya]] during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The [[Koltsevaya Line]] was first planned as a line running under the [[Garden Ring]], a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow's city centre. The first part of the line \u2013 from [[Park Kultury (Koltsevaya Line)|Park Kultury]] to [[Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Kurskaya]] (1950) \u2013 follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs {{convert|1|-|1.5|km}} outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya\u2013[[Belorusskaya-Koltsevaya|Belorusskaya]]), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.\n\n===Cold War era===\n[[File:Novoslobodskaya 04.jpg|thumb|left|Novoslobodskaya station]]\n[[File:MosMetro KomsomolskayaKL img2 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb| [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Komsomolskaya station]]]]\n[[File:Metro MSK Line2 Sokol.jpg|thumb|[[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol station]]]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cold War]] led to the construction of a deep section of the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] and [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. In the further development of the Metro the term \"stages\" was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957\u20131959 are referred to as the \"fifth stage\".\n\nOther stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as nuclear shelters.\n\nDuring the late 1950s the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was toned down, and decorations at some stations (such as [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh]] and [[Alexeyevskaya (Metro)|Alexeyevskaya]]) were simplified by comparison with the original plans. This was done on the orders of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who favoured more spartan decoration. A typical layout (which quickly became known as ''Sorokonozhka''\u2013\"centipede\", from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, less-costly technology; this was not always appropriate, and resulted in utilitarian design. For example, walls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train vibration and some tiles eventually fell off. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the same color, which eventually led to [[:wikt:variegated|variegated]] parts of the walls. Not until the mid-1970s was the architectural extravagance restored and original designs again popular. However, the newer design of \"centipede\" stations (with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate.\n\n===Stalinist ideals===\n{{see also|Stalinist architecture}}\n\n====Publicizing the metro====\nThe Moscow Metro was one of the USSR's most ambitious architectural projects. The metro's artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied ''svet'' (radiance or brilliance) and ''svetloe budushchee'' (a radiant future).<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\">{{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Catherine |title=Beauty as a Route to 'the Radiant Future': Responses of Soviet Architecture |journal=Journal of Design History |year=1997 |volume=10 |series=Design, Stalin and the Thaw |issue=2 |pages=137\u2013160 |jstor=1316129 |doi=10.1093/jdh/10.2.137}}</ref> With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an \"artificial underground sun\".<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\">{{cite journal |last=Bowlt |first=John E. |title=Stalin as Isis and Ra: Socialist Realism and the Art of Design |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |year=2002 |volume=24 |series=Design, Culture, Identity: The Wolfsonian Collection |pages=34\u201363 |jstor=1504182 |doi=10.2307/1504182}}</ref> This palatial underground environment<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\"/> reminded riders that their tax rubles had been well spent on ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\nThe chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow's Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the ''Metrostroi'' (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\">{{cite journal |last=Damsky |first=Abram |title=Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950 |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |date=Summer 1987 |volume=5 |issue=Russian/Soviet Theme |pages=90\u2013111 |jstor=1503938 |doi=10.2307/1503938}}</ref> Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form.

Poliakov's decision to base his design on a reinterpretation of Russian classical architecture clearly influenced the concept of the lamps, some of which I planned in collaboration with the architect himself. The shape of the lamps was a torch \u2013 the torch of victory, as Poliakov put it... The artistic quality and stylistic unity of all the lamps throughout the station's interior made them perhaps the most successful element of the architectural composition. All were made of cast aluminum decorated in a black and gold anodized coating, a technique which the Metrostroi factory had only just mastered.\n<br /> \nThe Taganskaia Metro Station on the Ring Line was designed in...quite another style by the architects K.S. Ryzhkov and A. Medvedev... Their subject matter dealt with images of war and victory...The overall effect was one of ceremony ... In the platform halls the blue ceramic bodies of the chandeliers played a more modest role, but still emphasised the overall expressiveness of the lamp.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/>|Abram Damsky|Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950}}\n\nThe work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\n====Industrialization====\nStalin's [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin's fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and smart resource distribution that kept up the incredible pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough [[steel]] to incorporate it into the metro's design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.\n\nThe Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union#Second Plan, 1933\u20131937|second five-year plan]]. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow's population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933.  The Metro also bolstered Moscow's shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\">{{cite journal |last=Jenks |first=Andrew |title=A Metro on the Mount: The Underground as a Church of Soviet Civilization |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2000 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=697\u2013724 |jstor=2517594 |doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0160}}</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nThe [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources and inspire its people. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.\n\nThe person in charge of Metro mobilization was [[Lazar Kaganovich]]. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the \"Iron Commissar\"; he shared Stalin's fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich's managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the [[Palace of the soviets|Palace of the Soviets]]: failure.\n\nThis was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O'Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:\n\n{{quote|A specialist workforce had been drawn from many different regions, including miners from the Ukrainian and Siberian coalfields and construction workers from the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk, the Dniepr hydroelectric power station, and the Turkestan-Siberian railway... materials used in the construction of the metro included iron from Siberian Kuznetsk, timber from northern Russia, cement from the Volga region and the norther Caucasus, bitumen from Baku, and marble and granite from quarries in Karelia, the Crimea, the Caucasus, the Urals, and the Soviet Far East<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Mahoney |first=Mike |title=Archaeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro |journal=The Modern Language Review |date=January 2003 |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=138\u2013150 |jstor=3738180 |doi=10.2307/3738180}}</ref>|Mike O'Mahoney|Archeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro}}\n\nSkilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The ''Metrostroi'' (the organization responsible for the Metro's construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of ''Udarnik metrostroia'' (''Metrostroi Shock Worker'', its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the [[Komsomol]] generation because of its strength and youth.\n\n====Patriotic influences====\nWhen the Metro opened in 1935 it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that, it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new \"[[Homo Sovieticus]]\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref> The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>\n\nThe Metro was iconic also because it showcased [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realism]] in public art. Socialist Realism was in fact a method, not a style.<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\"/> This method was influenced by [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] favorite 19th-century [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]], who stated that \"art is no use unless it serves politics\".<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> This maxim explains why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology. Any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected. Without this cohesion, the Metro would not reflect Socialist Realism. If the Metro did not utilize Socialist Realism, it would fail to illustrate Stalinist values and transform Soviet citizens into socialists. Anything less than Socialist Realism's grand artistic complexity would fail to inspire a long-lasting, nationalistic attachment to Stalin's new society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Voyce |first=Arthur |title=Soviet Art and Architecture: Recent Developments |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=January 1956 |volume=303 |series=Russia Since Stalin: Old Trends and New Problems |pages=104\u2013115 |jstor=1032295 |doi=10.1177/000271625630300110}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14)===\n{{main|Moscow Central Circle}}\n[[File:MCC 12LUZH 7041 PLAT.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, light outdoor station|[[Luzhniki (Moscow Central Circle)|Luzhniki]] MCC station]]\nA proposal to convert the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] into a [[Urban rail transit|metropolitan railway]] with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012.

There is no accurate information about the author of the logo, so it is often attributed to the architects of the first stations \u2013 Samuil Kravets, Ivan Taranov and Nadezhda Bykova. It is noteworthy, however, that even at the opening in 1935, the M letter on the logo had no definite shape.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0423 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f\u0430|publisher=ADME|url=http://www.adme.ru/dizajn/u-moskovskogo-metro-net-logotipa-492755/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223000634/http://www.adme.ru/dizajn/u-moskovskogo-metro-net-logotipa-492755|archivedate=23 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nToday, with at least ten different variations of the shape in use, Moscow Metro still does not have clear brand or logo guidelines.

The fare has been steadily rising since 1991, hastened by [[inflation]] (taking into account the [[Monetary reform in Russia, 1998|1998 revaluation]] of the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] by a factor of 1,000). Effective February 2017, one ride costs 55 rubles (approx. 1 US dollar). Discounts (up to 33 percent) are available when buying a multiple-trip ticket (starting with twenty-trip cards), and children under age seven can travel free with their parents.\n\nTickets are available for a fixed number of trips, regardless of distance traveled or number of transfers. Monthly and yearly passes are also available. Fare enforcement takes place at the points of entry. Once a passenger has entered the Metro system, there are no further ticket checks \u2013 one can ride to any number of stations and make transfers within the system freely. Transfers to other public-transport systems (such as bus, tram, trolleybus) are not covered by the ticket. Transfer to monorail is free within 90 minutes.\n\nBefore 1991, turnstiles accepted coins; however, with the start of [[hyperinflation]] plastic tokens of various design were used. Disposable [[magnetic stripe card]]s were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of trips.\n\nOn 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement contactless [[smart cards]], known as Transport Cards. The card has an unlimited number of trips and may be programmed for 30, 90 or 365 days. The first purchase includes a one-time cost of 50 rubles, and its active lifetime is projected as 3\u00bd years; defective cards are exchanged at no cost. Unlimited cards are also available for students at reduced price (as of 2017, 365 rubles\u2014or about $US6\u2014for a calendar month of unlimited usage) for a one-time cost of 70 rubles. Transport Cards impose a delay for each consecutive use; i.e. the card can not be used for seven minutes after the user has passed through the turnstile.\n\nIn January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing magnetic cards with [[Smart card#Contactless smart cards|contactless]] disposable tickets based on [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP's]] [[MIFARE|MIFARE Ultralight]] technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards stopped 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.<ref name=mifareinmoscow>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1518.html |title=Moscow Metro: the World's First Major Transport System to operate fully contactless with NXP's MIFARE Technology |publisher=[[NXP Semiconductors]] |accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, the [[Government of Moscow|city government]] launched the Muscovite's Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the [[Moscow region]]; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the [[Bank of Moscow]]. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city's public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.\n\nSince 2006, [[Banking in Russia|several banks]] have issued [[credit card]]s which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner's bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles).<ref name=rates_2010/> Partner banks include the [[Bank of Moscow]], [[CitiBank]], [[Rosbank]], [[Alfa-Bank]] and [[Avangard Bank]].<ref name=creditcards>{{cite web |url=http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |title=\u0411\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 |publisher=Moscow metro |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727014525/http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2013 Moscow Transport Department introduced a smart card based transport electronic wallet called ''Troika''.

Major projects include:\n*[[Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line]]: The construction is now underway of the line's fifth stage, that will add six stations and {{convert|9.5|km|abbr=on}} of track bringing the northern terminus to [[Beskudnikovsky District]]. The extension will involve building of a new train yard in Likhobory. Afterwards, the line may continue northwards, likely into the [[Severny District, Moscow|Severny District]] beyond the [[MKAD]] and potentially into the adjacent city of [[Dolgoprudny]] after 2025.\n*Light Metro lines: Originally developed as a way of reducing costs by building an elevated Metro line to distant regions of Moscow, the only one of these (the [[Butovskaya Line]]) has been the subject of criticism. The project of Solntsevskaya Light Metro Line was cancelled in favour of the underground Solntsevskaya Metro Line (see below). The line 12 southwards extension is planned to include three stations (also {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} in length) and new depot. All the listed light-metro work has been removed from Moscow Metro's expansion programme until 2015.\n*[[Solntsevskaya Line]]: Following cancellation of the second \"Light Metro\" line, an old project was revived to bring the Metro to the [[Solntsevo District]] outside Moscow. Initially foreseen as part of a major Solntsevo-Mytischinskaya chordial line, it was revised as a continuation of [[Kalininskaya Line]], starting from the second set of tracks at [[Park Pobedy (Moscow Metro)|Park Pobedy]] and having the line curve out along Michurin Avenue with three stations: Minskaya, Lomonosovsky Prospekt and Ramenki. This is planned for 2015, and would be the first stage of the line; the second stage would reach Solntsevo. The [[Kalininskaya Line]] is planned for extension from Tretyakovskaya to [[Ostozhenka]], Kadashevskaya and [[Smolenskaya (Filyovskaya Line)|Smolenskaya]] (where it will unite nearby stations into one transfer unit) and continue westwards towards [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]].\n*Ghost stations: Moscow Metro does not have [[ghost station]]s in the conventional sense; of the three stations that were closed, two&nbsp;\u2014 [[Pervomayskaya (closed)|Pervomayskaya]] (1954\u201361) and [[Kaluzhskaya (closed)|Kaluzhskaya]] (1964\u201374)&nbsp;\u2014 were temporary; one (Leninskiye Gory) was built on a bridge closed due to faulty construction; it was rebuilt and opened in 2002 as [[Vorobyovy Gory (Moscow Metro)|Vorobyovy Gory]]. Several planned stations were omitted; some were later completed, but some exist only on paper. The best-known was [[Spartak (Moscow Metro)|Spartak]], which was left unfinished in 1975 due to low ridership potential and only opened in 2014. Other stations which may open are [[Khmelnitskaya]] (also known as Maroseyka) on the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]], which will offer a transfer to [[Kitay-gorod (Moscow Metro)|Kitay-gorod]]; Yakimanka on the [[Kaluzhsko-Rizhskaya Line]] (transfer to [[Polyanka (Moscow Metro)|Polyanka]]); and [[Suvorovskaya]] on the [[Koltsevaya Line]], which was to be built with [[Dostoyevskaya (Moscow Metro)|Dostoyevskaya]] but has since been postponed.\n\nAccording to plans by the [[Government of Moscow|Moscow city government]] and [[Ministry of Transport (Russia)|Russia's Transport Ministry]] (announced in September 2008), by 2015 {{convert|79|km}} of new lines, 43 new underground stations and 7 metro depots should be added to the system.\n\n==={{anchor|Distant projects}}Future proposals===\nPlans exist for the following projects:\n*Chordal Lines: Projects for these appeared in the mid-1980s; they called for conventional radial lines but instead of passing through the city centre within the [[Koltsevaya Line]], they would bypass them on the outside.<ref>[http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif Map in Russian] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003020857/http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif |date=3 October 2008 }} Retrieved 28 September 2011.</ref> After four of these are completed, they will be used to form the new Second Ring service (see below). Construction began only on the [[Strogino-Mitino extension|Mitino-Butovskaya Line]] during the early 1980s. In the wake of the 1990s crises these projects were abandoned, replaced by more cost-effective means (including the Light Metro lines) and using existent segments. However (despite the Mitino-Butovo chord replacement), the Solntsevsky radius of the Solntsevo-Mytishchinskaya line has been regenerated in its original path. It is unknown whether it would cross all the northern radii before travelling to the adjacent city of [[Mytishchi]] along the Yaroslav Highway, since there is now a fast connection to Mytishchi via the Sputnik rail link from the [[Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal]] and a new plan to build a line from [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] to [[Moscow Savyolovsky railway station|Savyolovskaya]] would effectively duplicate the path. The fates of the Balashikha-Troparevskaya (southwest bypass) and the Khimsko-Lyuberetskaya (northeast bypass) chordal lines are unknown.\n*Second (large) Ring: This plan for a second ring line dates back to the 1960s.\n**The original 1960s project called for a ring of 3\u20136 stations on the radius; several provisions for the future line were built (including transfer space at [[Bratislavskaya (Moscow Metro)|Bratislavskaya]]), the [[Kakhovskaya Line]] and the [[Cherkizovskaya]]\u2013[[Bulvar Rokossovskogo (Sokolnicheskaya Line)|Ulitsa Podbelskogo]] section of the [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]] (allowing it to expand westwards into Izmaylovo).<ref>http://metro.molot.ru/img/genplan_71.gif</ref>\n**During the 1980s chordal line proposals the ring was to be formed out of the space enclosed by it, with a circular service operating at off-peak hours.<ref>[http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302210610/http://www.metro.ru/map/1989/metro.ru-1989map-big3.gif|date=2 March 2010}}</ref>\n**In 2006 Moscow Metro announced plans for a second transfer contour, which would build a line from [[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] to [[Moscow Savyolovsky railway station|Savyolovskaya]] on a large diameter; this would in the future become enclosed into a ring, one to three stations along the radius.\n\n==Metro 2==\n{{Main|Metro-2}}\n\nIt has been alleged that a second and deeper metro system code-named \"D-6\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Moscow Metro 2 \u2013 The dark legend of Moscow |url=http://www.moscow-russia-insiders-guide.com/moscow-metro-2.html |publisher=Moscow Russia Insider's Guide}}</ref> designed for emergency evacuation of key city personnel in case of nuclear attack during the [[Cold War]], exists under military jurisdiction. It is believed that it consists of a single track connecting the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], chief HQ ([[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|General Staff]]\u2013''Genshtab''), Lubyanka ([[Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation|FSB]] Headquarters), the Ministry of Defence and several other secret installations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} There are alleged to be entrances to the system from several civilian buildings, such as the [[Russian State Library]], [[Moscow State University]] (MSU) and at least two stations of the regular Metro. It is speculated that these would allow for the evacuation of a small number of randomly chosen civilians, in addition to most of the elite military personnel. A suspected junction between the secret system and the regular Metro is supposedly behind the [[Sportivnaya (Moscow Metro)|Sportivnaya]] station on the [[Sokolnicheskaya Line]]. The final section of this system was supposedly completed in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metro.ru/metro2/ |title=\u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e-2 |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n{{Update section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Moscow MetroCrowded (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Moscow Metro is [[Metro systems by annual passenger rides|one of the busiest metro systems in the world]].]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border: solid 1px #ddd; text-align: left;\"\n|-\n!

''Sway'' was chosen for release as the album's third single, and was released in Australia on June 22, 2004.\n\n''Sway'' was only released as an individual single in [[Australia]]. In many other countries, the release of the track was held back until July 26, and packaged as a double A-side with the album's fourth single, ''[[Spider-Man Theme (Michael Bubl\u00e9 song)|Spider-Man Theme]]''. However, due to its popularity with Australian radio stations, the track was given a separate release in the region, with ''Spider-Man Theme'' being released three months later in September 2004, as a separate release. Bubl\u00e9's version of the song has appeared in such television shows and films as ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'', ''[[CSI: NY]]'', ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', ''[[The Wedding Date]]'', ''[[Da Kath and Kim Code]]'' and ''[[No Reservations (film)|No Reservations]]''. The music video for the track was directed by Peter Kasden, who also filmed a music video for the single's B-side, ''Moondance'', which was released exclusively to Australian music channels to promote the release of the single. The video features scenes of Bubl\u00e9 performing the song in the studio, intercut with scenes of Bubl\u00e9 driving a car through the Australian outback. The separate release, two music videos and strong radio airplay meant that ''Sway'' reached a peak of No. 15 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]], making it Bubl\u00e9's highest charting single to that date.\n\n===Track listing===\n*'''Australian CD single'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/MICHAEL-BUBLE-SWAY-AUSSIE-CD-SINGLE-NM-/230795219279?pt=AU_Audio_CDs&hash=item35bc77914f |title=Items found similar to \"MICHAEL BUBLE SWAY AUSSIE CD SINGLE NM\" |publisher=eBay |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}</ref>\n# \"Sway\" <small>(Junkie XL Mix)</small> \u2013 3:46\n# \"Sway\" <small>(acoustic version)</small> \u2013 3:08\n# \"Moondance\" <small>(live version)</small> \u2013 3:45\n\n===Charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!Chart (2004)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|15|song=Sway|artist=Michael Bubl\u00e9|rowheader=true|accessdate=12 May 2018}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Billboardadultcontemporary|24|artist=Michael Buble|rowheader=true|accessdate=12 May 2018}}\n|}\n\n==The Pussycat Dolls version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Sway\n| cover      = The Pussycat Dolls - Sway.png\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[The Pussycat Dolls]]\n| album      = [[Shall We Dance?

[[Pedro Infante]], for whom the song was written, recorded it in 1954.\n\n[[Norman Gimbel]] took the song, removed the somewhat melancholy Spanish lyrics about a man wondering if he shall ever love again, and wrote brand-new English lyrics about a man praising his dancing partner's ability to affect his heart with how she \"sways\" when they dance.

''Sway'' was chosen for release as the album's third single, and was released in Australia on June 22, 2004.\n\n''Sway'' was only released as an individual single in [[Australia]]. In many other countries, the release of the track was held back until July 26, and packaged as a double A-side with the album's fourth single, ''[[Spider-Man Theme (Michael Bubl\u00e9 song)|Spider-Man Theme]]''. However, due to its popularity with Australian radio stations, the track was given a separate release in the region, with ''Spider-Man Theme'' being released three months later in September 2004, as a separate release. Bubl\u00e9's version of the song has appeared in such television shows and films as ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'', ''[[CSI: NY]]'', ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'', ''[[The Wedding Date]]'', ''[[Da Kath and Kim Code]]'' and ''[[No Reservations (film)|No Reservations]]''. The music video for the track was directed by Peter Kasden, who also filmed a music video for the single's B-side, ''Moondance'', which was released exclusively to Australian music channels to promote the release of the single.
