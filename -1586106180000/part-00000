He went to boarding school to Cadet College Kohat from where he did his Matriculation and F.Sc. He then did BSc in Civil Engineering from University of Engineering and Technology Lahore. Chaudhary is highly regarded by the Kamboh caste of Zamindars (traditional landowners) his popularity in local politics has helped elect PTI officials as MPA's in Lahore, specifically in [[PP-147]] and [[PP-148]] where those caste's form a majority.\n\n==Personal life ==\nChaudhary married Salma Ejaz in 1984, his wife is the daughter of [[Mian Tufail Mohammad]] one of the original founding members and leader of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]]. Much of Chaudhary's early political career was in the Jamaat. Chaudhary is the founder and the chief executive officer of Kisan Care (pvt ltd) providing agricultural chemicals <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanbusinessjournal.com/b2b-directory/kisan-care-pvt-ltd_60364.html |title=Kisan Care (pvt) Ltd., Lahore |publisher=Pakistanbusinessjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2020-02-26}}</ref>\n\n== Political career==\n\n===Early career: Jamaat-e-Islami===\nChaudhary started his political career in the Jamaat-e-Islami student wing and had gradually progressed up the ranks of the party; he became national leader of the Jamaat student wing. Chaudhary and General Zia-ul-Haq were initially on good terms as Zia was keen to placate the religious right. However Chaudhary fast became disillusioned with Zia's undemocratic ways and as leader of the youth wing, Chaudhary dissented from the majority of the senior leadership as he opposed the regime of dictator [[General Zia-ul-Haq]]. Chaudhary organised protests in his native [[Lahore]] as national leader of the Jamaat's youth wing, General Zia soon ordered repression of the protests and Chaudhary along with his leaders and followers were tortured and imprisoned by the regime police and security services.\n\nThe death of General Zia in 1988 breathed new life into Pakistan's faltering democracy; during this period Chaudhary served as deputy mayor of Lahore in the early 1990s. Chaudhary continued to rise in the party's ranks and by 1998 he was appointed to the Central Executive Committee (the top decision-making body of the party) Chaudhary continued to dissent in the 1990s from official party line on many cases; he voted against the Jamaat forming a coalition with the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] for the 1999 elections while on the Central Executive Committee; however, the Jamaat formed an alliance; by this time Chaudhary had become disillusioned with the Jamaat as he felt that the party had lost its way in protecting the national interests of Pakistan, he left the party in 2006. Upon the death of [[Qazi Hussain Ahmed]] (the man who Chaudhary fell out with over his moderate approach compared to Ahmed's more conservative approach) it became evidently clear the two men had managed to reconcile their differences at some point while Chaudhary had still defected to PTI<ref>{{cite web|author=Ejaz Chaudhary |url=https://twitter.com/EjazChaudhary/status/287764056683708417 |title=Ejaz Chaudhary on Twitter: \"Going to Peshawar to attend funeral of Qazi Hussain Ahmad with my wife,both of us have great affiliation with him\" |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2013-01-05 |accessdate=2020-02-26}}</ref>\n\nChaudhary's political views are frequently described as moderate, based on the principals of Islam and of communal tolerance <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awaztoday.com/singleprofile/549/Ejaz-Chaudhry.aspx |title=Ejaz Chaudhary |publisher=Awaztoday.com |date= |accessdate=2020-02-26}}</ref> \n===Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf: 2007\u2013present===\nBy September 2007, Chaudhary joined Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf after receiving a personal invitation from Khan himself to join the party.

Chaudhary and General Zia-ul-Haq were initially on good terms as Zia was keen to placate the religious right. However Chaudhary fast became disillusioned with Zia's undemocratic ways and as leader of the youth wing, Chaudhary dissented from the majority of the senior leadership as he opposed the regime of dictator [[General Zia-ul-Haq]]. Chaudhary organised protests in his native [[Lahore]] as national leader of the Jamaat's youth wing, General Zia soon ordered repression of the protests and Chaudhary along with his leaders and followers were tortured and imprisoned by the regime police and security services.\n\nThe death of General Zia in 1988 breathed new life into Pakistan's faltering democracy; during this period Chaudhary served as deputy mayor of Lahore in the early 1990s. Chaudhary continued to rise in the party's ranks and by 1998 he was appointed to the Central Executive Committee (the top decision-making body of the party) Chaudhary continued to dissent in the 1990s from official party line on many cases; he voted against the Jamaat forming a coalition with the [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)]] for the 1999 elections while on the Central Executive Committee; however, the Jamaat formed an alliance; by this time Chaudhary had become disillusioned with the Jamaat as he felt that the party had lost its way in protecting the national interests of Pakistan, he left the party in 2006.

Trobiawan, Linaw, and Qauqaut were other dialects (''see [[East Formosan languages]]'').\n\nBasay data is mostly available from Erin Asai's 1936 field notes, which were collected from an elderly Basay speaker in Shinshe, [[Taipei]], as well as another one in [[Yilan City|Yilan]] who spoken the Trobiawan dialect (Li 1999). However, the Shinshe informant's speech was heavily influenced by Taiwanese, and the Trobiawan informant, named Ipai, had heavy Kavalan influence in her speech.\n\n==Syntax==\nThere are four optional case markers in Basay (Li 1999:646).\n*a &ndash; nominative, ligature (Shinshe dialect)\n*ta &ndash; nominative (Trobiawan dialect)\n*li &ndash; locative (Shinshe dialect)\n*u &ndash; oblique (Trobiawan dialect)\n\nSome function words include (Li 1999):\n*pai 'future'\n\nTrobiawan negators include (Li 1999):\n*mia 'not' (Shinshe dialect: mayu 'not (yet)')\n*asi 'don't' (Shinshe dialect: manai 'don't')\n*(m)upa 'not to want'\n*(Shinshe dialect: kualau 'not exist')\n\nYes-no questions are marked by ''u ~ nu'' (Li 1999:657).\n\n==Morphology==\nBasay verbs, like Kavalan verbs, distinguish between agent-focus (AF) and patient-focus (PF) verbs (Li 1999:650). The perfective prefixes na- and ni- are [[allomorph]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Basay Focus System\n! Type of prefix\n!c=01| Neutral\n!c=02| Perfective\n!c=03| Future\n|-\n!

Trobiawan, Linaw, and Qauqaut were other dialects (''see [[East Formosan languages]]'').\n\nBasay data is mostly available from Erin Asai's 1936 field notes, which were collected from an elderly Basay speaker in Shinshe, [[Taipei]], as well as another one in [[Yilan City|Yilan]] who spoken the Trobiawan dialect (Li 1999). However, the Shinshe informant's speech was heavily influenced by Taiwanese, and the Trobiawan informant, named Ipai, had heavy Kavalan influence in her speech.\n\n==Syntax==\nThere are four optional case markers in Basay (Li 1999:646).\n*a &ndash; nominative, ligature (Shinshe dialect)\n*ta &ndash; nominative (Trobiawan dialect)\n*li &ndash; locative (Shinshe dialect)\n*u &ndash; oblique (Trobiawan dialect)\n\nSome function words include (Li 1999):\n*pai 'future'\n\nTrobiawan negators include (Li 1999):\n*mia 'not' (Shinshe dialect: mayu 'not (yet)')\n*asi 'don't' (Shinshe dialect: manai 'don't')\n*(m)upa 'not to want'\n*(Shinshe dialect: kualau 'not exist')\n\nYes-no questions are marked by ''u ~ nu'' (Li 1999:657).\n\n==Morphology==\nBasay verbs, like Kavalan verbs, distinguish between agent-focus (AF) and patient-focus (PF) verbs (Li 1999:650). The perfective prefixes na- and ni- are [[allomorph]]s.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Basay Focus System\n! Type of prefix\n!c=01| Neutral\n!c=02| Perfective\n!c=03| Future\n|-\n!
