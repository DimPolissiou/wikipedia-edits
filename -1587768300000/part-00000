It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s. Adult males are sociable despite their [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], forming groups called coalitions.\n\nAfrican cheetahs may achieve successful hunts running at a speed of only {{convert|64|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} while hunting due to their exceptional ability to accelerate, but are capable of accelerating up to {{convert|112|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} on short distances of {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah is, therefore, the [[Fastest animals|fastest]] land animal. Because of its prowess at hunting, the cheetah was tamed as early as the 16th century BC in Egypt to kill game at hunts. Cheetahs have been widely depicted in art, literature, advertising, and animation.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe vernacular name 'cheetah' is derived from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], which today is split into  {{lang-hi|\u091a\u0940\u0924\u093e}} (''c\u012bt\u0101'') and {{lang-ur|\u0686\u06cc\u062a\u0627}} (''ch\u012bt\u0101''),<ref>{{cite book |last=Platts |first=J.

Cheetahs chirp when they are excited, for instance when gathered around a kill. Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari.

The cheetah will stalk its prey, trying to conceal itself in cover, and try to approach as close as possible, often within {{convert|60|to|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey (or even farther for less alert prey). Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly. Cheetahs kill their prey by tripping it during the chase by hitting its rump with the forepaw or using the strong dewclaw to knock the prey off its balance, bringing it down with much force and sometimes even breaking one of its limbs.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs can decelerate extremely fast towards the end of the hunt, slowing down from {{convert|58|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} to {{convert|14|mph|km/h|order=flip|abbr=on}} in just three strides, and can easily follow any twists and turns the prey makes as it tries to flee.<ref name=hunterwcw/> To kill medium- to large-sized prey the cheetah bites the prey's throat to suffocate it and lies down, maintaining the bite for around five minutes, within which the prey stops struggling. A bite on the nape of the neck or the snout (and sometimes on the skull) suffices to kill smaller prey.<ref name = wcw/><ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs have an average hunting success rate of 25\u201340%, higher for smaller and more vulnerable prey.<ref name = \"O'Brien\" /><ref name=hunterwcw/>\n\nOnce the hunt is over, the prey is taken near a bush or a tree; the cheetah, highly exhausted after the chase, rests beside the kill and pants heavily for five to 55 minutes.

Groups of cheetah devour the kill peacefully, though minor noises and snapping may be observed.<ref name=wcw/> Cheetahs can consume large quantities of food; a cheetah at the [[Etosha National Park]] was found to consume as much as {{convert|10|kg|lb}} within two hours.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Phillips |first1 = J.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran). To defend itself or its prey, a cheetah will hold its body low to the ground, and produce a snarl with its mouth wide open, the eyes staring threateningly ahead and the ears folded backward. This may be accompanied by moans, hisses, and growls, and hitting the ground with the paws.<ref name=Estes/> Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; this may be due to [[vulture]]s and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy [[carrion|carcasses]] within a short time; male cheetahs often take kills from females.<ref name=hunterwcw/><ref name=wcw/><ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Houston |first1 = D.

Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

It inhabits a variety of mostly [[arid]] habitats like dry forests, [[scrub forest]]s, and [[savanna]]hs. The species is [[IUCN Red List]]ed as [[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]], as it suffered a substantial decline in its historic range in the 20th century due to [[habitat loss]], [[poaching]] for the [[illegal pet trade]], and conflict with humans. By 2016, the global cheetah population has been estimated at approximately 7,100 individuals in the wild. Several African countries have taken steps to improve cheetah conservation measures.\n\nThe cheetah was formally [[scientific description|described]] by [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1775 and is the only [[extant taxon|extant member]] of the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Acinonyx]]''. Its yellowish tan or [[rufous]] to greyish white [[Coat (animal)|coat]] is uniformly covered with nearly 2,000 solid black spots. Its body is slender with a small rounded head, black tear-like streaks on the face, deep chest, long thin legs and long spotted tail. It reaches {{convert|70|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} at the shoulder, and weighs {{convert|21|-|72|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe cheetah breeds throughout the year, and is an [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulator]]. [[Gestation]] lasts nearly three months, resulting in a litter of typically three to five, in rare cases up to eight cubs. They are weaned at the age of about six months. After siblings become independent from their mother, they usually stay together for some time. It is active mainly during the day, with hunting its major activity. It is a [[carnivore]] and preys mainly upon [[antelope]]s. It stalks its prey to within {{convert|100|-|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}, charges towards it and kills it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death. Female cheetahs are solitary or live with their offspring in [[home range]]s.

Other uses include summoning of concealed or lost cubs by the mother, as a form of greeting or courtship between adults.<ref name=sh2003/> The cheetah's chirp is similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. <ref name=volodina/> A similar but louder call ('yelp') that can be heard from up to {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; this call is typically used by mothers to locate lost cubs, or by cubs to find their mothers and siblings.<ref name=wcw/><ref name=\"kingdon\">{{cite book |last1=Kingdon |first1=J. |authorlink=Jonathan Kingdon |title=The Kingdon Field Guide to African Mammals |chapter = Cheetah ''Acinonyx jubatus''|year=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=London |isbn=978-1-4729-1236-7 |pages=403\u2013404 |edition=2nd |chapterurl = {{Google Books|id=gcrBDwAAQBAJ|pg=PT975|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref>\n\n* Churring (or churtling): A churr is a shrill, staccato call that can last up to 2 seconds.

A bleat indicates distress, for instance when a cheetah confronts a predator that has stolen its kill.

Apart from chirping, mothers can use a repeated ''ihn ihn'' is to gather cubs, and a ''prr prr'' is to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still. Bickering cubs can let out a 'whirr'{{snds}}the pitch rises with the intensity of the quarrel, and ends on a harsh note.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=sh2003/>\n\nAnother major means of communication is by [[olfactory communication|scent]]{{snds}}males often investigate urine-marked places (territories or common landmarks) for a long time by crouching on their forelegs and carefully smelling the place. Then they will themselves urinate there and sniff at their own scent before leaving; other observing individuals might repeat the ritual. Females may also show marking behavior but less prominently than males do. Among females, those in oestrus will show maximum urine-marking, and their excrement can attract males from far off. Males marking their territory by urination stand close to an elevated spot (such as tree trunks, stumps or rocks) with the tail raised and the penis pointed at the area to be marked. In Botswana, cheetahs are frequently captured by ranchers who set up traps in traditional marking spots; the calls of the trapped cheetah can allure more cheetahs to the place.<ref name=Estes/><ref name=nowak/> \n\nTouch and visual cues are other ways of signaling in cheetahs. Social meetings involve mutual sniffing of the oral area, anus and genitals. Individuals will groom one another, lick each other's faces and rub cheeks. However they seldom lean on or rub their flanks against each other. The tear streaks on the face can sharply define expressions at close range. The alternate light and dark rings on the tail of a mother probably serve as a signal to cubs to follow her.<ref name=Estes/>\n\n===Diet and hunting===\n\nThe cheetah is a carnivore that hunts small- to medium-sized prey weighing {{convert|20|to|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, but mostly below {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The primary prey are medium-sized ungulates; some ungulates are the major diet in certain areas, such as [[Dama gazelle|Dama]] and [[Dorcas gazelle|Dorcas]] [[gazelle]]s in the Sahara, [[impala]] in the eastern and southern African woodlands, [[springbok]] in the arid savannas to the south and [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the Serengeti; in India cheetahs used to prey mostly on [[blackbuck]]. Smaller antelopes such as the [[common duiker]] are a common prey in the southern Kalahari. Larger ungulates are typically avoided, though [[nyala]], whose males weigh around {{convert|120|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, were found to be the major prey in a study in the Phinda Game Reserve.

Alternatively the cheetah can lay hidden in cover and wait for the prey to come nearer. A stalking cheetah assumes a partially crouched posture, with the head lower than the shoulders; it will move slowly and turn still at times. In areas of minimal cover the cheetah will approach within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the prey and start the chase. The chase typically lasts a minute; in a 2013 study the length of chases averaged {{convert|173|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and the longest run measured {{convert|559|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The cheetah can give up the chase if it is detected by the prey early or if it can not make a kill quickly.

They typically begin with the hindquarters, and then progress toward the abdomen and the spine. Rib bones are chewed on at the ends, and the limbs are not generally torn apart while eating. Unless the prey is very small, the skeleton is left almost intact after feeding on the meat. Cheetahs might lose 10\u221215% of their kills to large carnivores such as hyenas and lions ([[grey wolf|grey wolves]] in Iran).

These areas were found to be spacious; of these four areas, the Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary had the largest available area, {{convert|6800|sqkm|sqmi}}. Moreover, these were rich in prey availability. The [[Sanjay National Park]], though comprising an area of {{convert|12.500|sqkm|sqmi}} and having supported cheetah populations before the independence of India in 1947, is no longer suitable for the cheetah due to low prey density and risks of poaching.<ref>{{cite report |last1 = Ranjitsinh |first1 = M.

In the Middle East, the cheetah would accompany the nobility to hunts in special seats behind saddles. Cheetahs continued to be associated with royalty and elegance in western Asia until as late as the 19th century. The first phase of taming would take several weeks, in which the cheetah would be kept tethered and made to get accustomed to human beings. Next, the cheetah would be tempted with food and trained to mount horses. Finally, its hunting instincts would be aroused by slaughtering animals before it. The whole process could take as long as a year to complete. In eastern Asia, the records are confusing as regional names for the leopard and the cheetah may be used interchangeably. The earliest depiction of cheetahs from eastern Asia dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] (7th to 10th centuries{{nbsp}}AD); paintings depict tethered cheetahs as well as cheetahs mounted on horses. Chinese emperors would use cheetahs, as well as [[caracal]]s, as gifts. In the 13th and the 14th centuries, the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] rulers bought numerous caracals, cheetahs, and tigers from the western parts of the empire and Muslim merchants, in return for gold, silver, cash, and silk. According to the ''[[Ming Shilu]]'', the subsequent [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries) continued this practice. The cheetah gradually entered Eurasia toward the 14th century, though they never became as popular as they had in the Middle East.<ref name=mair/> The [[Mughal dynasty|Mughal]] ruler [[Akbar the Great]] (1556\u20131605) is said to have kept as many as 1000 cheetahs.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" /> However, his son [[Jahangir]] wrote in his memoirs, ''[[Tuzk-e-Jahangiri]]'', that only one of them gave birth to cubs.<ref name=mair/> Mughal rulers trained cheetahs as well as caracals in a similar way as the West Asians, and used them to hunt game{{snds}}especially [[blackbuck]].

The term 'torus' was derived due to the biconcave disk and C-shape of the virion in the extracellular environment. Due to genetic similarities and replication behavior, in 1992, the Torovirus has been included in the Coronaviridae family. Various envelope genes and the enzymes like polymerase in the Toroviruses and Coronaviruses can be ancestrally related to the common predecessor. Hence the nomenclature of the Torovirus constituents like proteins and mRNAs and other structures has been derived from the family Coronaviridae. However, varying structural components and diversity in the molecular sequences in genomes of Torovirus put them in a separate genus. Currently, the [[international Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) recognize four species in the genus Torovirus, namely EToV, BToV, PToV, and HToV. <ref>Cho, K. O., & Hoet, A. E. (2014).

While Berne virus was not neutralized by antisera against known equine viruses, serologic cross-reactions were observed in neutralization tests and ELISA using sera from calves that had been experimentally infected with morphologically similar particles, then baptized \u2018Breda\u2019 viruses. The first \u2018Breda\u2019 bovine torovirus (BToV) was discovered in 1979 during an investigation in a dairy herd in Breda (Iowa), in which severe neonatal calf diarrhea had been a problem for three consecutive years. After this initial report, other strains of BToV were identified in beef calves from Ohio, and in a colostrum-deprived (CD) calf from Iowa. Most of the studies on the pathogenesis and pathology of torovirus infections have been done in BToV-infected gnotobiotic (Gn) and CD calves, as well as in limited field studies; in contrast, most of the biochemistry and morphogenesis data on toroviruses are based on EToV studies.<ref>Kuwabara M., Wada K., Maeda Y. First isolation of cytopathogenic bovine torovirus in cell culture from a calf with diarrhea. Clinical and Vaccine Immunology. 2007;14:998\u20131004.</ref>\n\nIn 1984, torovirus-like (TVL) particles were detected in the feces from human patients with gastroenteritis by using electron microscopy (EM). Since then, reports of human toroviruses (HToV) in children and adults with acute diarrhea have appeared in several countries, and have been reported as a commonly identified cause of nosocomial viral gastroenteritis in neonatal intensive care units. TVL particles have also been detected in fecal samples from pigs, and named porcine torovirus (PToV), which have several lineages circulating in porcine populations worldwide. However, a link between PToV and clinical disease remains unclear.\n\nTurkey torovirus (TToV) was detected in young poultry with stunting syndrome characterized by diarrhea, poor weight gain, and suboptimal performance. TToV has similar physicochemical properties and sequence similarity of polymerase protein gene to EToV. TToV was propagated in primary culture of turkey intestinal epithelial cells as well as in turkey embryos. Experimental inoculation of TToVs into young poults results in characteristic stunting syndrome.\n\nIn 2007, cytopathogenic BToV from a calf with diarrhea in Japan (designated as BToV-Aichi) was isolated in human rectal tumor cell line HRT-18, which is frequently used for the isolation of bovine coronavirus. Subsequently, another Japanese group isolated four more cytopathogenic BToV strains in HRT-18 cells used for the first BToV strain, but could not in HRT-18 cells used for bovine coronavirus. This indicates that cytopathogenic BToVs were preferentially propagated under the particular conditions, including the source of the HRT-18 cells used. Such adaptation is reported to be associated with the mutation of the HE gene producing a truncated hemagglutinin-esterase protein, which apparently was produced during the passage of the virus in such cultured cells.<ref>Cho KO, Hoet AE.

Clinical and Vaccine Immunology. 2007;14:998\u20131004.</ref> While Berne virus was not neutralized by antisera against known equine viruses, serologic cross-reactions were observed in neutralization tests and ELISA using sera from calves that had been experimentally infected with morphologically similar particles, then baptized \u2018Breda\u2019 viruses. The first \u2018Breda\u2019 bovine torovirus (BToV) was discovered in 1979 during an investigation in a dairy herd in Breda (Iowa), in which severe neonatal calf diarrhea had been a problem for three consecutive years. After this initial report, other strains of BToV were identified in beef calves from Ohio, and in a colostrum-deprived (CD) calf from Iowa. Most of the studies on the pathogenesis and pathology of torovirus infections have been done in BToV-infected gnotobiotic (Gn) and CD calves, as well as in limited field studies; in contrast, most of the biochemistry and morphogenesis data on toroviruses are based on EToV studies.\n\nIn 1984, torovirus-like (TVL) particles were detected in the feces from human patients with gastroenteritis by using electron microscopy (EM). Since then, reports of human toroviruses (HToV) in children and adults with acute diarrhea have appeared in several countries, and have been reported as a commonly identified cause of nosocomial viral gastroenteritis in neonatal intensive care units. TVL particles have also been detected in fecal samples from pigs, and named porcine torovirus (PToV), which have several lineages circulating in porcine populations worldwide. However, a link between PToV and clinical disease remains unclear.\n\nTurkey torovirus (TToV) was detected in young poultry with stunting syndrome characterized by diarrhea, poor weight gain, and suboptimal performance. TToV has similar physicochemical properties and sequence similarity of polymerase protein gene to EToV. TToV was propagated in primary culture of turkey intestinal epithelial cells as well as in turkey embryos. Experimental inoculation of TToVs into young poults results in characteristic stunting syndrome.\n\nIn 2007, cytopathogenic BToV from a calf with diarrhea in Japan (designated as BToV-Aichi) was isolated in human rectal tumor cell line HRT-18, which is frequently used for the isolation of bovine coronavirus. Subsequently, another Japanese group isolated four more cytopathogenic BToV strains in HRT-18 cells used for the first BToV strain, but could not in HRT-18 cells used for bovine coronavirus. This indicates that cytopathogenic BToVs were preferentially propagated under the particular conditions, including the source of the HRT-18 cells used. Such adaptation is reported to be associated with the mutation of the HE gene producing a truncated hemagglutinin-esterase protein, which apparently was produced during the passage of the virus in such cultured cells.<ref>Cho KO, Hoet AE.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids.

The new trams will be {{convert|43|m}} long and {{convert|2.4|m}} wide, and be capable of carrying 90 seated and 186 standing passengers. Both [[Stadler Rail]] and [[Siemens]] filed complaints with the [[Administrative Court of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich]], causing the finalisation of the contract to be suspended, but the court ruled in February 2017 that VBZ could conclude the contract with Bombardier. After both Stadler and Siemens decided not to appeal this decision to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], the contract was finally signed on 2 March 2017.

The trams and other city transport modes operate within a fare regime provided by the cantonal public transport authority [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV), which also covers regional rail and bus services.<ref name=tutttctlr>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title = Z\u00fcrich: Top city \u2014 thanks to light rail | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 130\u2013134 | date = April 2005}}</ref><ref name=tuttcraag>{{cite news | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | title =  Z\u00fcrich: The Cobra rules, all above ground | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 180\u2013184 | date = May 2005}}</ref><ref name=zacait>{{cite web |  first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/zurich05_0.html | title = Z\u00fcrich: A city and its trams | date = December 2005 | accessdate = 2011-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe city's trams are operated by the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Z\u00fcrich]] (VBZ), which also manages the tramway infrastructure within the city, but the city's tram tracks are also used by two other operations.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

Most, but not all, tram stops are configured to allow passengers in [[wheelchair]]s to board low-floor trams.<ref name=gpw/>\n\nOf the three routes that operate in part over Glattalbahn tracks, routes 10 and 12 are operated by the VBZ on behalf of the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] (VBG), normally using tramcars in the VBG's own predominantly white colour scheme, whilst route 11 is operated by the VBZ on its own behalf, normally using vehicles in its own livery.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr/>\n\nThe independent [[Forchbahn]] (FB) railway uses VBZ trackwork to reach their city centre terminus, at [[Z\u00fcrich Stadelhofen railway station|Bahnhof Stadelhofen]], from the eastern edge of the city, at Rehalp. The FB trains operate largely in the street for this section of their route, sharing track with VBZ tram routes, but are categorised as route [[S18 (ZVV)|S18]] of the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn railway network]] rather than as part of the tram network. Beyond Rehalp the trains use the FB's own segregated tracks to reach their outer terminus at [[Esslingen, Switzerland|Esslingen]].<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/>\n\nOn the last weekend of each month, the [[Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum]] operates tram route 21 from the city centre to the museum at Burgwies (up to Rehalp at Saturdays), using their own heritage rolling stock.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tram-museum.ch/content.php?id=5&lang=en | title = The Museum Line 21 | publisher = Z\u00fcrich Tram Museum | accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Infrastructure===\n[[File:Z\u00fcrich - Stadelhoferplatz IMG 4441.JPG|thumb|Raised platforms for use with low-floor trams, being used by a high-floor tram]]\nZ\u00fcrich's tram network is built to [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge).

The tracks are electrified using [[overhead line]] at 600 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]], utilising a supply system shared with the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus network]].<ref name=\"figures\">{{cite web |url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/die_vbz/portraet/zahlen_fakten/linien.html |title=Startseite VBZ - Die VBZ - Portr\u00e4t - Zahlen & Fakten - Linien |publisher=Stadt Z\u00fcrich [City of Z\u00fcrich] |language=German |trans-title=Home VBZ - VBZ - Portrait - Facts & Figures - Lines |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nThe VBZ infrastructure within Z\u00fcrich is largely street based, with varying degrees of segregation from other street traffic and significant sections where trams run in unrestricted traffic lanes. In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. By contrast, on VBG infrastructure in the Stadtbahn Glattal, VBZ trams operate on long stretches of dedicated track.<ref name=gpw>{{cite web | title = Gleisplan - Stra\u00dfenbahn Z\u00fcrich mit Glattal |  url = http://www.gleisplanweb.eu/Maps/Zuerich.pdf | language = German | trans-title = Trackplan - Z\u00fcrich with Glattal | date = 2014-01-23 | accessdate = 2014-06-21}}</ref><ref name=saw/>\n\nMany of Z\u00fcrich's tram stops have been equipped with boarding platforms raised to match the floor height of the low floor trams, although there are still examples of stops where passengers must board from street level. Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided. In consequence all terminal locations are equipped with [[turning loop]]s, and all tram stops are to the [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]] of the tram.<ref name=gpw/>\n\n===Depots and workshops===\n[[File:Tramdepot Zuerich 1911 Friedrich Fissler.jpg|thumb|left|The tram depot at Hard was built in 1911]]\nZ\u00fcrich's tram fleet is kept in the five operational depots of Hard, Irchel, Kalkbreite, Oerlikon and  Wollishofen, together with a permanent way yard at Hardturm. Whilst these depots have the capability to undertake minor maintenance, heavier maintenance is the responsibility of the VBZ's central workshop at Altstetten.

Burgweis depot now houses the [[Tram-Museum Z\u00fcrich]] main collection, whilst Wartau is used as a workshop by that organisation. The rail connections permit the occasional operation of preserved trams on the VBZ network.<ref name=gpw/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Tram fleet===\nAs of 2012, the VBZ owns 313 tram vehicles, which between them cover over 16 million vehicle-kilometres per year. All regular public services are covered by 289 vehicles of two basic classes, with the remainder of the fleet made up of a number of assorted works vehicles, including some used for the cargo tram service, and heritage vehicles.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle. Passengers may board through any door and are not required to show tickets on boarding. Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network. Free transfer is permitted between different vehicles, routes, modes and operators, provided a ticket valid for the whole journey is held.<ref name=vbzfzs>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Fare zone system | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nThe ZVV system is zone-based, with fares for individual journeys set by the zones the journey passes through. The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes.

The cargo tram serves 10 different collection points around Z\u00fcrich, calling at each on different days of the month. The collected refuse is taken to a specially constructed siding at the ERZ yard adjacent to the Werdh\u00f6lzli tram terminus.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | title = Cargo- und E-Tram | language = German | trans-title = Cargo- and E-Tram | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-09 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120829085657/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/de/index/produkte_dienstleistungen/cargo_tram_und_etram.html | archivedate = 2012-08-29 }}</ref><ref name=amcargo>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/cargotram.html | title = Cargotram -  Z\u00fcrich's domestic refuse takes to the rails | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = August 2003 | accessdate = 2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2014&item=140114 | title = Cargotram serves additional destination | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue | date = 2014-01-14 | accessdate = 2014-02-06}}</ref>\n\nThe service was introduced in 2003, as an attempt to reduce the amount of bulky waste items dumped illegally every year.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids. As of February 2015, no decision had been made as to which supplier to select, with reports of conflict between city and canton authorities.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=210610a | title = Tango, Combino or Flexity? | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = June 2010 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?item=201112 | title = New tram order: The ball is rolling | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = November 2012 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2013&item=080413 | title = Five suppliers vie for tram contract | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = April 2013 | accessdate = 2013-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.proaktiva.ch/tram/zurich/newslog/newsitem.php?year=2015&item=260215 | title = More gloom over tram order | first = Andrew | last = Moglestue |  date = February 2015 | accessdate = 2015-03-02}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, it was announced that VBZ had awarded a contract worth 358 million [[Swiss Franc]]s to [[Bombardier Transportation]] for the supply of 70 7-section [[Flexity 2]] trams, with an option for a further 70, to be delivered between 2018 and 2023. The new trams will be {{convert|43|m}} long and {{convert|2.4|m}} wide, and be capable of carrying 90 seated and 186 standing passengers. Both [[Stadler Rail]] and [[Siemens]] filed complaints with the [[Administrative Court of the Canton of Z\u00fcrich]], causing the finalisation of the contract to be suspended, but the court ruled in February 2017 that VBZ could conclude the contract with Bombardier. After both Stadler and Siemens decided not to appeal this decision to the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]], the contract was finally signed on 2 March 2017.
