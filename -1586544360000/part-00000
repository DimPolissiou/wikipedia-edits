ClarisWorks 4 requires a 68020 CPU and System 7. When the Claris company was disbanded and absorbed back into Apple, the product was renamed AppleWorks;<ref name=\"cw-by-bob\" /> version 5 was released shortly before the product's return to Apple and was briefly called ClarisWorks 5. ClarisWorks/AppleWorks 5 requires MacOS 7.0.1, though the 5.0.4 patch can only be applied in Mac OS 9. It is the last version to support the 68k CPU architecture.\n\nThe last version, AppleWorks 6, requires a PowerPC CPU and replaces the communications module with a [[presentation software|presentation]] module (in prior versions there was only rudimentary support for presentations through the other modules).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} It was also [[porting|ported]] to the [[Carbon (API)|Carbon API]] to work on Mac OS X, but as an early Carbon application, it does not take advantage of many of the newer features of Mac OS X and portions of the interface still retain elements of the Platinum appearance of Mac OS 8/9.\n\nUsing Claris's [[XTND]] framework, AppleWorks can create, open, and save files in a number of file formats. For example, word processor documents can be saved in [[Microsoft Word]] format, and spreadsheet files can be saved in [[Microsoft Excel]] format.\n\nThe software received good reviews{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} during the course of its lifespan for its interface and the tight integration of its modules. For example, like the earlier versions, in AppleWorks a drawing \"frame\" can be placed in a spreadsheet document, a paint frame can be placed in a drawing document, etc. This allows for very elaborate and data-rich layouts. However, the limitations of the product became more apparent as the product aged {{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}. The program also only allows for a single undo/redo, and in many cases, if a frame from one module is placed in another module, the frame may no longer be editable in any way as soon as it is deselected.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nEquation Editor by Design Science is bundled with AppleWorks.

ClarisWorks 4 requires a 68020 CPU and System 7. When the Claris company was disbanded and absorbed back into Apple, the product was renamed AppleWorks;<ref name=\"cw-by-bob\" /> version 5 was released shortly before the product's return to Apple and was briefly called ClarisWorks 5. ClarisWorks/AppleWorks 5 requires MacOS 7.0.1, though the 5.0.4 patch can only be applied in Mac OS 9. It is the last version to support the 68k CPU architecture.\n\nThe last version, AppleWorks 6, requires a PowerPC CPU and replaces the communications module with a [[presentation software|presentation]] module (in prior versions there was only rudimentary support for presentations through the other modules).{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} It was also [[porting|ported]] to the [[Carbon (API)|Carbon API]] to work on Mac OS X, but as an early Carbon application, it does not take advantage of many of the newer features of Mac OS X and portions of the interface still retain elements of the Platinum appearance of Mac OS 8/9.\n\nUsing Claris's [[XTND]] framework, AppleWorks can create, open, and save files in a number of file formats. For example, word processor documents can be saved in [[Microsoft Word]] format, and spreadsheet files can be saved in [[Microsoft Excel]] format.\n\nThe software received good reviews{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} during the course of its lifespan for its interface and the tight integration of its modules. For example, like the earlier versions, in AppleWorks a drawing \"frame\" can be placed in a spreadsheet document, a paint frame can be placed in a drawing document, etc. This allows for very elaborate and data-rich layouts. However, the limitations of the product became more apparent as the product aged {{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}. The program also only allows for a single undo/redo, and in many cases, if a frame from one module is placed in another module, the frame may no longer be editable in any way as soon as it is deselected.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nEquation Editor by Design Science is bundled with AppleWorks. Also, the [[MathType]] or [[MathMagic]] equation editors can be used.

They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]] in [[San Francisco]] by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]], and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the [[iPhone 6S|iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus]] as the flagship devices in the [[iPhone]] series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] on September 22, 2017, and the [[iPhone X]] on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone 7's overall design is similar to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6. Changes introduced included new color options (matte black and jet black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|headphone jack]]. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] [[quad-core processor|quad-core]] [[system-on-chip]] with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12&nbsp;[[megapixel]] rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional [[telephoto lens]] exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode.\n\nReception of the iPhone 7 was generally negative. Although reviewers noted the improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing for flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of iPhone 7.{{Citation needed|reason=Please cite reviews/reviewers|date=July 2019}}\n\nMany reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]] and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for [[Phil Schiller]]'s statement that such a drastic change required \"courage.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 7 was discontinued and removed from Apple's website after its annual September hardware event on September 10, 2019.\n\n== History ==\nPrior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumored. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[headphone jack]] received significant media attention.{{refn|<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple May Replace 3.5mm Headphone Jack on

Gordon Kelly of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that rival smartphones, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy S7]], had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and [[Nexus 6P]]. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the [[iPhone 6]] and [[iPhone 6S]], was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that \"the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display\".<ref name=\"Forbes review\">{{cite web |first=Gordon |last=Kelly |title=iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus Review: Should You Upgrade? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/09/21/apple-iphone-7-vs-iphone-7-plus-review-should-you-upgrade/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNilay Patel of ''[[The Verge]]'' described the devices as being \"full of aggressive breaks from convention\" despite their design continuity with previous models (going as far as dubbing them \"a prototype of [[iPhone X|next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign]] disguised as an iPhone 6\"), citing the headphone jack removal (which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of [[AirPods|wireless headphones]]), [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] CPU, and home button redesign. The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit \"not as insane\" as the [[quad HD]] displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the \"first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years\" (as opposed to the \"gimmick\" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a \"step\" above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple \"took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem.\" Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were \"legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal.

They were announced on September 7, 2016, at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]] in [[San Francisco]] by Apple CEO [[Tim Cook]], and were released on September 16, 2016, succeeding the [[iPhone 6S|iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus]] as the flagship devices in the [[iPhone]] series. Apple also released the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in numerous countries worldwide throughout September and October 2016. They were succeeded as flagship devices by the [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] on September 22, 2017, and the [[iPhone X]] on November 3, 2017.\n\nThe iPhone 7's overall design is similar to iPhone 6S and iPhone 6. Changes introduced included new color options (matte black and jet black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, revised antenna bands, and the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[Phone connector (audio)|headphone jack]]. The device's internal hardware received upgrades, including a [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] [[quad-core processor|quad-core]] [[system-on-chip]] with improved system and graphics performance, upgraded 12&nbsp;[[megapixel]] rear-facing cameras with optical image stabilization on all models, and an additional [[telephoto lens]] exclusive to the iPhone 7 Plus to provide enhanced (2x) optical zoom capabilities and portrait mode.\n\nReception of the iPhone 7 was generally negative. Although reviewers noted the improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing for flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of iPhone 7.{{Citation needed|reason=Please cite reviews/reviewers|date=July 2019}}\n\nMany reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]] and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for [[Phil Schiller]]'s statement that such a drastic change required \"courage.\u201d\n\nThe iPhone 7 was discontinued and removed from Apple's website after its annual September hardware event on September 10, 2019.\n\n== History ==\nPrior to its announcement, multiple aspects of the iPhone 7 were heavily rumored. Apple's plans to remove the 3.5&nbsp;mm [[headphone jack]] received significant media attention.{{refn|<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Rossignol |title=Apple May Replace 3.5mm Headphone Jack on

Gordon Kelly of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted that rival smartphones, such as the [[Samsung Galaxy S7]], had increased battery life and added water resistance over its predecessor while retaining the headphone jack, and that the iPhone 7's camera photo quality was improved but still lagging behind some phones already on the market, including the Galaxy S7 and [[Nexus 6P]]. Kelly praised how Apple was able to extract improved brightness and accurate color reproduction from its LCD display panel, while noting that it was old technology which was also well behind rivals who had already moved to sharper 1080p or even 2K screens. The iPhone 7's exterior, which reuses the aging design of the [[iPhone 6]] and [[iPhone 6S]], was criticized, especially the size of the device and thick top/bottom bezels, with Kelly writing that \"the iPhone 7 Plus is simply far too big for a smartphone with a 5.5-inch display\".<ref name=\"Forbes review\">{{cite web |first=Gordon |last=Kelly |title=iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus Review: Should You Upgrade? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2016/09/21/apple-iphone-7-vs-iphone-7-plus-review-should-you-upgrade/ |website=[[Forbes]] |date=September 21, 2016 |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNilay Patel of ''[[The Verge]]'' described the devices as being \"full of aggressive breaks from convention\" despite their design continuity with previous models (going as far as dubbing them \"a prototype of [[iPhone X|next year's rumored drastic iPhone redesign]] disguised as an iPhone 6\"), citing the headphone jack removal (which he felt was an attempt to encourage the use of [[AirPods|wireless headphones]]), [[Heterogeneous computing|heterogeneous]] CPU, and home button redesign. The display quality was considered an improvement over previous models, albeit \"not as insane\" as the [[quad HD]] displays on competing phones. The Taptic Engine was considered the \"first really valuable new UI concept I've seen on phones in years\" (as opposed to the \"gimmick\" of 3D Touch), Patel felt that the cameras of the devices were a \"step\" above the 6S in terms of performance, and praised the dual-lens camera on the 7 Plus for enhancing the phone's camera functionality. However, he panned the lack of editing features that made use of them. In regards to the enhanced Bluetooth audio support provided by devices containing the W1 chip, he argued that Apple \"took away an established open standard in favor of new technologies, but instead of making the experience of using those new technologies better across the board, it made every third-party wireless audio product a second-class citizen of the Apple ecosystem.\" Giving the iPhone 7 a 9 out of 10, he concluded that the devices were \"legitimately among the most interesting, opinionated, powerful phones Apple has ever shipped, and the most confident expressions of the company's vision in a long time. iOS 10 is excellent, the cameras are better, and the performance is phenomenal.

It also posthumously bills [[Bela Lugosi]] as a guest-star (silent footage of the actor had actually been shot by Wood for another, unfinished film just prior to Lugosi's death in August 1956). Other guest-stars are Hollywood veterans [[Lyle Talbot]], who claimed that he never refused any acting job, and former cowboy star [[Tom Keene (actor)|Tom Keene]]. ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' was released theatrically in 1959 by [[Distributors Corporation of America]], which was credited as Valiant Pictures at the time. \n\nThe film's storyline concerns [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s who seek to stop humanity from creating a [[doomsday weapon]] that could destroy the universe. The aliens implement \"Plan 9\", a scheme to resurrect the Earth's dead, referred to as \"[[ghoul]]s\". By causing chaos, the aliens hope the crisis will force humanity to listen to them; otherwise the aliens will destroy mankind with armies of the undead. The film was originally developed under the title '''''Grave Robbers from Outer Space''''', but its financial backers objected to this title, considering it sacrilegious, and it was retitled ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' prior to production.\n\n''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' played on television in relative obscurity until 1980, when authors Harry Medved and [[Michael Medved]] dubbed it the \"[[List of films considered the worst|worst film ever made]]\" in their book ''[[The Golden Turkey Awards]]''. Wood and his film were posthumously given two [[Golden Turkey Awards]] for Worst Director Ever and Worst Film.

Overhead, an airliner heads toward [[Burbank, California]]. The pilot, Jeff Trent, and his co-pilot Danny are blinded by a bright light and loud noise. They look outside and see a [[flying saucer]]. They follow the saucer's flight until it lands at the graveyard, where the funeral's gravediggers are killed by a female zombie.\n\nAt home, lost in his grief, the old man goes outside and (offscreen) steps in front of an oncoming car and is killed. Mourners at the old man's funeral discover the dead gravediggers. Inspector Daniel Clay and other police officers arrive, but Clay goes off alone to continue his investigation.\n\nTrent and his wife Paula, who live near the graveyard, hear the [[Siren (noisemaker)|sirens]] and Jeff tells Paula about his flying-saucer encounter, stating that the [[United States Army|army]] has since sworn him to secrecy. A powerful swooshing noise then knocks everyone at the Tanner residence and the nearby graveyard to the ground as a saucer lands.

To force their acknowledgment, Eros recommends implementing \"Plan 9\", which will resurrect recently-dead humans by stimulating their [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]] and [[pineal gland]]s. Meanwhile, Trent prepares for another flight; concerned for his wife's safety he urges her to stay with her mother, but she insists on staying home. That night, the zombified old man rises from his grave and breaks into the house. He pursues Paula outside, where his zombie wife and zombie Inspector Clay join him. Paula manages to escape, then collapses from her ordeal while the three zombies return to Eros' saucer.  \n\nAt [[the Pentagon]], Gen. Roberts informs Edwards that the government has been receiving alien messages. They explain that the aliens are trying to prevent humanity from eventually destroying the universe. The general dispatches Edwards to [[San Fernando, California]], where most of the alien activity has occurred.\n\nThough the undead are under alien control, zombie Clay suddenly attacks and nearly strangles Eros. The ruler closely examines zombie Clay, then orders the zombie old man destroyed to further frighten humanity. He then approves Eros's Plan 9 to raise undead armies and orders that they march on the [[capital city|capitals]] of Earth.\n\nIn California, the police and Edwards interview the Trents, not knowing that the flying saucer has returned to the graveyard. Officer Kelton encounters the zombie old man, who chases him into the Trents' yard where Eros' ray hits him and his body rapidly decompose. Stunned, Edwards, the Trents, and the police drive to the cemetery.  \n\nJohn Harper insists on leaving Paula in the car, but Paula refuses to stay alone, so Kelton stays with her. Eros and fellow alien Tanna send zombie Clay to kidnap Paula and lure the other three to their saucer. Seeing the saucer's glow off in the distance, Trent and the police head toward it. At the car, zombie Clay knocks out Kelton; when he awakens, Kelton calls for help and Patrolman Larry responds. \n\nEros lets Trent and the police enter his saucer with their guns drawn. He then tells them human weapons development will inevitably lead to the discovery of \"Solaronite,\" a substance that has the effect of exploding \"sunlight molecules.\" Such an explosion would set off an uncontrollable [[chain reaction]], destroying the ''entire'' universe. Eros now believes humans are too immature and stupid (\"You see? You see? Your stupid minds. Stupid! Stupid!\"),<ref>{{cite web |title=Plan 9 From Outer Space |url=https://www.quotes.net/movies/plan_9_from_outer_space_8855 |website=Quotes.net |publisher=Stands4 LLC |accessdate=2018-12-31}}</ref> so he intends to destroy mankind. He threatens to kill Paula if Trent and the police try to force him to go with them. Officers Kelton and Larry arrive and see zombie Clay holding the unconscious Paula near the saucer. Realizing that their weapons are useless, they sneak up behind Clay and club him with a length of wood, knocking him out. Eros sees this and says Clay's controlling ray has been shut off, which released Paula. A fight breaks out between Eros and Jeff, but the saucer's equipment is damaged during the struggle, starting a fire aboard. The humans quickly escape, and Tanna and the unconscious Eros fly away in their burning saucer, which finally explodes, killing them both; their zombies quickly decompose to skeletal remains inside their clothing.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PlanNine 11.jpg|thumb|right|Pilot Jeff Trent ([[Gregory Walcott]]) confronts the aliens.]]\n[[File:PlanNine 09.jpg|thumb|right|The corpse of Inspector Clay ([[Tor Johnson]]) attacks Eros ([[Dudley Manlove]]).]]\n* [[Gregory Walcott]] as Jeff Trent\n* Mona McKinnon as Paula Trent\n* [[Duke Moore]] as Lt.

Science fiction remained popular throughout the 1950s, though the genre had experienced significant changes in the [[post-war]] period. The [[Atomic Age]], heralded by the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], had inspired science fiction films to deal with the dangers of unrestricted science, while [[History of spaceflight|space flight]] and the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]] and civilizations (more \"traditional\" elements of the genre), seemed to hold new fascination for audiences at the beginning of the [[Space Race]]. On the other hand, Gothic fiction had enjoyed the height of its film popularity during the 1930s and 1940s. It was in decline by the 1950s and was viewed as old-fashioned. By 1950s standards, the combination of dated and modern elements gives the film a rather [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] quality.<ref name=\"Craig1\">Craig 2009, pp. 138\u2013177.</ref>\n\n''Plan 9''{{'}}s script seems to aim at being an [[epic film]], a genre typically requiring a big budget from a [[major film studio]]. That Ed Wood made it with minimal financial resources underscores one of the qualities of his work: His ideas tended to be too expensive to film, yet he tried to film them anyway. As Rob Craig argues, Wood's failed efforts give the film a peculiar charm. Craig finds that ''Plan 9'' has much in common with both [[epic theatre]] (\"grand melodrama on a minuscule budget\") and the [[Theatre of the Absurd]] (characters acting as buffoons, nonsense, and verbosity in dialogue, [[Dream art|dream-like]] and [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] imagery, hints of allegory, and a narrative structure where [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] is consistently undermined).<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\n===The introduction and its origins===\nThe film opens with an introduction by Wood's friend, psychic [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]]: \"Greetings my friends! We are all interested in the future, For that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives!\". (This line appears in the narration for the [[General Motors]]' \"Futurama\" ride and its accompanying film, ''To New Horizons'', that were part of the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]\u2014years before Criswell's own television program.)<ref>{{Internet Archive|id=ToNewHor1940|name=To New Horizons by Handy (Jam) Organization}}</ref> At the time of filming, Criswell was the star of the KLAC Channel 13 (now [[KCOP|KCOP-13]]) television series ''Criswell Predicts''. The introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show (a ''Criswell Predicts'' title card appears at the start of the scene), but since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a comparison is impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell's public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early [[Televangelism|televangelists]]. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as \"my friends,\" as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line likely derives from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction, \"Future events such as these will affect you in the future\", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nAnother line asserts that the audience is interested in \"the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable,\" probably assuming that the film's audience will have a fascination with the paranormal. The narrator starts claiming that \"we\" (the filmmakers) are bringing to light the full story and evidence of fateful events, based on the \"secret testimony\" of the survivors. The narration seems to emulate the style of [[Sensationalism|sensational]] headlines in tabloid newspapers, and promises audiences access to \"lurid secrets\" as if following the example of ''[[True Confessions (magazine)|True Confessions]]'' and similar scandal magazines. The notion that a film or show could be based on true incidents and testimony would be familiar to a 1950s audience, because it was used in contemporary [[police procedural]]s such as ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nChanging the tone, Criswell delivers the sermon-like lines: \"Let us punish the guilty! Let us reward the innocent!\" which again sounds like a preacher addressing his congregation. The introduction concludes with the dramatic question: \"Can your heart stand the shocking facts about graverobbers from outer space\"? The latter phrase was simply the original title of the film, but the rest of the line again seems to emulate the sensationalist press.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe film's [[afterword]], also narrated by Criswell and delivered in an identical tone to the film's introduction, provides the audience with a challenge (\"...you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony. Can you prove it didn't happen\"?), a warning (\"Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment\"), and concluding wish (\"God help us...in the future\".)<ref>{{cite web |title=Criswell quotes |url=http://www.moviequotedb.com/movies/plan-9-from-outer-space/character_1864.html |website=Movie Quotes Database |publisher=Movie Quotes Database |accessdate=2019-01-02}}</ref>\n\n===Government conspiracy===\nThrough Trent's initial conversation with his wife, the film introduces the notion of a government and military conspiracy to cover up information on [[List of reported UFO sightings|documented UFO sightings]]. This notion was clearly influenced by the emergence and increased popularity of a [[UFO conspiracy theory]]. \n\nThe implications concerning the public's distrust of the government were however atypical for a 1950s American film. [[Anti-statism|Anti-statist]] ideas were to become more popular in the 1960s, which is when the subject became \"safe\" for mainstream cinema.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />. In this area and perhaps others, the film was actually ahead of its time.\n\n===Message from the aliens===\nThe film contains a cautionary message from the aliens. The earliest use of this concept in film was probably in ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951), and it had since seen frequent use in science-fiction films. The idea was that humanity's [[self-destructive behavior]] was the real threat, not any external source of danger.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\n==Casting==\nThe \"iconic\" [[flying saucer]] of the film has been variously identified as a paper plate or a hubcap. According to the documentary ''Flying Saucers Over Hollywood, The Plan 9 Companion'' (1991) it was actually a recognizable model kit produced in 1956 by toy manufacturer Paul Lindberg. Lindberg Line model kits had introduced a flying saucer kit, roughly matching the popular image of UFOs of the time: \"a silver disc-shaped craft with a clear dome on top.\" Inside the plastic dome was a [[Little green men|little green man]]. Both a regular version of the assembled model and a modified version appear in the film.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nFootage of [[Los Angeles]] is used to ground the otherworldly events to a realistic setting. As a resident, Wood was probably familiar with the locations. The scene where the military fires at the flying saucers is actual military stock footage.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe Rev. Lynn Lemon, who plays an unnamed minister, was one of the [[Baptist]]s variously involved in the production of the film. J. Edward Reynolds was a leader of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], and Hugh Thomas was one of his associates from the church; both play gravediggers, while Reynolds was also the executive producer of the film. At the time of the film's creation, David De Mering was the personal secretary and alleged lover of fellow cast member [[Bunny Breckinridge]]; his inclusion in the cast was probably a result of this association.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />[[File:Quality Studios 2015.jpg|thumbnail|Quality Studios in 2015.]]\n\nAccording to [[Maila Nurmi]] (Vampira), she was recruited by [[Paul Marco]] to act as a vampire in the film, for $200. She recalled insisting that her part be silent, as she did not like the dialogue that Wood had written for her. This recollection might be inaccurate, since the undead of this film are generally mute. She contributed to the film a \"regal presence\" and theatrical mannerisms. Her performance is reminiscent of a [[silent film]] actress; she credited [[Theda Bara]] as her main influence.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe male alien Eros is apparently named after [[Eros]], Greek god of love. Craig suggests that the female alien's name, Tanna, invokes the name of another Greek deity: [[Thanatos]], god of death.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe Pentagon office depicted includes a map of the United States with the sign of the [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad]]. The same map appears in ''Baghdad After Midnight'' (1954), which was also filmed at Quality Studios; it was probably a standard Quality Studios prop.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\n===Bela Lugosi's last film===\n[[File:PlanNine 08.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Bela Lugosi]], in silent footage for the abandoned ''The Vampire's Tomb'', which was later recycled for ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''.]]\nShortly before Lugosi's death in August 1956, he had been working with Wood on numerous half-realized projects, variously titled ''The Vampire's Tomb'' or ''The Ghoul Goes West''.<ref name=\"Peary\">Peary 1981, pp. 266\u2013270.</ref> Scenes unconnected to ''Plan 9'', featuring Lugosi weeping at a funeral, walking in front of Tor Johnson's house at daytime, walking in and out of the Johnson home's side door at nighttime and a daylight scene on a patch of highway showing Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before furling it around himself and walking back the way he came, had been shot. According to the documentary Flying Saucers : The 'Plan 9' Companion, these shots were improvised. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood shelved these projects.<ref name=\"Peary\"/> \n\nShortly after Lugosi's death the story and screenplay for ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' were written and finalized, with Wood planning to use the unconnected, unrelated footage of Lugosi as a means of putting a credit for him on the picture. Wood used the Lugosi footage as a means of attracting actors to the picture, gaining the interest of Gregory Walcott and Maila Nurmi, among others, by telling them he was making \"Bela Lugosi's last movie.\" Though Wood's actions were driven in part by the desire to give his film a \"star name\" and attract horror fans, he meant the Lugosi cameo as a loving farewell and tribute to the actor, who had become a close friend. Wood hired his wife's chiropractor Tom Mason as a stand-in for Lugosi, although Mason was taller than Lugosi and bore no resemblance to him,<ref name=\"Peary\"/> making him one of the earliest \"[[fake Shemp]]s\". Narration from [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]] was also employed in an attempt to better link Lugosi's footage with the rest of ''Plan 9''. The theatrical cut of the film utilized every last scrap of material Wood had of Lugosi, including minor sprocket discolorations, film trims that would in a normal film be discarded as unusable. Cuts of the film on VHS during the '80s and '90s, the vast majority of which were unauthorized bootleg dupes, varied drastically in quality and the amount of Lugosi material retained.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nCoincidentally, further Lugosi footage Wood had shot at an unspecified pre-1956 date was to have been the basis of a second posthumous movie for the horror legend, ''Ghouls of the Moon'', but the footage had been shot on volatile acetate stock and dissolved into toxic-smelling sludge by the time Wood's thoughts turned to the new venture in the summer of 1959. ''Ghouls of the Moon'' was abandoned entirely as a result. Mystery surrounds the content and nature of the lost material, described only as 'wild' by a friend of Wood's who had seen the raw footage shortly after it was shot.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Release===\n''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' was shot in November 1956 and had a private preview March 15, 1957 screening at the Carlton Theatre in [[Los Angeles]] (the onscreen title at this time was ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space''). Another year elapsed before [[Distributors Corporation of America]] (DCA) picked up the film and copyrighted it, intending to distribute it during the spring of 1958. The company folded, however, and it was not released until July 22, 1959, through DCA's receiver, Valiant Pictures. By then it had been re-titled ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''. The film's name had concerned its backers, two local Baptist ministers, who objected to the \"Grave Robbers\" part of the title. They reportedly considered the direct reference to [[grave robbery|grave robbing]] to be [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]], so Wood changed the title to \"Plan 9\". The original title is mentioned at the end of Criswell's opening narration when he asks the audience, \"Can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?\" It is also possible Wood changed the title because he did not want his backers to know that the film was finally being distributed (by 1959, they may have completely given up all hope of seeing a return on their investment). The new title, however, was less indicative of the film's content and may have contributed to its distribution problems.<ref name=\"Craig1\" /> Like many independent films of the period, ''Plan 9'' was distributed under a [[Film distribution#Pre-studio era|states' rights]] basis.\n\n''Plan 9'' was screened as part of a [[double feature]] at various times.<ref>\"Week's Attractions at the Neighborhood Movie Theaters.\" ''The Washington Post'' and ''Times Herald'' (1954\u20131959) \u00aaWashington, D.C.), June 28, 1959, p. H4.</ref> In Chicago, it was first seen alongside the British thriller ''[[Time Lock]]'' (1957), a film which is mostly remembered as an early film credit for [[Sean Connery]]. Later that year, it was used as a \"co-feature\" ([[B movie]]) for double-feature screenings of ''[[The Trap (1959 film)|The Trap]]'' (1959), a film noir starring [[Richard Widmark]]. In Texas, it was seen alongside ''[[Devil Girl From Mars]]'' (1954), a five-year-old British science fiction film.<ref name=\"Movieline\">Adams, Michael.

These include visible microphones, ordinary chairs doubling for aircraft equipment, and plumbing hardware visible aboard the aliens' flying saucer. However, Wood had framed his shots for theatrical widescreen viewing, expecting that the ephemera at the top and bottom of the frame would be cropped when projected. Only when the film is viewed in its original widescreen aspect ratio is it apparent that he ''did'' compose his scenes correctly. The various objects intruding on the picture were never meant to be seen by the audience. Recent ''Plan 9'' DVD releases restore the viewed images to their proper ratios, in a manner consistent with Wood's original intentions. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nCritics say the absurdity of ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' is found in the dialogue rather than on-screen action. Criswell's opening narration redundantly informs the viewer that \"future events such as these will affect you in the future\" while referring to viewers as \"my friends\" four times in the same minute.<ref name=\"Plan9goofs\"/> Criswell also begins the narration by referring to future events, only to describe them in the past tense later (\"...&nbsp;the full story of what happened on that fateful day\"), and inexplicably calling for \"the guilty\" to be punished.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nSeveral sound-stage exterior sets are interspersed with second-unit footage shot outdoors (for example, the old man's reanimated corpse chasing Paula Trent through the cemetery). In a number of these scenes, the outdoor footage was intended to be shot [[Day for night|day-for-night]], but this is not apparent in the film's video transfers, making these scenes contrast harshly against the on-set footage.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Additionally, the military soldiers' hats are slightly lopsided, the \"cemetery\" and graves are obviously made of wood, and the alien's leader wears a generic stage-play \"medieval soldier\" costume.\n\n[[File:Boom mike.png|thumb|right|A visible shadow of the boom microphone (center of photo's upper edge) in a cockpit scene]]\nDuring the first [[Cockpit (aviation)|aircraft cockpit]] scene, the [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer]] is visibly reading from a script in his lap, and a flash of light from a flying saucer reveals the [[Boom operator (media)|boom microphone]]'s shadow.<ref name=\"Plan9goofs\"/> The microphone and flight officer's script are not visible in the original theatrical release, as they do not fit the frame for its original 1.85:1 projected aspect ratio.<ref>\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", ''BoxOffice Barometer'', February 29, 1960, pp.  117, 130.</ref> These mistakes are noticeable only in the film's [[open matte]] video transfers.\n\n===Music===\nThe music for ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' was compiled by Gordon Zahler.

''Plan 9'' was composed and shot for the 1.85:1 aspect ratio theatrical projection, the predominant widescreen format. As unskilled a filmmaker as he was, Ed Wood never intended for his film to be seen in a 1.33:1 open matte aspect ratio. This has led to various boom mics and edges of props, etc., being seen at the top and bottom of the image, which have since come to be intrinsically associated with the viewing of this film. Further complicating the matter, Wood incorporated stock footage framed in 1.33:1 (including his own footage of [[Bela Lugosi]]), which becomes overly cropped when shown in widescreen.\n\n==Remakes==\nFilmmaker [[Ernie Fosselius]] (of ''[[Hardware Wars]]'' fame) created the 2009 [[short film]] ''Plan 9.1 from Outer Space'', which featured hand-carved wooden puppets of the characters from the film.

''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' was released theatrically in 1959 by [[Distributors Corporation of America]], which was credited as Valiant Pictures at the time. \n\nThe film's storyline concerns [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]]s who seek to stop humanity from creating a [[doomsday weapon]] that could destroy the universe. The aliens implement \"Plan 9\", a scheme to resurrect the Earth's dead, referred to as \"[[ghoul]]s\". By causing chaos, the aliens hope the crisis will force humanity to listen to them; otherwise the aliens will destroy mankind with armies of the undead.

In [[Washington, D.C.]], the military fires missiles at more saucers, while the Chief of Saucer Operations, Col. Thomas Edwards, reveals that the government has been covering up saucer attacks. He mentions that one small town was annihilated, hinting at a [[secret history]] of other encounters.\n\nThe aliens return to their Space Station 7. Commander Eros informs their ruler that he has been unsuccessful in contacting Earth's governments. To force their acknowledgment, Eros recommends implementing \"Plan 9\", which will resurrect recently-dead humans by stimulating their [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]] and [[pineal gland]]s. Meanwhile, Trent prepares for another flight; concerned for his wife's safety he urges her to stay with her mother, but she insists on staying home. That night, the zombified old man rises from his grave and breaks into the house. He pursues Paula outside, where his zombie wife and zombie Inspector Clay join him. Paula manages to escape, then collapses from her ordeal while the three zombies return to Eros' saucer.  \n\nAt [[the Pentagon]], Gen. Roberts informs Edwards that the government has been receiving alien messages. They explain that the aliens are trying to prevent humanity from eventually destroying the universe. The general dispatches Edwards to [[San Fernando, California]], where most of the alien activity has occurred.\n\nThough the undead are under alien control, zombie Clay suddenly attacks and nearly strangles Eros. The ruler closely examines zombie Clay, then orders the zombie old man destroyed to further frighten humanity. He then approves Eros's Plan 9 to raise undead armies and orders that they march on the [[capital city|capitals]] of Earth.\n\nIn California, the police and Edwards interview the Trents, not knowing that the flying saucer has returned to the graveyard. Officer Kelton encounters the zombie old man, who chases him into the Trents' yard where Eros' ray hits him and his body rapidly decompose. Stunned, Edwards, the Trents, and the police drive to the cemetery.  \n\nJohn Harper insists on leaving Paula in the car, but Paula refuses to stay alone, so Kelton stays with her. Eros and fellow alien Tanna send zombie Clay to kidnap Paula and lure the other three to their saucer. Seeing the saucer's glow off in the distance, Trent and the police head toward it. At the car, zombie Clay knocks out Kelton; when he awakens, Kelton calls for help and Patrolman Larry responds. \n\nEros lets Trent and the police enter his saucer with their guns drawn. He then tells them human weapons development will inevitably lead to the discovery of \"Solaronite,\" a substance that has the effect of exploding \"sunlight molecules.\" Such an explosion would set off an uncontrollable [[chain reaction]], destroying the ''entire'' universe. Eros now believes humans are too immature and stupid (\"You see? You see? Your stupid minds. Stupid!

He threatens to kill Paula if Trent and the police try to force him to go with them. Officers Kelton and Larry arrive and see zombie Clay holding the unconscious Paula near the saucer. Realizing that their weapons are useless, they sneak up behind Clay and club him with a length of wood, knocking him out. Eros sees this and says Clay's controlling ray has been shut off, which released Paula. A fight breaks out between Eros and Jeff, but the saucer's equipment is damaged during the struggle, starting a fire aboard. The humans quickly escape, and Tanna and the unconscious Eros fly away in their burning saucer, which finally explodes, killing them both; their zombies quickly decompose to skeletal remains inside their clothing.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:PlanNine 11.jpg|thumb|right|Pilot Jeff Trent ([[Gregory Walcott]]) confronts the aliens.]]\n[[File:PlanNine 09.jpg|thumb|right|The corpse of Inspector Clay ([[Tor Johnson]]) attacks Eros ([[Dudley Manlove]]).]]\n* [[Gregory Walcott]] as Jeff Trent\n* Mona McKinnon as Paula Trent\n* [[Duke Moore]] as Lt.

Science fiction remained popular throughout the 1950s, though the genre had experienced significant changes in the [[post-war]] period. The [[Atomic Age]], heralded by the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], had inspired science fiction films to deal with the dangers of unrestricted science, while [[History of spaceflight|space flight]] and the existence of [[extraterrestrial life]] and civilizations (more \"traditional\" elements of the genre), seemed to hold new fascination for audiences at the beginning of the [[Space Race]]. On the other hand, Gothic fiction had enjoyed the height of its film popularity during the 1930s and 1940s. It was in decline by the 1950s and was viewed as old-fashioned. By 1950s standards, the combination of dated and modern elements gives the film a rather [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] quality.<ref name=\"Craig1\">Craig 2009, pp. 138\u2013177.</ref>\n\n''Plan 9''{{'}}s script seems to aim at being an [[epic film]], a genre typically requiring a big budget from a [[major film studio]]. That Ed Wood made it with minimal financial resources underscores one of the qualities of his work: His ideas tended to be too expensive to film, yet he tried to film them anyway. As Rob Craig argues, Wood's failed efforts give the film a peculiar charm. Craig finds that ''Plan 9'' has much in common with both [[epic theatre]] (\"grand melodrama on a minuscule budget\") and the [[Theatre of the Absurd]] (characters acting as buffoons, nonsense, and verbosity in dialogue, [[Dream art|dream-like]] and [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] imagery, hints of allegory, and a narrative structure where [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] is consistently undermined).<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\n===The introduction and its origins===\nThe film opens with an introduction by Wood's friend, psychic [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]]: \"Greetings my friends! We are all interested in the future, For that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives!\". (This line appears in the narration for the [[General Motors]]' \"Futurama\" ride and its accompanying film, ''To New Horizons'', that were part of the [[1939 New York World's Fair]]\u2014years before Criswell's own television program.)<ref>{{Internet Archive|id=ToNewHor1940|name=To New Horizons by Handy (Jam) Organization}}</ref> At the time of filming, Criswell was the star of the KLAC Channel 13 (now [[KCOP|KCOP-13]]) television series ''Criswell Predicts''. The introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show (a ''Criswell Predicts'' title card appears at the start of the scene), but since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a comparison is impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell's public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early [[Televangelism|televangelists]]. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as \"my friends,\" as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line likely derives from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction, \"Future events such as these will affect you in the future\", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nAnother line asserts that the audience is interested in \"the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable,\" probably assuming that the film's audience will have a fascination with the paranormal. The narrator starts claiming that \"we\" (the filmmakers) are bringing to light the full story and evidence of fateful events, based on the \"secret testimony\" of the survivors. The narration seems to emulate the style of [[Sensationalism|sensational]] headlines in tabloid newspapers, and promises audiences access to \"lurid secrets\" as if following the example of ''[[True Confessions (magazine)|True Confessions]]'' and similar scandal magazines. The notion that a film or show could be based on true incidents and testimony would be familiar to a 1950s audience, because it was used in contemporary [[police procedural]]s such as ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nChanging the tone, Criswell delivers the sermon-like lines: \"Let us punish the guilty! Let us reward the innocent!\" which again sounds like a preacher addressing his congregation. The introduction concludes with the dramatic question: \"Can your heart stand the shocking facts about graverobbers from outer space\"? The latter phrase was simply the original title of the film, but the rest of the line again seems to emulate the sensationalist press.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe film's [[afterword]], also narrated by Criswell and delivered in an identical tone to the film's introduction, provides the audience with a challenge (\"...you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony. Can you prove it didn't happen\"?), a warning (\"Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment\"), and concluding wish (\"God help us...in the future\".)<ref>{{cite web |title=Criswell quotes |url=http://www.moviequotedb.com/movies/plan-9-from-outer-space/character_1864.html |website=Movie Quotes Database |publisher=Movie Quotes Database |accessdate=2019-01-02}}</ref>\n\n===Government conspiracy===\nThrough Trent's initial conversation with his wife, the film introduces the notion of a government and military conspiracy to cover up information on [[List of reported UFO sightings|documented UFO sightings]]. This notion was clearly influenced by the emergence and increased popularity of a [[UFO conspiracy theory]]. \n\nThe implications concerning the public's distrust of the government were however atypical for a 1950s American film. [[Anti-statism|Anti-statist]] ideas were to become more popular in the 1960s, which is when the subject became \"safe\" for mainstream cinema.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />. In this area and perhaps others, the film was actually ahead of its time.\n\n===Message from the aliens===\nThe film contains a cautionary message from the aliens. The earliest use of this concept in film was probably in ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' (1951), and it had since seen frequent use in science-fiction films. The idea was that humanity's [[self-destructive behavior]] was the real threat, not any external source of danger.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\n==Casting==\nThe \"iconic\" [[flying saucer]] of the film has been variously identified as a paper plate or a hubcap. According to the documentary ''Flying Saucers Over Hollywood, The Plan 9 Companion'' (1991) it was actually a recognizable model kit produced in 1956 by toy manufacturer Paul Lindberg. Lindberg Line model kits had introduced a flying saucer kit, roughly matching the popular image of UFOs of the time: \"a silver disc-shaped craft with a clear dome on top.\" Inside the plastic dome was a [[Little green men|little green man]]. Both a regular version of the assembled model and a modified version appear in the film.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nFootage of [[Los Angeles]] is used to ground the otherworldly events to a realistic setting. As a resident, Wood was probably familiar with the locations. The scene where the military fires at the flying saucers is actual military stock footage.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe Rev. Lynn Lemon, who plays an unnamed minister, was one of the [[Baptist]]s variously involved in the production of the film. J. Edward Reynolds was a leader of the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] in [[Beverly Hills, California]], and Hugh Thomas was one of his associates from the church; both play gravediggers, while Reynolds was also the executive producer of the film. At the time of the film's creation, David De Mering was the personal secretary and alleged lover of fellow cast member [[Bunny Breckinridge]]; his inclusion in the cast was probably a result of this association.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />[[File:Quality Studios 2015.jpg|thumbnail|Quality Studios in 2015.]]\n\nAccording to [[Maila Nurmi]] (Vampira), she was recruited by [[Paul Marco]] to act as a vampire in the film, for $200. She recalled insisting that her part be silent, as she did not like the dialogue that Wood had written for her. This recollection might be inaccurate, since the undead of this film are generally mute. She contributed to the film a \"regal presence\" and theatrical mannerisms. Her performance is reminiscent of a [[silent film]] actress; she credited [[Theda Bara]] as her main influence.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe male alien Eros is apparently named after [[Eros]], Greek god of love. Craig suggests that the female alien's name, Tanna, invokes the name of another Greek deity: [[Thanatos]], god of death.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\nThe Pentagon office depicted includes a map of the United States with the sign of the [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad]]. The same map appears in ''Baghdad After Midnight'' (1954), which was also filmed at Quality Studios; it was probably a standard Quality Studios prop.<ref name=\"Craig1\" />\n\n===Bela Lugosi's last film===\n[[File:PlanNine 08.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Bela Lugosi]], in silent footage for the abandoned ''The Vampire's Tomb'', which was later recycled for ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''.]]\nShortly before Lugosi's death in August 1956, he had been working with Wood on numerous half-realized projects, variously titled ''The Vampire's Tomb'' or ''The Ghoul Goes West''.<ref name=\"Peary\">Peary 1981, pp. 266\u2013270.</ref> Scenes unconnected to ''Plan 9'', featuring Lugosi weeping at a funeral, walking in front of Tor Johnson's house at daytime, walking in and out of the Johnson home's side door at nighttime and a daylight scene on a patch of highway showing Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before furling it around himself and walking back the way he came, had been shot. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood shelved these projects.<ref name=\"Peary\"/> \n\nShortly after Lugosi's death the story and screenplay for ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' were written and finalized, with Wood planning to use the unconnected, unrelated footage of Lugosi as a means of putting a credit for him on the picture. Wood used the Lugosi footage as a means of attracting actors to the picture, gaining the interest of Gregory Walcott and Maila Nurmi, among others, by telling them he was making \"Bela Lugosi's last movie.\" Though Wood's actions were driven in part by the desire to give his film a \"star name\" and attract horror fans, he meant the Lugosi cameo as a loving farewell and tribute to the actor, who had become a close friend. Wood hired his wife's chiropractor Tom Mason as a stand-in for Lugosi, although Mason was taller than Lugosi and bore no resemblance to him,<ref name=\"Peary\"/> making him one of the earliest \"[[fake Shemp]]s\". Narration from [[The Amazing Criswell|Criswell]] was also employed in an attempt to better link Lugosi's footage with the rest of ''Plan 9''. The theatrical cut of the film utilized every last scrap of material Wood had of Lugosi, including minor sprocket discolorations, film trims that would in a normal film be discarded as unusable. Cuts of the film on VHS during the '80s and '90s, the vast majority of which were unauthorized bootleg dupes, varied drastically in quality and the amount of Lugosi material retained.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nCoincidentally, further Lugosi footage Wood had shot at an unspecified pre-1956 date was to have been the basis of a second posthumous movie for the horror legend, ''Ghouls of the Moon'', but the footage had been shot on volatile acetate stock and dissolved into toxic-smelling sludge by the time Wood's thoughts turned to the new venture in the summer of 1959. ''Ghouls of the Moon'' was abandoned entirely as a result. Mystery surrounds the content and nature of the lost material, described only as 'wild' by a friend of Wood's who had seen the raw footage shortly after it was shot.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Release===\n''Grave Robbers from Outer Space'' was shot in November 1956 and had a private preview March 15, 1957 screening at the Carlton Theatre in [[Los Angeles]] (the onscreen title at this time was ''Grave Robbers from Outer Space''). Another year elapsed before [[Distributors Corporation of America]] (DCA) picked up the film and copyrighted it, intending to distribute it during the spring of 1958. The company folded, however, and it was not released until July 22, 1959, through DCA's receiver, Valiant Pictures. By then it had been re-titled ''Plan 9 from Outer Space''. The film's name had concerned its backers, two local Baptist ministers, who objected to the \"Grave Robbers\" part of the title. They reportedly considered the direct reference to [[grave robbery|grave robbing]] to be [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]], so Wood changed the title to \"Plan 9\". The original title is mentioned at the end of Criswell's opening narration when he asks the audience, \"Can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?\" It is also possible Wood changed the title because he did not want his backers to know that the film was finally being distributed (by 1959, they may have completely given up all hope of seeing a return on their investment). The new title, however, was less indicative of the film's content and may have contributed to its distribution problems.<ref name=\"Craig1\" /> Like many independent films of the period, ''Plan 9'' was distributed under a [[Film distribution#Pre-studio era|states' rights]] basis.\n\n''Plan 9'' was screened as part of a [[double feature]] at various times.<ref>\"Week's Attractions at the Neighborhood Movie Theaters.\" ''The Washington Post'' and ''Times Herald'' (1954\u20131959) \u00aaWashington, D.C.), June 28, 1959, p. H4.</ref> In Chicago, it was first seen alongside the British thriller ''[[Time Lock]]'' (1957), a film which is mostly remembered as an early film credit for [[Sean Connery]]. Later that year, it was used as a \"co-feature\" ([[B movie]]) for double-feature screenings of ''[[The Trap (1959 film)|The Trap]]'' (1959), a film noir starring [[Richard Widmark]]. In Texas, it was seen alongside ''[[Devil Girl From Mars]]'' (1954), a five-year-old British science fiction film.<ref name=\"Movieline\">Adams, Michael.

These include visible microphones, ordinary chairs doubling for aircraft equipment, and plumbing hardware visible aboard the aliens' flying saucer. However, Wood had framed his shots for theatrical widescreen viewing, expecting that the ephemera at the top and bottom of the frame would be cropped when projected. Only when the film is viewed in its original widescreen aspect ratio is it apparent that he ''did'' compose his scenes correctly. The various objects intruding on the picture were never meant to be seen by the audience. Recent ''Plan 9'' DVD releases restore the viewed images to their proper ratios, in a manner consistent with Wood's original intentions. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nCritics say the absurdity of ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' is found in the dialogue rather than on-screen action. Criswell's opening narration redundantly informs the viewer that \"future events such as these will affect you in the future\" while referring to viewers as \"my friends\" four times in the same minute.<ref name=\"Plan9goofs\"/> Criswell also begins the narration by referring to future events, only to describe them in the past tense later (\"...&nbsp;the full story of what happened on that fateful day\"), and inexplicably calling for \"the guilty\" to be punished.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nSeveral sound-stage exterior sets are interspersed with second-unit footage shot outdoors (for example, the old man's reanimated corpse chasing Paula Trent through the cemetery). In a number of these scenes, the outdoor footage was intended to be shot [[Day for night|day-for-night]], but this is not apparent in the film's video transfers, making these scenes contrast harshly against the on-set footage.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Additionally, the military soldiers' hats are slightly lopsided, the \"cemetery\" and graves are obviously made of wood, and the alien's leader wears a generic stage-play \"medieval soldier\" costume.\n\n[[File:Boom mike.png|thumb|right|A visible shadow of the boom microphone (center of photo's upper edge) in a cockpit scene]]\nDuring the first [[Cockpit (aviation)|aircraft cockpit]] scene, the [[First Officer (civil aviation)|first officer]] is visibly reading from a script in his lap, and a flash of light from a flying saucer reveals the [[Boom operator (media)|boom microphone]]'s shadow.<ref name=\"Plan9goofs\"/> The microphone and flight officer's script are not visible in the original theatrical release, as they do not fit the frame for its original 1.85:1 projected aspect ratio.<ref>\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", ''BoxOffice Barometer'', February 29, 1960, pp.  117, 130.</ref> These mistakes are noticeable only in the film's [[open matte]] video transfers.\n\n===Music===\nThe music for ''Plan 9 from Outer Space'' was compiled by Gordon Zahler. Zahler used stock recordings of works by about a dozen composers, which was a fairly common procedure in the 1950s for scoring low-budget films and television programs.

''Plan 9'' was composed and shot for the 1.85:1 aspect ratio theatrical projection, the predominant widescreen format. As unskilled a filmmaker as he was, Ed Wood never intended for his film to be seen in a 1.33:1 open matte aspect ratio. This has led to various boom mics and edges of props, etc., being seen at the top and bottom of the image, which have since come to be intrinsically associated with the viewing of this film. Further complicating the matter, Wood incorporated stock footage framed in 1.33:1 (including his own footage of [[Bela Lugosi]]), which becomes overly cropped when shown in widescreen.\n\n==Remakes==\nFilmmaker [[Ernie Fosselius]] (of ''[[Hardware Wars]]'' fame) created the 2009 [[short film]] ''Plan 9.1 from Outer Space'', which featured hand-carved wooden puppets of the characters from the film.
