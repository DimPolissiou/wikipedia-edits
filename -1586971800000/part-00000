The concert tour was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of playing, were influenced by the punk rock [[zeitgeist]] of the late 1970s and, provided a stark contrast from Young's previous, folk-inspired album ''[[Comes a Time]]''.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=529\u2013537}}\n\nTwo new songs, the acoustic \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]\" and electric \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" were the centerpiece of the new material. The solo portions of the album including, \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\", \"Thrasher\" and \"Ride My Llama\" were recorded live in [[San Francisco]] at the [[The Boarding House (nightclub)|Boarding House]] between May 24 and May 28, 1978. Two songs from the album were not recorded live: \"Sail Away\" was recorded without Crazy Horse during or after the ''[[Comes a Time]]'' recording sessions,<ref name=\"hrc\">{{cite web |url=http://hyperrust.org/Chronology/The70s.html |title=HyperRust chronology |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref>  and \"Pocahontas\" had been recorded solo in 1976<ref name=\"hrc\"/> (original recording without overdubs was released in 2017 on archival release ''[[Hitchhiker (album)|Hitchhiker]]'').{{cn|date=October 2019}}}\n\nAfter his final performance at the Boarding House on May 28th, Young collaborated with the [[art punk]] band [[Devo]] on a cacophonous version of \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" at the [[Different Fur]] studio in San Francisco and, would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} During the Different Fur studio session, Devo vocalist [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] added the lyrics \"Rust never sleeps\", a slogan he remembered from his graphic arts career promoting the automobile rust proofing product [[Rust-Oleum]]. Young adopted the line and used it in his Crazy Horse version of the song, as well as for the title of his album.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531}} The lyrics, \"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} \n\nThe electric sets were recorded during the Neil Young/Crazy Horse tour in late 1978, with [[overdub]]s added later.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp= 538}} Audience noise is removed as much as possible, although it is clearly audible at certain points, most noticeably on the opening and closing songs. \n\n==

The concert tour was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of playing, were influenced by the punk rock [[zeitgeist]] of the late 1970s and, provided a stark contrast from Young's previous, folk-inspired album ''[[Comes a Time]]''.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=529\u2013537}}\n\nTwo new songs, the acoustic \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]\" and electric \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" were the centerpiece of the new material. The solo portions of the album including, \"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\", \"Thrasher\" and \"Ride My Llama\" were recorded live in [[San Francisco]] at the [[The Boarding House (nightclub)|Boarding House]] between May 24 and May 28, 1978. Two songs from the album were not recorded live: \"Sail Away\" was recorded without Crazy Horse during or after the ''[[Comes a Time]]'' recording sessions,<ref name=\"hrc\">{{cite web |url=http://hyperrust.org/Chronology/The70s.html |title=HyperRust chronology |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}</ref>  and \"Pocahontas\" had been recorded solo in 1976<ref name=\"hrc\"/> (original recording without overdubs was released in 2017 on archival release ''[[Hitchhiker (album)|Hitchhiker]]'').{{cn|date=October 2019}}}\n\nAfter his final performance at the The Boarding House on May 28th, Young collaborated with the [[art punk]] band [[Devo]] on a cacophonous version of \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\" at the [[Different Fur]] studio in San Francisco and, would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} During the Different Fur studio session, Devo vocalist [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] added the lyrics \"Rust never sleeps\", a slogan he remembered from his graphic arts career promoting the automobile rust proofing product [[Rust-Oleum]]. Young adopted the line and used it in his Crazy Horse version of the song, as well as for the title of his album.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531}} The lyrics, \"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} \n\nThe electric sets were recorded during the Neil Young/Crazy Horse tour in late 1978, with [[overdub]]s added later.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp= 538}} Audience noise is removed as much as possible, although it is clearly audible at certain points, most noticeably on the opening and closing songs. \n\n==

She begins:\n\n{{quote|Deep breath. Feel the air fill my lungs. This is the right thing to do. The country needs to see that our democracy still works, no matter how painful this is. Breathe out.

She wrote, \"This wasn't just about my comments in one town hall.

She wrote \"After so much hand-wringing about Trump undermining our democracy by not pledging to accept the results, the pressure was on us to do it right. If I was going to lose, the President wanted me to concede quickly and gracefully.

We are doing the work.<ref>What Happened, p. 501.</ref>\n\nAnother subject of the book is how to get through difficult experiences. Clinton discusses her practice of [[yoga]] and her liking of [[chardonnay]],<ref name=\"books\" /> but in particular, she lists a large number of books that helped her cope with the loss in one way or another. These included mysteries by [[Louise Penny]], [[Jacqueline Winspear]], [[Donna Leon]], and [[Caroline and Charles Todd]].

Bear in mind, too, that few \u2014 if any \u2014 of these same people called out Bernie Sanders for writing his own campaign memoir, one that dropped just days post-election. No, there's some sort of special virulence reserved for Clinton. And she gets it. In fact, she spends much of ''What Happened'' parsing that very question.<ref name=\"ew\">{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Tina|url= \nhttp://ew.com/books/2017/09/12/hillary-clinton-memoir-what-happened-review/|title=Hillary Clinton is upset about a lot of things in What Happened: EW review|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJennifer Senior of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said:\n\n<blockquote>\"What Happened\" is not one book, but many.

'It wasn't healthy or productive,' she writes, 'to dwell on the ways I felt I'd been shivved.' It's a perfect word, 'shivved.'

She begins:\n\n{{quote|Deep breath. Feel the air fill my lungs. This is the right thing to do. The country needs to see that our democracy still works, no matter how painful this is. Breathe out.

She wrote, \"This wasn't just about my comments in one town hall.

She wrote \"After so much hand-wringing about Trump undermining our democracy by not pledging to accept the results, the pressure was on us to do it right. If I was going to lose, the President wanted me to concede quickly and gracefully.

We are doing the work.<ref>What Happened, p. 501.</ref>\n\nAnother subject of the book is how to get through difficult experiences. Clinton discusses her practice of [[yoga]] and her liking of [[chardonnay]],<ref name=\"books\" /> but in particular, she lists a large number of books that helped her cope with the loss in one way or another. These included mysteries by [[Louise Penny]], [[Jacqueline Winspear]], [[Donna Leon]], and [[Caroline and Charles Todd]].

But bear in mind that many \u2014 if not all \u2014 of the people tearing down Clinton and her new memoir, ''What Happened'', haven't actually read it. Bear in mind, too, that few \u2014 if any \u2014 of these same people called out Bernie Sanders for writing his own campaign memoir, one that dropped just days post-election. No, there's some sort of special virulence reserved for Clinton. And she gets it. In fact, she spends much of ''What Happened'' parsing that very question.<ref name=\"ew\">{{cite web|last=Jordan|first=Tina|url= \nhttp://ew.com/books/2017/09/12/hillary-clinton-memoir-what-happened-review/|title=Hillary Clinton is upset about a lot of things in What Happened: EW review|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJennifer Senior of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said:\n\n<blockquote>\"What Happened\" is not one book, but many.

'It wasn't healthy or productive,' she writes, 'to dwell on the ways I felt I'd been shivved.' It's a perfect word, 'shivved.'

The events of the voyage led to witch trials and executions in Denmark and Scotland.\n\n==Career==\nPeder Munk was the son of Ludvig Munk (d. 1537) and Kirstin Pedersdatte Lykke. He was born at [[:da:L\u00f8nborgg\u00e5rd|L\u00f8nborgg\u00e5rd]], L\u00f8nborg, [[Ringk\u00f8bing-Skjern Municipality|Ringk\u00f8bing]], Denmark, on 22 April 1534. Peder's younger brother [[Ludvig Munk]] was also a sailor and a soldier, whose daughter [[Kirsten Munk]] married [[Christian IV of Denmark]] in 1615.\n\nPeder Munk's main estate from 1566 was Estvadg\u00e5rd in [[Skive Municipality|Skive Kommune]].\n\nIn 1575 Peder Munk was made Admiral of Denmark, the [[Admiral of the Realm]] or 'Rigsadmiral', and in 1588 was one of the council, the [[Rigsraadet]] of regents for Christian IV. Peder Munk is said to have provided a miniature warship for the young king in a Jutland lake.\n\nOn 20 August 1589 Peder Munk and others accepted an agreement at [[Helsing\u00f8r]] over the rule of the islands [[Orkney]] from the Scottish ambassador [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal]], as part of the marriage arrangements of [[James VI of Scotland]] and [[Anne of Denmark]], a sister of Christian IV.<ref>''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 822-4.</ref>\n\n==Mission to Scotland==\nIn August 1589 the Danish council decided that Peder Munk, Breide Rantzau, Dr Paul Kniblo, and [[Niels Krag]] would accompany Anne of Denmark, the bride of James VI, to Scotland. Peder sailed on 5 September with Henrik Knudsen Gyldenstierne, admiral of the fleet, and 18 ships.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 150, 164.</ref> They were delayed by adverse winds.

J\u00f8rgen Rosenkrantz and Christoffer Valkendorf asked for the Regent's and Council's advice, and wrote to Anne of Denmark asking if she would return to Denmark, but they realised the Scottish envoys and [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal]] wanted her to continue or stay at Oslo.<ref>''Kancelliets brevb\u00f8ger vedr\u00f8rende Danmarks indre forhold i uddrag'' (Copenhagen, 1908), pp. 275-6.</ref> Meanwhile, Steen Bille, William Stewart, and [[Andrew Sinclair (privy counsellor)|Andrew Sinclair]] brought Anne's letters in French to Edinburgh on 10 October, describing the delay and four or five failed attempts to cross the [[North Sea]], and saying she would stay in Norway.<ref>Miles Kerr-Peterson, ''A Protestant Lord in James VI's Scotland'' (Boydell, 2019), p. 51: ''Descriptive Index of the Contents of Five Manuscript Volumes, library of Dawson Turner'' (Great Yarmouth, 1843), p. 127 now in the British Library: [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t4wh55k35&view=1up&seq=468 ''HMC Salisbury Hatfield'', vol. 3 (London, 1889), p. 438.]</ref> James VI decided to sail to Norway and escort her back to Denmark.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (John Donald: Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 23-5, 136-7: Thomas Riis, ''Auld Acquaintaince'', vol. 1 (Odense, 1988), pp. 264-5.</ref>\n[[File:Falkland Palace from the Orchard.JPG|thumb|right|Peder Munk was welcomed at [[Falkland Palace]] by James Beaton of Creich and given a handful of earth and stones.]]\n\nJames VI and Anne of Denmark returned to Scotland on 1 May 1590 with the remainder of the Danish fleet. Munk, Breide Rantzau, and [[Steen Ottesen Brahe (1547\u20131620)|Steen Brahe]] came as ambassadors. Before Anne's coronation in Edinburgh, Peder Munk travelled to view and take formal possession of the lands which James VI had given Anne of Denmark as a \"[[morning gift]]\". This gift was confirmed by the presentation of a special charter with the royal seal and the seals of representatives of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] and the Scottish burgh towns. Munk went first to [[Rossend Castle]] the home of [[Robert Melville, 1st Lord Melville|Sir Robert Melville]], and stayed at [[Wemyss Castle]]. On 12 May they visited [[Falkland Palace]], then his party stayed the night with the [[William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton|Earl of Morton]] at the Newhouse of [[Lochleven Castle]]. Next, on 13 May, they went to [[Dunfermline Palace]] and then after a night at [[Niddry Castle]], on 14 May, [[Linlithgow Palace]]. At each palace, the lawyer [[John Skene, Lord Curriehill|John Skene]] read out the details of the property, then Munk was given a handful of earth and stone, the traditional Scottish ceremony of transferring ownership or \"[[sasine]]\".<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (John Donald: Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 57-8, 102-3: William Fraser, ''Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss'', vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1888), pp. 28-9: David Moysie, ''Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland'' (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 158.</ref>\n\nBack in Edinburgh, on 17 May, the day of the queen's coronation, Munk, Steen Brahe, and Breide Rantzau walked with Anne of Denmark down the aisle of [[Holyrood Abbey]] on her left side, and the English ambassador [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Sir Robert Bowes]] walked on the right.

It was held in the house of the master of the mint, Thomas Aitchisoun, at the foot of Todrick's wynd. The organiser was [[John MacMorran]] who had the room hung with tapestry, hired musicians, and arranged a guard of honour carrying [[halberd]]s.

Later in 1590, after Munk's return to Denmark from Scotland, [[Anna Koldings]] and others were executed for gathering in Karen V\u00e6vers's house to infest the keels of the ships with little devils.<ref>Louise Nyholm Kallestrup, 'Kind in Words and Deeds but False in Their Hearts: Fear of Evil Conspiracy in Late Sixteenth-Century Denmark', in, Jonathan Barry, Owen Davies, Cornelie Usborne, ''Cultures of Witchcraft in Europe from the Middle Ages to the Present'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018), pp. 138-142.</ref> In Scottish several people were accused of trying to sink the royal ships by magic in the [[North Berwick witch trials]].

They entertained the Scottish ambassadors John Skene and [[William Stewart of Houston|William Stewart]]. At dinner the ambassadors were seated at one table with the king, Munk, Peder Gyldenstierne, Steen Brahe, Hak Holgersen Ulfstand, Henrik Below, and Breide Rantzau, which was a special honour for the diplomats.<ref>David Scott Gehring, ''Diplomatic Intelligence on the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark during the Reigns of Elizabeth I and James VI'', Camden Fifth Series, 49 (2016), p. 155.</ref>\n\nFrom 1596 to 1608, he was [[Marshal of the Realm (Denmark)|Marshal of the Realm]] or Rigsmarsk, the commander of Danish armed forces, in succession to Hak Holgersen Ulfstand (1535-1594).\n\nHe married Karen Skeel (d. 1601) in 1566, a daughter of Albert Skeel and Kirsten Sandberg. Their heraldry, dated 1568, is represented in a carving at [[Borre, Denmark|Borre]] kirke, on the island of [[M\u00f8n]].\n\nOn 29 July 1604 he married Sophie Pedersdatter Brahe (1580-1638), a daughter of Peder Jensson Brahe (d. 1610) and Margarete Albretsdatter G\u00f8ye (d. 1594).\n\nPeder Munk came to England in the retinue of Christian IV and King James gave him a gift of gilt plate on 11 August 1606.<ref>John Nichols, ''The Progresses Processions, and Magnificient Festivities of King James the First'', vol. 1 (London, 1828), p. 604.</ref>\n\nFrom 1589 Munk owned the manor at [[:da:S\u00e6byg\u00e5rd (Volstrup Sogn)|S\u00e6byg\u00e5rd]] at Volstrup Sogn.

The events of the voyage led to witch trials and executions in Denmark and Scotland.\n\n==Career==\nPeder Munk was the son of Ludvig Munk (d. 1537) and Kirstin Pedersdatte Lykke. He was born at [[:da:L\u00f8nborgg\u00e5rd|L\u00f8nborgg\u00e5rd]], L\u00f8nborg, [[Ringk\u00f8bing-Skjern Municipality|Ringk\u00f8bing]], Denmark, on 22 April 1534. Peder's younger brother [[Ludvig Munk]] was also a sailor and a soldier, whose daughter [[Kirsten Munk]] married [[Christian IV of Denmark]] in 1615.\n\nPeder Munk's main estate from 1566 was Estvadg\u00e5rd in [[Skive Municipality|Skive Kommune]].\n\nIn 1575 Peder Munk was made Admiral of Denmark, the [[Admiral of the Realm]] or 'Rigsadmiral', and in 1588 was one of the council, the [[Rigsraadet]] of regents for Christian IV. Peder Munk is said to have provided a miniature warship for the young king in a Jutland lake.\n\nOn 20 August 1589 Peder Munk and others accepted an agreement at [[Helsing\u00f8r]] over the rule of the islands [[Orkney]] from the Scottish ambassador [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal]], as part of the marriage arrangements of [[James VI of Scotland]] and [[Anne of Denmark]], a sister of Christian IV.<ref>''Register of the Privy Council of Scotland'', vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 822-4.</ref>\n\n==Mission to Scotland==\nIn August 1589 the Danish council decided that Peder Munk, Breide Rantzau, Dr Paul Kniblo, and [[Niels Krag]] would accompany Anne of Denmark, the bride of James VI, to Scotland.

CA follows a trimester calendar with grades issued at the conclusion of each term. Classes in all divisions follow a six-day rotating schedule.\n\n==History==\n\nColorado Academy was established in 1906 as the '''Hill School for Boys''' in the [[Capitol Hill, Denver|Capitol Hill]] neighborhood in [[Denver, Colorado]], and by 1923 was called the '''Colorado Military School'''. Military training was incorporated into the curriculum. The school outgrew its space during [[World War II]] and in 1947, moved from its location near the [[University of Denver]] to its present location in Lakewood, just outside the Denver city limits. In 1955, the school began shifting its focus away from military training. Under the leadership of F. Charles Froelicher, '''Colorado Academy''' emerged as a college preparatory school for boys. The school became coeducational in 1971.\n\nCarl Martin became the Chief Financial Officer,  hired by Mr. Froelicher, in December, 1972, and served as CFO until May, 1994, as Chief Financial Officer for Financial Affairs.\n\nToday, the school has three different divisions: Lower School, Pre-Kindergarten - Grade 5, Middle School, Grades 6-8, and Upper School, Grades 9-12. The curriculum emphasizes group and individual study of the liberal arts and sciences, as well as engagement through experiential and service learning.\n\n==Campus==\nThe school's present campus was purchased in 1947. Known as the Kirk estate, it was the country home of Jesse Welborn, president of the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company.  The campus has buildings for each division,  including a state-of-the-art Upper School that opened in January 2013, that features an innovation laboratory, expanded science labs and classrooms. The campus includes two libraries: a Lower School Library and the Raether Library, the Ponzio Arts Center, the Schotters Music Building, the historic Welborn House, Smith Center, a new field house and athletic center, a Campus Center and Bookstore, and a soon-to-be-renovated performing arts center.  The CA campus also has a number of athletic fields, such as Stuie's Courts (8) (Tennis), Wright Field, Simms Field,  Firman Field, Slater Field (turf) and a baseball field that was renovated in 2014.\n\n==Extracurricular activities==\nAll students participate in a week-long experiential learning program in the spring trimester called Interim. The Rocky Mountain wilderness and the Denver urban landscape are some of the settings for a range of experiences. The program is designed to provide students with challenging outdoor experiences alongside classmates and CA faculty. \n\nUpper School students run an annual Students H.O.P.E.
