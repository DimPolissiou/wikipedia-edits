His attempt to capture [[Fort Detroit]] in 1780 ended in defeat when he was ambushed by forces under Chief [[Little Turtle]].\n<!-- Sometimes spelled Delabalme, Delebalme, LaBalme, LeBalme, Le Balme, La Balm, Le Balm, etc. -->\n\n==Seven Years' War==\n\n'''Augustin Mottin''' was born 28 August 1733, in the [[French Alps]] near [[Saint-Antoine-l'Abbaye|Saint-Antoine]], the son of a [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]].  He served as a trooper in the distinguished \"Scottish\" company of the [[Gendarme (historical)|Gendarmerie de France]] during the [[Seven Years' War]].  He was one of the French cavalry officers who survived the crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Minden]].\n\nFollowing the war, Augustin studied horsemanship, eventually becoming master at the Gendarmerie's Riding School in Lun\u00e9ville.  Mottin was promoted to Fourrier-Major in 1766, and retired with a pension in 1773.  Using the assumed name \"Mottin de La Balme,\" he wrote a book on horsemanship in 1773, titled ''Essai sur l'\u00e9quitation ou principes raisonn\u00e9s sur l'Art de monter et de dresser les chevaux''.{{sfnp|Ryerson|2009|p=830}}  He followed with a book on cavalry tactics in 1776.\n\n==American Revolution==\n[[File:LaBalme's Defeat - Whitley County, Indiana.jpg|thumb|right]]\n'''Augustin de La Balme''' received a letter of recommendation from [[Benjamin Franklin]]{{sfnp|Birzer|2000|p=136}} and left for the [[United States]] to assist in the American Revolution.  He arrived with a group of French volunteers that included the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]],{{sfnp|Hogeland|2017|p=88-9}} and expressed a \"love of liberty\" as the motivation for his service.{{sfn|Ferreiro|2016|p=142}}  In 1777, he was appointed as the Colonial Army's [[History of the Office of the Inspector General of the United States Army|Inspector General]] of [[Cavalry]].{{sfnp|Allison|1986|p=45}} Due to his performance in the 1777 [[Battle of Brandywine]], however, [[Kazimierz Pu\u0142aski|Casimir Pulaski]] was made a Major General over all cavalry, including La Balme, who was not at the battle.{{sfn|Ferreiro|2016|p=146}}  When he learned that he would no longer be in command of the United States Cavalry, La Balme resigned in October 1777.<ref>See letter of John Hancock to George Washington, 12 Oct 1777.

The success of [[George Rogers Clark|General Clark's]] capture of [[Fort Sackville]] at [[Vincennes]] inspired La Balme to attempt a similar feat against the British at [[Fort Detroit]]. La Balme arrived in Kaskaskia as a French officer and was \"greeted as [[Messiah|Masiah]]\" by the local [[Canadien]] residents,{{sfnp|Birzer|2000|p=139}} who had been living under British rule for over a decade.  He represented himself as a representative of [[King Louis XVI|Louis XVI of France]]{{sfnp|Birzer|2000|p=139}} and gathered a list of grievances from residents living under the rule of the Virginians, which was to be delivered to the French Ambassador at [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]].{{sfnp|English|1896|p=695}}  La Balme openly disdained Clark, whom he considered an uneducated woodsman.{{sfnp|Hogeland|2017|p=88-9}}  He coordinated a diversionary attack against [[Fort St. Joseph (Niles)|Fort St. Joseph]],{{sfnp|Allison|1986|p=49}} then began his journey to Detroit, recruiting militia from among the Canadian citizens of Kaskaskia, [[Cahokia]], and Vincennes.  At Vincennes, he started up the [[Wabash River]] with the expectation of adding to his force from the Canadian villages of [[Ouiatenon]] (present day [[West Lafayette, Indiana]]) and [[Kekionga]] (present day [[Fort Wayne]]). La Balme apparently expected Canadian residents at Fort Detroit to join him once they arrived.  La Balme kept the French ambassador, [[Anne-C\u00e9sar de La Luzerne]], updated on his movements,{{sfnp|Birzer|2000|p=137}} and the expedition marched under a French flag.{{sfnp|Seineke|1981|p=36, fn}}\n\nLa Balme's mounted force moved so quickly that it had little opposition until reaching [[Kekionga]],{{sfnp|Hogeland|2017|p=88-9}} where La Balme had planned to arrest [[Charles Beaubien]], the British agent.  Beaubien and many of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]] were not there, however, so the force raised the French flag{{sfnp|Barnhill|2006}} and raided British stores for two weeks{{sfnp|Hogeland|2017|p=88-9}} while awaiting reinforcements that never arrived.  Upon learning of the return of a Miami hunting party to Kekionga, Le Balme departed to raid another trading post on the [[Eel River (Wabash River)|Eel River]]. Leaving some twenty men to guard the captured stores at Kekionga, his force marched out over the Eel River trail (the same trail [[Hardin's Defeat|Colonel John Hardin]] would follow ten years later).\n\nThe Miami Indians, learning of the intrusion, destroyed the small group of men left at Kekionga. Chief [[Little Turtle]], who lived in a village along the Eel River, received permission from the Kekionga Miami to lead an attack.{{sfnp|Hogeland|2017|p=88-9}}  He gathered available warriors and attacked La Balme in camp at dawn on 5 November, before he reached the Eel River trading post{{sfnp|Gaff|2004|p=84-85}} and just 3 miles from Little Turtle's village.{{sfnp|Hogeland|2017|p=88-9}}  La Balme and his men fortified themselves on the banks of the river but were only able to fire one volley before being overwhelmed.{{sfnp|Hogeland|2017|p=88-9}} There remains some confusion as to the length of the battle; accounts of the siege vary from several days to several weeks.  Only a few survivors managed to escape.  Augustin de la Balme died in the battle, which became known as '''La Balme's Defeat'''.\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:Labalme 2010c.jpg|thumb]]\n* For his leadership in this battle, Little Turtle gained a reputation that initiated a successful career as a military commander in the [[Northwest Indian War]].{{sfnp|Hogeland|2017|p=88-9}}  11 years later, almost to the day, he led an attack that remains one of the [[St. Clair's defeat|worst defeats in U.S. Army history]].\n* Although LaBalme's expedition resulted in failure, it did cause the British considerable concern.

(Detroit was again surrendered to the British in the [[War of 1812]], but was returned at the conclusion of the war.)

Out of grief and anger she then drowned herself. She was refused entry to heaven until she found the souls of her two sons.

Other regional variations of the story exist.\n\nAccording to the legend, in a rural village in [[Mexico]], there lived a beautiful young woman named Mar\u00eda. She came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty and grace. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman was riding through her village and stopped in his tracks. He had traveled all over the world and has never seen anyone as beautiful as Mar\u00eda. He was mesmerized by her. He knew that he had to win her heart. '''Mar\u00eda was easily charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Eventually, the two [[married]], and Mar\u00eda gave birth to two sons. Her husband was always traveling and he stopped spending time with his family.''' When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and as time passed Mar\u00eda could tell that her husband was falling out of love with her because she was getting old. One day he returned to the village with a younger woman, and bid his children farewell, ignoring Mar\u00eda.<ref name=\"literacynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|title=LA LLORONA - A HISPANIC LEGEND|website=www.literacynet.org|access-date=2016-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119025116/http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|archive-date=2016-11-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMar\u00eda, angry and hurt, took her children to a river and drowned them in a blind rage.

Aztec pride drove {{lang|es|La Malinche}} to acts of vengeance. In this context, the tale compares the Spanish discovery of the [[New World]] and the demise of indigenous culture after the conquest with {{lang|es|La Llorona}}'s loss. Before the Spaniards arrival to Tenochtitlan, there were seven ugly omens, the sixth of those was a woman screaming during the nights crying : \"Where will I take you?,oh my children!

As Bacil Kirtley (1960) wrote in Western Folklore, \"During the same decade that {{lang|es|La Llorona}} was first mentioned in Mexico, a story, seemingly already quite old, of '{{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}}' ('The White Lady')\u2014which reproduces many of the features consistently recurring in the more developed versions of '{{lang|es|La Llorona}}', was recorded in Germany\"; references to {{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}} date back as early as 1486. The story of the White Lady follows a virtually identical plot to the classical {{lang|es|La Llorona}} story.}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest published reference to {{lang|es|La Llorona}} occurred in a sonnet written by Mexican poet [[Manuel Carpio]] in the late 1800s.

[[Sarah Shahi]] portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character [[Sam Winchester]] destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.\n\nLa Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film ''[[La Leyenda de la Llorona]]''. Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.\n\nIn 1995, Mexican playwright [[Josefina L\u00f3pez]] wrote \"Unconquered Spirits\", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the \"La Malinche\" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar. She gives birth to twin boys as a result, and drowns them in the river out of protection rather than spite. Act Two takes place in 1938 amidst the San Antonio Pecan Sheller's Strike. A widowed mother who works at the Pecan factory has an abortion after being raped by her white supervisor, resulting in a visit from La Llorona to give her the strength to fight back against her attacker. The play is well noted for its sympathetic portrayal of La Llorona as a victim of oppression.\n\nIn [[Nancy Farmer]]'s 2002 science fiction novel, ''[[The House of the Scorpion]]'', and its 2013 sequel book, ''[[The Lord of Opium]]'', the main character, Matt, makes several references to La Llorona, often when retelling the story to other main characters or during self-reflection.\n\nThe 2006 Mexican horror film ''[[Kilometer 31]]'' is inspired by the legend of La Llorona, and the main evil entity in the film is based on her and her story.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nLa Llorona has also been the theme character of several of [[Universal Studios]]'s haunted houses during their annual Halloween event, [[Halloween Horror Nights]] (Both Hollywood and Orlando locations).<ref>{{cite web|title=La Llorona comes to \"Halloween Horror Nights\"|url=http://www.latimes.com/visuals/video/65277378-132.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, [[James Wan]], [[Gary Dauberman]] and Emilie Gladstone produced a film titled ''[[The Curse of La Llorona]]''.

She went to hell and came back alive from coming up the same river she and her sons died in. She hunts for her ex-husband as well as children.\n\nAngel she knew one of your ancestors\nThe legend described in this article is the Mexican version of this folktale. Other regional variations of the story exist.\n\nAccording to the legend, in a rural village in [[Mexico]], there lived a beautiful young woman named Mar\u00eda. She came from a poor family but was known around her village for her beauty and grace. One day, an extremely wealthy nobleman was riding through her village and stopped in his tracks. He had traveled all over the world and has never seen anyone as beautiful as Mar\u00eda. He was mesmerized by her. He knew that he had to win her heart. '''Mar\u00eda was easily charmed by him and he was charmed by her beauty, so when he proposed to her, she immediately accepted. Eventually, the two [[married]], and Mar\u00eda gave birth to two sons. Her husband was always traveling and he stopped spending time with his family.''' When he came home, he only paid attention to the children and as time passed Mar\u00eda could tell that her husband was falling out of love with her because she was getting old. One day he returned to the village with a younger woman, and bid his children farewell, ignoring Mar\u00eda.<ref name=\"literacynet1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|title=LA LLORONA - A HISPANIC LEGEND|website=www.literacynet.org|access-date=2016-12-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119025116/http://www.literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/llorona.html|archive-date=2016-11-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMar\u00eda, angry and hurt, took her children to a river and drowned them in a blind rage.

In one folk story of {{lang|es|La Malinche}}, she became Cort\u00e9s's mistress and bore him a child, only to be abandoned so that he could marry a Spanish lady (although no evidence exists that {{lang|es|La Malinche}} killed her children). Aztec pride drove {{lang|es|La Malinche}} to acts of vengeance. In this context, the tale compares the Spanish discovery of the [[New World]] and the demise of indigenous culture after the conquest with {{lang|es|La Llorona}}'s loss. Before the Spaniards arrival to Tenochtitlan, there were seven ugly omens, the sixth of those was a woman screaming during the nights crying : \"Where will I take you?,oh my children! [Miguel Le\u00f3n Portilla- Visi\u00f3n de los Vencidos, p. 21].\n\nStories of weeping female phantoms are common in the folklore of both [[Europe]]an and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] cultures.

As Bacil Kirtley (1960) wrote in Western Folklore, \"During the same decade that {{lang|es|La Llorona}} was first mentioned in Mexico, a story, seemingly already quite old, of '{{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}}' ('The White Lady')\u2014which reproduces many of the features consistently recurring in the more developed versions of '{{lang|es|La Llorona}}', was recorded in Germany\"; references to {{lang|de|Die Weisse Frau}} date back as early as 1486. The story of the White Lady follows a virtually identical plot to the classical {{lang|es|La Llorona}} story.}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest published reference to {{lang|es|La Llorona}} occurred in a sonnet written by Mexican poet [[Manuel Carpio]] in the late 1800s.

[[Sarah Shahi]] portrayed Constance Welch, The Woman in White who, after discovering her husband's infidelity took the lives of her two children by drowning them in a bathtub at home and soon after, took her own by jumping off a bridge into a river. Her ghost was known to haunt the Centennial Highway, hitchhiking unknowing motorists, mostly men, and killing those whom she deemed unfaithful. Main character [[Sam Winchester]] destroyed her ghost by crashing his car into the house where she used to live. Finally facing the ghosts of her children, The Woman in White was destroyed by her own guilt from killing them.\n\nLa Llorona appears as the main antagonist of the Mexican animated film ''[[La Leyenda de la Llorona]]''. Here, La Llorona is portrayed as a more sympathetic character, with her children's deaths coming as an accident rather than at her own hands.\n\nIn 1995, Mexican playwright [[Josefina L\u00f3pez]] wrote \"Unconquered Spirits\", which uses the myth of La Llorona as a plot device. The play has two time periods, with Act One taking place in 16th Century Mexico after Spain occupied it. Here, Lopez takes inspiration from the \"La Malinche\" variation, with the heroine represented as a young Aztec girl who is brutally raped by a Spanish Friar. She gives birth to twin boys as a result, and drowns them in the river out of protection rather than spite. Act Two takes place in 1938 amidst the San Antonio Pecan Sheller's Strike. A widowed mother who works at the Pecan factory has an abortion after being raped by her white supervisor, resulting in a visit from La Llorona to give her the strength to fight back against her attacker. The play is well noted for its sympathetic portrayal of La Llorona as a victim of oppression.\n\nIn [[Nancy Farmer]]'s 2002 science fiction novel, ''[[The House of the Scorpion]]'', and its 2013 sequel book, ''[[The Lord of Opium]]'', the main character, Matt, makes several references to La Llorona, often when retelling the story to other main characters or during self-reflection.\n\nThe 2006 Mexican horror film ''[[Kilometer 31]]'' is inspired by the legend of La Llorona, and the main evil entity in the film is based on her and her story.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nLa Llorona has also been the theme character of several of [[Universal Studios]]'s haunted houses during their annual Halloween event, [[Halloween Horror Nights]] (Both Hollywood and Orlando locations).<ref>{{cite web|title=La Llorona comes to \"Halloween Horror Nights\"|url=http://www.latimes.com/visuals/video/65277378-132.html|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=12 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, [[James Wan]], [[Gary Dauberman]] and Emilie Gladstone produced a film titled ''[[The Curse of La Llorona]]''.

He was one of the early members of the [[Fabian Society]] in 1884, who like [[George Bernard Shaw]] joined three months after its inception. Along with his wife [[Beatrice Webb]], [[Annie Besant]], [[Graham Wallas]], [[Edward R. Pease]], [[Hubert Bland]], and [[Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier|Sydney Olivier]], Shaw and Webb turned the Fabian Society into the pre-eminent political-intellectual society in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] England. He wrote the original, pro-nationalisation [[Clause IV]] for the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n==Background and education==\nWebb was born in London to a professional family. He studied law at the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution]] for a degree of the [[University of London]] in his spare time, while holding down an office job. He also studied at [[King's College London]], prior to being [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in 1885.\n\n==Professional life==\nIn 1895, he helped to establish the London School of Economics, using a bequest left to the Fabian Society. He was appointed Professor of Public Administration in 1912, a post he held for fifteen years. In 1892, Webb married [[Beatrice Potter]], who shared his interests and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sidney-and-Beatrice-Webb|title=Sidney and Beatrice Webb {{!}} British economists|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en}}</ref> The money she brought with her enabled him to give up his clerical job and concentrate on his other activities.

Sidney became Member of Parliament for [[Seaham (UK Parliament constituency)|Seaham]] at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]].<ref>The History of the Fabian Society, Edward R. Pease, Frank Cass and Co. LTD, 1963</ref> The couple's influence can be seen in their hosting of the [[The Coefficients|Coefficients]], a dining club which attracted some of the leading statesmen and thinkers of the day. In 1929, he was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Passfield''', of Passfield Corner in the County of Southampton.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33509 |date=25 June 1929 |page=4189 }}</ref> He served as both [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] and [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Labour Government 1929\u20131931|second Labour Government]] in 1929. As Colonial Secretary he issued the [[Passfield White Paper]] revising the government's policy in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], previously set by the [[Churchill White Paper]] of 1922. In 1930, failing health caused him to step down as Dominions Secretary, but he stayed on as Colonial Secretary till the fall of the Labour government in August 1931.\n\nIgnoring mounting evidence of the atrocities committed by [[Joseph Stalin]], the Webbs were supporters of the [[Soviet Union]] until their deaths. Having reached their seventies and early eighties, their books ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation?'' (1935) and ''The Truth About Soviet Russia'' (1942) give a very positive assessment of Joseph Stalin's regime. [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] historian [[Al Richardson (historian)|Al Richardson]] later described ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?'' as \"pure Soviet propaganda at its most mendacious\".<ref>Al Richardson, \"Introduction\" to [[C.

G. Wells]]' ''[[The New Machiavelli]]'' (1911), the Webbs, as \"the Baileys\", are mercilessly lampooned as short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators. The Fabian Society, of which Wells was briefly a member (1903\u201308), fares no better in his estimation.\n\nIn her [http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/collections/webb#diary/ diary], Beatrice Webb records that they have \"read the caricatures of ourselves \u2026 with much interest and amusement.

Lord Passfield's ashes were also buried there in 1947.

He was one of the early members of the [[Fabian Society]] in 1884, who like [[George Bernard Shaw]] joined three months after its inception. Along with his wife [[Beatrice Webb]], [[Annie Besant]], [[Graham Wallas]], [[Edward R. Pease]], [[Hubert Bland]], and [[Sydney Olivier, 1st Baron Olivier|Sydney Olivier]], Shaw and Webb turned the Fabian Society into the pre-eminent political-intellectual society in [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] England. He wrote the original, pro-nationalisation [[Clause IV]] for the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].\n\n==Background and education==\nWebb was born in London to a professional family. He studied law at the [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution]] for a degree of the [[University of London]] in his spare time, while holding down an office job. He also studied at [[King's College London]], prior to being [[Call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in 1885.\n\n==Professional life==\nIn 1895, he helped to establish the London School of Economics, using a bequest left to the Fabian Society. He was appointed Professor of Public Administration in 1912, a post he held for fifteen years. In 1892, Webb married [[Beatrice Potter]], who shared his interests and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sidney-and-Beatrice-Webb|title=Sidney and Beatrice Webb {{!}} British economists|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en}}</ref> The money she brought with her enabled him to give up his clerical job and concentrate on his other activities.

Pease, Frank Cass and Co. LTD, 1963</ref> The couple's influence can be seen in their hosting of the [[The Coefficients|Coefficients]], a dining club which attracted some of the leading statesmen and thinkers of the day. In 1929, he was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Passfield''', of Passfield Corner in the County of Southampton.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=33509 |date=25 June 1929 |page=4189 }}</ref> He served as both [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] and [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Labour Government 1929\u20131931|second Labour Government]] in 1929. As Colonial Secretary he issued the [[Passfield White Paper]] revising the government's policy in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], previously set by the [[Churchill White Paper]] of 1922. In 1930, failing health caused him to step down as Dominions Secretary, but he stayed on as Colonial Secretary till the fall of the Labour government in August 1931.\n\nIgnoring mounting evidence of the atrocities committed by [[Joseph Stalin]], the Webbs were supporters of the [[Soviet Union]] until their deaths. Having reached their seventies and early eighties, their books ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilisation?'' (1935) and ''The Truth About Soviet Russia'' (1942) give a very positive assessment of Joseph Stalin's regime. [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] historian [[Al Richardson (historian)|Al Richardson]] later described ''Soviet Communism: A New Civilization?'' as \"pure Soviet propaganda at its most mendacious\".<ref>Al Richardson, \"Introduction\" to [[C.

The Fabian Society, of which Wells was briefly a member (1903\u201308), fares no better in his estimation.\n\nIn her [http://digital.library.lse.ac.uk/collections/webb#diary/ diary], Beatrice Webb records that they have \"read the caricatures of ourselves \u2026 with much interest and amusement.

Draughts developed from [[alquerque]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Draughts.htm |title = Draughts, Checkers - Online Guide |first=James |last=Masters |website=www.tradgames.org.uk }}</ref> The name derives from the verb to draw or to move.<ref name=strutt/>\n\nThe most popular forms are [[English draughts]], also called '''American checkers''', played on an 8\u00d78 [[checkerboard]]; [[Russian draughts]], also played on an 8\u00d78, and [[international draughts]], played on a 10\u00d710 board. There are many other variants played on 8\u00d78 boards. [[Canadian checkers]] and Singaporean/Malaysian checkers (also locally known as ''dum'') are played on a 12\u00d712 board.\n\nEnglish draughts was [[Solved game|weakly solved]] in 2007 by the team of Canadian computer scientist [[Jonathan Schaeffer]]. From the standard starting position, both players can guarantee a draw with [[perfect play]].\n\n==General rules {{anchor|Rules}}==\nDraughts is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard. One player has the dark pieces; the other has the light pieces. Players alternate turns. A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.\n\nOnly the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may move only diagonally into an unoccupied square. When presented, capturing is mandatory in most official rules, although some rule variations make capturing optional.<ref>As is standard in modern Variants; see more at [http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Draughts.htm The Online Guide to Traditional Games]</ref> In almost all variants, the player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.\n\n===Men===\nUncrowned pieces (''men'') move one step diagonally forwards, and capture an opponent's piece by moving two consecutive steps in the same line, jumping over the piece on the first step. Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece; the jumps do not need to be in the same line and may \"zigzag\" (change diagonal direction). In [[English draughts]] men can jump only forwards; in [[international draughts]] and [[Russian draughts]] men can jump both forwards and backwards.\n\n===Kings {{anchor|King|king}}===\n[[File:Probl\u00e8me Jeu de dames SR.gif|right|thumb|A game in international draughts, featuring a flying king]]\n\nWhen a man reaches the ''kings row'' (also called ''crownhead'', the farthest row forward), it becomes a ''king'', and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the first man (''crowned''), and acquires additional powers including the ability to move backwards and (in variants where they cannot already do so) capture backwards. Like men, a king can make successive jumps in a single turn provided that each jump captures an enemy man or king.\n\nIn international draughts, kings (also called ''flying kings'') move any distance along unblocked diagonals, and may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it. Because jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete, it is possible to reach a position in a multi-jump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped.\n\nFlying kings are not used in English draughts; a king's only advantage over a man is the ability to move and capture backwards as well as forwards.\n\n==Naming==\nIn most non-English languages (except those that acquired the game from English speakers), draughts is called ''dame'', ''dames'', ''damas'', or a similar term that refers to ladies. The pieces are usually called ''men'', ''stones'', \"pe\u00f3n\" (pawn) or a similar term; men promoted to kings are called ''dames'' or ladies. In these languages, the [[queen (chess)|queen]] in [[chess]] or in card games is usually called by the same term as the kings in draughts. A case in point includes the Greek terminology, in which draughts is called \"\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\" (dama), which is also one term for the queen in chess.\n\n==National and regional variants==\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:International draughts.jpg|Starting position in [[international draughts]] which is played on a 10\u00d710 board\nFile:Draughts.svg|Starting position in [[Russian draughts|Russian]], [[Brazilian draughts|Brazilian]], [[Czech draughts|Czech]] draughts and [[Pool checkers]]\nFile:Canadian Checkers gameboard and init config.PNG|Starting position in [[Canadian draughts]]\nFile:TurkishDraughts (trad).png|Board and starting position in [[Turkish draughts]]\nFile:Damiera.JPG|Starting position in [[Italian draughts|Italian]] and Portuguese draughts\nFile:Column draughts game.gif|A Russian column draughts game\n</gallery>\n\n===Russian Column draughts===\nColumn draughts (Russian towers) is a kind of draughts, known in Russia since the beginning of the nineteenth century, in which the game is played according to the usual rules of draughts, but with the difference that the beaten draught is not removed from the playing field, and is captured under the beating figure (draught or tower).\n\nThe resulting towers move around the board as a whole, \"obeying\" the upper draught. When taking the tower, only the upper draught is removed from it. If on the top there is a draught of other color than removed as a result of fight, the tower becomes a tower of the rival. Rules of moves of draughts and kings correspond to the rules of Russian draughts.\n* Russian Wikipedia article on [[:ru:\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0448\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438|Russian Column draughts]]\n\n===Flying kings; men can capture backwards===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ <big>''International draughts / American Pool checkers family''</big>\n!National variant\n!Board size \n!Pieces per side\n!Double-corner or light square on player's near-right?\n!First move\n!Capture constraints\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[International draughts]] (or Polish draughts)\n|align=\"center\"|10\u00d710\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|align=\"center\"|Yes\n|align=\"center\"|White\n|A sequence must capture the maximum possible number of pieces.\n|Pieces promote only when ending their move on the final rank, not when passing through it.

The winners in men's have been from the United Kingdom, United States, [[Barbados]], and most recently Italy (3-Move division). The women's championship in English draughts started in 1993. The women's winners have been from Ireland, [[Turkmenistan]], and Ukraine.\n\nThe World Championship in international draughts began in 1885 in France, and since 1948 has been organized by the [[World Draughts Federation]] (FMJD, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale du Jeu de Dames). It occurs every two years. In even years following the tournament, the World Title match takes place. The men's championship has had winners from the Netherlands, Canada, the Soviet Union, [[Senegal]], [[Latvia]], and Russia. The first Women's World Championship was held in 1973. The World Junior Championship has been played since 1971. European Championships have been held since 1965 (men's) and 2000 (women's).\n\nOther official World Championships began as follows: [[Brazilian draughts]], in 1985; [[Russian draughts]], in 1993; [[Turkish draughts]], in 2014.\n\n==Invented variants==\n* [[Blue and Gray (board game)|Blue and Gray]]: On a 9\u00d79 board, each side has 17 guard pieces that move and jump in any direction, to escort a captain piece which races to the center of the board to win.\n* [[Cheskers]]: A variant invented by [[Solomon Golomb]].  Each player begins with a [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] and a [[camel (chess)|camel]] (which jumps with coordinates (3,1) rather than (2,1) so as to stay on the black squares), and men reaching the back rank promote to a bishop, camel, or king.\n* [[Damath]]: A variant utilizing math principles and numbered chips popular in the [[Philippines]].\n* [[Dameo]]: A variant played on an 8\u00d78 board, move and capture rules are similar to those of [[Armenian draughts]]. A special \"sliding\" move is used for moving a line of checkers similar to the movement rule in [[Epaminondas (game)|Epaminondas]]. By [[Christian Freeling]] (2000). \n* [[Hexdame]]: A literal adaptation of [[international draughts]] to a hexagonal gameboard. By Christian Freeling (1979).\n* [[Lasca]]: A checkers variant on a 7\u00d77 board, with 25 fields used. Jumped pieces are placed under the jumper, so that towers are built. Only the top piece of a jumped tower is captured. This variant was invented by [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]] [[Emanuel Lasker]].\n* [[Philosophy shogi checkers]]: A variant on a 9\u00d79 board, game ending with capturing opponent's king. Invented by [[Inoue Enry\u014d]] and described in Japanese book in 1890.\n* [[Suicide checkers]] (also called ''Anti-Checkers'', ''Giveaway Checkers'' or ''Losing Draughts''): A variant where the objective of each player is to lose all of their pieces.\n* [[Ultra checkers|Tiers]]: A complex variant which allows players to upgrade their pieces beyond kings.\n* [[Vladimir Vigman|Vigman's]] draughts: Each player has 24 pieces (two full sets) \u2013 one on the light squares, a second set on dark squares. Each player plays two games simultaneously: one on light squares, the other on dark squares.

One player has the dark pieces; the other has the light pieces. Players alternate turns. A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.\n\nOnly the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may move only diagonally into an unoccupied square. When presented, capturing is mandatory in most official rules, although some rule variations make capturing optional.<ref>As is standard in modern Variants; see more at [http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Draughts.htm The Online Guide to Traditional Games]</ref> In almost all variants, the player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.\n\n===Men===\nUncrowned pieces (''men'') move one step diagonally forwards, and capture an opponent's piece by moving two consecutive steps in the same line, jumping over the piece on the first step. Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece; the jumps do not need to be in the same line and may \"zigzag\" (change diagonal direction). In [[English draughts]] men can jump only forwards; in [[international draughts]] and [[Russian draughts]] men can jump both forwards and backwards.\n\n===Kings {{anchor|King|king}}===\n[[File:Probl\u00e8me Jeu de dames SR.gif|right|thumb|A game in international draughts, featuring a flying king]]\n\nWhen a man reaches the ''kings row'' (also called ''crownhead'', the farthest row forward), it becomes a ''king'', and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the first man (crowning), and acquires additional powers including the ability to move backwards and (in variants where they cannot already do so) capture backwards. Like men, a king can make successive jumps in a single turn provided that each jump captures an enemy man or king.\n\nIn international draughts, kings (also called ''flying kings'') move any distance along unblocked diagonals, and may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it. Because jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete, it is possible to reach a position in a multi-jump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped.\n\nFlying kings are not used in English draughts; a king's only advantage over a man is the ability to move and capture backwards as well as forwards.\n\n==Naming==\nIn most non-English languages (except those that acquired the game from English speakers), draughts is called ''dame'', ''dames'', ''damas'', or a similar term that refers to ladies. The pieces are usually called ''men'', ''stones'', \"pe\u00f3n\" (pawn) or a similar term; men promoted to kings are called ''dames'' or ladies. In these languages, the [[queen (chess)|queen]] in [[chess]] or in card games is usually called by the same term as the kings in draughts. A case in point includes the Greek terminology, in which draughts is called \"\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\" (dama), which is also one term for the queen in chess.\n\n==National and regional variants==\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:International draughts.jpg|Starting position in [[international draughts]] which is played on a 10\u00d710 board\nFile:Draughts.svg|Starting position in [[Russian draughts|Russian]], [[Brazilian draughts|Brazilian]], [[Czech draughts|Czech]] draughts and [[Pool checkers]]\nFile:Canadian Checkers gameboard and init config.PNG|Starting position in [[Canadian draughts]]\nFile:TurkishDraughts (trad).png|Board and starting position in [[Turkish draughts]]\nFile:Damiera.JPG|Starting position in [[Italian draughts|Italian]] and Portuguese draughts\nFile:Column draughts game.gif|A Russian column draughts game\n</gallery>\n\n===Russian Column draughts===\nColumn draughts (Russian towers) is a kind of draughts, known in Russia since the beginning of the nineteenth century, in which the game is played according to the usual rules of draughts, but with the difference that the beaten draught is not removed from the playing field, and is captured under the beating figure (draught or tower).\n\nThe resulting towers move around the board as a whole, \"obeying\" the upper draught. When taking the tower, only the upper draught is removed from it. If on the top there is a draught of other color than removed as a result of fight, the tower becomes a tower of the rival. Rules of moves of draughts and kings correspond to the rules of Russian draughts.\n* Russian Wikipedia article on [[:ru:\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0448\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438|Russian Column draughts]]\n\n===Flying kings; men can capture backwards===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ <big>''International draughts / American Pool checkers family''</big>\n!National variant\n!Board size \n!Pieces per side\n!Double-corner or light square on player's near-right?\n!First move\n!Capture constraints\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[International draughts]] (or Polish draughts)\n|align=\"center\"|10\u00d710\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|align=\"center\"|Yes\n|align=\"center\"|White\n|A sequence must capture the maximum possible number of pieces.\n|Pieces promote only when ending their move on the final rank, not when passing through it.

The men's championship has had winners from the Netherlands, Canada, the Soviet Union, [[Senegal]], [[Latvia]], and Russia. The first Women's World Championship was held in 1973. The World Junior Championship has been played since 1971.

He ended his academic career in 1921 and embarked full-time on political work.\n\n==Liberalism and politics==\nWhile at Manchester, Muir had become active in the Manchester Liberal Federation and this sparked his interest in [[Industrial democracy|industrial]], economic and [[social reform]]. He published the book ''Liberalism and Industry'' in 1920 and in 1921 he was one of the founders of the Liberal Summer Schools,<ref>Anne Moore, entry on Liberal Summer Schools in Brack and Randall (eds) ''The Dictionary of Liberal Thought''.</ref> an annual, week-long, residential school to promote interest in the party and to develop innovative policies. The schools were held in alternate years at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] until 1939. The schools produced the famous Liberal \u2018coloured books\u2019 on industrial and social questions and was a source of ideas for progressives in politics. Muir was also a prominent Liberal writer contributing frequently to [[The Nation and Atheneum|''The Nation'']] and the ''Weekly Westminster''. During the 1930s, he edited the ''Westminster Newsletter'', a weekly commentary on Liberal Party affairs.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=35142|title=Muir, (John) Ramsay Bryce|first = D.

He was a driving spirit behind the party reorganisation of 1936, and briefly (in 1936) acted as vice-president of the new Liberal Party Organization (LPO). From 1936 until his death he chaired the education and propaganda committee of the LPO. He was a key contributor to the Liberal policy review of 1934 and principal author of its report \u2018The Liberal Way\u2019.  Although Muir was associated closely with the progressive ideas coming out of the Liberal Summer Schools, the radical solutions for unemployment, industrial and social reform which were inspired by [[Maynard Keynes]], [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and [[William Beveridge]], he was also something of a classical Liberal too. He was particularly constant over [[Free Trade]], which he always supported, and took a paternal view of Imperial and Colonial questions,<ref>Richard Grayson, ''Liberals, International Relations and Appeasement'', p42.</ref> in which Britain's duties to its colonies took centre stage with an emphasis on trusteeship.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Muir was a volunteer writer and lecturer for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].

He published the book ''Liberalism and Industry'' in 1920 and in 1921 he was one of the founders of the Liberal Summer Schools,<ref>Anne Moore, entry on Liberal Summer Schools in Brack and Randall (eds) ''The Dictionary of Liberal Thought''.</ref> an annual, week-long, residential school to promote interest in the party and to develop innovative policies. The schools were held in alternate years at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] until 1939. The schools produced the famous Liberal \u2018coloured books\u2019 on industrial and social questions and was a source of ideas for progressives in politics. Muir was also a prominent Liberal writer contributing frequently to [[The Nation and Atheneum|''The Nation'']] and the ''Weekly Westminster''. During the 1930s, he edited the ''Westminster Newsletter'', a weekly commentary on Liberal Party affairs.<ref>{{Cite ODNB|id=35142|title=Muir, (John) Ramsay Bryce|first = D. M.| last = Cregier}}</ref>\n\nMuir stood for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] eight times in all in the Liberal interest between 1922 and 1935.<ref>F. W. S. Craig: ''British parliamentary election results 1918-1949''</ref> He was elected at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] as [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]] in [[Lancashire]], having been unsuccessful in that constituency at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] However he was defeated at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]]. He stood for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] again at five further elections, without success:\n* 1926: [[by-election]] for the [[Combined English Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined English Universities]]\n* [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]]: [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]]\n* 1931: [[by-election]] in [[Scarborough and Whitby (UK Parliament constituency)|Scarborough & Whitby]]\n* [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]]: [[Louth, Lincolnshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Louth]]\n*[[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]]: Scarborough and Whitby\n \nMuir was also a leading figure in the [[National Liberal Federation]] (NLF), being its chairman from 1931\u201333 and president from 1933-3.  He was a driving spirit behind the party reorganisation of 1936, and briefly (in 1936) acted as vice-president of the new Liberal Party Organization (LPO). From 1936 until his death he chaired the education and propaganda committee of the LPO. He was a key contributor to the Liberal policy review of 1934 and principal author of its report \u2018The Liberal Way\u2019.  Although Muir was associated closely with the progressive ideas coming out of the Liberal Summer Schools, the radical solutions for unemployment, industrial and social reform which were inspired by [[Maynard Keynes]], [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] and [[William Beveridge]], he was also something of a classical Liberal too. He was particularly constant over [[Free Trade]], which he always supported, and took a paternal view of Imperial and Colonial questions,<ref>Richard Grayson, ''Liberals, International Relations and Appeasement'', p42.</ref> in which Britain\u2019s duties to its colonies took centre stage with an emphasis on trusteeship.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Muir was a volunteer writer and lecturer for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]]. He never married or had children and died at his home in [[Pinner]], [[Middlesex]], on 4 May 1941 aged 68.\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''History of Municipal Government in Liverpool'' (joint with others), 1906\n*''History of Liverpool'', 1907\n*''Peers and Bureaucrats'', 1910\n*''Atlas of Modern History'', 1911\n*''Philips' new historical atlas for students'' (joint with others), 1911\n*''Britain's Case Against Germany'', 1915\n*''Making of British India'', 1915\n*''Nationalism and Internationalism'', 1916\n*''The Expansion of Europe'', 1917\n*''The Character of the British Empire'', 1917\n*''National Self-Government'', 1918\n*''Liberalism and Industry: Towards a Better Social Order'', 1920\n*''History of the British Commonwealth, Volume I'', 1920\n*''History of the British Commonwealth, Volume II'', 1922\n*''Politics and Progress: A Survey of the Problems of Today'', 1923\n*''America the Golden'', 1927\n*''British History'', 1928\n*''Robinson the Great'', 1929\n*''How Britain is Governed'', 1930\n*''Protection versus Free Imports'', 1930\n*''The Political Consequences of the Great War'', 1931\n*''The Interdependent World and its Problems'', 1932\n*''The Faith of a Liberal'', 1933\n*''A Brief History of Our Own Times'', 1934\n*''The Record of the National Government'', 1936\n*Future for Democracy, 1939\n*''Civilisation and Liberty'', 1940\n*''Ramsay Muir: An Autobiography and Some Essays'' (edited by Stuart Hodgson), 1944\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Liberal Party (UK) MPs]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n*[[F.

By the late 19th century, the first black person had been elected to office.\n\nThe [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migrations]] from 1910 to 1960 brought hundreds of thousands of blacks from the [[Southern United States|South]] to [[Chicago]], where they became an urban population.  They created churches, community organizations, important businesses,  music, and literature.  African Americans of all classes built a community on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of Chicago for decades before the [[Civil Rights Movement]], as well as on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago.  Residing in segregated communities, almost regardless of income, the Black residents of Chicago aimed to create communities where they could survive, sustain themselves, and have the ability to determine for themselves their own course in [[Chicago history]].\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings===\n{{further|Slavery in Illinois}}\nAlthough du Sable's settlement was established in the 1780s, African Americans would only become established as a community in the 1840s, with the population reaching 1,000 by 1860. Much of this population consisted of escaped slaves from the Upper South. Following the end of Reconstruction in 1877, African Americans flowed from the Deep South into Chicago, raising the population from approximately 4,000 in 1870 to 15,000 in 1890.\n\nIn 1853, [[John A. Logan]] helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state. However, in 1865, the state repealed its \"[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Laws]]\" and became the first to ratify the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]].\n\nEspecially after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Illinois had some of the most progressive anti-discrimination legislation in the nation.<ref name=\"jimcrow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/scripts/jimcrow/lawsoutside.cgi?state=Illinois |title=Jim Crow Laws: Illinois |accessdate=May 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020322/http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/scripts/jimcrow/lawsoutside.cgi?state=Illinois |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> School segregation was first outlawed in 1874, and segregation in public accommodations was first outlawed in 1885.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> In 1870, Illinois extended voting rights to African-American men for the first time, and in 1871, [[John Jones (Illinois politician)|John Jones]], a tailor and [[Underground Railroad]] station manager who successfully lobbied for the repeal of the state's Black Laws, became the first African-American elected official in the state, serving as a member of the [[Cook County Board of Commissioners|Cook County Commission]]. By 1879, [[John W. E. Thomas]] of Chicago became the first African American elected to the [[Illinois General Assembly]], beginning the longest uninterrupted run of African-American representation in any state legislature in U.S. history. After the [[Great Chicago Fire]], Chicago mayor [[Joseph Medill]] appointed the city's first black fire company of nine men and the first black police officer.\n\n===Great Migration===\n{{Main|Great Migration (African American)}}\n[[File:Chicagoracialhistory.png|thumb|300px|The black population in Chicago significantly increased in the early to mid-1900s, due to the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South. While African Americans made up less than two percent of the city's population in 1910, by 1960 the city was nearly 25 percent black.]]\n\nAt the turn of the century, southern states succeeded in passing new constitutions and laws that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks and many poor whites.  Deprived of the right to vote, they could not sit on juries or run for office. They were subject to discriminatory laws passed by white legislators, including racial segregation of public facilities. Segregated education for black children and other services were consistently underfunded in a poor, agricultural economy. As white-dominated legislatures passed Jim Crow laws to re-establish white supremacy and create more restrictions in public life, violence against blacks increased, with [[lynchings]] used as extrajudicial enforcement. In addition, the [[boll weevil]] infestation ruined much of the cotton industry in the early 20th century. Voting with their feet, blacks started migrating out of the South to the North, where they could live more freely, get their children educated, and get new jobs.\n\nIndustry buildup for World War I pulled thousands of workers to the North, as did the rapid expansion of [[railroads]], and the [[meatpacking]] and [[steel]] industries. Between 1915 and 1960, hundreds of thousands of black southerners migrated to Chicago to escape violence and segregation, and to seek [[economic freedom]]. They went from being a mostly rural population to one that was mostly urban. \"The migration of African Americans from the rural south to the urban north became a mass movement.\"<ref name=\"spear\">Allen H. Spear, ''Black Chicago: The Making of a Negro Ghetto (1890\u20131920)''.</ref> The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] radically transformed Chicago, both politically and culturally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/print-narrative.cfm?destID=6&catID=0006020044|title=Frommer's|website=Frommers.com|accessdate= September 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1910 to 1940, most African Americans who migrated north were from rural areas. They had been chiefly sharecroppers and laborers, although some were landowners pushed out by the boll weevil disaster. After years of underfunding of public education for blacks in the South, they tended to be poorly educated, with relatively low skills to apply to urban jobs.  Like the European rural immigrants, they had to rapidly adapt to a different urban culture.  Many took advantage of better schooling in Chicago and their children learned quickly.  After 1940, when the second larger wave of migration started, black migrants tended to be already urbanized, from southern cities and towns.  They were the most ambitious, better educated with more urban skills to apply in their new homes.\n\nThe masses of new migrants arriving in the cities captured public attention.  At one point in the 1940s, 3,000 African Americans were arriving every week in Chicago\u2014stepping off the trains from the South and making their ways to neighborhoods they had learned about from friends and the ''[[Chicago Defender]]''.<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''The Great Migration''.</ref>  The Great Migration was charted and evaluated. Urban white northerners started to get worried, as their neighborhoods rapidly changed. At the same time, recent and older ethnic immigrants competed for jobs and housing with the new arrivals, especially on the South Side, where the steel and meatpacking industries had the most numerous working-class jobs.\n\nEthnic Irish were heavily implicated in the gang violence and the rioting that erupted in 1919. They had been the most established ethnic group and defended their power and territory in the South Side against newcomers: both other ethnic whites and southern blacks. \"Chicago was a focal point of the great migration and the racial violence that came in its wake.\"<ref name=\"spear\"/>  With Chicago's industries steadily expanding, opportunities opened up for new migrants, including Southerners, to find work. The railroad and meatpacking industries recruited black workers. Chicago's African-American newspaper, the ''Chicago Defender'', made the city well known to southerners.  It sent bundles of papers south on the [[Illinois Central]] trains, and African-American [[Pullman Porters]] would drop them off in Black towns. \"Chicago was the most accessible northern city for African Americans in Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas.\"<ref name=\"spear\"/> They took the trains north. \"Then between 1916 and 1919, 50,000 blacks came to crowd into the burgeoning black belt, to make new demands upon the institutional structure of the South Side.\"<ref name=\"spear\"/>\n\n===Segregation===\n[[File:Chicagoblackbelt.jpg|thumb|300px|Chicago's Black Belt, April 1941]]\nIn the 1920s, homeowner's discriminatory covenant practices were killed in state courts.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> The increasingly large black population in [[Chicago]] (40,000 in 1910, and 278,000 in 1940<ref name=\"manning\"/>) faced some of the same discrimination in Chicago as they had in the South. It was hard for many blacks to find jobs and find decent places to live because of the competition for housing among different groups of people at a time when the city was expanding in population so dramatically. At the same time that blacks moved from the South in the Great Migration, Chicago was still receiving thousands of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. The groups competed with each other for working-class wages.\n\nThough other techniques to maintain [[housing segregation]] had been used, such as [[redlining]] and [[exclusive zoning]] to single-family housing, by 1927 the political leaders of Chicago began to adopt racially restrictive [[Covenant (law)|covenants]].<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> The Chicago Real Estate Board promoted a racially restrictive covenant to YMCAs, churches, women's clubs, PTAs, Kiwanis clubs, chambers of commerce and property owners' associations.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> At one point, as much as 80% of the city's area was included under restrictive covenants.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/>\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' ruled in 1948 that racially restrictive covenants were unconstitutional, but this did not quickly solve blacks' problems with finding adequate housing.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/>  Homeowners' associations discouraged members from selling to black families, thus maintaining [[residential segregation]].<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> European immigrants and their descendants competed with African Americans for limited affordable housing, and those who didn't get the house lived on the streets.\n\nIn a succession common to most cities, many middle and upper-class whites were the first to move out of the city to new housing, aided by new commuter rail lines and the construction of new highway systems.  Later arrivals, ethnic whites and African-American families occupied the older housing behind them. The white residents who had been in the city longest were the ones most likely to move to the newer, most expensive housing, as they could afford it. After WWII, the early white residents (many Irish immigrants and their descendants) on the [[South side (Chicago)|South Side]] began to move away under pressure of new migrants and with newly expanding housing opportunities. African Americans continued to move into the area, which had become the black capital of the country. The South Side became predominantly black, and the Black Belt was formed.\n\n==Lifestyle==\n===Housing===\n{{Ethnic Chicago sidebar}}\nBetween 1900 and 1910, the African-American population rose rapidly in Chicago. White hostility and population growth combined to create the ghetto on the South Side. Nearby were areas dominated by ethnic Irish, who were especially territorial in defending against incursions into their areas by any other groups.<ref name=\"manning\"/> Most of this large population was composed of migrants.<ref name=\"manning\"/> In 1910 more than 75 percent of blacks lived in predominantly black sections of the city.<ref name=\"manning\"/> The eight or nine neighborhoods that had been set as areas of black settlement in 1900 remained the core of the Chicago African-American community. The Black Belt slowly expanded as African Americans, despite facing violence and restrictive covenants, pushed forward into new neighborhoods.<ref>Will Cooley, \"Moving On Out: Black Pioneering in Chicago, 1915\u20131950,\" Journal of Urban History 36:4 (July 2010), 485\u2013506.</ref> As the population grew, African Americans became more confined to a delineated area, instead of spreading throughout the city. When blacks moved into mixed neighborhoods, ethnic white hostility grew. After fighting over the area, often whites left the area to be dominated by blacks. This is one of the reasons the black belt region started.\n\nThe Black Belt of Chicago was the chain of neighborhoods on the [[Neighborhoods of Chicago#South side|South Side]] of [[Chicago]] where three-quarters of the city's African-American population lived by the mid-20th century.<ref name=\"manning\"/> In the early 1940s whites within residential blocks formed \"restrictive covenants\" that served as legal contracts restricting individual owners from renting or selling to black people. The contracts limited the housing available to black tenants, leading to the accumulation of black residents within The Black Belt, one of the few neighborhoods open to black tenants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chipublib.org/housing/|title=Housing and Race in Chicago|website=Chipublib.org|accessdate= September 23, 2017}}</ref> The Black Belt was an area that stretched 30 blocks along [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] on the South Side and was rarely more than seven blocks wide.<ref name=\"manning\"/> With such a large population within this confined area, overcrowding often led to numerous families living in old and dilapidated buildings. The South Side's \"black belt\" also contained zones related to economic status. The poorest residents lived in the northernmost, oldest section of the black belt, while the elite resided in the southernmost section.<ref name=\"chicagoD\">[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam011.html \"Chicago: Destination for the Great Migration\"], ''The African-American Mosaic'', [[Library of Congress]].</ref> In the mid-20th century, as African Americans across the United States struggled against the economic confines created by segregation, black residents within the Black Belt sought to create more economic opportunity in their community through the encouragement of local black businesses and entrepreneurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam011.html|title=Chicago: Destination for the Great Migration - The African-American Mosaic Exhibition - Exhibitions (Library of Congress)|first=Chicago|last=Defender|date= July 23, 2010|website=Loc.gov|accessdate= September 23, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"manning\"/> During this time, Chicago was the capital of Black America. Many African Americans who moved to the Black Belt area of Chicago were from the Southeastern region of the United States.\n\nImmigration to Chicago was another pressure of overcrowding, as primarily lower-class newcomers from rural Europe also sought cheap housing and working class jobs.  More and more people tried to fit into converted \"[[kitchenette]]\" and basement apartments.  Living conditions in the Black Belt resembled conditions in the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] ghetto or in the stockyards district.<ref name=\"spear\"/>  Although there were decent homes in the Negro sections, the core of the Black Belt was a slum. A 1934 census estimated that black households contained 6.8 people on average, whereas white households contained 4.7.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book|authorlink=Arnold R.

This unhealthiness increased the threat of disease. From 1940\u20131960, the infant death rate in the Black Belt was 16% higher than the rest of the city.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCrime in [[African-American neighborhood]]s was a low priority to the police. Associated with problems of poverty and southern culture, rates of violence and homicide were high. Some women resorted to prostitution to survive. Both low life and middle-class strivers were concentrated in a small area.<ref name=\"manning\"/>\n\nIn 1946, the [[Chicago Housing Authority]] (CHA) tried to ease the pressure in the overcrowded ghettos and proposed to put public housing sites in less congested areas in the city. The white residents did not take to this very well, so city politicians forced the CHA to keep the [[status quo]] and develop high rise projects in the Black Belt and on the West Side. Some of these became notorious failures. As industrial restructuring in the 1950s and later led to massive job losses, residents changed from working-class families to poor families on welfare.<ref name=\"manning\"/>\n\nAs of May 2016 violence within some Chicago neighborhoods prompted black middle-class people to move to suburbs.<ref>\"[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/chicagos-high-murder-rates-drive-exodus-of-black-middle-class/ Chicago\u2019s high murder rates drive exodus of black middle class].\" ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'', May 15, 2016. Retrieved May 18, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Culture===\nBetween 1916 and 1920, almost 50,000  Black Southerners moved to Chicago,<ref name=\"spear\"/> which profoundly shaped the city's development. Growth increased even more rapidly after 1940. In particular, the new citizens caused the growth of local churches, businesses and community organizations. A new musical culture arose, fed by all the traditions along the Mississippi River. The population continued to increase with new migrants, with the most arriving after 1940.\n\nThe black arts community in Chicago was especially vibrant. The 1920s were the height of the [[Jazz Age]], but music continued as the heart of the community for decades. Nationally renowned musicians rose within the Chicago world. Along the Stroll, a bright-light district on [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]], jazz greats like [[Louis Armstrong]] headlined at nightspots including the [[Deluxe Cafe]].\n\nBlack Chicago-people literary creation from 1925 to 1950 was also prolific, and the city's [[Chicago Black Renaissance|Black Renaissance]] rivaled that of the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. Prominent writers included [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Willard Motley]], [[William Attaway]], [[Frank Marshall Davis]], [[St. Clair Drake]], [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.]], and [[Margaret Walker]]. Chicago was home to writer and poet [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], known for her portrayals of Black working-class life in crowded tenements of [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]]. These writers expressed the changes and conflicts blacks found in urban life and the struggles of creating new worlds. In Chicago, black writers turned away from the folk traditions embraced by [[Harlem Renaissance]] writers, instead adopting a grittier style of \"literary naturalism\" to depict life in the urban ghetto. The classic ''[[Black Metropolis]]'', written by St. Clair Drake and Horace R. Cayton, Jr., exemplified the style of the Chicago writers. Today it remains the most detailed portrayal of Black Chicago in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nFrom 2008 to the present, the West Side Historical Society under the guidance of Rickie P. Brown Sr. began to document the rich history of the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago. Their research provided proof of the Austin community having the largest population of Blacks in the city of Chicago. This proved that the largest population of blacks are on its west side, when factoring in the Near West Side, North Lawndale, West Humboldt Park, Garfield Park, and Austin communities as well. Their efforts to build a museum on the west side and continuing to bring awareness to [[Juneteenth]] as a national holiday was rewarded with a proclamation in 2011 by Governor Pat Quinn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austinweeklynews.com/News/Articles/2-22-2012/Westside-Historical-Society-continues-making-history/|title=Westside Historical Society continues making history|website=Austinweeklynews.com|access-date=October 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Business===\nChicago's black population developed a class structure, composed of a large number of domestic workers and other manual labourers, along with a small, but growing, contingent of middle-and-upper-class business and professional elites. In 1929, black Chicagoans gained access to city jobs, and expanded their professional class. Fighting job discrimination was a constant battle for African Americans in Chicago, as foremen in various companies restricted the advancement of black workers, which often kept them from earning higher wages.<ref name=\"chicagoD\"/> In the mid-20th century, blacks began slowly moving up to better positions in the work force.<ref name=\"manning\"/>\n\nThe migration expanded the market for African-American business. \"The most notable breakthrough in black business came in the insurance field.\"<ref name=\"spear\"/> There were four major insurance companies founded in Chicago. Then, in the early 20th century, service establishments took over.{{Clarify|date=August 2012}} The African-American market on State Street during this time consisted of barber shops, restaurants, pool rooms, saloons, and beauty salons. African Americans used these trades to build their own communities. These shops gave the blacks a chance to establish their families, earn money, and become an active part of the community.\n\n==Achievements==\nIn the early 20th century many prominent African Americans were Chicago residents, including Republican and later Democratic congressman [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William L. Dawson]] (America's most powerful black politician<ref name=\"manning\"/>) and boxing champion [[Joe Louis]]. America's most widely read black newspaper,<ref name=\"manning\"/> the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', was published there and circulated in the South as well.\n\nAfter long efforts, in the late 1930s, workers organized across racial lines to form the [[United Meatpacking Workers of America]]. By then, the majority of workers in Chicago's plants were black, but they succeeded in creating an interracial organizing committee. It succeeded in organizing unions both in Chicago and [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska, the city with the second largest meatpacking industry. This union belonged to the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), which was more progressive than the [[American Federation of Labor]]. They succeeded in lifting segregation of job positions. For a time, workers achieved living wages and other benefits, leading to blue collar middle-class life for decades. Some blacks were also able to move up the ranks to supervisory and management positions. The CIO also succeeded in organizing Chicago's steel industry.\n\nBlacks began to win elective office in local and state government.<ref name=\"manning\"/>  The first blacks had been elected to office in Chicago in the late 19th century, decades before the Great Migrations.\n\nChicago is home to three of eight [[List of African-American United States Senators|African-American United States Senators]] who have served since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], who are all Democrats: [[Carol Moseley Braun]] (1993&ndash;1999), Former President [[Barack Obama]] (2005&ndash;2008), and [[Roland Burris]] (2009&ndash;2010). Chicago also elected the first post-Reconstruction African-American member of Congress, [[Oscar Stanton De Priest]], in [[Illinois' 1st congressional district]], which has continuously elected African-Americans to the office since De Priest's term. The Chicago area alone has elected 18 [[List of African-American United States Representatives|African Americans to the House of Representatives]], more than any other state in the country.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States|Chicago}}\n*[[Chicago Black Renaissance]]\n*[[Chicago State University]]\n*[[Chicago Race Riot of 1919]]\n*[[Great Migration (African American)]]\n*[[Second Great Migration (African American)]]\n*[[History of Chicago]]\n* [[Political history of Chicago]]\n*[[Racial segregation in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Best, Wallace.

By the late 19th century, the first black person had been elected to office.\n\nThe [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migrations]] from 1910 to 1960 brought hundreds of thousands of blacks from the [[Southern United States|South]] to [[Chicago]], where they became an urban population.  They created churches, community organizations, important businesses,  music, and literature.  African Americans of all classes built a community on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of Chicago for decades before the [[Civil Rights Movement]], as well as on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago.  Residing in segregated communities, almost regardless of income, the Black residents of Chicago aimed to create communities where they could survive, sustain themselves, and have the ability to determine for themselves their own course in [[Chicago history]].\n\n==History==\n===Beginnings===\n{{further|Slavery in Illinois}}\nAlthough du Sable's settlement was established in the 1780s, African Americans would only become established as a community in the 1840s, with the population reaching 1,000 by 1860. Much of this population consisted of escaped slaves from the Upper South. Following the end of Reconstruction in 1877, African Americans flowed from the Deep South into Chicago, raising the population from approximately 4,000 in 1870 to 15,000 in 1890.\n\nIn 1853, [[John A. Logan]] helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state. However, in 1865, the state repealed its \"[[Black Codes (United States)|Black Laws]]\" and became the first to ratify the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]].\n\nEspecially after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Illinois had some of the most progressive anti-discrimination legislation in the nation.<ref name=\"jimcrow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/scripts/jimcrow/lawsoutside.cgi?state=Illinois |title=Jim Crow Laws: Illinois |accessdate=May 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927020322/http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/scripts/jimcrow/lawsoutside.cgi?state=Illinois |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref> School segregation was first outlawed in 1874, and segregation in public accommodations was first outlawed in 1885.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> In 1870, Illinois extended voting rights to African-American men for the first time, and in 1871, [[John Jones (Illinois politician)|John Jones]], a tailor and [[Underground Railroad]] station manager who successfully lobbied for the repeal of the state's Black Laws, became the first African-American elected official in the state, serving as a member of the [[Cook County Board of Commissioners|Cook County Commission]]. By 1879, [[John W. E. Thomas]] of Chicago became the first African American elected to the [[Illinois General Assembly]], beginning the longest uninterrupted run of African-American representation in any state legislature in U.S. history. After the [[Great Chicago Fire]], Chicago mayor [[Joseph Medill]] appointed the city's first black fire company of nine men and the first black police officer.\n\n===Great Migration===\n{{Main|Great Migration (African American)}}\n[[File:Chicagoracialhistory.png|thumb|300px|The black population in Chicago significantly increased in the early to mid-1900s, due to the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South.

Deprived of the right to vote, they could not sit on juries or run for office. They were subject to discriminatory laws passed by white legislators, including racial segregation of public facilities. Segregated education for black children and other services were consistently underfunded in a poor, agricultural economy. As white-dominated legislatures passed Jim Crow laws to re-establish white supremacy and create more restrictions in public life, violence against blacks increased, with [[lynchings]] used as extrajudicial enforcement. In addition, the [[boll weevil]] infestation ruined much of the cotton industry in the early 20th century. Voting with their feet, blacks started migrating out of the South to the North, where they could live more freely, get their children educated, and get new jobs.\n\nIndustry buildup for World War I pulled thousands of workers to the North, as did the rapid expansion of [[railroads]], and the [[meatpacking]] and [[steel]] industries. Between 1915 and 1960, hundreds of thousands of black southerners migrated to Chicago to escape violence and segregation, and to seek [[economic freedom]]. They went from being a mostly rural population to one that was mostly urban. \"The migration of African Americans from the rural south to the urban north became a mass movement.\"<ref name=\"spear\">Allen H.

They had been chiefly sharecroppers and laborers, although some were landowners pushed out by the boll weevil disaster. After years of underfunding of public education for blacks in the South, they tended to be poorly educated, with relatively low skills to apply to urban jobs.  Like the European rural immigrants, they had to rapidly adapt to a different urban culture.  Many took advantage of better schooling in Chicago and their children learned quickly.  After 1940, when the second larger wave of migration started, black migrants tended to be already urbanized, from southern cities and towns.  They were the most ambitious, better educated with more urban skills to apply in their new homes.\n\nThe masses of new migrants arriving in the cities captured public attention.  At one point in the 1940s, 3,000 African Americans were arriving every week in Chicago\u2014stepping off the trains from the South and making their ways to neighborhoods they had learned about from friends and the ''[[Chicago Defender]]''.<ref>Nicholas Lemann, ''The Great Migration''.</ref>  The Great Migration was charted and evaluated. Urban white northerners started to get worried, as their neighborhoods rapidly changed. At the same time, recent and older ethnic immigrants competed for jobs and housing with the new arrivals, especially on the South Side, where the steel and meatpacking industries had the most numerous working-class jobs.\n\nEthnic Irish were heavily implicated in the gang violence and the rioting that erupted in 1919. They had been the most established ethnic group and defended their power and territory in the South Side against newcomers: both other ethnic whites and southern blacks. \"Chicago was a focal point of the great migration and the racial violence that came in its wake.\"<ref name=\"spear\"/>  With Chicago's industries steadily expanding, opportunities opened up for new migrants, including Southerners, to find work. The railroad and meatpacking industries recruited black workers. Chicago's African-American newspaper, the ''Chicago Defender'', made the city well known to southerners.  It sent bundles of papers south on the [[Illinois Central]] trains, and African-American [[Pullman Porters]] would drop them off in Black towns. \"Chicago was the most accessible northern city for African Americans in Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas.\"<ref name=\"spear\"/> They took the trains north. \"Then between 1916 and 1919, 50,000 blacks came to crowd into the burgeoning black belt, to make new demands upon the institutional structure of the South Side.\"<ref name=\"spear\"/>\n\n===Segregation===\n[[File:Chicagoblackbelt.jpg|thumb|300px|Chicago's Black Belt, April 1941]]\nIn the 1920s, homeowner's discriminatory covenant practices were killed in state courts.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> The increasingly large black population in [[Chicago]] (40,000 in 1910, and 278,000 in 1940<ref name=\"manning\"/>) faced some of the same discrimination in Chicago as they had in the South. It was hard for many blacks to find jobs and find decent places to live because of the competition for housing among different groups of people at a time when the city was expanding in population so dramatically. At the same time that blacks moved from the South in the Great Migration, Chicago was still receiving thousands of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. The groups competed with each other for working-class wages.\n\nThough other techniques to maintain [[housing segregation]] had been used, such as [[redlining]] and [[exclusive zoning]] to single-family housing, by 1927 the political leaders of Chicago began to adopt racially restrictive [[Covenant (law)|covenants]].<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> The Chicago Real Estate Board promoted a racially restrictive covenant to YMCAs, churches, women's clubs, PTAs, Kiwanis clubs, chambers of commerce and property owners' associations.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> At one point, as much as 80% of the city's area was included under restrictive covenants.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/>\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' ruled in 1948 that racially restrictive covenants were unconstitutional, but this did not quickly solve blacks' problems with finding adequate housing.<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/>  Homeowners' associations discouraged members from selling to black families, thus maintaining [[residential segregation]].<ref name=\"jimcrow\"/> European immigrants and their descendants competed with African Americans for limited affordable housing, and those who didn't get the house lived on the streets.\n\nIn a succession common to most cities, many middle and upper-class whites were the first to move out of the city to new housing, aided by new commuter rail lines and the construction of new highway systems.  Later arrivals, ethnic whites and African-American families occupied the older housing behind them. The white residents who had been in the city longest were the ones most likely to move to the newer, most expensive housing, as they could afford it. After WWII, the early white residents (many Irish immigrants and their descendants) on the [[South side (Chicago)|South Side]] began to move away under pressure of new migrants and with newly expanding housing opportunities. African Americans continued to move into the area, which had become the black capital of the country. The South Side became predominantly black, and the Black Belt was formed.\n\n==Lifestyle==\n===Housing===\n{{Ethnic Chicago sidebar}}\nBetween 1900 and 1910, the African-American population rose rapidly in Chicago. White hostility and population growth combined to create the ghetto on the South Side. Nearby were areas dominated by ethnic Irish, who were especially territorial in defending against incursions into their areas by any other groups.<ref name=\"manning\"/> Most of this large population was composed of migrants.<ref name=\"manning\"/> In 1910 more than 75 percent of blacks lived in predominantly black sections of the city.<ref name=\"manning\"/> The eight or nine neighborhoods that had been set as areas of black settlement in 1900 remained the core of the Chicago African-American community. The Black Belt slowly expanded as African Americans, despite facing violence and restrictive covenants, pushed forward into new neighborhoods.<ref>Will Cooley, \"Moving On Out: Black Pioneering in Chicago, 1915\u20131950,\" Journal of Urban History 36:4 (July 2010), 485\u2013506.</ref> As the population grew, African Americans became more confined to a delineated area, instead of spreading throughout the city. When blacks moved into mixed neighborhoods, ethnic white hostility grew. After fighting over the area, often whites left the area to be dominated by blacks. This is one of the reasons the black belt region started.\n\nThe Black Belt of Chicago was the chain of neighborhoods on the [[Neighborhoods of Chicago#South side|South Side]] of [[Chicago]] where three-quarters of the city's African-American population lived by the mid-20th century.<ref name=\"manning\"/> In the early 1940s whites within residential blocks formed \"restrictive covenants\" that served as legal contracts restricting individual owners from renting or selling to black people. The contracts limited the housing available to black tenants, leading to the accumulation of black residents within The Black Belt, one of the few neighborhoods open to black tenants.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chipublib.org/housing/|title=Housing and Race in Chicago|website=Chipublib.org|accessdate= September 23, 2017}}</ref> The Black Belt was an area that stretched 30 blocks along [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]] on the South Side and was rarely more than seven blocks wide.<ref name=\"manning\"/> With such a large population within this confined area, overcrowding often led to numerous families living in old and dilapidated buildings. The South Side's \"black belt\" also contained zones related to economic status. The poorest residents lived in the northernmost, oldest section of the black belt, while the elite resided in the southernmost section.<ref name=\"chicagoD\">[https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam011.html \"Chicago: Destination for the Great Migration\"], ''The African-American Mosaic'', [[Library of Congress]].</ref> In the mid-20th century, as African Americans across the United States struggled against the economic confines created by segregation, black residents within the Black Belt sought to create more economic opportunity in their community through the encouragement of local black businesses and entrepreneurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam011.html|title=Chicago: Destination for the Great Migration - The African-American Mosaic Exhibition - Exhibitions (Library of Congress)|first=Chicago|last=Defender|date= July 23, 2010|website=Loc.gov|accessdate= September 23, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"manning\"/> During this time, Chicago was the capital of Black America. Many African Americans who moved to the Black Belt area of Chicago were from the Southeastern region of the United States.\n\nImmigration to Chicago was another pressure of overcrowding, as primarily lower-class newcomers from rural Europe also sought cheap housing and working class jobs.  More and more people tried to fit into converted \"[[kitchenette]]\" and basement apartments.  Living conditions in the Black Belt resembled conditions in the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] ghetto or in the stockyards district.<ref name=\"spear\"/>  Although there were decent homes in the Negro sections, the core of the Black Belt was a slum. A 1934 census estimated that black households contained 6.8 people on average, whereas white households contained 4.7.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite book|authorlink=Arnold R.

This unhealthiness increased the threat of disease. From 1940\u20131960, the infant death rate in the Black Belt was 16% higher than the rest of the city.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCrime in [[African-American neighborhood]]s was a low priority to the police. Associated with problems of poverty and southern culture, rates of violence and homicide were high. Some women resorted to prostitution to survive. Both low life and middle-class strivers were concentrated in a small area.<ref name=\"manning\"/>\n\nIn 1946, the [[Chicago Housing Authority]] (CHA) tried to ease the pressure in the overcrowded ghettos and proposed to put public housing sites in less congested areas in the city. The white residents did not take to this very well, so city politicians forced the CHA to keep the [[status quo]] and develop high rise projects in the Black Belt and on the West Side. Some of these became notorious failures. As industrial restructuring in the 1950s and later led to massive job losses, residents changed from working-class families to poor families on welfare.<ref name=\"manning\"/>\n\nAs of May 2016 violence within some Chicago neighborhoods prompted black middle-class people to move to suburbs.<ref>\"[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/chicagos-high-murder-rates-drive-exodus-of-black-middle-class/ Chicago\u2019s high murder rates drive exodus of black middle class].\" ''[[PBS NewsHour]]'', May 15, 2016. Retrieved May 18, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Culture===\nBetween 1916 and 1920, almost 50,000  Black Southerners moved to Chicago,<ref name=\"spear\"/> which profoundly shaped the city's development. Growth increased even more rapidly after 1940. In particular, the new citizens caused the growth of local churches, businesses and community organizations. A new musical culture arose, fed by all the traditions along the Mississippi River. The population continued to increase with new migrants, with the most arriving after 1940.\n\nThe black arts community in Chicago was especially vibrant. The 1920s were the height of the [[Jazz Age]], but music continued as the heart of the community for decades. Nationally renowned musicians rose within the Chicago world. Along the Stroll, a bright-light district on [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]], jazz greats like [[Louis Armstrong]] headlined at nightspots including the [[Deluxe Cafe]] .\n\nBlack Chicago-people literary creation from 1925 to 1950 was also prolific, and the city's [[Chicago Black Renaissance|Black Renaissance]] rivaled that of the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. Prominent writers included [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Willard Motley]], [[William Attaway]], [[Frank Marshall Davis]], [[St. Clair Drake]], [[Horace R. Cayton, Jr.]], and [[Margaret Walker]]. Chicago was home to writer and poet [[Gwendolyn Brooks]], known for her portrayals of Black working-class life in crowded tenements of [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]]. These writers expressed the changes and conflicts blacks found in urban life and the struggles of creating new worlds. In Chicago, black writers turned away from the folk traditions embraced by [[Harlem Renaissance]] writers, instead adopting a grittier style of \"literary naturalism\" to depict life in the urban ghetto. The classic ''[[Black Metropolis]]'', written by St. Clair Drake and Horace R. Cayton, Jr., exemplified the style of the Chicago writers. Today it remains the most detailed portrayal of Black Chicago in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nFrom 2008 to the present, the West Side Historical Society under the guidance of Rickie P. Brown Sr. began to document the rich history of the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago. Their research provided proof of the Austin community having the largest population of Blacks in the city of Chicago. This proved that the largest population of blacks are on its west side, when factoring in the Near West Side, North Lawndale, West Humboldt Park, Garfield Park, and Austin communities as well. Their efforts to build a museum on the west side and continuing to bring awareness to [[Juneteenth]] as a national holiday was rewarded with a proclamation in 2011 by Governor Pat Quinn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austinweeklynews.com/News/Articles/2-22-2012/Westside-Historical-Society-continues-making-history/|title=Westside Historical Society continues making history|website=Austinweeklynews.com|access-date=October 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Business===\nChicago's black population developed a class structure, composed of a large number of domestic workers and other manual labourers, along with a small, but growing, contingent of middle-and-upper-class business and professional elites. In 1929, black Chicagoans gained access to city jobs, and expanded their professional class. Fighting job discrimination was a constant battle for African Americans in Chicago, as foremen in various companies restricted the advancement of black workers, which often kept them from earning higher wages.<ref name=\"chicagoD\"/> In the mid-20th century, blacks began slowly moving up to better positions in the work force.<ref name=\"manning\"/>\n\nThe migration expanded the market for African-American business. \"The most notable breakthrough in black business came in the insurance field.\"<ref name=\"spear\"/> There were four major insurance companies founded in Chicago. Then, in the early 20th century, service establishments took over.{{Clarify|date=August 2012}} The African-American market on State Street during this time consisted of barber shops, restaurants, pool rooms, saloons, and beauty salons. African Americans used these trades to build their own communities. These shops gave the blacks a chance to establish their families, earn money, and become an active part of the community.\n\n==Achievements==\nIn the early 20th century many prominent African Americans were Chicago residents, including Republican and later Democratic congressman [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William L. Dawson]] (America's most powerful black politician<ref name=\"manning\"/>) and boxing champion [[Joe Louis]]. America's most widely read black newspaper,<ref name=\"manning\"/> the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', was published there and circulated in the South as well.\n\nAfter long efforts, in the late 1930s, workers organized across racial lines to form the [[United Meatpacking Workers of America]]. By then, the majority of workers in Chicago's plants were black, but they succeeded in creating an interracial organizing committee. It succeeded in organizing unions both in Chicago and [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska, the city with the second largest meatpacking industry. This union belonged to the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO), which was more progressive than the [[American Federation of Labor]]. They succeeded in lifting segregation of job positions. For a time, workers achieved living wages and other benefits, leading to blue collar middle-class life for decades. Some blacks were also able to move up the ranks to supervisory and management positions. The CIO also succeeded in organizing Chicago's steel industry.\n\nBlacks began to win elective office in local and state government.<ref name=\"manning\"/>  The first blacks had been elected to office in Chicago in the late 19th century, decades before the Great Migrations.\n\nChicago is home to three of eight [[List of African-American United States Senators|African-American United States Senators]] who have served since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], who are all Democrats: [[Carol Moseley Braun]] (1993&ndash;1999), Former President [[Barack Obama]] (2005&ndash;2008), and [[Roland Burris]] (2009&ndash;2010). Chicago also elected the first post-Reconstruction African-American member of Congress, [[Oscar Stanton De Priest]], in [[Illinois' 1st congressional district]], which has continuously elected African-Americans to the office since De Priest's term. The Chicago area alone has elected 18 [[List of African-American United States Representatives|African Americans to the House of Representatives]], more than any other state in the country.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United States|Chicago}}\n*[[Chicago Black Renaissance]]\n*[[Chicago State University]]\n*[[Chicago Race Riot of 1919]]\n*[[Great Migration (African American)]]\n*[[Second Great Migration (African American)]]\n*[[History of Chicago]]\n* [[Political history of Chicago]]\n*[[Racial segregation in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Best, Wallace.

January 1888 \u2013 6 March 1965) was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour politician]] who held a variety of senior positions in the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]]. During the inter-war period, he was Minister of Transport during the [[1929\u20131931 Labour Government]], then, after losing his seat in Parliament in [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]], became Leader of the [[London County Council]] in the 1930s. Returning to the Commons in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]], he was defeated by [[Clement Attlee]] in the [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election that year]], but later acted as [[Home Secretary]] in the wartime coalition.\n\nMorrison organised Labour's victorious 1945 election campaign, and was appointed [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] in [[Attlee ministry|Attlee's governments of 1945\u201351]]. Attlee, Morrison, [[Ernest Bevin]], [[Stafford Cripps]] and (initially) [[Hugh Dalton]] formed the \"Big Five\" who dominated those governments. Morrison oversaw Labour's nationalisation programme, although he opposed [[Aneurin Bevan|Aneurin Bevan's]] proposals for a nationalised hospital service as part of the setting up of the [[National Health Service]]. Morrison developed his social views from his work in local politics and always emphasised the importance of public works to deal with unemployment. In the final year of Attlee's premiership, Morrison had an unhappy term as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. He was hailed as  \"Lord Festival\" for his successful leadership of the [[Festival of Britain]], a critical and popular success in 1951 that attracted millions of visitors to fun-filled educational exhibits and events in London and across the country.\n\nMorrison was widely expected to succeed Attlee as Labour leader, but Attlee, who disliked him, postponed stepping down until 1955. Morrison, who was by then considered too old, came a poor third in the ensuing [[1955 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election]].<ref>Laybourn, Keith (2002) \u201cMorrison, Herbert Stanley\u201d in John Ramsden, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198601344}}. pp. 443\u201344</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMorrison was born in Stockwell, [[Lambeth, London]], to Priscilla (n\u00e9e Lyon; died 1907) and Henry Morrison (died 1917), one of six children who survived infancy. Henry Morrison was a police constable, whose Conservative political opinions his son would later come to disagree with strongly.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAs a baby, he permanently lost the sight in his right eye due to infection. He attended Stockwell Road Primary School and, from the age of 11, St Andrew's Church of England School. He left school at 14 to become an errand boy. His early politics were radical, and he briefly flirted with the [[Social Democratic Federation]] over the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP). As a [[conscientious objector]], he worked in a market garden in [[Letchworth]] in World War One.<ref name=\"Howell\"/>\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Early career===\n\nMorrison eventually became a pioneer leader in the London Labour Party. He was elected to the [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney]] in 1919 when the Labour Party won control of the Borough, and he was Mayor in 1920\u201321. Morrison was a follower of [[Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient FC]] and became a shareholder in the club. He was elected to the [[London County Council]] (LCC) in 1922 and at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] he became [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hackney South (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South]], but lost that seat the following year when [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s first administration lost the general election.<ref name=Howell>Howell, David (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35121 \"Morrison, Herbert Stanley, Baron Morrison of Lambeth (1888\u20131965)\"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press; {{DOI|10.1093/ref:odnb/35121}}</ref>\n\nMorrison returned to Parliament in the 1929 general election, and MacDonald appointed him Minister of Transport. Morrison, like many others in the party, was deeply disheartened by MacDonald's national government, and he lost his seat again in 1931.\n\n===London===\nMorrison continued to sit on the London County Council and in 1933 was elected to lead the Labour Group. He wrote a book ''Socialisation and Transport : the Organisation of Socialised Industries with Particular Reference to the London Passenger Transport Bill'' which encapsulated his ideas on nationalisation. Managers would be appointed to run monopoly industries in the public interest. He did not, however, envisage democratic control by the workers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kynaston|first1=David|authorlink=David Kynaston|title=A World to Build|date=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9780747585404|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldtobuild0000kyna/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/worldtobuild0000kyna/page/24}}</ref>  Unexpectedly, Labour won the 1934 LCC election and Morrison became Leader of the Council. This gave him control of almost all local government services in London. His main achievements here included the unification of bus, tram and trolleybus services with the Underground, by the creation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (colloquially known as London Transport) in 1933, and creating the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] around the suburbs. He confronted the Government over its refusal to finance the replacement of [[Waterloo Bridge]], and eventually they agreed to pay 60% of the cost of the new bridge.<ref name=Howell/>\n\nIn the 1935 election, Morrison was once again elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and immediately [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|challenged Attlee for the leadership]] of the party. He was defeated by a wide margin in the final ballot, a defeat ascribed to his unfamiliarity with the MPs who had served in the previous Parliament. Both he and his supporter Hugh Dalton put some of the blame on the Masonic [[New Welcome Lodge]], who, they claimed, backed the third-place leadership candidate [[Arthur Greenwood]] and then switched their votes to Attlee.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Masons' Candidate: New Welcome Lodge No. 5139 and the Parliamentary Labour Party|journal=Labour History Review|volume =71|issue=1|date=April 2006 |pages=9\u201341(33)|doi=10.1179/174581806X103862 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233637409_%27The_Masons%27_Candidate%27_New_Welcome_Lodge_No._5139_and_the_Parliamentary_Labour_Party|last1=Hamill|first1=John|last2=Prescott|first2=Andrew}} This cites as note number 2 H. Morrison, ''Herbert Morrison: An Autobiography by Lord Morrison of Lambeth'', London, Odhams, 1960, p. 164</ref>  After losing, Morrison concentrated on his LCC work. He convinced Labour to adopt the new electioneering techniques that opponents had been using, especially using advertising agencies in the 1937 local elections.<ref>Dominic Wring, \"\u201cSelling socialism\u201d-The marketing of the \u201cvery old\u201d British Labour Party.\" ''European Journal of Marketing'' 35#9/10 (2001): 1038-1046.

His biographers, [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoghue]] and [[George William Jones|George W. Jones]], have written that \"Morrison never said or wrote\" the words attributed to him.<ref>Donoghue and Jones, ''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician''. p. xxxi</ref>\n\n===Wartime Coalition===\n\nIn 1940, Morrison was appointed the first [[Minister of Supply]] by [[Winston Churchill]], but shortly afterwards succeeded Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]] as Home Secretary. Morrison's London experience in local government was particularly useful during [[the Blitz]], and the [[Air-raid shelter#Morrison shelter|Morrison shelter]] was named after him. He made radio appeals for more fire guards in December 1940 ('Britain shall not burn').<ref>audiobook titled ''The Blitz''</ref>\n\nMorrison had to take many potentially unpopular and controversial decisions by the nature of wartime circumstances. On 21 January 1941, he banned the [[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Daily Worker]] for opposing war with Germany and supporting the Soviet Union. The ban lasted for a total of 18 months before it was rescinded.\n\nThe arrival of black American troops caused concern in the government, leading Morrison, the Home Secretary, to comment \"I am fully conscious that a difficult social problem might be created if there were a substantial number of sex relations between white women and coloured troops and the procreation of half-caste children.\" That was in a memorandum for the cabinet in 1942.<ref>[http://www.nickelinthemachine.com/2011/05/marc-blitzstein-roland-hayes-and-the-negro-chorus-at-the-royal-albert-hall-in-1943/ Marc Blitzstein, Roland Hayes and the \u2018Negro Chorus\u2019 at the Royal Albert Hall in 1943]. nickelinthemachine.com.

He was the chief sponsor of the [[Festival of Britain]].\n\nMorrison supervised the major Labour programme of nationalising large sectors of industry. As Lord President chaired the Committee on the Socialization of Industries, he followed the model that was already in place of setting up public corporations, such as the [[BBC]] in broadcasting (1927). The owners of corporate stock were given government bonds, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The management remained the same, only now they became public servants working for the government. For the Labour Party leadership, nationalisation was a method to consolidate national planning in their own hands. It was not designed to modernise old industries, make them efficient, or transform their organisational structure.<ref>Sked, Alan and Cook, Chris (1979) ''Post-War Britain: A Political History''. {{ISBN|0140179127}}. pp 31\u201334</ref><ref>Beer, Samuel H.

Grady]] proposed \"The [[Morrison-Grady Plan]]\", intended to resolve the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], calling for federalisation under overall British trusteeship. Ultimately, the plan was rejected by both [[Palestinians]] and [[Israelis]].\n\nAfter Ernest Bevin's resignation as Foreign Secretary, Morrison took over his role, but did not feel at ease in the Foreign Office. He took an aggressive stance against [[Iran]]'s nationalist Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] and approved his overthrow.<ref>{{citation|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~simpson/Hist%20725%20Summer%202006/The%20US%20and%20Mossadegh%201951-1953.pdf |title=The United States, Great Britain, and Mossadegh |author=Painter, David S. |publisher=Georgetown University |isbn=1-56927-332-4 |year=1988 |accessdate=23 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117190807/http://userpages.umbc.edu/~simpson/Hist%20725%20Summer%202006/The%20US%20and%20Mossadegh%201951-1953.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His tenure there was cut short by Labour's defeat in the 1951 general election, and he was appointed a [[Companion of Honour]] in November that year.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=39396 |date=30 November 1951 |page=6235 |supp=y}}</ref>\n\n===Festival of Britain===\n{{Main|Festival of Britain}}\n[[File:In16695.jpg|thumb|right|The 300-foot-tall [[Skylon (Festival of Britain)|Skylon]] at the [[Festival of Britain]], 1951]]\nMorrison lacked a deep concern for foreign affairs, but he was an enthusiastic leader of a major domestic project, the [[Festival of Britain]].  Starting in 1947, he was the prime mover of the 1951 fair. The original goal was to celebrate the centennial of the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]].<ref>Bernard Donoughue, and G. W. Jones, ''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician'' (1973), pp 492-95.</ref>   However, the plans were changed. It was not to be another [[World Fair]], and international themes were absent; even the Commonwealth was ignored. Instead, the Festival focused entirely on Britain and its achievements; it was funded chiefly by the government, with a budget of \u00a312-million. The Conservatives gave little support. The Labour government was losing support, and the implicit goal of the festival was to give the people a feeling of successful recovery from the war's devastation, as well as promoting British science, technology, industrial design, architecture and the arts.<ref>F.M. Leventhal, \"'A Tonic to the Nation': The Festival of Britain, 1951.\" Albion 27#3 (1995): 445-453.</ref> Historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] says the Festival was a \"triumphant success\" as thousands:\n:flocked to the South Bank site, to wander around the [[Dome of Discovery]], gaze at the [[Skylon (Festival of Britain)|Skylon]], and generally enjoy a festival of national celebration. Up and down the land, lesser festivals enlisted much civic and voluntary enthusiasm. A people curbed by years of total war and half-crushed by austerity and gloom, showed that it had not lost the capacity for enjoying itself....Above all, the Festival made a spectacular setting as a showpiece for the inventiveness and genius of British scientists and technologists.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth O.

Attlee remained as Leader through the early 1950s and fought the 1955 election, finally announcing his retirement after Labour's defeat. Morrison was then 67, and was seen to be too old to embark on a new leadership role. During the leadership election, he was the interim [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]]. Although he stood, he finished last, by a wide margin, of the three candidates, with many of his supporters switching to [[Hugh Gaitskell]]. Gaitskell won the election, and Morrison resigned as Deputy Leader.\n\nDuring the [[Suez Crisis]], Morrison advocated unilateral action by the United Kingdom against Egypt, following Colonel Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal. Morrison stood down at the 1959 general election and was made a [[life peer]] as Baron Morrison of [[Lambeth]] in the [[County of London]] on 2 November 1959.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=41860 |date=3 November 1959 |page=6942 |nolink=y}}</ref> He was appointed President of the [[British Board of Film Censors]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nWhile working in a market garden in [[Letchworth]] during World War One, Morrison met his first wife, Margaret Kent (1896\u20131953), a secretary and daughter of a railway clerk. The couple married on 15 March 1919. His total involvement in politics, however, meant that theirs was not a happy marriage; his later autobiography made no mention of Kent or their daughter, Mary.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing Kent's death in July 1953, Morrison married Edith Meadowcroft (''b''. ''c''.1908), a businesswoman of Conservative politics. The pair married on 6 January 1955 and their relationship appeared much more successful.<ref name=\"Howell\" />\n\nMorrison's grandson [[Peter Mandelson]] was a cabinet minister in the Labour governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]].\n\n==Death==\n\nHe died on 6 March 1965, coincidentally in the same month as the London County Council was abolished.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n==TV portrayal==\n\nMorrison was Foreign Secretary at the time of the defection of the double agents [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]].

During the inter-war period, he was Minister of Transport during the [[1929\u20131931 Labour Government]], then, after losing his seat in Parliament in [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]], became Leader of the [[London County Council]] in the 1930s. Returning to the Commons in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]], he was defeated by [[Clement Attlee]] in the [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election that year]], but later acted as [[Home Secretary]] in the wartime coalition.\n\nMorrison organised Labour's victorious 1945 election campaign, and was appointed [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] in [[Attlee ministry|Attlee's governments of 1945\u201351]]. Attlee, Morrison, [[Ernest Bevin]], [[Stafford Cripps]] and (initially) [[Hugh Dalton]] formed the \"Big Five\" who dominated those governments. Morrison oversaw Labour's nationalisation programme, although he opposed [[Aneurin Bevan|Aneurin Bevan's]] proposals for a nationalised hospital service as part of the setting up of the [[National Health Service]]. Morrison developed his social views from his work in local politics and always emphasised the importance of public works to deal with unemployment. In the final year of Attlee's premiership, Morrison had an unhappy term as [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. He was hailed as  \"Lord Festival\" for his successful leadership of the [[Festival of Britain]], a critical and popular success in 1951 that attracted millions of visitors to fun-filled educational exhibits and events in London and across the country.\n\nMorrison was widely expected to succeed Attlee as Labour leader, but Attlee, who disliked him, postponed stepping down until 1955. Morrison, who was by then considered too old, came a poor third in the ensuing [[1955 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election]].<ref>Laybourn, Keith (2002) \u201cMorrison, Herbert Stanley\u201d in John Ramsden, ed., ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-century British Politics''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198601344}}. pp. 443\u201344</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMorrison was born in Stockwell, [[Lambeth, London]], to Priscilla (n\u00e9e Lyon; died 1907) and Henry Morrison (died 1917), one of six children who survived infancy. Henry Morrison was a police constable, whose Conservative political opinions his son would later come to disagree with strongly.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAs a baby, he permanently lost the sight in his right eye due to infection. He attended Stockwell Road Primary School and, from the age of 11, St Andrew's Church of England School. He left school at 14 to become an errand boy. His early politics were radical, and he briefly flirted with the [[Social Democratic Federation]] over the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP). As a [[conscientious objector]], he worked in a market garden in [[Letchworth]] in World War One.<ref name=\"Howell\"/>\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Early career===\n\nMorrison eventually became a pioneer leader in the London Labour Party. He was elected to the [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney]] in 1919 when the Labour Party won control of the Borough, and he was Mayor in 1920\u201321. Morrison was a follower of [[Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient FC]] and became a shareholder in the club. He was elected to the [[London County Council]] (LCC) in 1922 and at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] he became [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Hackney South (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South]], but lost that seat the following year when [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s first administration lost the general election.<ref name=Howell>Howell, David (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35121 \"Morrison, Herbert Stanley, Baron Morrison of Lambeth (1888\u20131965)\"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' Oxford University Press; {{DOI|10.1093/ref:odnb/35121}}</ref>\n\nMorrison returned to Parliament in the 1929 general election, and MacDonald appointed him Minister of Transport. Morrison, like many others in the party, was deeply disheartened by MacDonald's national government, and he lost his seat again in 1931.\n\n===London===\nMorrison continued to sit on the London County Council and in 1933 was elected to lead the Labour Group. He wrote a book ''Socialisation and Transport : the Organisation of Socialised Industries with Particular Reference to the London Passenger Transport Bill'' which encapsulated his ideas on nationalisation. Managers would be appointed to run monopoly industries in the public interest. He did not, however, envisage democratic control by the workers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kynaston|first1=David|authorlink=David Kynaston|title=A World to Build|date=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=9780747585404|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldtobuild0000kyna/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/worldtobuild0000kyna/page/24}}</ref>  Unexpectedly, Labour won the 1934 LCC election and Morrison became Leader of the Council. This gave him control of almost all local government services in London. His main achievements here included the unification of bus, tram and trolleybus services with the Underground, by the creation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (colloquially known as London Transport) in 1933, and creating the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] around the suburbs. He confronted the Government over its refusal to finance the replacement of [[Waterloo Bridge]], and eventually they agreed to pay 60% of the cost of the new bridge.<ref name=Howell/>\n\nIn the 1935 election, Morrison was once again elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and immediately [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|challenged Attlee for the leadership]] of the party. He was defeated by a wide margin in the final ballot, a defeat ascribed to his unfamiliarity with the MPs who had served in the previous Parliament. Both he and his supporter Hugh Dalton put some of the blame on the Masonic [[New Welcome Lodge]], who, they claimed, backed the third-place leadership candidate [[Arthur Greenwood]] and then switched their votes to Attlee.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Masons' Candidate: New Welcome Lodge No. 5139 and the Parliamentary Labour Party|journal=Labour History Review|volume =71|issue=1|date=April 2006 |pages=9\u201341(33)|doi=10.1179/174581806X103862 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233637409_%27The_Masons%27_Candidate%27_New_Welcome_Lodge_No._5139_and_the_Parliamentary_Labour_Party|last1=Hamill|first1=John|last2=Prescott|first2=Andrew}} This cites as note number 2 H. Morrison, ''Herbert Morrison: An Autobiography by Lord Morrison of Lambeth'', London, Odhams, 1960, p. 164</ref>  After losing, Morrison concentrated on his LCC work. He convinced Labour to adopt the new electioneering techniques that opponents had been using, especially using advertising agencies in the 1937 local elections.<ref>Dominic Wring, \"\u201cSelling socialism\u201d-The marketing of the \u201cvery old\u201d British Labour Party.\" ''European Journal of Marketing'' 35#9/10 (2001): 1038-1046.

His biographers, [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Bernard Donoghue]] and [[George William Jones|George W.

Morrison's London experience in local government was particularly useful during [[the Blitz]], and the [[Air-raid shelter#Morrison shelter|Morrison shelter]] was named after him. He made radio appeals for more fire guards in December 1940 ('Britain shall not burn').<ref>audiobook titled ''The Blitz''</ref>\n\nMorrison had to take many potentially unpopular and controversial decisions by the nature of wartime circumstances. On 21 January 1941, he banned the [[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Daily Worker]] for opposing war with Germany and supporting the Soviet Union. The ban lasted for a total of 18 months before it was rescinded.\n\nThe arrival of black American troops caused concern in the government, leading Morrison, the Home Secretary, to comment \"I am fully conscious that a difficult social problem might be created if there were a substantial number of sex relations between white women and coloured troops and the procreation of half-caste children.\" That was in a memorandum for the cabinet in 1942.<ref>[http://www.nickelinthemachine.com/2011/05/marc-blitzstein-roland-hayes-and-the-negro-chorus-at-the-royal-albert-hall-in-1943/ Marc Blitzstein, Roland Hayes and the \u2018Negro Chorus\u2019 at the Royal Albert Hall in 1943]. nickelinthemachine.com.

He was the chief sponsor of the [[Festival of Britain]].\n\nMorrison supervised the major Labour programme of nationalising large sectors of industry. As Lord President chaired the Committee on the Socialization of Industries, he followed the model that was already in place of setting up public corporations, such as the [[BBC]] in broadcasting (1927). The owners of corporate stock were given government bonds, and the government took full ownership of each affected company, consolidating it into a national monopoly. The management remained the same, only now they became public servants working for the government. For the Labour Party leadership, nationalisation was a method to consolidate national planning in their own hands. It was not designed to modernise old industries, make them efficient, or transform their organisational structure.<ref>Sked, Alan and Cook, Chris (1979) ''Post-War Britain: A Political History''. {{ISBN|0140179127}}. pp 31\u201334</ref><ref>Beer, Samuel H.

Grady]] proposed \"The [[Morrison-Grady Plan]]\", intended to resolve the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]], calling for federalisation under overall British trusteeship. Ultimately, the plan was rejected by both [[Palestinians]] and [[Israelis]].\n\nAfter Ernest Bevin's resignation as Foreign Secretary, Morrison took over his role, but did not feel at ease in the Foreign Office. He took an aggressive stance against [[Iran]]'s nationalist Prime Minister [[Mohammed Mosaddeq]] and approved his overthrow.<ref>{{citation|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~simpson/Hist%20725%20Summer%202006/The%20US%20and%20Mossadegh%201951-1953.pdf |title=The United States, Great Britain, and Mossadegh |author=Painter, David S. |publisher=Georgetown University |isbn=1-56927-332-4 |year=1988 |accessdate=23 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117190807/http://userpages.umbc.edu/~simpson/Hist%20725%20Summer%202006/The%20US%20and%20Mossadegh%201951-1953.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> His tenure there was cut short by Labour's defeat in the 1951 general election, and he was appointed a [[Companion of Honour]] in November that year.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=39396 |date=30 November 1951 |page=6235 |supp=y}}</ref>\n\n===Festival of Britain===\n{{Main|Festival of Britain}}\n[[File:In16695.jpg|thumb|right|The 300-foot-tall [[Skylon (Festival of Britain)|Skylon]] at the [[Festival of Britain]], 1951]]\nMorrison lacked a deep concern for foreign affairs, but he was an enthusiastic leader of a major domestic project, the [[Festival of Britain]].  Starting in 1947, he was the prime mover of the 1951 fair. The original goal was to celebrate the centennial of the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]].<ref>Bernard Donoughue, and G. W. Jones, ''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician'' (1973), pp 492-95.</ref>   However, the plans were changed. It was not to be another [[World Fair]], and international themes were absent; even the Commonwealth was ignored. Instead, the Festival focused entirely on Britain and its achievements; it was funded chiefly by the government, with a budget of \u00a312-million. The Conservatives gave little support. The Labour government was losing support, and the implicit goal of the festival was to give the people a feeling of successful recovery from the war's devastation, as well as promoting British science, technology, industrial design, architecture and the arts.<ref>F.M. Leventhal, \"'A Tonic to the Nation': The Festival of Britain, 1951.\" Albion 27#3 (1995): 445-453.</ref> Historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]] says the Festival was a \"triumphant success\" as thousands:\n:flocked to the South Bank site, to wander around the [[Dome of Discovery]], gaze at the [[Skylon (Festival of Britain)|Skylon]], and generally enjoy a festival of national celebration. Up and down the land, lesser festivals enlisted much civic and voluntary enthusiasm. A people curbed by years of total war and half-crushed by austerity and gloom, showed that it had not lost the capacity for enjoying itself....Above all, the Festival made a spectacular setting as a showpiece for the inventiveness and genius of British scientists and technologists.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth O.

Attlee remained as Leader through the early 1950s and fought the 1955 election, finally announcing his retirement after Labour's defeat. Morrison was then 67, and was seen to be too old to embark on a new leadership role. During the leadership election, he was the interim [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]]. Although he stood, he finished last, by a wide margin, of the three candidates, with many of his supporters switching to [[Hugh Gaitskell]]. Gaitskell won the election, and Morrison resigned as Deputy Leader.\n\nDuring the [[Suez Crisis]], Morrison advocated unilateral action by the United Kingdom against Egypt, following Colonel Nasser's seizure of the Suez Canal. Morrison stood down at the 1959 general election and was made a [[life peer]] as Baron Morrison of [[Lambeth]] in the [[County of London]] on 2 November 1959.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=41860 |date=3 November 1959 |page=6942 |nolink=y}}</ref> He was appointed President of the [[British Board of Film Censors]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nWhile working in a market garden in [[Letchworth]] during World War One, Morrison met his first wife, Margaret Kent (1896\u20131953), a secretary and daughter of a railway clerk. The couple married on 15 March 1919. His total involvement in politics, however, meant that theirs was not a happy marriage; his later autobiography made no mention of Kent or their daughter, Mary.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\nFollowing Kent's death in July 1953, Morrison married Edith Meadowcroft (''b''. ''c''.1908), a businesswoman of Conservative politics. The pair married on 6 January 1955 and their relationship appeared much more successful.<ref name=\"Howell\" />\n\nMorrison's grandson [[Peter Mandelson]] was a cabinet minister in the Labour governments of [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]].\n\n==Death==\n\nHe died on 6 March 1965, coincidentally in the same month as the London County Council was abolished.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\n==TV portrayal==\n\nMorrison was Foreign Secretary at the time of the defection of the double agents [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]].
