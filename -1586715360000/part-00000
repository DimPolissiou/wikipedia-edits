{"title_page": "List of rulers of Croatia", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\nThis is a complete '''list of rulers of Croatia''' under domestic ethnic and elected dynasties during the [[Croatian Kingdom (disambiguation)|Croatian Kingdom]] (925\u20131918). This article follows the monarch's title number according to Hungarian succession for convenience. For example, the Hungarian monarch B\u00e9la IV is according to Croatian succession correctly titled B\u00e9la III. This is because Hungarians had a king named B\u00e9la prior to the incorporation of Croatia under the Hungarian Crown but the Croats did not.\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|Origin hypotheses of the Croats}}The details of the arrival of the [[Croats]] are scarcely documented. Around 626, Croats migrated from [[White Croatia]] (around what is now [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]) at the invitation of [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]]. According to a legend recorded in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', the Croats came to their present region under the leadership of five brothers called Kloukas, Lobelos, Kosentzis, Mouchlo, Chrobatos and two sisters called Touga and Bouga.\n\nIt is theorized that one of the brothers called Chrobatos (''Hrvat'') gave the name for Croats (''Hrvati'') as a whole, although mainstream historians dismiss this as not verifiable. The Croats started gradually converting to Christianity under the rule of [[Porga of Croatia|Porga]] in the 7th century.\n\n== Dukes of Pannonia (8th century\u2013896) ==\n{{see also|Duchy of Pannonian Croatia}}\n\nAlso called Pannonian Croatia in Croatian historiography. Croatian sources claim it was a Croatian duchy while others claim it was an unspecified Slavic duchy with its inhabitants called simply \"Slavs\" (lat. ''Sclavi'').\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"  width=100%\n! width=5%  | Portrait\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=10% | Reign start \n! width=10% | Reign end\n! width=25% | Notes\n|-\n|  ||'''[[Vojnomir of Pannonian Croatia|Vojnomir]]'''|| c. 791 || c. 810 ||\n|-\n| ||'''[[Ljudevit]]'''||{{Circa|810}}|| c. 823 ||align=\"left\"|\n|-\n|  ||'''[[Ratimir, Duke of Lower Pannonia|Ratimir]]'''|| 829 || 838 ||\n|-\n|  ||'''[[Braslav, Duke of Lower Pannonia|Braslav]]'''|| 880 || c. 896 || \n|- \n|}\n\n== Dukes of Dalmatian Croatia (7th century\u2013925) ==\n{{see also|Duchy of Croatia}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100%\n! width=5%  | Portrait\n! width=15% | Name\n! width=10% | Reign start \n! width=10% | Reign end\n! width=25% | Notes\n|-\n|  ||'''[[Vi\u0161eslav of Croatia|Vi\u0161eslav]]'''|| c. 785 || c. 802 || align=\"left\" |Vi\u0161eslav left behind a [[baptismal font]], surviving to this day, which mentioned him being a duke (although duke of an unspecified region).

This article follows the monarch's title number according to Hungarian succession for convenience. For example, the Hungarian monarch B\u00e9la IV is according to Croatian succession correctly titled B\u00e9la III. This is because Hungarians had a king named B\u00e9la prior to the incorporation of Croatia under the Hungarian Crown but the Croats did not.\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|Origin hypotheses of the Croats}}The details of the arrival of the [[Croats]] are scarcely documented. Around 626, Croats migrated from [[White Croatia]] (around what is now [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]) at the invitation of [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]]. According to a legend recorded in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', the Croats came to their present region under the leadership of five brothers called Kloukas, Lobelos, Kosentzis, Mouchlo, Chrobatos and two sisters called Touga and Bouga.\n\nIt is theorized that one of the brothers called Chrobatos (''Hrvat'') gave the name for Croats (''Hrvati'') as a whole, although mainstream historians dismiss this as not verifiable. The Croats started gradually converting to Christianity under the rule of [[Porga of Croatia|Porga]] in the 7th century.\n\n== Dukes of Pannonia (8th century\u2013896) ==\n{{see also|Duchy of Pannonian Croatia}}\n\nAlso called Pannonian Croatia in Croatian historiography. Croatian sources claim it was a Croatian duchy while others claim it was an unspecified Slavic duchy with its inhabitants called simply \"Slavs\" (lat.
