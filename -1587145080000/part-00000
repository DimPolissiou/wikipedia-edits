They have been allowed to play in the qualifying rounds of the [[Scottish Cup]] since 1978 and have qualified for the cup proper on several occasions.\n\nSpartans entered their top amateur side into the [[Scottish Junior Football Association|SJFA East Region junior]] setup in 2009, however they withdrew in 2013.

The stadium has a capacity of 3,000 (504 seated). Ainslie Park is only part of the new project that Spartans have invested into their new ground. It is part of a wider development of the Spartans Community Football Academy. The new facility incorporates a fully enclosed stadium which meets [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] and [[Scottish Football League|SFL]] criteria, with an artificial pitch, floodlights, seating for 504 spectators and an overall capacity of 3,000. Another full size, floodlit artificial pitch sits adjacent to the main playing area and the accommodation incorporates six changing rooms, a club room, committee room and a physio room. The Club ground holds a P.A system and a bar for spectators.\n\nIn March 2017, [[Edinburgh City F.C.|Edinburgh City]] reached an agreement with Spartans to use Ainslie Park ground for three seasons while [[Meadowbank Stadium]] is being redeveloped.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/edinburgh-city/edinburgh-city-and-spartans-confirm-three-season-groundshare-1-4407011 |title=Edinburgh City and Spartans confirm three-season groundshare |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher= |first=Ross |last=Pilcher |date=29 March 2017 |accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Senior squad==\nAs of 26 February 2020<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spartansfc.com/squad/|title=Lowland League Squad  {{!}} The Spartans FC Official Website \u2013 Live together.

[n 1813 he is burnt alive, in 1819 rescued by his wife.]\n\n''Night the Second''\n\nIn 'Glen-Avin', the ninth bard, Farquhar of Spey, sings of a sage who dies defying the Spirit of the Storm in the Cairngorms.\n\nIn 'Old David', the tenth bard, from Hogg's Ettrick, sings of the rescue by David and his seven sons of the beloved of one of them from a cave where she is imprisoned by marauders taken to be fairies.\n\nThe eleventh bard, from Lomond, sings 'The Spectre's Cradle-Song' and 'Macgregor', the latter telling of the eponymous warrior's abduction by a mysterious fatal woman.\n\nIn 'Earl Walter', the twelfth bard, from Clyde, sings of Walter Hamilton's defeating Lord Darcie in single combat before the king.\n\nIn  'Kilmeny', the thirteenth bard, Drummond of Ern, sings of a young woman who is taken to 'the land of thochte' and returns for a period to impart 'wordis of wonder, and wordis of truthe'.\n\n''Night the Third''\n\nIn 'Mary Scott', the fourteenth bard, from the Borders, sings of how Lord Pringle of Torwoodlee disguises himself as an abbot to visit his beloved Mary, daughter of his rival Tushilaw. When their liaison is discovered, her mother poisons her, but after his forces have triumphed Lord Pringle restores her to life with a kiss, they marry, and peace prevails.\n\nIn 'King Edward's Dream', the fifteenth bard, from Lammermoor, sings of the dying Edward I's vision of a future free Scotland entering into a voluntary union with England.\n\nIn 'Drumlanrig', the sixteenth bard, from Nithsdale, sings of the defeat of the Earl of Lennox's invading force by James Douglas of Drumlanrig. Douglas is encouraged by May Morison, who had been abducted by the English and whose brother falls in the conflict, and at the end he takes her as his bride.\n\nIn 'The Abbot M'Kinnon', the seventeenth bard, from the Hebrides, sings of the sinking of the Abbot of Iona's ship in retribution for his liaison with Matilda of Skye in male disguise.\n\n''Conclusion''\n\nAfter a passionate debate between the factions at Court, Queen Mary's harp is awarded to Gardyn. The Ettrick bard is happy to receive a less elaborate instrument, which will eventually be inherited by Hogg.\n\n==Reception==\nThe first edition of ''The Queen's Wake'' was enthusiastically received by almost all of the reviewers as a triumph by a self-taught genius.
