Further versions were also released for the [[Game.com]] and [[R-Zone]]. It features a similar basic gameplay system and the same story as ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'', but adds characters and stages restored from ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]''. New additions to the game included the \"Aggressor\" bar, and a new finishing move called [[Brutality (Mortal Kombat)|Brutality]], a long combination of attacks that ends with the opponent exploding. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{further|Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3}}\n[[File:Mkt fight.png|thumb|left|[[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] from ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|MK]]'' battles the ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' version of [[Johnny Cage]] in ''[[Mortal Kombat II|MK II]]'''s armory stage. The [[Head-up display (video gaming)|HUD]] is the same as from ''[[Mortal Kombat 3|MK3]]''/''UMK3'', while the Aggressor bar is exclusive to ''MKT''.\n]]\n\n''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' introduces the Aggressor bar, which fills as the combatants fight (twice as much if the opponent is blocking). Once the bar is filled, it grants the character fast movement and greater attack damage for a short period of time.\n\nMany characters gained additional special moves. Some were simple edits of existing moves (such as Stryker throwing two grenades instead of one), while others were unused animations never implemented in their intended previous games. These special moves included ''MK'' [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]]'s Knife Spin move, ''MKII'' [[Kung Lao]]'s Air Torpedo, [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]]'s Spinning Punch move, [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]'s Lightning that shoots from behind the opponent, and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]]'s Blade Spin move. Additionally, [[Shao Kahn]] gained a throw and grab-and-punch move, and [[Motaro]] gained a proper throw move. [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]'s famous \"Spine Rip\" Fatality reappears in the game but is completely censored, as the screen blacks out with only the \"Fatality\" text visible. This was due to avoid having to re-animate the fatality for this game.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Trilogy'' adds the \"Brutality\" finishing move, which requires the player to perform an 11-button combo in order to rapidly beat on their opponent until they explode. (Brutalities have been previously featured in the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] ports of ''UMK3''.) All of the arenas that featured a [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Stage Fatality|Stage Fatality]] are featured in this game, except the Pit II.\n\nAll of the battle arenas that were featured in ''MKII'', ''MK3'', and ''UMK3'' are available in ''MKT'', but only four backgrounds from the original ''Mortal Kombat'' were featured (Courtyard, Goro's Lair, the Pit, and the Pit Bottom). The [[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[Sega Saturn]] versions lack The Hidden Portal and Noob's Dorfen stages from ''MK3'', while the [[Nintendo 64]] version lacks Kahn's Arena and the Bank from ''MKII'' and ''MK3'', respectively. {{clear left}}\n\n== Characters ==\n[[File:Mkt select.png|thumb|left|Character select screen from the CD versions of the game]]\n\nAlong with the ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' roster, ''Trilogy'' adds [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] exactly as they appeared in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', with added running animations especially created for ''MK Trilogy''. [[Johnny Cage]] was also added to the roster, this time portrayed by Chris Alexander (replacing [[Daniel Pesina]], who was legally at odds with Midway). He kept his moves from ''MKII'' except for the Split Punch, which was excluded since none of the characters from ''MK3''/''UMK3'' had graphics for getting hit in the groin. [[Boss (video gaming)|Bosses]] [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]], [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat character)|Kintaro]], [[Motaro]] and [[Shao Kahn]] are also [[Player character|playable]] characters from the start (except for the Nintendo 64 version, where only Motaro and Shao Kahn are included and must be unlocked via a cheat menu).<ref name=EGM90>{{cite magazine |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy: Special Comparison Feature |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=90|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1997|pages=158-161}}</ref> The PC, PlayStation and Saturn versions also contain alternate versions of [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]], [[Kung Lao]], [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] and Raiden as they appeared in the first two titles. Contrarily to ''MKII'' Raiden and Baraka, these versions of the characters did not get proper running animations and just feature a sped-up version of their walk animation when they try to run.\n\nTwo new [[secret character (video games)|secret characters]] appear as well, depending on the version of the game. Most versions have [[Chameleon (Mortal Kombat)|Chameleon]], a semi-transparent ninja who rapidly switches between all the other male ninjas (Classic Sub-Zero, Scorpion, [[Noob Saibot]], Human [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]], [[Rain (Mortal Kombat)|Rain]], [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]], and [[Ermac]]) during combat. This character is playable by performing a special button combination. The Nintendo 64 version replaced him with a female character named Khameleon, who switches between the female ninjas instead (Kitana, Mileena, and Jade). {{clear left}}\n\n== Development ==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=When {{sic|we going}} to release ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3|Ultimate MK3]]'' on consoles, it seemed odd to release it on the [[PlayStation (console)|Playstation]] without doing something \"special\" for it. Since the PS1 had so much space (CD drive) we decided to include the ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|MK1]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat II|MK2]]'' assets and call it ''MK Trilogy''. Actually we were busy working on the arcade games and our San Diego team was doing the ports and ''MK Trilogy''.

Initially publisher Williams Entertainment stated that Johnny Cage would not be included in the game at all due to the dispute with Pesina.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Williams Prepares for a New Era! |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=85|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1996 |pages=52-55}}</ref> Carlos Pesina's original sprites were used for Raiden's gameplay, but Sal Divita's image was used for his versus screen picture.\n\nMost of the background music tracks from ''MKII'' and ''MK3'' remained intact, especially for the [[CD-ROM]] versions of the game. In all versions of the game, many of the tracks do not match their respective arenas when compared to their original arcade counterparts. In all versions of ''MKT'', none of the music from the original ''Mortal Kombat'' game is used. All of the CD-ROM games read the background music directly from the CD, providing high-quality CD sound, but all of the music loops are used when \"Finish Him/Her\" appears. All of the music taken from ''MK3'' on the CD-ROM ''MKT'' games is noticeably slowed down in both speed and pitch. When these particular songs were converted to ''MKT''' Red Book [[CD-DA]] quality, they were downsampled without resampling them to maintain the original tempo and pitch in the PC, PlayStation, and Saturn versions.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== PlayStation ===\nThis version was developed by [[Avalanche Software]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996 |page=41}}</ref> There are at least three public revisions of this game for the PlayStation; the final version is the North American Greatest Hits and European Platinum edition. With each revision, aspects of the gameplay were refined, producing gameplay closer to that of ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' for the arcade. Many of the infinite combos and bugs found in the game only existed in earlier revisions.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=MKT Bugs Fixed |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997 |page=118|quote=Midway has since - without much fanfare - put out a newer version of MKT for the PS, apparently sans glitches.}}</ref> Shang Tsung never appears anywhere within the \"Choose Your Destiny\" towers, probably because of the loading delays when morphing in the PlayStation version (there are options to completely turn off morphs and letting the system load two additional characters into memory when playing as Shang Tsung, eliminating the long loading delays when morphing in ''MK3''); the only time the CPU ever controls Tsung is during the attract mode. \n\nAfter beating the PlayStation version of the game, the final message in the credits says \"''[[Mortal Kombat 4|MK4]]'' coming in 1997\". The PlayStation version of the game exhibits a number of bugs when played on a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 game console, which causes the game to become unplayable.\n\n=== Nintendo 64 ===\nThe [[Nintendo 64]] port is based on the Windows PC and PlayStation versions of ''Mortal Kombat 3'' and the Sega Saturn version of ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3''. This edition includes 3-on-3 simultaneous battles as an exclusive feature.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy: All the Kombat You'll Ever Need |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996|pages=246-7}}</ref> In this version, like in the arcade, the player begins the game with four credits, but after playing a two-player match, the player earns an extra credit, while in the CD-ROM versions anyone can play for free. Free Play must be unlocked on the N64 version, which also has a more cohesive \"Supreme Demonstration\" feature (which shows every Fatality, Babality, Friendship, Animality, and Brutality for every character) than the PS or Saturn versions (as the latter versions needed to load the Fatalities and thus cannot show every one in the allotted time). This version only uses music from ''MK3'' and it is played through the system's internal synth, resulting in considerably lower quality than the CD versions. However, all ending tunes and music loops used during the \"Finish Him/Her\" sequences are intact, unlike in the CD-ROM versions.\n\nDue to cartridge limitations, only 30 characters are included, instead of the 37 featured in the other console versions. The N64 port lacks Goro and Kintaro; the classic versions of Jax, Kung Lao, Kano, and Raiden; as well as the unmasked Sub-Zero (however, the masked Sub-Zero can perform both Sub-Zeros' special moves).<ref name=EGM90/> Chameleon is replaced with the secret character Khameleon, a grey female ninja that randomly switches between Kitana, Mileena and Jade.<ref name=EGM90/> The N64 version of the game, like ''MK3'' and ''UMK3'', provides the player with an \"Ultimate Kombat Kode\" screen after a single-player game is over, where a 6-digit code can be entered to unlock Human Smoke and Khameleon for normal play.\n\nThe N64 game also includes a new stage, the Star Bridge, made of the Pit II's background with a star-filled sky. Some older backgrounds are also enhanced with extra graphics and added animation. For example, the Pit I features two different sky backgrounds (a pitch-black, star-filled sky in the N64 version, and the same sky background as the Pit II in the CD-ROM versions); Kahn's Kave has animated clouds and a glowing floor added to it; and the Lost Bridge has [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Hornbuckle]] and [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Blaze]] appear at random in the background. In the N64 version, the Graveyard stage has more names on the gravestones near the front: besides those of the original Midway design team for ''MK3'', names of the team at Williams Entertainment were added, and the date of death on the stones was changed to the creators' birthdates.\n\nIn this version, there are two secret menus, because not all the playable characters are unlocked from the start. Motaro and Shao Kahn can each perform a Fatality exclusive to this port. They also have an aggressor meter, unlike in other versions.<ref name=EGM90/> In the Subway's stage fatality, new animations were added for the characters. [[Nightwolf]] has a very different Friendship move exclusive to this version, which he pulls out 3 hatchets and begins to juggle, as opposed to turning into Raiden since this character became playable in this game (although in the other versions, Nightwolf retains his original ''MK3'' Friendship move). In addition, many frames of animation were cut from each character.<ref name=EGM90/>\n\n=== Sega Saturn ===\nThe [[Sega Saturn]] version, converted by Point of View and released almost a year after the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions, is a straight conversion of the PlayStation version without any substantial changes in content. Due to hardware differences and inadequate code adapting, the porting process from the PlayStation had some technical changes, which included the replacement of almost all transparency effects with mesh patterns and the loss of certain voice samples, like most fighters' running yells and some alternative phrases used by characters like Raiden and Scorpion in their attacks.\n\n=== PC ===\nThe PC version is a direct port of the PlayStation version, developed by Point of View and released almost at the same time as the Sega Saturn port. This port is identical to the PlayStation version, lacking the extra load times and providing some minor cosmetic differences in the game introduction. There were at least two public revisions of this game for the PC, and the final version (indicated by the word \"final\" next to the version number in the about dialog box) has gameplay identical to the Greatest Hits release on PlayStation.\n\n=== Game.com ===\nThe game was a launch release for the [[Game.com]] handheld console. The game includes a multiplayer mode, accessible only with the compete.com game link cable (to link two Game.com consoles together). Only 13 characters (Cyrax, Ermac, Jade, Mileena, Sektor, Kitana, Motaro, Nightwolf, Noob Saibot, Raiden, Reptile and Shao Kahn) and 10 Kombat Zones remain in this version (screenshots of early releases showed a different assortment of characters). In addition, each character only has two special moves and four finishing moves: one Fatality, Babality, Friendship, and Brutality. In this version, each finishing move has the same command for every character.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = PS: 67%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/ps/197997-mortal-kombat-trilogy/index.html |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy for PlayStation |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><br />N64: 52%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/n64/197996-mortal-kombat-trilogy/index.html |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy for Nintendo 64 |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n| EGM = N64: 8.125/10<ref name=EGM89>{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: MK Trilogy |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=89|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 1996 |page=85}}</ref>\n| GI = SSAT: 8.75/10<ref name=GISat>{{cite magazine|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/aug97/mortal.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971021120233/http://www.gameinformer.com/aug97/mortal.html |archivedate=October 21, 1997|date=August 1997 |magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref>\n| GSpot = N64: 5.8/10<ref name=GS64>{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Gerstmann|authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review/1900-2544832/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=December 4, 1996 |accessdate=January 17, 2018}}</ref><br />PS: 8.6/10<ref>{{cite web |first=Hugh|last=Sterbakov|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-trilogy/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review-2548427/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=GameSpot |date=1996-12-01 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><br />SSAT: 6.0/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-trilogy/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review-2533994/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=GameSpot |date=1997-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n| IGN = N64: 4.1/10<ref name=\"IGN64r\">{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Peer|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/21/mortal-kombat-trilogy-2|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=17 January 2018|date=November 20, 1996}}</ref><br />PS: 6.0/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1996/12/20/mortal-kombat-trilogy |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=December 19, 1996 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Digital Press''\n| rev1Score = N64: 8/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Paprocki|first=Matt|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy |url=http://www.digitpress.com/reviews/mktilogy_n64.htm|website=Digital Press|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=October 24, 2005}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''Super Power''\n| rev2Score = N64: 91%<ref name=\"SP\"/>\n| rev3 = ''Player One''\n| rev3Score = N64: 70<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Player+One/playerone_numero078/Player+One+n%25B078+(Septembre+1997)+-+Page+069.jpg|title=Player One 078|website=download.abandonware.org}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''SuperGamePower''\n| rev4Score = SSAT: 5/5<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SuperGamePower_Ano_03_No._042_1997-09_Nova_Cultural_BR_pt|title=SuperGamePower - Ano 03 No. 042 (1997-09)(Nova Cultural)(BR)(pt)|date=1 September 1997|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><br />N64: 4.8/5<ref name=\"MKTSGP\"/>\n| rev5 = ''CD Consoles''\n| rev5Score = PS: {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=101&num=7224&album=oui|title=CD Consoles 101|website=www.abandonware-magazines.org}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev6Score = SSAT: 88%<ref name=SSM22>{{cite magazine|last=Yeo |first=Matt |title=Review: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=26|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=December 1997|pages=68-71}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe game's critical reception has varied considerably, depending on the platform and publication.

He said the Nintendo 64 version is a faithful conversion of the arcade games, though he compared it unfavorably to the PlayStation version. However, he held that the arcade games themselves are too aged to merit an appearance on the Nintendo 64, referring to them as five years old (in actuality, ''Mortal Kombat 3'' was barely a year old at the time, and even the oldest in the series was four years old).<ref name=\"IGN64r\"/> ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' was said to be a \"particularly horrible game\" among the Nintendo 64 library by ''[[Forbes]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Noer |title=Blood on the Snow |url=https://www.forbes.com/1997/09/19/col.html |date=1997-09-19 |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=2010-03-13 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123081745/http://www.forbes.com/1997/09/19/col.html |archivedate=2013-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but was honored in [[Nintendo Power Awards]] '96, coming second in the category \"Best Tournament Fighting Game\".<ref>''[[Nintendo Power]]'' #96 (May 1997)</ref>\n\nReviewing the PlayStation version, Major Mike criticized the overly difficult opponent AI and the unbalanced nature of the playable boss characters, and said the music tracks \"sound like a [[45 record]] played at 33 [[RPM]].\" He nonetheless concluded it to be \"a must for any fighting gamer's library\", due to the responsive controls and large amount of content.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=PlayStation ProReview: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=100|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1997 |page=84}}</ref> Though ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' never reviewed the PlayStation version of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'', they ran a four-page feature comparing it to the Nintendo 64 version. Shawn Smith picked the Nintendo 64 version as the one to buy, saying that the major bugs in the PlayStation version outweigh the Nintendo 64 version's various shortcomings. The other three members of the review team all voted for the PlayStation version, particularly citing the additional characters and the lower price ($49.99 as compared to $69.99 for the Nintendo 64 version).<ref name=EGM90/> They later named both versions runner-up for Fighting Game of the Year, behind ''[[Tekken 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\nThe Saturn version arrived nearly a year (over a year in some countries) after the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions and received comparatively little attention. ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' said the long wait for the conversion was baffling, since the game's 2D visuals fall within the Saturn's specialty and no new content had been created for the Saturn version, and damaging, since superior 2D Saturn fighters had since come out and home versions of ''Mortal Kombat 4'' were on the horizon, making ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' both graphically and stylistically outdated.<ref name=SSM22/> ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', ''[[Game Informer]]'', and ''GamePro'' all concluded it to be a must-have for ''Mortal Kombat'' fans due to its comprehensive content and features, but advised non-fans to look to other fighting games on the Saturn, and described it as virtually identical to the PlayStation version.<ref name=GISat/><ref name=SSM22/><ref>{{cite magazine |author=Art Angel |title=Saturn ProReview: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=108 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=September 1997|page=98}}</ref>\n\nReleased at a time when the Nintendo 64's popularity was burgeoning and there were few competing games for the system, the Nintendo 64 version of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' saw impressive sales figures.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Who Won the Videogame Wars of 1996? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=16-19}}</ref> According to a later IGN retrospective, ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' \"offered something no fan could ignore: It brought every character from the series into the fold, along with most of the levels, making for one massive game that had enough to please everyone.

Further versions were also released for the [[Game.com]] and [[R-Zone]]. It features a similar basic gameplay system and the same story as ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'', but adds characters and stages restored from ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]''. New additions to the game included the \"Aggressor\" bar, and a new finishing move called [[Brutality (Mortal Kombat)|Brutality]], a long combination of attacks that ends with the opponent exploding. The game was met with mixed reviews upon release.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{further|Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3}}\n[[File:Mkt fight.png|thumb|left|[[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] from ''[[Mortal Kombat (1992 video game)|MK]]'' battles the ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' version of [[Johnny Cage]] in ''[[Mortal Kombat II|MK II]]'''s armory stage. The [[Head-up display (video gaming)|HUD]] is the same as from ''[[Mortal Kombat 3|MK3]]''/''UMK3'', while the Aggressor bar is exclusive to ''MKT''.\n]]\n\n''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' introduces the Aggressor bar, which fills as the combatants fight (twice as much if the opponent is blocking). Once the bar is filled, it grants the character fast movement and greater attack damage for a short period of time.\n\nMany characters gained additional special moves. Some were simple edits of existing moves (such as Stryker throwing two grenades instead of one), while others were unused animations never implemented in their intended previous games. These special moves included ''MK'' [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]]'s Knife Spin move, ''MKII'' [[Kung Lao]]'s Air Torpedo, [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]]'s Spinning Punch move, [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]]'s Lightning that shoots from behind the opponent, and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]]'s Blade Spin move. Additionally, [[Shao Kahn]] gained a throw and grab-and-punch move, and [[Motaro]] gained a proper throw move. [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]]'s famous \"Spine Rip\" Fatality reappears in the game but is completely censored, as the screen blacks out with only the \"Fatality\" text visible. This was due to avoid having to re-animate the fatality for this game.{{fact|date=July 2019}}\n\n''Trilogy'' adds the \"Brutality\" finishing move, which requires the player to perform an 11-button combo in order to rapidly beat on their opponent until they explode. (Brutalities have been previously featured in the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] ports of ''UMK3''.) All of the arenas that featured a [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)#Stage Fatality|Stage Fatality]] are featured in this game, except the Pit II.\n\nAll of the battle arenas that were featured in ''MKII'', ''MK3'', and ''UMK3'' are available in ''MKT'', but only four backgrounds from the original ''Mortal Kombat'' were featured (Courtyard, Goro's Lair, the Pit, and the Pit Bottom). The [[Personal computer|PC]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], and [[Sega Saturn]] versions lack The Hidden Portal and Noob's Dorfen stages from ''MK3'', while the [[Nintendo 64]] version lacks Kahn's Arena and the Bank from ''MKII'' and ''MK3'', respectively. {{clear left}}\n\n== Characters ==\n[[File:Mkt select.png|thumb|left|Character select screen from the CD versions of the game]]\n\nAlong with the ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' roster, ''Trilogy'' adds [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] exactly as they appeared in ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', with added running animations especially created for ''MK Trilogy''. [[Johnny Cage]] was also added to the roster, this time portrayed by Chris Alexander (replacing [[Daniel Pesina]], who was legally at odds with Midway). He kept his moves from ''MKII'' except for the Split Punch, which was excluded since none of the characters from ''MK3''/''UMK3'' had graphics for getting hit in the groin. [[Boss (video gaming)|Bosses]] [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]], [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat character)|Kintaro]], [[Motaro]] and [[Shao Kahn]] are also [[Player character|playable]] characters from the start (except for the Nintendo 64 version where only Motaro and Shao Kahn are included and must be unlocked via a cheat menu).<ref name=EGM90>{{cite magazine |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy: Special Comparison Feature |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=90|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1997|pages=158-161}}</ref> The PC, PlayStation and Saturn versions also contain alternate versions of [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]], [[Kung Lao]], [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] and Raiden as they appeared in the first two titles. Contrarily to ''MKII'' Raiden and Baraka, these versions of the characters did not get proper running animations and just feature a sped-up version of their walk animation when they try to run.\n\nTwo new [[secret character (video games)|secret characters]] appear as well, depending on the version of the game. Most versions have [[Chameleon (Mortal Kombat)|Chameleon]], a semi-transparent ninja who rapidly switches between all the other male ninjas (Classic Sub-Zero, Scorpion, [[Noob Saibot]], Human [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Smoke]], [[Rain (Mortal Kombat)|Rain]], [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]], and [[Ermac]]) during combat. This character is playable by performing a special button combination. The Nintendo 64 version replaced him with a female character named Khameleon, who switches between the other female ninjas instead (Kitana, Mileena, and Jade). {{clear left}}\n\n== Development ==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=When {{sic|we going}} to release ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3|Ultimate MK3]]'' on consoles, it seemed odd to release it on the [[PlayStation (console)|Playstation]] without doing something \"special\" for it.

Actually we were busy working on the arcade games and our San Diego team was doing the ports and ''MK Trilogy''.

Initially publisher Williams Entertainment stated that Johnny Cage would not be included in the game at all due to the dispute with Pesina.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Williams Prepares for a New Era! |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=85|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=August 1996 |pages=52-55}}</ref> Carlos Pesina's original sprites were used for Raiden's gameplay, but Sal Divita's image was used for his versus screen picture.\n\nMost of the background music tracks from ''MKII'' and ''MK3'' remained intact, especially for the [[CD-ROM]] versions of the game. In all versions of the game, many of the tracks do not match their respective arenas when compared to their original arcade counterparts. In all versions of ''MKT'', none of the music from the original ''Mortal Kombat'' game is used. All of the CD-ROM games read the background music directly from the CD, providing high-quality CD sound, but all of the music loops are used when \"Finish Him/Her\" appears. All of the music taken from ''MK3'' on the CD-ROM ''MKT'' games is noticeably slowed down in both speed and pitch. When these particular songs were converted to ''MKT''' Red Book [[CD-DA]] quality, they were downsampled without resampling them to maintain the original tempo and pitch in the PC, PlayStation, and Saturn versions.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== PlayStation ===\nThis version was developed by [[Avalanche Software]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1996 |page=41}}</ref> There are at least three public revisions of this game for the PlayStation; the final version is the North American Greatest Hits and European Platinum edition. With each revision, aspects of the gameplay were refined, producing gameplay closer to that of ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' for the arcade. Many of the infinite combos and bugs found in the game only existed in earlier revisions.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=MKT Bugs Fixed |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997 |page=118|quote=Midway has since - without much fanfare - put out a newer version of MKT for the PS, apparently sans glitches.}}</ref> Shang Tsung never appears anywhere within the \"Choose Your Destiny\" towers, probably because of the loading delays when morphing in the PlayStation version (there are options to completely turn off morphs and letting the system load two additional characters into memory when playing as Shang Tsung, eliminating the long loading delays when morphing in ''MK3''); the only time the CPU ever controls Tsung is during the attract mode. \n\nAfter beating the PlayStation version of the game, the final message in the credits says \"''[[Mortal Kombat 4|MK4]]'' coming in 1997\". The PlayStation version of the game exhibits a number of bugs when played on a PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3 game console, which causes the game to become unplayable.\n\n=== Nintendo 64 ===\nThe [[Nintendo 64]] port is based on the Windows PC and PlayStation versions of ''Mortal Kombat 3'' and the Sega Saturn version of ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3''. This edition includes 3-on-3 simultaneous battles as an exclusive feature.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy: All the Kombat You'll Ever Need |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=November 1996|pages=246-7}}</ref> In this version, like in the arcade, the player begins the game with four credits, but after playing a two-player match, the player earns an extra credit, while in the CD-ROM versions anyone can play for free. Free Play must be unlocked on the N64 version, which also has a more cohesive \"Supreme Demonstration\" feature (which shows every Fatality, Babality, Friendship, Animality, and Brutality for every character) than the PS or Saturn versions (as the latter versions needed to load the Fatalities and thus cannot show every one in the allotted time). This version only uses music from ''MK3'' and it is played through the system's internal synth, resulting in considerably lower quality than the CD versions. However, all ending tunes and music loops used during the \"Finish Him/Her\" sequences are intact, unlike in the CD-ROM versions.\n\nDue to cartridge limitations, only 30 characters are included, instead of the 37 featured in the other console versions. The N64 port lacks Goro and Kintaro; the classic versions of Jax, Kung Lao, Kano, and Raiden; as well as the unmasked Sub-Zero (however, the masked Sub-Zero can perform both Sub-Zeros' special moves).<ref name=EGM90/> Chameleon is replaced with the secret character Khameleon, a grey female ninja that randomly switches between Kitana, Mileena and Jade.<ref name=EGM90/> The N64 version of the game, like ''MK3'' and ''UMK3'', provides the player with an \"Ultimate Kombat Kode\" screen after a single-player game is over, where a 6-digit code can be entered to unlock Human Smoke and Khameleon for normal play.\n\nThe N64 game also includes a new stage, the Star Bridge, made of the Pit II's background with a star-filled sky. Some older backgrounds are also enhanced with extra graphics and added animation. For example, the Pit I features two different sky backgrounds (a pitch-black, star-filled sky in the N64 version, and the same sky background as the Pit II in the CD-ROM versions); Kahn's Kave has animated clouds and a glowing floor added to it; and the Lost Bridge has [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Hornbuckle]] and [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Blaze]] appear at random in the background. In the N64 version, the Graveyard stage has more names on the gravestones near the front: besides those of the original Midway design team for ''MK3'', names of the team at Williams Entertainment were added, and the date of death on the stones was changed to the creators' birthdates.\n\nIn this version, there are two secret menus, because not all the playable characters are unlocked from the start. Motaro and Shao Kahn can each perform a Fatality exclusive to this port. They also have an aggressor meter, unlike in other versions.<ref name=EGM90/> In the Subway's stage fatality, new animations were added for the characters. [[Nightwolf]] has a very different Friendship move exclusive to this version, which he pulls out 3 hatchets and begins to juggle, as opposed to turning into Raiden since this character became playable in this game (although in the other versions, Nightwolf retains his original ''MK3'' Friendship move). In addition, many frames of animation were cut from each character.<ref name=EGM90/>\n\n=== Sega Saturn ===\nThe [[Sega Saturn]] version, converted by Point of View and released almost a year after the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions, is a straight conversion of the PlayStation version without any substantial changes in content. Due to hardware differences and inadequate code adapting, the porting process from the PlayStation had some technical changes, which included the replacement of almost all transparency effects with mesh patterns and the loss of certain voice samples, like most fighters' running yells and some alternative phrases used by characters like Raiden and Scorpion in their attacks.\n\n=== PC ===\nThe PC version is a direct port of the PlayStation version, developed by Point of View and released almost at the same time as the Sega Saturn port. This port is identical to the PlayStation version, lacking the extra load times and providing some minor cosmetic differences in the game introduction. There were at least two public revisions of this game for the PC, and the final version (indicated by the word \"final\" next to the version number in the about dialog box) has gameplay identical to the Greatest Hits release on PlayStation.\n\n=== Game.com ===\nThe game was a launch release for the [[Game.com]] handheld console. The game includes a multiplayer mode, accessible only with the compete.com game link cable (to link two Game.com consoles together). Only 13 characters (Cyrax, Ermac, Jade, Mileena, Sektor, Kitana, Motaro, Nightwolf, Noob Saibot, Raiden, Reptile and Shao Kahn) and 10 Kombat Zones remain in this version (screenshots of early releases showed a different assortment of characters). In addition, each character only has two special moves and four finishing moves: one Fatality, Babality, Friendship, and Brutality. In this version, each finishing move has the same command for every character.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = PS: 67%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/ps/197997-mortal-kombat-trilogy/index.html |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy for PlayStation |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><br />N64: 52%<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamerankings.com/n64/197996-mortal-kombat-trilogy/index.html |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy for Nintendo 64 |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=2019-03-21}}</ref>\n| EGM = N64: 8.125/10<ref name=EGM89>{{cite magazine|title=Review Crew: MK Trilogy |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=89|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=December 1996 |page=85}}</ref>\n| GI = SSAT: 8.75/10<ref name=GISat>{{cite magazine|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/aug97/mortal.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19971021120233/http://www.gameinformer.com/aug97/mortal.html |archivedate=October 21, 1997|date=August 1997 |magazine=[[Game Informer]]}}</ref>\n| GSpot = N64: 5.8/10<ref name=GS64>{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Gerstmann|authorlink=Jeff Gerstmann|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review/1900-2544832/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=[[GameSpot]] |date=December 4, 1996 |accessdate=January 17, 2018}}</ref><br />PS: 8.6/10<ref>{{cite web |first=Hugh|last=Sterbakov|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-trilogy/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review-2548427/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=GameSpot |date=1996-12-01 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref><br />SSAT: 6.0/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/mortal-kombat-trilogy/reviews/mortal-kombat-trilogy-review-2533994/ |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy Review |website=GameSpot |date=1997-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n| IGN = N64: 4.1/10<ref name=\"IGN64r\">{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Peer|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/21/mortal-kombat-trilogy-2|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=17 January 2018|date=November 20, 1996}}</ref><br />PS: 6.0/10<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1996/12/20/mortal-kombat-trilogy |title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy - IGN |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=December 19, 1996 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Digital Press''\n| rev1Score = N64: 8/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Paprocki|first=Matt|title=Mortal Kombat Trilogy |url=http://www.digitpress.com/reviews/mktilogy_n64.htm|website=Digital Press|accessdate=25 November 2017|date=October 24, 2005}}</ref>\n| rev2 = ''Super Power''\n| rev2Score = N64: 91%<ref name=\"SP\"/>\n| rev3 = ''Player One''\n| rev3Score = N64: 70<ref>{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Player+One/playerone_numero078/Player+One+n%25B078+(Septembre+1997)+-+Page+069.jpg|title=Player One 078|website=download.abandonware.org}}</ref>\n| rev4 = ''SuperGamePower''\n| rev4Score = SSAT: 5/5<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SuperGamePower_Ano_03_No._042_1997-09_Nova_Cultural_BR_pt|title=SuperGamePower - Ano 03 No. 042 (1997-09)(Nova Cultural)(BR)(pt)|date=1 September 1997|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><br />N64: 4.8/5<ref name=\"MKTSGP\"/>\n| rev5 = ''CD Consoles''\n| rev5Score = PS: {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=101&num=7224&album=oui|title=CD Consoles 101|website=www.abandonware-magazines.org}}</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]''\n| rev6Score = SSAT: 88%<ref name=SSM22>{{cite magazine|last=Yeo |first=Matt |title=Review: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=26|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=December 1997|pages=68-71}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe game's critical reception has varied considerably, depending on the platform and publication.

He said the Nintendo 64 version is a faithful conversion of the arcade games, though he compared it unfavorably to the PlayStation version. However, he held that the arcade games themselves are too aged to merit an appearance on the Nintendo 64, referring to them as five years old (in actuality, ''Mortal Kombat 3'' was barely a year old at the time, and even the oldest in the series was four years old).<ref name=\"IGN64r\"/> ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' was said to be a \"particularly horrible game\" among the Nintendo 64 library by ''[[Forbes]]'',<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Noer |title=Blood on the Snow |url=https://www.forbes.com/1997/09/19/col.html |date=1997-09-19 |magazine=Forbes |accessdate=2010-03-13 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123081745/http://www.forbes.com/1997/09/19/col.html |archivedate=2013-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but was honored in [[Nintendo Power Awards]] '96, coming second in the category \"Best Tournament Fighting Game\".<ref>''[[Nintendo Power]]'' #96 (May 1997)</ref>\n\nReviewing the PlayStation version, Major Mike criticized the overly difficult opponent AI and the unbalanced nature of the playable boss characters, and said the music tracks \"sound like a [[45 record]] played at 33 [[RPM]].\" He nonetheless concluded it to be \"a must for any fighting gamer's library\", due to the responsive controls and large amount of content.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=PlayStation ProReview: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=100|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1997 |page=84}}</ref> Though ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' never reviewed the PlayStation version of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'', they ran a four-page feature comparing it to the Nintendo 64 version. Shawn Smith picked the Nintendo 64 version as the one to buy, saying that the major bugs in the PlayStation version outweigh the Nintendo 64 version's various shortcomings. The other three members of the review team all voted for the PlayStation version, particularly citing the additional characters and the lower price ($49.99 as compared to $69.99 for the Nintendo 64 version).<ref name=EGM90/> They later named both versions runner-up for Fighting Game of the Year, behind ''[[Tekken 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\nThe Saturn version arrived nearly a year (over a year in some countries) after the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions and received comparatively little attention. ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' said the long wait for the conversion was baffling, since the game's 2D visuals fall within the Saturn's specialty and no new content had been created for the Saturn version, and damaging, since superior 2D Saturn fighters had since come out and home versions of ''Mortal Kombat 4'' were on the horizon, making ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' both graphically and stylistically outdated.<ref name=SSM22/> ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', ''[[Game Informer]]'', and ''GamePro'' all concluded it to be a must-have for ''Mortal Kombat'' fans due to its comprehensive content and features, but advised non-fans to look to other fighting games on the Saturn, and described it as virtually identical to the PlayStation version.<ref name=GISat/><ref name=SSM22/><ref>{{cite magazine |author=Art Angel |title=Saturn ProReview: Mortal Kombat Trilogy|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=108 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=September 1997|page=98}}</ref>\n\nReleased at a time when the Nintendo 64's popularity was burgeoning and there were few competing games for the system, the Nintendo 64 version of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' saw impressive sales figures.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Who Won the Videogame Wars of 1996? |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=28|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1997|pages=16-19}}</ref> According to a later IGN retrospective, ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' \"offered something no fan could ignore: It brought every character from the series into the fold, along with most of the levels, making for one massive game that had enough to please everyone.

Branson once said, \"There is no point in starting your own business unless you do it out of a sense of frustration.\" At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit [[retail price maintenance]].<ref group=note>Another example was the [[Net Book Agreement]], which limited the ability of book outlets, including discount book clubs, to offer deep discounts.</ref>\n\nBranson eventually started a record shop in [[Oxford Street]] in London. In 1971, he was questioned in connection with the selling of records that had been declared export stock. The matter was never brought before a court because Branson agreed to repay any unpaid [[purchase tax]] of 33% and a \u00a370,000 fine.

He has argued that the concept of democracy is that of self-government by the people. For such a system to work, an informed electorate is necessary. In order to be appropriately knowledgeable, there must be no constraints on the free flow of information and ideas. According to Meiklejohn, democracy will not be true to its essential ideal if those in power are able to manipulate the electorate by withholding information and stifling criticism. Meiklejohn acknowledges that the desire to manipulate opinion can stem from the motive of seeking to benefit society. However, he argues, choosing manipulation negates, in its means, the democratic ideal.<ref>{{cite book |title= Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first= Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn=978-1551113760 |pages=226\u201327 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy }}</ref>\n\n[[Eric Barendt]] has called this defence of free speech on the grounds of democracy \"probably the most attractive and certainly the most fashionable free speech theory in modern Western democracies\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Propaganda and the Ethics of Persuasion |last=Marlin |first=Randal |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher= Broadview Press |location= |isbn= 978-1551113760 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zp38Ot2g7LEC&pg=PA226&dq=%22free+speech%22+democracy |page=226 }}</ref> [[Thomas I.

But, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties imposed should be higher for causing harm.<ref name=\"ref1\" /> In contrast, Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.<ref name=\"leeds1\" /> Because the degree to which people may take offence varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that a number of factors need to be taken into account when applying the offence principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offence, and the general interest of the community at large.<ref name=\"leeds1\" />\n\nJasper Doomen argued that harm should be defined from the point of view of the individual citizen, not limiting harm to physical harm since nonphysical harm may also be involved; Feinberg's distinction between harm and offence is criticized as largely trivial.<ref>Doomen 2014, pp. 111, 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Bernard Harcourt]] wrote of the collapse of the harm principle: \"Today the debate is characterized by a cacophony of competing harm arguments without any way to resolve them. There is no longer an argument within the structure of the debate to resolve the competing claims of harm. The original harm principle was never equipped to determine the relative importance of harms.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/l/law-phil.htm |chapter=Philosophy of Law|author=Kenneth Einar Himma|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nInterpretations of both the harm and offense limitations to freedom of speech are culturally and politically relative. For instance, in Russia, the harm and offense principles have been used to justify the [[Russian LGBT propaganda law]] restricting speech (and action) in relation to [[LGBT]] issues. A number of European countries that take pride in freedom of speech nevertheless outlaw speech that might be interpreted as [[Holocaust denial#Laws against Holocaust denial|Holocaust denial]].

But we should expect such speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a voice. We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates.[...] My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting children from the dangers of Internet communication. The Government can continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of existing laws criminalising obscenity and child pornography. [...] As we learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public educations about the benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role as well. In my view, our action today should only mean that Government's permissible supervision of Internet contents stops at the traditional line of unprotected speech. [...] The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of the plaintiff's experts put it with such resonance at the hearing: \"What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is.

In 1557 the [[British Crown]] thought to stem the flow of seditious and heretical books by chartering the [[Stationers' Company]]. The right to print was limited to the members of that guild, and thirty years later the [[Star Chamber]] was chartered to curtail the \"greate enormities and abuses\" of \"dyvers contentyous and disorderlye persons professinge the arte or mystere of pryntinge or selling of books.\" The right to print was restricted to two universities and to the 21 existing printers in the [[city of London]], which had 53 [[printing presses]].

Locke established the [[individual]] as the unit of value and the bearer of rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to liberty|liberty]], [[right to property|property]] and the [[pursuit of happiness]]. However Locke's ideas evolved primarily around the concept of the right to seek salvation for one's soul, and was thus primarily concerned with theological matters.

Mill's ''[[On Liberty]]'', published in 1859 became a classic defence of the right to freedom of expression.<ref name=\"Sanders 2003 66\" /> Mill argued that [[truth]] drives out falsity, therefore the free expression of ideas, true or false, should not be feared. Truth is not stable or fixed, but evolves with time. Mill argued that much of what we once considered true has turned out false. Therefore, views should not be prohibited for their apparent falsity. Mill also argued that free discussion is necessary to prevent the \"deep slumber of a decided opinion\". Discussion would drive the onwards march of truth and by considering false views the basis of true views could be re-affirmed.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sanders| first = Karen| title = Ethics & Journalism| publisher = Sage| year = 2003| page = 67| url = https://www.google.com/books?id=bnpliIUyO60C&dq=Areopagitica+freedom+of+speech+britain&as_brr=3| isbn = 978-0-7619-6967-9}}</ref> Furthermore, Mill argued that an opinion only carries intrinsic value to the owner of that opinion, thus silencing the expression of that opinion is an injustice to a basic human right.

But, as offending someone is less serious than harming someone, the penalties imposed should be higher for causing harm.<ref name=\"ref1\" /> In contrast, Mill does not support legal penalties unless they are based on the harm principle.<ref name=\"leeds1\" /> Because the degree to which people may take offence varies, or may be the result of unjustified prejudice, Feinberg suggests that a number of factors need to be taken into account when applying the offence principle, including: the extent, duration and social value of the speech, the ease with which it can be avoided, the motives of the speaker, the number of people offended, the intensity of the offence, and the general interest of the community at large.<ref name=\"leeds1\" />\n\nJasper Doomen argued that harm should be defined from the point of view of the individual citizen, not limiting harm to physical harm since nonphysical harm may also be involved; Feinberg's distinction between harm and offence is criticized as largely trivial.<ref>Doomen 2014, pp. 111, 112.</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Bernard Harcourt]] wrote of the collapse of the harm principle: \"Today the debate is characterized by a cacophony of competing harm arguments without any way to resolve them.

In a Britain when men still wore heavy grey suits, working women were still relatively rare and the Empire was still, just, a going concern, D H Lawrence\u2019s book was merely one of many banned because of its threat to public morality.}}</ref> Fred Kaplan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated the overturning of the obscenity laws \"set off an explosion of free speech\" in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/21/opinion/21kaplan.html |title= The Day Obscenity Became Art |work= The New York Times |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2018 |author= Kaplan, Fred |quote=TODAY is the 50th anniversary of the court ruling that overturned America\u2019s obscenity laws, setting off an explosion of free speech \u2014 and also, in retrospect, splashing cold water on the idea, much discussed during Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings, that judges are \u201cumpires\u201d rather than agents of social change.}}</ref> The 1960s also saw the [[Free Speech Movement]], a massive long-lasting student protest on the campus of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] during the 1964\u201365 academic year.<ref>\n*{{Cite web|url=http://fsm.berkeley.edu/|title=Berkeley FSM {{!}} Free Speech Movement 50th Anniversary|website=fsm.berkeley.edu|ref=:0|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> In 1964 comedian [[Lenny Bruce]] was arrested in the U.S. due to complaints again pertaining to his use of various obscenities.
