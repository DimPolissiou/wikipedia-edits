The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n{| style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n==The Lines==\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]].\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]].\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Cpt Inglefield, Cpt. Parry, Cpt. Dumaresq, Cpt. Buckner, Cpt. Graves, Cpt. Blair, Cpt. Burnett, Cpt. Savage, Cpt. Symons, Cpt. Charrington, Cpt. Inglis, Cpt. Cornish, Cpt. Truscott, Cpt. Saumarez, Cpt. Knight Cpt. Wilson, Cpt. Williams and Cpt. Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n==Pre-Battle Movements==\n\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet soon caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat. The British fleet became separated from the centre and rear divisions{{clarify|date=June 2016}}. But eight ships of their vanguard under [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]] moved against Grasse's retreating ships and waged a fight. After an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse soon realized that the main British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to return to protect the merchant convoy.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|Main stages of the battle]]\n\nIn the following days the two fleets faced each other parallel but both sides kept their distance as they repaired their ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nOn 12 April, the French were sighted a short distance away, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes. A French straggler, {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} ([[Seventy-four (ship)|74 guns]]), was spotted and was chased by four British ships as De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n=== Breaking of the line ===\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian.

As she slowed, she duelled with de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns. The rest of the ships soon followed, [[Raking fire|raking]] the French as they did so, causing high casualties amongst the soldiers and sailors.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\">O'Shaughnessy p. 315-17</ref> Around 9 am, Drake's rearmost ship, {{HMS|Russell|1764|6}}, cleared the end of the French fleet and hauled wind; while his ships had taken some damage, they had inflicted a severe battering on the French.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} was the first victim; virtually a sitting duck, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships began milling around; ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the French line, blasting her way through; this piercing was followed by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]], to the south, also immediately capitalized on the opportunity and led the rearmost of the British ships through the French line, inflicting significant damage. The French tried to restore order; around 1:30 pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled line on the port tack, but this was not fulfilled; he was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}}, which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> ''Ardent'' soon followed, being taken by the rest of the British centre.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\"/>\n[[File:Fin du C\u00e9sar-Dumoulin-IMG 5478.JPG|thumb|220px|''The end of the C\u00e9sar'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nAt 4 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', alone and being battered by ''Barfleur'', with little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated.

Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> With a fire out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 50 British sailors, although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, learning of Grasse's fate, assumed command of the scattered French naval fleet.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n[[File:Barnard's History of England - Rodney accepts the surrender of deGrasse.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1785 engraving of de Grasse surrendering to Rodney.]]\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n{| style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n==The Lines==\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS Formidable]] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]].\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS Barfleur]] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS Prince George]] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS Duke]] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS Namur]]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904</ref>\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser 1904</ref>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. THey awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS Alert]] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]].\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS Resolution]]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS Canada]]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS Monarch]] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the Formidable. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Cpt Inglefield, Cpt. Parry, Cpt. Dumaresq, Cpt. Buckner, Cpt. Graves, Cpt. Blair, Cpt. Burnett, Cpt. Savage, Cpt. Symons, Cpt. Charrington, Cpt. Inglis, Cpt. Cornish, Cpt. Truscott, Cpt. Saumarez, Cpt. Knight Cpt. Wilson, Cpt. Williams and Cpt. Wilkinson.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.72</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS Andromache]], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS Magnificent]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.79</ref>\n\n==Pre-Battle Movements==\n\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.80</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref>Famous Fighters of the Fleet, Edward Fraser, 1904, p.81</ref>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS Barfleur (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS St Albans]] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS Valiant]], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the Barfleur and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet soon caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref>Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat. The British fleet became separated from the centre and rear divisions{{clarify|date=June 2016}}. But eight ships of their vanguard under [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Samuel Hood, 1st Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]] moved against Grasse's retreating ships and waged a fight. After an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse soon realized that the main British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to return to protect the merchant convoy.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|Main stages of the battle]]\n\nIn the following days the two fleets faced each other parallel but both sides kept their distance as they repaired their ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nOn 12 April, the French were sighted a short distance away, as the two fleets maneuvered between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes. A French straggler, {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} ([[Seventy-four (ship)|74 guns]]), was spotted and was chased by four British ships as De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]]. He [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship which led him to Guadeloupe{{clarify|date=June 2016}} and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n=== Breaking of the line ===\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship \u2018Formidable\u2019 breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' opened fire and engaged the French centre. As she slowed, she duelled with de Grasse's flagship, {{ship|French ship|Ville de Paris|1764|2}} of 104 guns. The rest of the ships soon followed, [[Raking fire|raking]] the French as they did so, causing high casualties amongst the soldiers and sailors.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\">O'Shaughnessy p. 315-17</ref> Around 9 am, Drake's rearmost ship, {{HMS|Russell|1764|6}}, cleared the end of the French fleet and hauled wind; while his ships had taken some damage, they had inflicted a severe battering on the French.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} was the first victim; virtually a sitting duck, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships began milling around; ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the French line, blasting her way through; this piercing was followed by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]], to the south, also immediately capitalized on the opportunity and led the rearmost of the British ships through the French line, inflicting significant damage. The French tried to restore order; around 1:30 pm, Admiral de Grasse signalled line on the port tack, but this was not fulfilled; he was soon battling Hood's 90-gun HMS ''Barfleur''.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2 pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, they took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3 pm. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}}, which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}}. ''Hector'', a complete dismasted wreck, struck her flag after having battled {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}}.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> ''Ardent'' soon followed, being taken by the rest of the British centre.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh1\"/>\n[[File:Fin du C\u00e9sar-Dumoulin-IMG 5478.JPG|thumb|220px|''The end of the C\u00e9sar'', by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nAt 4 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', alone and being battered by ''Barfleur'', with little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated. [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, succeeded in rallying eight ships of his own division.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nFinally, the isolated ''Ville de Paris'', being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood took the surrender; the boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, Ville de Paris presented a scene of complete horror.

Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> With a fire out of control, the [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]] aboard the ''C\u00e9sar'' exploded, killing more than 400 French and 50 British sailors, although many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the disaster.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, learning of Grasse's fate, assumed command of the scattered French naval fleet.

The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. It is estimated that the French may have lost as many as 3,000 men. More than 5,000 French soldiers and sailors were captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged.<ref>Trew p. 169</ref> The high number of men demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica.<ref>Trew 158</ref> Of the ''Ville de Paris''{{'}} crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded \u2013 more than the casualties of the entire British fleet.<ref name=\"Valin\"/>\n[[File:Barnard's History of England - Rodney accepts the surrender of deGrasse.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1785 engraving of de Grasse surrendering to Rodney.]]\n\nOn 17 April, Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line ([[HMS Argonaut (1782)|''Jason'']] and {{ship|French ship|Caton|1777|2}}) and two smaller warships in the [[Battle of the Mona Passage]] on 19 April.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/>\n\nSoon after the defeat, the French fleet reached [[Cap Francois]] in several waves; the main contingent, under Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April; ''Marseillois'', along with {{ship|French ship|Hercule|1778|2}}, {{ship|French ship|Pluton|1778|2}} and {{ship|French ship|\u00c9veill\u00e9|1773|2}}, arrived on 11 May.<ref name=\"troude158\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 158</ref>\n\nIn May, all French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique, then numbering twenty-six ships, and were soon joined by twelve Spanish ships. Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

He was created a [[Peerage|peer]] with \u00a32,000 a year settled on the title in perpetuity for this victory. Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

The song, initially created only as a studio exercise to test drum sounds on new recording equipment, sold over two million copies and reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 22 in the US. It reached No.1 in Italy and Germany and was also a Top 20 hit in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland and Japan.<ref name=\"Tremlett\">{{cite book | author=George Tremlett | title=The 10cc Story | year= 1976 | isbn=0-8600-7378-5 | publisher= Futura }}</ref>\n\n==Background and Recording==\nThe song was the first to be recorded at [[Strawberry Studios]] in [[Stockport]], England, on new four-track [[Ampex]] equipment purchased by studio owners [[Eric Stewart]], [[Graham Gouldman]] and Peter Tattersall. It featured a simple repeated chorus and a heavy drum rhythm that Gouldman's manager, [[Harvey Lisberg]], has claimed became influential in pop music. He said: \"I think a lot of people were very influenced by 'Neanderthal Man', which was something new in drum sounds, using four drums on a four-track machine. When [[Gary Glitter]] came along with his records, I thought I could hear the same sort of sound deep down in there. I think there were a lot of other people who copied the sound, maybe unintentionally.\"<ref name=\"Tremlett\" />\n\nStewart recalled that when the recording equipment had been set up, [[Kevin Godley]] set up his drum kit, [[Lol Creme]] got out his guitar and Stewart sat down at the control desk. \"It was the first time we'd had a real control desk with a four-track machine and we were excited to try it all out,\" he said. \"The whole thing was just an experiment because Kevin wanted to lay all sorts of different drum beats down that he hadn't recorded before, and there was this crazy sort of nursery rhyme that had just got into our heads.\"\n\n\"''As we laid down the drum tracks, Lol was singing in the studio with Kevin keeping time &ndash; and after we'd laid four drum tracks down Lol's voice came through at a very high level, sounding like something none of us had ever heard before on a record. It really sounded very strange, so we carried on working on the number, adding little bits of piano to it.''\"<ref name=\"Tremlett\" />\n\nBy good fortune, Dick Leahy of [[Philips Records]] (the record company that had released all the singles by Stewart's former band [[The Mindbenders]] on its [[Fontana Records|Fontana]] label) was in the [[Manchester]] area on business and visited the studio.  When he asked Stewart what they had been working on, Stewart played the \"Neanderthal Man\" tape they had just completed.  Stewart said Leahy immediately claimed, \"It's fabulous! It's a hit record!\" and offered a \u00a3500 advance.  The advance was particularly timely for Stewart, who was considering selling his house and moving to something smaller to provide him with more funding for the studio.\n\nHe said the first task was to create a name for the band: \"We had no name for the group, of course. But we had a girl at the studio\u2026 Kathy Gill, I think her name was, who had very, very nice legs and she used to wear these incredible hot pants. Green, leather hot pants. So we called the group Hotlegs.\"<ref>[http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/injection005.htm \"10cc : A Pure Injection Of Pop,\" chapter 4, by Dave Thompson, \"Goldmine\" magazine, April 11, 1997]</ref>\n\nStewart said Philips were not entirely content with the song, however: \"The next thing that happened after we'd done the deal was that we got a phone call from them. 'We like the record,' they said, 'but we can't hear the words!' We had about three phone calls about that, and each time I explained that they weren't supposed to hear the words. Eventually they agreed to release it just as we wanted it.\"\n\nHe said there was one further hitch before the song was released: a loud metallic burst towards the end of the song blew a \u00a31200 cutter head as the track was being mastered in the [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]] cutting suite. He explained: \"We had a sound on that track that was something that had never been recorded before. We'd made the sound by taking a large 6&nbsp;ft by 4&nbsp;ft sheet of steel into the studio. It was actually a sheet we were going to fireproof one of the doors with &ndash; and then at the right moment we had hit it with a hammer. The hammer blow gave it such a shock frequency-wise that the equipment just couldn't take it.

The song, initially created only as a studio exercise to test drum sounds on new recording equipment, sold over two million copies and reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 22 in the US. It reached No.1 in Italy and Germany and was also a Top 20 hit in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland and Japan.<ref name=\"Tremlett\">{{cite book | author=George Tremlett | title=The 10cc Story | year= 1976 | isbn=0-8600-7378-5 | publisher= Futura }}</ref>\n\n==Background and Recording==\nThe song was the first to be recorded at [[Strawberry Studios]] in [[Stockport]], England, on new four-track [[Ampex]] equipment purchased by studio owners [[Eric Stewart]], [[Graham Gouldman]] and Peter Tattersall. It featured a simple repeated chorus and a heavy drum rhythm that Gouldman's manager, [[Harvey Lisberg]], has claimed became influential in pop music. He said: \"I think a lot of people were very influenced by 'Neanderthal Man', which was something new in drum sounds, using four drums on a four-track machine. When [[Gary Glitter]] came along with his records, I thought I could hear the same sort of sound deep down in there. I think there were a lot of other people who copied the sound, maybe unintentionally.\"<ref name=\"Tremlett\" />\n\nStewart recalled that when the recording equipment had been set up, [[Kevin Godley]] set up his drum kit, [[Lol Creme]] got out his guitar and Stewart sat down at the control desk. \"It was the first time we'd had a real control desk with a four-track machine and we were excited to try it all out,\" he said. \"The whole thing was just an experiment because Kevin wanted to lay all sorts of different drum beats down that he hadn't recorded before, and there was this crazy sort of nursery rhyme that had just got into our heads.\"\n\n\"''As we laid down the drum tracks, Lol was singing in the studio with Kevin keeping time &ndash; and after we'd laid four drum tracks down Lol's voice came through at a very high level, sounding like something none of us had ever heard before on a record. It really sounded very strange, so we carried on working on the number, adding little bits of piano to it.''\"<ref name=\"Tremlett\" />\n\nBy good fortune, Dick Leahy of [[Philips Records]] (the record company that had released all the singles by Stewart's former band [[The Mindbenders]] on its [[Fontana Records|Fontana]] label) was in the [[Manchester]] area on business and visited the studio.  When he asked Stewart what they had been working on, Stewart played the \"Neanderthal Man\" tape they had just completed.  Stewart said Leahy immediately claimed, \"It's fabulous! It's a hit record!\" and offered a \u00a3500 advance.  The advance was particularly timely for Stewart, who was considering selling his house and moving to something smaller to provide him with more funding for the studio.\n\nHe said the first task was to create a name for the band: \"We had no name for the group, of course. But we had a girl at the studio\u2026 Kathy Gill, I think her name was, who had very, very nice legs and she used to wear these incredible hot pants. Green, leather hot pants. So we called the group Hotlegs.\"<ref>[http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/injection005.htm \"10cc : A Pure Injection Of Pop,\" chapter 4, by Dave Thompson, \"Goldmine\" magazine, April 11, 1997]</ref>\n\nStewart said Philips were not entirely content with the song, however: \"The next thing that happened after we'd done the deal was that we got a phone call from them. 'We like the record,' they said, 'but we can't hear the words!' We had about three phone calls about that, and each time I explained that they weren't supposed to hear the words. Eventually they agreed to release it just as we wanted it.\"\n\nHe said there was one further hitch before the song was released: a loud metallic burst towards the end of the song blew a \u00a31200 cutter head as the track was being mastered in the [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]] cutting suite. He explained: \"We had a sound on that track that was something that had never been recorded before. We'd made the sound by taking a large 6&nbsp;ft by 4&nbsp;ft sheet of steel into the studio. It was actually a sheet we were going to fireproof one of the doors with &ndash; and then at the right moment we had hit it with a hammer. The hammer blow gave it such a shock frequency-wise that the equipment just couldn't take it. At the time this was an embarrassment to all of us, but that faded into insignificance when we found ourselves with such a massive hit on our hands.\"<ref name=\"Tremlett\" />\n\n==Chart success and later work==\nThe song reached No. 2 in the UK on 15 August 1970 and remained there for two weeks, kept off the top spot by [[Elvis Presley]]'s \"[[The Wonder of You]]\".<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book\n| first= David | last= Roberts | year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums | edition= 19th | publisher= Guinness World Records Limited | location= London| pages= 248\u201349| isbn= 1-904994-10-5}}</ref>\n\n\"Neanderthal Man\" was the only hit by Hotlegs.

Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor [[domestic violence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-sherman-and-berk-1984/|title=Individuals \u2013 Sherman & Berk (1984) &#124; Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy}}</ref> later known as the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for [[misdemeanor]] arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime <ref>New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)</ref> led to his experimental research with [[David Weisburd]] and [[Tony Bouza]] that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"hot spots\" led to an increase in seizures of illegally carried guns and a decrease in gun crimes.\n\nSince 1995, Sherman has been co directing a program of prospective longitudinal experiments in restorative justice involving approximately 2,500 offenders and 2,000 crime victims. He has also  worked on the development of new tools for predicting murder among offenders on probation and parole in [[Philadelphia]], as well as randomized trials of intensive services among highest risk offenders.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Sherman was Greenfield Professor of Human Relations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], initially in the Department of Sociology. Under his leadership, Penn became the first [[Ivy League|Ivy League University]] to establish a Ph.D. in criminology as a separate field in 2000, and the first to establish a separate department of criminology in 2003, when Sherman was appointed the University's first Professor of Criminology. He served as Chair of the University's Department of Criminology from 2003 to 2007 and as the Director of the [[Fels Institute of Government]] from 1999 to 2005. He resigned from Penn in June 2010 to return to the University of Maryland as Distinguished University Professor while jointly serving as Wolfson Professor of Criminology from 2007-2017. Since 2016, he has also served as an Honorary Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.\n\nSherman also served Maryland as Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice from 1995 to 1999, and as a faculty member from 1982 to 1999. In 1987, he was the Seth Boyden Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Rutgers University]]'s Graduate School of Criminal Justice and from 1994 to 2016 he served as Adjunct Professor of Law at the [[Australian National University]]'s Research School of Social Science and later in the ANU School of Global Governance (RegNet). From 1976 to 1980 he was on the faculty of the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]]'s School of Criminal Justice.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 he was the co-director of the Justice Research Consortium in the United Kingdom. Since 1995 has been the Scientific Director of RISE, an ongoing research program in partnership with [[Australian National University]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. From 1985 to 1995 he served as president of the Crime Control Institute, and from 1979 to 1985 he was the Director of Research and later Vice President for the Washington-D.C.-based [[Police Foundation]].\n\nIn addition to his experimental research, Sherman has published articles and book chapters on a wide variety of topics, including [[police corruption]], police education, police [[discretion]], police crackdowns, [[restorative justice]], investigations, police [[use of force]], and fear reduction. In 1997, Sherman led a team of [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] criminologists in producing Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising, a Congressionally mandated evaluation of over 500 state and local crime prevention programs.\n\n==Key research findings==\nHis major discoveries can be summarized as follows:\n\n* In 1980, he discovered that restricting police powers to shoot people was not followed by any increases in crime, or in violence against police officers;<ref>Sherman, L. W.  (1983). 'Reducing Police Gun Use:  Critical Events, Administrative Policy and Organizational Change', in Punch, M. (ed.) ''Control in the Police Organization'',  Cambridge, Massachusetts:  M.I.T. Press.</ref> this evidence was later cited by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in its 1985 [[Tennessee v. Garner]] decision to restrict police powers to kill across the US.\n* In 1984, the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]] found that arresting suspects in [[domestic violence]] cases was more effective at reducing [[Recidivism|re-offending]] than counselling or temporarily separating the suspect and victim.<ref name=\"sherman1984-pf\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if all of its complex but repeated elements were tested by repeated controlled field experiments. In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. Since then, the [[FBI Academy]] has offered a course on [[evidence-based policing]], and it has become the subject of wide debate and commentary in police practice and research journals.\n\nIn 2008, Sherman made evidence-based policing (EBP) the core of the Police Executive Programme at Cambridge University, a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master's in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 5th International Conference attended by over 250 police and scholars from six continents, including Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the [http://www.sebp.police.uk Society of Evidence-Based Policing], and elected Sherman its first Honorary President, along with [[Peter Fahy|Sir Peter Fahy]], [[Chief Constable]] of the UK's [[Greater Manchester Police]] (see http://sebp.police.uk/index.php); as of 2014 the Society has over 1,000 members, primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America. In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing, which now has over 500 members (see http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php). In 2015, both Canada (see https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072800/http://www.can-sebp.net/index.php) and the United States (see http://www.evidencebasedpolicing.org/index.php) established their own branches of this learned professional society. In 2013, UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] appointed Sherman an independent non-executive director of the new [[College of Policing]], which develops and promotes evidence of what works in policing.\n\n==Institution building==\n\nSherman has been a prime mover in the development on several permanent new additions to the institutional landscape of criminology. The most visible of these new institutions is the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]], which philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]] and Sherman proposed to Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] of [[Stockholm University]] in mid-2000, and which Sarnecki brought to the Swedish Ministry of Justice where it received support from successive Ministers. The annual Prize for criminological research or its application that benefits humanity was funded by the [[Jerry Lee]] Foundation for a guaranteed minimum of ten years, with the first prizes awarded in 2006. The Prize has been awarded annually since then, most often presented by a member of the Royal Family, with Sherman and Sarnecki as co-chairs of the International Jury that selects the winners. In 2012, Justice Minister Beatrice Ask concluded an agreement with the Soderberg foundations to provide joint funding with Ministry investment of a permanent endowment for a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20120712062254/http://www.criminologyprize.com/extra/pod/ Stockholm Prize Foundation], which guarantees annual funding of the Prize in perpetuity.\n\nSherman has also founded or helped to found the Academy of Experimental Criminology (in 1999), the Division of Experimental Criminology of the [[American Society of Criminology]] (in 2009), the [[Campbell Collaboration]] and its Crime and Justice Group (in 2000), the first Department of Criminology in the [[Ivy League]]\u2014at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (in 2003) and its [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] and [[Master's degree|MA]] degrees (in 2001), its [[Master of Science]] (2004), and its Jerry Lee Center of Criminology (in 2001). He also founded the first centre for experimental criminology in 2008, the Jerry Lee Centre of Experimental Criminology at the [[Cambridge Institute of Criminology|University of Cambridge Institute of Criminology]].<ref>University of Pennsylvania School of Arts and Sciences, {{cite web |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724050856/http://www.sas.upenn.edu/jerrylee/people/lsherman.htm |archivedate=2008-07-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Former students==\n\nSherman's students have included University of Cincinnati Professor John Eck, University of Pennsylvania Professor John MacDonald, George Mason University Professors Cynthia Lum and Christopher Koper, London School of Economics Professor Meredith Rossner, University of Pennsylvania Research Professor Geoffrey Barnes, and former Thames Valley Police and National Policing Improvement agency Chief Constable Peter Neyroud, President of the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing and working police sergeant, Renee J. Mitchell, Matthew T. Mangino, former member of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and former district attorney of Lawrence County, Pennsylvania.

Sherman's work in establishing the Stockholm Prize in Criminology was recognized by the King of Sweden in 2016, who appointed Sherman a Knight \"Commander of the Royal Order of the Northern Star\" (KNO).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.law.cam.ac.uk/press/news/2016/06/lawrence-sherman-knighted-king-sweden | title=Lawrence Sherman Knighted by King of Sweden &#124; Faculty of Law}}</ref> In 2017, Yale University Graduate School awarded him a [[Wilbur Cross Medal]] for public service, and the [[University of Bialystok]] awarded him its medal for services to criminology.

Sherman''' (born October 25, 1949) is an American experimental criminologist and police educator who is the founder of [[evidence-based policing]] and Director of the [https://www.cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing].\n\nSherman's use of randomized controlled [[experiment]]s to study [[Deterrence (psychological)|deterrence]] and [[crime prevention]] has led him to examine such wide-ranging issues as [[domestic violence]], [[saturation patrol]], [[gun violence]], [[crack houses]], and [[reintegrative shaming]]. He has collaborated with over 30 police and justice agencies around the world, and been credited as a key founder of the field of [[experimental criminology]].\n\nSherman holds the posts of Director of the Police Executive Programme<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/courses/police/ Cambridge Police Executive Programme]</ref> and Director of Research at the Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology<ref>[http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/research/experiments/ Jerry Lee Centre for Experimental Criminology]</ref> at the University of Cambridge, where he is [[Wolfson Professor of Criminology]] Emeritus. He is also the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing<ref>[http://cambridge-ebp.co.uk Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>, and Editor-in-Chief of the Centre's ''Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing''<ref>[https://link.springer.com/journal/41887 Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing]</ref>.\n\n==Education==\nSherman graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Denison University]] in 1970, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Political Science]]. He received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[social science]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970, earned a [[Diploma]] in [[Criminology]] from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] in 1973, and received his M.A. and [[Ph.D.]]in [[sociology]] from [[Yale University]] in 1974 and 1976 respectively.\n\n==Academic career==\nSherman's career began at age 20 in the New York City Mayor's Office and Police Department as an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation [https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/12/celebratin-40-years-of-urban-fellows/'s New York City Urban Fellow]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and aide to the NYPD's Police Commissioner [[Patrick V. Murphy]], where he began a long research partnership with NYPD Assistant Chief [[Tony Bouza]]. Bouza became the Minneapolis Police Chief in 1980, where he persuaded the City Council to approve Sherman's research design to randomly assign arrest for misdemeanor [[domestic violence]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/individuals/individuals-sherman-and-berk-1984/|title=Individuals \u2013 Sherman & Berk (1984) &#124; Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy}}</ref> later known as the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]]. Sherman's early experimental research into the influence of arrest on recidivism in spouse abuse led to changes in police department policies and procedures nationwide, encouraged state legislatures to modify state statutes to allow for [[misdemeanor]] arrest, and eventually resulted in five federally funded replications, one of which Sherman led in Milwaukee. In the late 1980s, Sherman's discovery of hot spots of crime <ref>New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/police-have-done-more-than-prisons-to-cut-crime-in-new-york.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)</ref> led to his experimental research with [[David Weisburd]] and [[Tony Bouza]] that was first to show clear crime prevention effects of directed police patrol in high crime locations. In the early 1990s, Sherman's Kansas City Gun Experiment studied the effect of concentrated police patrol on gun crime and violence and that directed police patrol in gun crime \"hot spots\" led to an increase in seizures of illegally carried guns and a decrease in gun crimes.\n\nSince 1995, Sherman has been co directing a program of prospective longitudinal experiments in restorative justice involving approximately 2,500 offenders and 2,000 crime victims. He has also  worked on the development of new tools for predicting murder among offenders on probation and parole in [[Philadelphia]], as well as randomized trials of intensive services among highest risk offenders.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2007, Sherman was Greenfield Professor of Human Relations at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], initially in the Department of Sociology. Under his leadership, Penn became the first [[Ivy League|Ivy League University]] to establish a Ph.D. in criminology as a separate field in 2000, and the first to establish a separate department of criminology in 2003, when Sherman was appointed the University's first Professor of Criminology. He served as Chair of the University's Department of Criminology from 2003 to 2007 and as the Director of the [[Fels Institute of Government]] from 1999 to 2005. He resigned from Penn in June 2010 to return to the University of Maryland as Distinguished University Professor while jointly serving as Wolfson Professor of Criminology from 2007-2017. Since 2016, he has also served as an Honorary Professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane.\n\nSherman also served Maryland as Chair of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice from 1995 to 1999, and as a faculty member from 1982 to 1999. In 1987, he was the Seth Boyden Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Rutgers University]]'s Graduate School of Criminal Justice and from 1994 to 2016 he served as Adjunct Professor of Law at the [[Australian National University]]'s Research School of Social Science and later in the ANU School of Global Governance (RegNet). From 1976 to 1980 he was on the faculty of the [[University at Albany, SUNY|University at Albany]]'s School of Criminal Justice.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2007 he was the co-director of the Justice Research Consortium in the United Kingdom. Since 1995 has been the Scientific Director of RISE, an ongoing research program in partnership with [[Australian National University]] and the [[Australian Federal Police]]. From 1985 to 1995 he served as president of the Crime Control Institute, and from 1979 to 1985 he was the Director of Research and later Vice President for the Washington-D.C.-based [[Police Foundation]].\n\nIn addition to his experimental research, Sherman has published articles and book chapters on a wide variety of topics, including [[police corruption]], police education, police [[discretion]], police crackdowns, [[restorative justice]], investigations, police [[use of force]], and fear reduction. In 1997, Sherman led a team of [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] criminologists in producing Preventing Crime: What Works, What Doesn't, What's Promising, a Congressionally mandated evaluation of over 500 state and local crime prevention programs.\n\n==Key research findings==\nHis major discoveries can be summarized as follows:\n\n* In 1980, he discovered that restricting police powers to shoot people was not followed by any increases in crime, or in violence against police officers;<ref>Sherman, L. W.  (1983). 'Reducing Police Gun Use:  Critical Events, Administrative Policy and Organizational Change', in Punch, M. (ed.) ''Control in the Police Organization'',  Cambridge, Massachusetts:  M.I.T. Press.</ref> this evidence was later cited by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in its 1985 [[Tennessee v. Garner]] decision to restrict police powers to kill across the US.\n* In 1984, the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]] found that arresting suspects in [[domestic violence]] cases was more effective at reducing [[Recidivism|re-offending]] than counselling or temporarily separating the suspect and victim.<ref name=\"sherman1984-pf\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/pdf/minneapolisdve.pdf |title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment |date=April 1984 |author1=Sherman, Lawrence W. |author2=Richard A.

His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if all of its complex but repeated elements were tested by repeated controlled field experiments. In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. Since then, the [[FBI Academy]] has offered a course on [[evidence-based policing]], and it has become the subject of wide debate and commentary in police practice and research journals.\n\nIn 2008, Sherman made evidence-based policing (EBP) the core of the Police Executive Programme at Cambridge University, a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master's in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 5th International Conference attended by over 250 police and scholars from six continents, including Africa and Latin America.\n\nIn 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the [http://www.sebp.police.uk Society of Evidence-Based Policing], and elected Sherman its first Honorary President, along with [[Peter Fahy|Sir Peter Fahy]], [[Chief Constable]] of the UK's [[Greater Manchester Police]] (see http://sebp.police.uk/index.php); as of 2014 the Society has over 1,000 members, primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America. In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing, which now has over 500 members (see http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php). In 2015, both Canada (see https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072800/http://www.can-sebp.net/index.php) and the United States (see http://www.evidencebasedpolicing.org/index.php) established their own branches of this learned professional society. In 2013, UK [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] appointed Sherman an independent non-executive director of the new [[College of Policing]], which develops and promotes evidence of what works in policing.\n\n==Institution building==\n\nSherman has been a prime mover in the development on several permanent new additions to the institutional landscape of criminology. The most visible of these new institutions is the [[Stockholm Prize in Criminology]], which philanthropist [[Jerry Lee]] and Sherman proposed to Professor [[Jerzy Sarnecki]] of [[Stockholm University]] in mid-2000, and which Sarnecki brought to the Swedish Ministry of Justice where it received support from successive Ministers. The annual Prize for criminological research or its application that benefits humanity was funded by the [[Jerry Lee]] Foundation for a guaranteed minimum of ten years, with the first prizes awarded in 2006.

He started out as a fast bowler at academy level, but his coach advised him to become a rare [[left-arm unorthodox spin]] bowler considering his build, which was ill-suited for fast bowling. He played for [[India Under-19 cricket team]] in the [[2014 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]] where he took a [[hat-trick]] against [[Scotland national under-19 cricket team|Scotland]] which brought him into the limelight.\n\nHe became the second Indian other than [[Bhuvneshwar Kumar]] and the third spinner other than [[Imran Tahir]] and [[Ajantha Mendis]] to take 5-wicket hauls in all three formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.sportskeeda.com/player/kuldeep-yadav|title=Kuldeep Yadav biography|work=Sportskeeda|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref> On 18 December 2019, against the West Indies, he became the first bowler for India to take two hat-tricks in international cricket.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/28324821/stats-rohit-sharma-second-only-sachin-tendulkar |title=Stats - Rohit Sharma second only to Sachin Tendulkar |work=ESPN Cricinfo |accessdate=18 December 2019}}</ref> On 17 January 2020, in the second ODI [[Australian cricket team in India in 2019\u201320|against Australia]], Yadav became the fastest [[spin bowling|spin bowler]] for India, in terms of innings, to take 100 wickets in ODI cricket, in his 58th innings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/cricketnext/news/india-vs-australia-kuldeep-yadav-becomes-fastest-indian-spinner-to-get-100-odi-wickets-2462661.html |title=India vs Australia: Kuldeep Yadav Becomes Fastest Indian Spinner to Get 100 ODI Wickets |work=Network18 Media and Investments Ltd |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Domestic career==\n\nKuldeep Yadav was born and raised in [[Kanpur]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], the son of a brick kiln owner. In an interview, he revealed that it was his father who wanted him to continue playing cricket and even took him to a coach (Kapil Pandey). Inspired by bowling greats [[Wasim Akram]] and [[Zaheer Khan]], he wanted to become a left-arm seamer. However, given his slight build, his coach insisted on him becoming a wrist-spin bowler as he was impressed with the turn and variations he was providing unknowingly at the trials. Since then, he started following and watching videos of [[Shane Warne]]'s bowling and made him his role model.\n\n{{Quotation|\"I keep watching videos of [[Shane Warne|Warne]].

{"title_page": "Peter Greig-Smith", "text_new": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988. Past Presidents gathered for a team photograph: Back row, left to right: A.D. Bradshaw, R.J. Berry, '''Peter Greig-Smith''', A. Macfadyen, C.H. Gimingham, G. Dunnet, L.R.Taylor. Front row from left: C.H. Evans; P.R. Richards, J. Harley, R. Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent the rest of his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the Journal of Ecology, the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: John T. Curtis and Robert H. Whittaker in the United States, and David W. Goodall and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with J. Roger Bray, developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor, and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective. Watt\u2019s influence can be seen in Greig-Smith\u2019s obituaries of him<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. A. S. Watt, F.R.S.: A biographical note. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 9\u201310. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1990. Alexander Stuart Watt: 21 June 1892\u20132 March 1985. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' 35):404\u2013423.</ref>. The ''Biographical Memoirs'' of the Royal Society show that Watt, in turn, had studied at Cambridge under the mentorship of the ecologist Sir [[Arthur Tansley|Arthur G. Tansley]] (1871\u20131955), a direct academic descendant of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]] (Tansley had studied with Francis W. Oliver [1864\u20131951] at the University College, London, who in turn had been mentored by Sir E. Ray Lankester [1847\u20131929] at Cambridge, a student of George Rolleston [1829\u20131881] at Oxford, who had been in turn mentored by Thomas Henry Huxley \u2014\"Darwin's bulldog\"\u2014 in London). In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b.

''Microlejeunea diversiloba'' (spr.) K.M. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(2): 285\u2013288.</ref>. In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019. ''Looking back: A life of statistical ecology''. 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. Scada Publishing, Canada.

Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al.

After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H.

One of Greig-Smith\u2019s students, Andrew Morton, continued Greig-Smith\u2019s pattern analysis studies in the dunes at Newborough Warren in Anglesey, Wales, near Bangor.\n\n====Pattern in Tropical Ecosystems====\nBelow only the study of coastal dunes, Greig-Smith\u2019s interests were strongly focused on tropical ecosystems. After his visit to Trinidad as a young researcher, he developed an interest for African savannas, on the possibility of using his methodology for pattern analysis to understand the importance of intraspecific competition in tropical, strongly rainfall-seasonal ecosystems<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, and Michael J.

The analysis of pattern in vegetation: A comment on a paper by D. W. Goodall. ''Journal of Ecology'' 51(1): 223\u2013229.</ref>, he showed the importance of scaling in the measurement of plant spatial pattern. He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II. Some methodological problems of data from rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 56(3): 827\u2013844.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., Peter S. Ashton, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1972. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>rl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref>Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. Tim Allen, a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F. H., Amanda J. Zellmer, and C. J. Wuennenberg. 2005. The loss of narrative. In ''Ecological paradigms lost: Routes of theory change''. Edited by Kim Cuddington and Beatrix Beisner, 333\u2013370. Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201cThere may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views.\u201d Possibly as a result of his work at Trinidad as a young researcher in 1953, he always had a receptive and supportive attitude toward foreign students, and especially toward those from developing countries. [https://nyeleni.org/IMG/pdf/Tewolde_Darwin_Lecture2002.pdf Tewolde B. G. Egziabher]<ref>Egziabher, Tewolde Berhan Gebre. 2002.

He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011. Orchids at Treborth Botanic Garden. ''Bangoriad: Bangor University\u2019s Alumni and Friends\u2019 Magazine'' (Spring): 8. Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988.

Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the Journal of Ecology, the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: John T. Curtis and Robert H. Whittaker in the United States, and David W. Goodall and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with J. Roger Bray, developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor, and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective.

''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' 35):404\u2013423.</ref>. The ''Biographical Memoirs'' of the Royal Society show that Watt, in turn, had studied at Cambridge under the mentorship of the ecologist Sir [[Arthur Tansley|Arthur G. Tansley]] (1871\u20131955), a direct academic descendant of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]] (Tansley had studied with Francis W. Oliver [1864\u20131951] at the University College, London, who in turn had been mentored by Sir E. Ray Lankester [1847\u20131929] at Cambridge, a student of George Rolleston [1829\u20131881] at Oxford, who had been in turn mentored by Thomas Henry Huxley \u2014\"Darwin's bulldog\"\u2014 in London). In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b. ''Potamolejeunea Holtii'' (spruce) nov.comb. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 1(2): 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948c.

In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019. ''Looking back: A life of statistical ecology''. 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. Scada Publishing, Canada.

Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al. (1953)<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1953. A note on the behaviour of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L.) Link, in relation to sand-dune formation. ''Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 36(2): 132\u2013136.</ref>, dealt with the formation of tussocks in ''Ammophila arenaria'' and included detailed observations on the clumped distribution of tillers, which form tussock-like clumps in older, fixed dunes but are regularly distributed in the younger, moving dunes. After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1953. A note on the behaviour of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L.) Link, in relation to sand-dune formation.

One of Greig-Smith\u2019s students, Andrew Morton, continued Greig-Smith\u2019s pattern analysis studies in the dunes at Newborough Warren in Anglesey, Wales, near Bangor.\n\n====Pattern in Tropical Ecosystems====\nBelow only the study of coastal dunes, Greig-Smith\u2019s interests were strongly focused on tropical ecosystems. After his visit to Trinidad as a young researcher, he developed an interest for African savannas, on the possibility of using his methodology for pattern analysis to understand the importance of intraspecific competition in tropical, strongly rainfall-seasonal ecosystems<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, and Michael J. Chadwick. 1965. Data on pattern within plant communities: III. ''Acacia-Capparis'' semi-desert scrub in the Sudan. ''Journal of Ecology'' 53(2): 465\u2013474.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1991.

The use of random and contiguous quadrats in the study of the structure of plant communities. ''Annals of Botany'' 16(2): 293\u2013316.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1961.

The analysis of pattern in vegetation: A comment on a paper by D. W. Goodall. ''Journal of Ecology'' 51(1): 223\u2013229.</ref>, he showed the importance of scaling in the measurement of plant spatial pattern. He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II. Some methodological problems of data from rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 56(3): 827\u2013844.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., Peter S. Ashton, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1972. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>rl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref>Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. Tim Allen, a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F. H., Amanda J. Zellmer, and C. J. Wuennenberg. 2005. The loss of narrative. In ''Ecological paradigms lost: Routes of theory change''. Edited by Kim Cuddington and Beatrix Beisner, 333\u2013370. Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201cThere may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views.\u201d Possibly as a result of his work at Trinidad as a young researcher in 1953, he always had a receptive and supportive attitude toward foreign students, and especially toward those from developing countries. [https://nyeleni.org/IMG/pdf/Tewolde_Darwin_Lecture2002.pdf Tewolde B. G. Egziabher]<ref>Egziabher, Tewolde Berhan Gebre. 2002. ''The human individual and community in the conservation and sustainable use of biological resources''. Paper presented as the Darwin Lecture 2002 at the Annual Darwin Initiative meeting, London, 14 March 2002.

He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011. Orchids at Treborth Botanic Garden. ''Bangoriad: Bangor University\u2019s Alumni and Friends\u2019 Magazine'' (Spring): 8. Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Eezcurra", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor edits on paragraph 2 of the Intro", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Greig-Smith"}

He also used an Akai Head Rush pedal for a loop station originally, but has since also upgraded this to a Boss RC-50 Loop station and then the Boss RC-505 Loop station respectively. Note that he also uses an SYB-5 Bass synth to add an extra depth to the bass line. On stage he uses a DR-880 Rhythm Machine for some songs. In the past he has toyed with other equipment like the Boss A/B foot switch (an add-on for the RC-50) as well as a green slicer pedal, as seen in his Ghent performance. As for a live vocal microphone, currently he favours the R\u00d8DE M1 mic, however at the heart of his recording studio lies the Soundelux U195 condenser microphone.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Discography==\n*2004 - ''Exeunt Omnes'' (as a part of the band N.O.N)\n*2007 - ''Live in the Street'' - A collection of live street performances performed in various countries throughout Europe during the beginning stages of his busking.\n*2009 - ''Everythinks a Ripple'' - The first Dub FX studio album.
