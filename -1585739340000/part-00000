One common paradigm within which to study mind-wandering is the SART (sustained attention to response) task.<ref name=\"Smallwood2004\"/> In a SART task there are two categories of words.  One of the categories are the target words.  In each block of the task a word appears for about 300 ms, there will be a pause and then another word.  When a target word appears the participant hits a designated key.  About 60% of the time after a target word a thought probe will appear to gauge whether thoughts were on task.  If participants were not engaged in the task they were experiencing task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs), signifying mind-wandering.<ref name=\"McVay2.0\"/><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Weiner |editor1-first=Irving B. |editor2-last=Craighead |editor2-first=W.

However, they note that deliberate mind-wandering, or the purposeful shifting of one's attention to different stimuli, is not a consistent characteristic of having ADHD.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seli|first=Paul|last2=Smallwood|first2=Jonathan|last3=Cheyne|first3=James Allan|last4=Smilek|first4=Daniel|date=2015-06-01|title=On the relation of mind wandering and ADHD symptomatology|url=https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-014-0793-0|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=629\u2013636|doi=10.3758/s13423-014-0793-0|issn=1531-5320}}</ref>\n\nFranklin et. al. (2016) conducted research and arrived at similar conclusions. In their study, they had college students take multiple psychological evaluations that gauge ADHD symptom strength. Then, they had the students read a portion of a general science textbook. At various times and at random intervals throughout their reading, they were prompted to answer a question that asked if, prior to the task interruption, their attention was were either on task, slightly on task, slightly off task, or off task. In addition, they were asked if they were aware, unaware, or neither aware nor unaware of their thoughts as they read. Finally, they were tasked to press the space bar if they ever caught themselves mind-wandering. For a week after these assessments, the students used PDAs to answer follow-up questions that also gauged mind-wandering and awareness. This study\u2019s results revealed that students with higher ADHD symptomology showed less task-oriented control than those with lower ADHD symptomology. Additionally, those with lower ADHD symptomology were more likely to engage in useful or deliberate mind-wandering and were more aware of their inattention.

Participants with lower working memory capacity perform worse on comprehension-based tests.<ref name=\"Kane2012\"/><ref name=\"Smallwood 2011 63\u201377\"/> \nWhen investigating how mind-wandering affects retention of information, experiments are conducted where participants are asked a variety of questions about factual information, or deducible information while reading a detective novel. Participants are also asked about the state of their mind before the questions are asked. Throughout the reading itself, the author provides important cues to identify the villain, known as inference critical episodes (ICEs). The questions are asked randomly and before critical episodes are reached. It was found that episodes of mind-wandering, especially early on in the text led to decreased identification of the villain and worse results on both factual and deducible questions. Therefore, when mind-wandering occurs during reading, the text is not processed well enough to remember key information about the story. Furthermore, both the timing and the frequency of mind-wandering helps determine how much information is retained from the narrative.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smallwood |first1=Jonathan |last2=McSpadden |first2=Merrill |last3=Schooler |first3=Jonathan W. |title=When attention matters: The curious incident of the wandering mind |journal=Memory & Cognition |date=September 2008 |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=1144\u20131150 |pmid=18927032 |doi=10.3758/MC.36.6.1144}}</ref><ref name=\"Secondary Source\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smallwood |first=J. |title=Mind Wandering and Other Lapses |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/estcon/mind_wandering_and_other_lapses | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Consciousness |edition=1st |volume=2 |editor-last=Banks |editor-first=William P. |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |oclc=656164369 |url-access=subscription |via=Credo }}</ref>\n\n==Reading comprehension==\nReading comprehension must also be investigated in terms of text difficulty. To assess this, researchers provide an easy and hard version of a reading task. During this task, participants are interrupted and asked whether their thoughts at the time of interruption had been related or unrelated to the task. What is found is that mind-wandering has a negative effect on text comprehension in more difficult readings. This supports the executive-resource hypothesis which describes that both task related and task-unrelated thoughts (TUT) compete for executive function resources. Therefore, when the primary task is difficult, little resources are available for mind-wandering, whereas when the task is simple, the possibility for mind-wandering is abundant because it takes little executive control to focus on simple tasks. However, mind-wandering tends to occur more frequently in harder readings as opposed to easier readings. Therefore, it is possible that similar to retention, mind-wandering increases when readers have difficulty constructing a model of the story.<ref name=\"Secondary Source\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Feng |first1=S. |last2=D'Mello |first2=S. |last3=Graesser |first3=A.C. |title=Mind wandering while reading easy and difficult texts |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review |date=June 2013 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=586\u2013592 |pmid=23288660 |doi=10.3758/s13423-012-0367-y }}</ref>\n\n==Happiness==\n\nAs part of his doctoral research at Harvard University, [[Matthew Killingsworth]] used an iPhone app that captured a user's feelings in real time.<ref>{{cite web |title=About us |website=Track Your Happiness |url=https://www.trackyourhappiness.org/about |access-date=3 November 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jeremy |last=Hsu |date=11 November 2010 |title=Mind Wandering May Lead to a Bad Mood |website=[[LiveScience]] |publisher=Purch |url=http://www.livescience.com/8923-mind-wandering-lead-bad-mood.html }}</ref> The tool alerts the user at random times and asks: \"How are you feeling right now?\" and \"What are you doing right now?\"<ref name=KillingsworthGilbert2010>{{cite journal | author1 = Matthew A.

They also describe that people were less happy when their minds were wandering than when they were otherwise occupied. This effect was somewhat counteracted by people's tendency to mind-wander to happy topics, but unhappy mind-wandering was more likely to be rated as more unpleasant than other activities. The authors note that unhappy moods can also cause mind-wandering, but the time-lags between mind-wandering and mood suggests that mind-wandering itself can also lead to negative moods.<ref name = KillingsworthGilbert2010 /> Furthermore, research suggests that regardless of working memory capacity, participants participating in mind-wandering experiments report more mind-wandering when bored, stressed, unhappy.<ref name=Kane2007 /><ref name=\"Secondary Source\" />\n\n==Executive functions==\n[[Executive functions]] (EFs) are cognitive processes that make a person pay attention or concentrate on a task.<ref name = Diamond>{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Adele|title=Executive Functions|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=3 January 2013|volume=64|issue=1|pages=135\u2013168|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750|pmid=23020641|pmc=4084861}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barry |first=Danielle |title=Executive Function |pages=592\u2013594 |encyclopedia=The Gale Encyclopedia of Mental Health |edition=3rd |volume=1 |date=2012 |publisher=Gale |location=Detroit |editor-last=Key |editor-first=Kristin |oclc=783722616 }}</ref> Three executive functions that relate to memory are inhibiting, updating and shifting.

One common paradigm within which to study mind-wandering is the SART (sustained attention to response) task.<ref name=\"Smallwood2004\"/> In a SART task there are two categories of words.  One of the categories are the target words.  In each block of the task a word appears for about 300 ms, there will be a pause and then another word.  When a target word appears the participant hits a designated key.  About 60% of the time after a target word a thought probe will appear to gauge whether thoughts were on task.  If participants were not engaged in the task they were experiencing task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs), signifying mind-wandering.<ref name=\"McVay2.0\"/><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Weiner |editor1-first=Irving B. |editor2-last=Craighead |editor2-first=W.

(2016) conducted research and arrived at similar conclusions. In their study, they had college students take multiple psychological evaluations that gauge ADHD symptom strength. Then, they had the students read a portion of a general science textbook. At various times and at random intervals throughout their reading, they were prompted to answer a question that asked if, prior to the task interruption, their attention was were either on task, slightly on task, slightly off task, or off task. In addition, they were asked if they were aware, unaware, or neither aware nor unaware of their thoughts as they read. Finally, they were tasked to press the space bar if they ever caught themselves mind-wandering. For a week after these assessments, the students used PDAs to answer follow-up questions that also gauged mind-wandering and awareness. This study\u2019s results revealed that students with higher ADHD symptomology showed less task-oriented control than those with lower ADHD symptomology.

Participants with lower working memory capacity perform worse on comprehension-based tests.<ref name=\"Kane2012\"/><ref name=\"Smallwood 2011 63\u201377\"/> \nWhen investigating how mind-wandering affects retention of information, experiments are conducted where participants are asked a variety of questions about factual information, or deducible information while reading a detective novel. Participants are also asked about the state of their mind before the questions are asked. Throughout the reading itself, the author provides important cues to identify the villain, known as inference critical episodes (ICEs). The questions are asked randomly and before critical episodes are reached. It was found that episodes of mind-wandering, especially early on in the text led to decreased identification of the villain and worse results on both factual and deducible questions. Therefore, when mind-wandering occurs during reading, the text is not processed well enough to remember key information about the story. Furthermore, both the timing and the frequency of mind-wandering helps determine how much information is retained from the narrative.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Smallwood |first1=Jonathan |last2=McSpadden |first2=Merrill |last3=Schooler |first3=Jonathan W. |title=When attention matters: The curious incident of the wandering mind |journal=Memory & Cognition |date=September 2008 |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=1144\u20131150 |pmid=18927032 |doi=10.3758/MC.36.6.1144}}</ref><ref name=\"Secondary Source\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smallwood |first=J. |title=Mind Wandering and Other Lapses |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/estcon/mind_wandering_and_other_lapses | encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Consciousness |edition=1st |volume=2 |editor-last=Banks |editor-first=William P. |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |oclc=656164369 |url-access=subscription |via=Credo }}</ref>\n\n==Reading comprehension==\nReading comprehension must also be investigated in terms of text difficulty. To assess this, researchers provide an easy and hard version of a reading task. During this task, participants are interrupted and asked whether their thoughts at the time of interruption had been related or unrelated to the task. What is found is that mind-wandering has a negative effect on text comprehension in more difficult readings. This supports the executive-resource hypothesis which describes that both task related and task-unrelated thoughts (TUT) compete for executive function resources. Therefore, when the primary task is difficult, little resources are available for mind-wandering, whereas when the task is simple, the possibility for mind-wandering is abundant because it takes little executive control to focus on simple tasks. However, mind-wandering tends to occur more frequently in harder readings as opposed to easier readings. Therefore, it is possible that similar to retention, mind-wandering increases when readers have difficulty constructing a model of the story.<ref name=\"Secondary Source\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Feng |first1=S. |last2=D'Mello |first2=S. |last3=Graesser |first3=A.C. |title=Mind wandering while reading easy and difficult texts |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review |date=June 2013 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=586\u2013592 |pmid=23288660 |doi=10.3758/s13423-012-0367-y }}</ref>\n\n==Happiness==\n\nAs part of his doctoral research at Harvard University, [[Matthew Killingsworth]] used an iPhone app that captured a user's feelings in real time.<ref>{{cite web |title=About us |website=Track Your Happiness |url=https://www.trackyourhappiness.org/about |access-date=3 November 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Jeremy |last=Hsu |date=11 November 2010 |title=Mind Wandering May Lead to a Bad Mood |website=[[LiveScience]] |publisher=Purch |url=http://www.livescience.com/8923-mind-wandering-lead-bad-mood.html }}</ref> The tool alerts the user at random times and asks: \"How are you feeling right now?\" and \"What are you doing right now?\"<ref name=KillingsworthGilbert2010>{{cite journal | author1 = Matthew A.

They also describe that people were less happy when their minds were wandering than when they were otherwise occupied. This effect was somewhat counteracted by people's tendency to mind-wander to happy topics, but unhappy mind-wandering was more likely to be rated as more unpleasant than other activities. The authors note that unhappy moods can also cause mind-wandering, but the time-lags between mind-wandering and mood suggests that mind-wandering itself can also lead to negative moods.<ref name = KillingsworthGilbert2010 /> Furthermore, research suggests that regardless of working memory capacity, participants participating in mind-wandering experiments report more mind-wandering when bored, stressed, unhappy.<ref name=Kane2007 /><ref name=\"Secondary Source\" />\n\n==Executive functions==\n[[Executive functions]] (EFs) are cognitive processes that make a person pay attention or concentrate on a task.<ref name = Diamond>{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Adele|title=Executive Functions|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=3 January 2013|volume=64|issue=1|pages=135\u2013168|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-113011-143750|pmid=23020641|pmc=4084861}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barry |first=Danielle |title=Executive Function |pages=592\u2013594 |encyclopedia=The Gale Encyclopedia of Mental Health |edition=3rd |volume=1 |date=2012 |publisher=Gale |location=Detroit |editor-last=Key |editor-first=Kristin |oclc=783722616 }}</ref> Three executive functions that relate to memory are inhibiting, updating and shifting.

These bacteria can then reproduce and spread their antibiotic-resistant genes to other generations, increasing their prevalence and leading to infections that cannot be healed by antibiotics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ben|first=Yujie|last2=Fu|first2=Caixia|last3=Hu|first3=Min|last4=Liu|first4=Lei|last5=Wong|first5=Ming Hung|last6=Zheng|first6=Chunmiao|date=February 2019|title=Human health risk assessment of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment: A review|journal=Environmental Research|volume=169|pages=483\u2013493|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2018.11.040|issn=1096-0953|pmid=30530088|bibcode=2019ER....169..483B|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c46b56253afd303cb0f561aedb3113573cd129e5}}</ref> This is a growing matter of concern as antibiotic resistance is considered to be a serious future threat to human welfare.<ref name=pmid22048738/> Infectious diseases are the third leading cause of death in Europe and a future without effective antibiotics would fundamentally change the way modern medicine is practised.<ref name=pmid22048738/><ref name=pmid25918440>{{cite journal |last1=Shallcross |first1=Laura J. |last2=Howard |first2=Simon J. |last3=Fowler |first3=Tom |last4=Davies |first4=Sally C. |title=Tackling the threat of antimicrobial resistance: from policy to sustainable action |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=5 June 2015 |volume=370 |issue=1670 |pages=20140082 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0082 |pmid=25918440 |pmc=4424432 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89772d0ac83159bdc04737d8b8db9cc099b2b4f9}}</ref> \n[[File:Hartsock Genetic Engineering Bacteria Cell Division.png|thumb|Bacterial conjugation|333x333px]]\nBacteria can alter their genetic inheritance through two main ways, either by mutating their genetic material or acquiring a new one from other bacteria. The latter being the most important for causing antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains in animals and humans. One of the methods bacteria can obtain new genes is through a process called conjugation which deals with transferring genes using plasmids. These conjugative plasmids carry a number of genes that can be assembled and rearranged, which could then enable bacteria to exchange beneficial genes among themselves ensuring their survival against antibiotics and rendering them ineffective to treat dangerous diseases in humans, resulting into multi-drug resistant organisms.<ref>Bennett P.

There also has been an increase in the number of bacterial pathogens resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, including MRSA, which have recently emerged into different lineages. Some of them are associated with livestock and companion animals that are then able to be transmitted to humans, also called livestock-associated methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (LA-MRSA). These new lineages can be found on soft tissues of livestock workers, for example in their noses. A study looked at the association between exposure to livestock and the occurrence of LA-MRSA infection and observed that LA-MRSA infection was 9.64 times as likely to be found among livestock workers and veterinarians compared to their unexposed families and community members, showing that exposure to livestock significantly increases the risk of developing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.<ref>Chen, C., & Wu, F.

These bacteria can then reproduce and spread their antibiotic-resistant genes to other generations, increasing their prevalence and leading to infections that cannot be healed by antibiotics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ben|first=Yujie|last2=Fu|first2=Caixia|last3=Hu|first3=Min|last4=Liu|first4=Lei|last5=Wong|first5=Ming Hung|last6=Zheng|first6=Chunmiao|date=February 2019|title=Human health risk assessment of antibiotic resistance associated with antibiotic residues in the environment: A review|journal=Environmental Research|volume=169|pages=483\u2013493|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2018.11.040|issn=1096-0953|pmid=30530088|bibcode=2019ER....169..483B|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c46b56253afd303cb0f561aedb3113573cd129e5}}</ref> This is a growing matter of concern as antibiotic resistance is considered to be a serious future threat to human welfare.<ref name=pmid22048738/> Infectious diseases are the third leading cause of death in Europe and a future without effective antibiotics would fundamentally change the way modern medicine is practised.<ref name=pmid22048738/><ref name=pmid25918440>{{cite journal |last1=Shallcross |first1=Laura J. |last2=Howard |first2=Simon J. |last3=Fowler |first3=Tom |last4=Davies |first4=Sally C. |title=Tackling the threat of antimicrobial resistance: from policy to sustainable action |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=5 June 2015 |volume=370 |issue=1670 |pages=20140082 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0082 |pmid=25918440 |pmc=4424432 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/89772d0ac83159bdc04737d8b8db9cc099b2b4f9}}</ref> \n[[File:Hartsock Genetic Engineering Bacteria Cell Division.png|thumb|Bacterial conjugation|333x333px]]\nBacteria can alter their genetic inheritance through two main ways, either by mutating their genetic material or acquiring a new one from other bacteria. The latter being the most important for causing antibiotic-resistant bacteria strains in animals and humans. One of the methods bacteria can obtain new genes is through a process called conjugation which deals with transferring genes using plasmids. These conjugative plasmids carry a number of genes that can be assembled and rearranged, which could then enable bacteria to exchange beneficial genes among themselves ensuring their survival against antibiotics and rendering them ineffective to treat dangerous diseases in humans, resulting into multi-drug resistant organisms.<ref>Bennett P.

There also has been an increase in the number of bacterial pathogens resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, including MRSA, which have recently emerged into different lineages. Some of them are associated with livestock and companion animals that are then able to be transmitted to humans, also called livestock-associated methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (LA-MRSA). These new lineages can be found on soft tissues of livestock workers, for example in their noses. A study looked at the association between exposure to livestock and the occurrence of LA-MRSA infection and observed that LA-MRSA infection was 9.64 times as likely to be found among livestock workers and veterinarians compared to their unexposed families and community members, showing that exposure to livestock significantly increases the risk of developing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.<ref>Chen, C., & Wu, F.

It featured [[Jayam Ravi|Ravi]] and [[Sadha]] in their first Tamil ventures respectively, with the success of the film prompting the actor to retain the film's title as a prefix to his stage name.

Till date, ''Jayam'' is the first and the only Tamil film Gopichand has performed in.\n\n==Plot==\n\n\nIn Pushpathoor, the parents of first cousins Sujatha and Raghu decide the children will marry one another when they grow up. Raghu is seen to be arrogant and negatively shaded since he was young. He smokes and steals money from his father. Once when Raghu attacks Sujatha's classmate when he helps her, Sujatha breaks all bonds with Raghu. When Raghu's family move to another village, Sujatha and Raghu do not even say goodbye to each other. Meanwhile, Raghu's father gifts Sujatha with silver anklets and requests her to never remove them, to which she obliges. Several years pass by. Raghu and Sujatha are fairly distanced. Sujatha grows up to be a beautiful teenage girl, whereas Raghu becomes a rogue and womanizer. Every time his mother speaks of Sujatha, he feels disgusted. He even goes to the extent of sleeping with his servant.\n\nMeanwhile, Sujatha goes to college where she meets Ravi. Ravi is from an extremely poor family and does small jobs to survive his only mother and pay money to the moneylender. He has a decent group of friends, and they are classmates with Sujatha. Ravi has an instant crush for Sujatha, while Sujatha does not reciprocate. Ravi asks Sujatha to come to the temple festival, to which she denies, but in the end, Sujatha comes, indicating that she is in love with Ravi. Ravi and Sujatha start dating and communicate with each other on the train by writing to each other on the blackboard at the side of the train.\n\nOnce, when building up the courage to board the same compartment in the train as Ravi, Sujatha is spotted by the family astrologer She goes home scared, and as she had expected, the astrologer had told Sujatha's father. Her father tells her that she would be married to Raghu, just like they decided years ago. Sujatha protests, but her father stays firm. This results in Sujatha dropping out from college and staying at home. Sujatha has a sister named Kalyani, who turns out to be the messenger between her and Ravi.\n\nRaghu comes for the engagement reluctantly (still thinking their childhood encounter) but instantly falls for her the moment he sees her. He warns Sujatha that she would never go away and marry him in the end. They both are engaged. The whole family go to the family temple after the engagement, and there, Sujatha sees Ravi waiting for her. She is spotted talking to Ravi by Raghu and his gang, and they mercilessly beat him up. Traumatized, Sujatha runs to her father, but Raghu indirectly warns her family that things would turn out wrong if Ravi is seen anywhere near Sujatha.\n\nRavi gets treated, and Sujatha's marriage is nearing. As a last hope, Sujatha asks her sister to inform Ravi without letting any of Raghu's men knowing. Her sister goes to the railway station and waits for Ravi. When he comes, fearing that someone would see her, she writes the details on the blackboard. She eyes him to read it and leaves in a haste and is shown that Raghu's men are actually with her. Ravi comes and reads the board. However, Sujatha's sister has a habit for writing the letters \"it\" and \"la\" in between words, making it difficult for the readers to read it. Ravi ignores the message and leaves.\n\nFearing that Ravi would come and take Sujatha away, Raghu sends his men to Ravi's house. They trash the whole house and the things inside, sparing his mother. His mother tells Ravi's friends that he should come back with Sujatha and if he does not, she herself would kill him. Ravi who somehow cracked the code that Sujatha's sister wrote, realizes that Sujatha's wedding is the next day. He then mysteriously comes into Raghu's home and writes that he would be the one marrying Sujatha in the end, in blood, triggering Raghu. The same thing happens in Sujatha's home on their wedding day.  Raghu, in a rush, asks the family to hurry and complete the wedding. Sujatha goes into the room to change, but in reality, she is waiting for Ravi, after seeing his message on the wall. Raghu comes and breaks open the door, and at the same time, Ravi comes through the roof and rescues Sujatha.\n\nAngered and defeated, Raghu goes after the couple, and a chase ensues, which results in Ravi getting wounded by Raghu. The couple and Ravi's friend who helped them escape in the train with the help of the conductor, but Raghu enters the train with his men. The couple escapes to the roof, where they are cornered. To save themselves, they jump off the train and roll down to a forest. To their shock, Raghu and his men come there as well. Raghu once more corners them and asks Ravi to fight him, face-to-face. In the end, Ravi wins, bringing out his confidence, and also wins Sujatha's hand.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Jayam Ravi|Ravi]] as Ravi\n* [[Sadha]] as Sujatha\n* [[Gopichand (actor)|Gopichand]] as Raghu\n* [[Vadivelu]] as Mahesh\n* [[Rajeev (Tamil actor)|Rajeev]] as Sujatha's father\n* [[Pragathi (actress)|Pragathi]] as Sujatha's mother\n* [[Nizhalgal Ravi]] as Raghu's father\n* [[Nalini (actress)|Nalini]] as Raghu's mother\n* [[Poornitha|Kalyani]] as Kalyani (Sujatha's sister)\n* [[Senthil]] as Maadasamy\n* [[Suman Setty]] as Alibaba\n* [[Junior Balaiah]] as Astrologer\n* [[Shakeela]] as College Professor\n* [[Ramji (actor)|Ramji]] as Akash\n* [[Ramesh Khanna]]\n* [[Mayilsamy]]\n* [[Ilavarasu]]\n* [[Manobala]] as Kamalesh\n* [[Reshmi Menon]] as Young Sujatha \n{{colend}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\nSongs and background score is handled by [[R.P.
