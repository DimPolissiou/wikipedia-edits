{"title_page": "You can shed tears that she is gone", "text_new": "\"'''You can shed tears that she is gone...'''\" is the opening line of a piece of popular verse, based on a short [[prose poem]], \"'''Remember Me'''\", written in 1982 by English painter and poet [[David Harkins]] (born 14 November 1958).  The verse &ndash; sometimes also known as \"'''She Is Gone'''\" &ndash; has often been given an anonymous attribution, but Harkins claimed his original authorship after it was chosen by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as part of the [[Funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|funeral ceremony]] for her mother, [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]], in April 2002.  It has subsequently become a popular choice to be read at funeral ceremonies, although according to Harkins it was originally written about [[unrequited love]], rather than death.\n\n==Composition==\nAt the time it was written, Harkins was a [[bakery]] worker and aspiring artist living in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Cumbria]].<ref name=seaton/>   Writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in 2003, he said:<ref name=expressions>[http://www.poeticexpressions.co.uk/poems/you%20can%20shed%20tears%20that%20she%20is%20gone.htm  \"She Is Gone\", ''Poetic Expressions'']. Retrieved 8 June 2015</ref><blockquote>I was 23 when I first met Anne Lloyd, my inspiration for the poem I called 'Remember Me'.  She was 16 and didn't know me, but I had seen her about and knocked on her door one evening in November 1981.  Anne answered, and I introduced myself as a painter (painting was a hobby of mine back then) and asked her to pose. She agreed, and I returned on the Thursday evening, when I made feeble attempts to sketch Anne.  This proved difficult as her mother was present throughout. Anne posed for me about eight times, and we met regularly for a couple of years and talked a great deal, though we never even kissed, which is probably why I poured all my feelings about her into my poetry. I completed 'Remember Me' in about March 1982...</blockquote>\n\nHarkins' original piece, originally written in [[prose]] format, started with the line: \"Do not shed tears when I have gone but smile instead because I have lived...\".  The more frequently used and widely published wording is \"You can shed tears that she is gone or you can smile because she has lived...\"  Other lines in the modern version parallel, but differ from, Harkins' original.  It is not clear by whom the changes were made.\n\n==Publication and popularity==\nIn the early 1980s Harkins sent the piece, with other poems, to various magazines and poetry publishers, without any immediate success.  Eventually it was published in a small [[anthology]] in 1999.  He later said: \"I believe a copy of 'Remember Me' was lying around in some publishers/poetry magazine office way back, someone picked it up and after reading through the piece found it appropriate for a funeral/message of condolence.\"<ref name=harkins>[http://poetrypoem.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?poemnumber=273657&sitename=davidharkins&poemoffset=2&displaypoem=t&item=poetry  David Harkins Poetry].

I wasn't aware that people were using it for words of comfort when they'd lost loved ones.\"  He said that he had given up writing verse in 1984, commenting that \"I was never a good writer, and my poetry wasn't very good either. I know that.  I'm not bitter at all.\"<ref name=seaton/>   Harkins said that he had originally written the poem down in the margin of his copy of [[Dylan Thomas]]' verse ''Once It Was The Colour Of Saying'', but after reading of its use at the Queen Mother's funeral had removed the page and sent it as a gift to [[Prince Charles]], who thanked him.<ref name=harkins/><ref name=expressions/>  \n\nAlthough Harkins wrote a one-act community play performed in Carlisle in 1987, he gave up writing soon afterwards and worked in a food factory and as a cleaner.

The verse &ndash; sometimes also known as \"'''She Is Gone'''\" &ndash; has often been given an anonymous attribution, but Harkins claimed his original authorship after it was chosen by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as part of the [[Funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|funeral ceremony]] for her mother, [[Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]], in April 2002.  It has subsequently become a popular choice to be read at funeral ceremonies, although according to Harkins it was originally written about [[unrequited love]], rather than death.\n\n==Composition==\nAt the time it was written, Harkins was a [[bakery]] worker and aspiring artist living in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Cumbria]].<ref name=seaton/>   Writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in 2003, he said:<ref name=expressions>[http://www.poeticexpressions.co.uk/poems/you%20can%20shed%20tears%20that%20she%20is%20gone.htm  \"She Is Gone\", ''Poetic Expressions''].

She was 16 and didn't know me, but I had seen her about and knocked on her door one evening in November 1981.  Anne answered, and I introduced myself as a painter (painting was a hobby of mine back then) and asked her to pose. She agreed, and I returned on the Thursday evening, when I made feeble attempts to sketch Anne.  This proved difficult as her mother was present throughout. Anne posed for me about eight times, and we met regularly for a couple of years and talked a great deal, though we never even kissed, which is probably why I poured all my feelings about her into my poetry. I completed 'Remember Me' in about March 1982...</blockquote>\n\nHarkins' original piece, originally written in [[prose]] format, started with the line: \"Do not shed tears when I have gone but smile instead because I have lived...\".  The more frequently used and widely published wording is \"You can shed tears that she is gone or you can smile because she has lived...\"  Other lines in the modern version parallel, but differ from, Harkins' original.  It is not clear by whom the changes were made.\n\n==Publication and popularity==\nIn the early 1980s Harkins sent the piece, with other poems, to various magazines and poetry publishers, without any immediate success.  Eventually it was published in a small [[anthology]] in 1999.  He later said: \"I believe a copy of 'Remember Me' was lying around in some publishers/poetry magazine office way back, someone picked it up and after reading through the piece found it appropriate for a funeral/message of condolence.\"<ref name=harkins>[http://poetrypoem.com/cgi-bin/index.pl?poemnumber=273657&sitename=davidharkins&poemoffset=2&displaypoem=t&item=poetry  David Harkins Poetry].

This is due to the tradable sector market existing beyond the borders of a local region.  This larger market allows the tradable sector to generate more revenue, have higher salaries, and increase in size independent of the local economic climate.\n\nThe size of the multiplier effect on the non-tradable sector is determined by the interplay of three factors: consumer preference for non-tradables, the types of jobs created, and  the elasticity of local labor and housing supply.  Consumer preference refers to certain non-tradable goods and services requiring more workers to provide them than others.  If the tradable industry has high demand for a type of non-tradable good that needs more workers to be produced then the multiplier will be higher.  Types of jobs created refers to the fact that certain job categories generally have higher pay than others.  Higher pay results in larger amounts of disposable income that can be spent on the local economy.  This results in a higher multiplier.  Elasticity of local labor and housing supply refers to that the fact whenever there is an influx of new people with higher than average wages to an area, average prices will rise. This can in turn push out some residents with below average wages into lower cost areas.  This results in a lower multiplier.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moretti | first1 = Enrico | year = 2010 | title = Local multipliers | url = | journal = American Economic Review: Papers and Proceedings | volume = 100 | issue = 2| pages = 1\u20137 | doi = 10.1257/aer.100.2.1 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.216.691 }}</ref>\n\nEconomists also argue that certain industries have stronger agglomeration economies than other industries, which can magnify the strength of the multiplier effect.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moretti | first1 = Enrico | last2 = Wilson | first2 = Daniel J. | year = 2014 | title = State incentives for innovation, star scientists and jobs: Evidence from biotech | url =http://www.nber.org/papers/w19294.pdf | journal = Journal of Urban Economics | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 20\u201338 | doi = 10.1016/j.jue.2013.07.002 }}</ref>  Further, the magnitude is affected by local regional and political factors such as the unemployment levels<ref>J.J. van Dijk Local Employment Multipliers in U.S. cities  http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/13625/paper730.pdf</ref>  and level of government intervention in the economy and labor market.<ref>Guido de Blasio e Carlo Menon.

The New Geography Of Jobs</ref>\n\n===Research===\n\n====United States====\nSeveral scholars have found strong evidence for the presence of the local multiplier effect.  Within tradable industries, Enrico Moretti discovered that, for each additional skilled job created, 2.5 jobs were also generated in the local non-tradable goods and services sectors, and an additional unskilled job created 1 job in the local non-tradable sector.<ref>Moretti, Enrico.

Moretti cites the example of Apple Computers which directly employs only 13,000 workers but generates 60,000 additional service jobs in the area.  Of those 60,000, 36,000 are unskilled, such as restaurant or retail workers, while 24,000 are skilled jobs such as doctors or lawyers.<ref>Moretti, Enrico.  The New Geography Of Jobs</ref>\nOther academics have taken issue with the large magnitude of the local multiplier effect claimed by Moretti.  One study reanalyzes the claim of Enrico Moretti that five non-tradable jobs are created for each highly skilled tradable job.  Using a modified version of Moretti's method it found that the true multiplier effect was only 1.02 non-tradable jobs created.  Furthermore the study finds that there is no difference on the local multiplier effect between whether the tradable job is skilled or unskilled.<ref>J.J. van Dijk Local Employment Multipliers in U.S. cities  http://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/materials/papers/13625/paper730.pdf</ref>\n\n====Sweden====\nA comparison study of local multiplier effects in Sweden revealed similar multiplier effects as those found in the United States.  The study found that while sizable effects did occur, on average, they were smaller than the effects found in the United States.  For Sweden, adding a high-skilled job to the traded sector resulted in the creation of 3 additional jobs in the non-traded sector, as opposed to the 5 additional jobs created in the United States.  The authors argue the difference is due to the difference in local factors.  For example, Sweden's relatively smaller wage difference between skilled and unskilled workers negatively impacts the overall multiplier effect.<ref>Enrico Moretti* and Per Thulin**, Local multipliers and human capital in the United States and Sweden Industrial and Corporate Change, Volume 22, Number 1, pp. 339\u2013362</ref>\n\n====Italy====\nAnother study conducted in Italy using the same methodology as Morretti concluded that, in Italy, there was no evidence of a local multiplier effect from the creation of tradable jobs on the rest of the local economy.  The study found the local multiplier effect to be zero and occasionally negative in all regions of Italy.  In explaining this discrepancy, the authors points to excessive government regulation in the non-tradable sector, the government's role in wage setting, and  barriers to labor mobility.<ref>Guido de Blasio e Carlo Menon.

The study found that while sizable effects did occur, on average, they were smaller than the effects found in the United States.  For Sweden, adding a high-skilled job to the traded sector resulted in the creation of 3 additional jobs in the non-traded sector, as opposed to the 5 additional jobs created in the United States.  The authors argue the difference is due to the difference in local factors.  For example, Sweden's relatively smaller wage difference between skilled and unskilled workers negatively impacts the overall multiplier effect.<ref>Enrico Moretti* and Per Thulin**, Local multipliers and human capital in the United States and Sweden Industrial and Corporate Change, Volume 22, Number 1, pp. 339\u2013362</ref>\n\n====Italy====\nAnother study conducted in Italy using the same methodology as Morretti concluded that, in Italy, there was no evidence of a local multiplier effect from the creation of tradable jobs on the rest of the local economy.  The study found the local multiplier effect to be zero and occasionally negative in all regions of Italy.  In explaining this discrepancy, the authors points to excessive government regulation in the non-tradable sector, the government's role in wage setting, and  barriers to labor mobility.<ref>Guido de Blasio e Carlo Menon.

end}}\n\n==Comparison with COMMAND.COM==\nOn Windows, {{mono|cmd.exe}} is mostly compatible with {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} but provides the following extensions over it:\n\n* More detailed error messages than the blanket \"[[Bad command or file name]]\" (in the case of malformed commands) of {{mono|COMMAND.COM}}. In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.\n* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under [[DR DOS]] (through [[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]]) and later via a external component called {{mono|[[DOSKEY]]}}.)\n* Adds [[command-line completion]] for file and folder paths.\n* Treats the [[caret]] character ({{mono|^}}) as the [[escape character]]; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in {{mono|cmd.exe}} and {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} (e.g. \"{{mono|<}}\", \"{{mono|>}}\" and \"|\") that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.\n* Supports delayed variable expansion with [[SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion]], allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using [[control structures]] hard and complex.<ref name=\"Delay\"/> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.\n\nInternal commands have also been improved:\n\n* The {{mono|[[DELTREE]]}} command was merged into the {{mono|[[RMDIR|RD]]}} command, as part of its {{mono|/S}} [[Switch (command line)|switch]].\n* {{mono|SetLocal}} and {{mono|EndLocal}} commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after {{mono|SetLocal}} commands are local to the [[batch file]]. {{mono|EndLocal}} command restores the previous settings.<ref name=\"SetLocal\"/>\n* The {{mono|Call}} command allows subroutines within batch file. The {{mono|Call}} command in {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} only supports calling external batch files.\n* File name parser extensions to the {{mono|Set}} command are comparable with [[C shell]].{{Elucidate|reason=|date=October 2015}}\n* The {{mono|Set}} command can perform [[Expression Evaluation|expression evaluation]].\n* An expansion of the {{mono|[[For loop|For]]}} command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.\n* The new {{mono|[[PUSHD|PushD]]}} and {{mono|[[POPD|PopD]]}} commands provide access past navigated paths similar to \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons in a web browser or [[File Explorer]].\n* The conditional {{mono|IF}} command can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons. (This was available in DR-DOS, but not in [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] or [[MS-DOS]].)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Windows Terminal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\">{{Cite book |title=Showstopper!

end}}\n\n==Comparison with COMMAND.COM==\nOn Windows, {{mono|cmd.exe}} is mostly compatible with {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} but provides the following extensions over it:\n\n* More detailed error messages than the blanket \"[[Bad command or file name]]\" (in the case of malformed commands) of {{mono|COMMAND.COM}}. In OS/2, errors are reported in the chosen language of the system, their text being taken from the system message files. The {{mono|[[help (command)|HELP]]}} command can then be issued with the error message number to obtain further information.\n* Supports using of arrow keys to scroll through command history. (Under DOS this function was only available under [[DR DOS]] (through [[HISTORY (CONFIG.SYS directive)|HISTORY]]) and later via a external component called {{mono|[[DOSKEY]]}}.)\n* Adds [[command-line completion]] for file and folder paths.\n* Treats the [[caret]] character ({{mono|^}}) as the [[escape character]]; the character following it is to be taken literally. There are special characters in {{mono|cmd.exe}} and {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} (e.g. \"{{mono|<}}\", \"{{mono|>}}\" and \"|\") that are meant to alter the behavior of the command line processor. The caret character forces the command line processor to interpret them literally.\n* Supports delayed variable expansion with [[SETLOCAL EnableDelayedExpansion]], allowing values of variables to be calculated at runtime instead of during parsing of script before execution (Windows 2000 and later), fixing DOS idioms that made using [[control structures]] hard and complex.<ref name=\"Delay\"/> The extensions can be disabled, providing a stricter compatibility mode.\n\nInternal commands have also been improved:\n\n* The {{mono|[[DELTREE]]}} command was merged into the {{mono|[[RMDIR|RD]]}} command, as part of its {{mono|/S}} [[Switch (command line)|switch]].\n* {{mono|SetLocal}} and {{mono|EndLocal}} commands limit the scope of changes to the environment. Changes made to the command line environment after {{mono|SetLocal}} commands are local to the [[batch file]]. {{mono|EndLocal}} command restores the previous settings.<ref name=\"SetLocal\"/>\n* The {{mono|Call}} command allows subroutines within batch file. The {{mono|Call}} command in {{mono|COMMAND.COM}} only supports calling external batch files.\n* File name parser extensions to the {{mono|Set}} command are comparable with [[C shell]].{{Elucidate|reason=|date=October 2015}}\n* The {{mono|Set}} command can perform [[Expression Evaluation|expression evaluation]].\n* An expansion of the {{mono|[[For loop|For]]}} command supports parsing files and arbitrary sets in addition to file names.\n* The new {{mono|[[PUSHD|PushD]]}} and {{mono|[[POPD|PopD]]}} commands provide access past navigated paths similar to \"forward\" and \"back\" buttons in a web browser or [[File Explorer]].\n* The conditional {{mono|IF}} command can perform [[Case sensitivity|case-insensitive]] comparisons and numeric equality and inequality comparisons in addition to case-sensitive string comparisons. (This was available in DR-DOS, but not in [[PC&nbsp;DOS]] or [[MS-DOS]].)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Windows Terminal]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Zachary_1994\">{{Cite book |title=Showstopper!

They come up with shortlists of suspects among known criminals and [[Bruce Reynolds]] is on that list. A \u00a310,000 reward for information leads to a tip from a neighbour about the rented farmhouse, but they are soon drowning in hoax callers and fake tips.

An additional $100,000 of matching support from [[Craig Newmark]]'s [[News Integrity Initiative]] was also expected.<ref name=Medium/>.\n\nIn a [[Medium (website)|Medium]] post published in May 2017, WikiTribune said it had met its funding goal, but would not start operations until later that year:<ref name=Mediapost />\n\n{{Quote|Despite lots of confused comments, the end of the crowdfunding campaign doesn't mean an instantaneous launch. It means we've got enough support to start making the project happen, which involves hiring for, designing and building WikiTribune from scratch. ... We don\u2019t have an exact date, but we're aiming to be up and running \u2013 that means producing content \u2013 by Autumn this year. We\u2019ll do it faster if we can, but only if we can do it right.}}\n\nIn a [[Medium (website)|Medium]] post published in July 2017, WikiTribune introduced three of their initial ten journalists as Holly Brockwell, Harry Ridgewell, and Linh Nguyen.<ref name=Introduction/>\n\nOn October 23, 2018, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that WikiTribune had laid off its team of reporters and editors, \"a year after it launched with a promise to reinvent journalism.\" Volunteers could then publish articles without having them checked by professionals, although a new team of journalists purportedly was to be hired to work in support roles. \"Despite the best efforts of staff, the overall structure and design didn't let the community genuinely flourish,\" said founder Jimmy Wales. \"We didn't get very much work done.\" Funded by donations rather than advertisers, the site remained free to access.<ref name=LaidOff/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[Adrienne LaFrance]] reviewed the WikiTribune proposal in ''[[The Atlantic]]''. She had previously worked at the ''[[Honolulu Civil Beat]]'', which was founded by [[Pierre Omidyar]] with similar ideas of \"peer news\". LaFrance thought the plan was over-ambitious as a staff of ten was insufficient to cover global news stories and managing volunteer input would be time-consuming.<ref name=Atlantic/>\n\n[[Andrew Lih]], a researcher at the [[American University]]'s school of communication, expected WikiTribune's hybrid approach to be more successful than the volunteer-only model of [[Wikinews]]: \"You have an operational command structure that\u2019s based on full-time staff. The pro journalists and editors provide the supervision on how the story moves forward. The crowd does the heavy lifting on a lot of the combing, sifting, searching, checking. You let the crowd do what the crowd is good at.\"<ref name=Nieman/>\n\n[[Sarah Baxter]], deputy editor of the ''[[Sunday Times]]'', addressed WikiTribune in the newspaper in April 2017 in \"Wikipedia won't break real news, just tweak it\". After critical remarks on the [[reliability of Wikipedia]], she said: \"It's the warp and weft of debate in the free press, whether digital or print, that gets to the heart of the truth, not the wacky wisdom of self-appointed crowds.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/wikipedia-wont-break-real-news-just-tweak-it-m6jc3pg3j|title=Wikipedia won't break real news, just tweak it|publisher=Sunday Times|date=30 April 2017|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Emily Bell]], director of the [[Tow Center for Digital Journalism]], reviewed coverage of the project four days after the initial announcement.  She said that there was considerable scepticism which was apparent in an [[Reddit#IAmA and AMA|Ask Me Anything]] session held by Wales.
