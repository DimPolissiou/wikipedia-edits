The corridor is also known as the \"Ljubljana Gate\".\n\nBy the autumn of 1915 one mile had been won by Italian troops, and by October 1917 a few Austrian mountains and some square miles of land had changed hands several times. Italian troops did not reach the port of [[Trieste]], the Italian General Luigi Cadorna's initial target, until after the [[Armistice]].<ref>A War in Words, p.163, Simon & Schuster, 2003 {{ISBN|0-7432-4831-7}}</ref>\n\n==Primary sector for Italian operations==\nWith the rest of the mountainous 400-mile length of the Front being almost everywhere dominated by Austro-Hungarian forces, the [[So\u010da]] (Isonzo) was the only practical area for Italian military operations during the war. The Austrians had fortified the mountains {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} ahead of the Italians' entry into the war on 23 May 1915.\n\nItalian Chief of Staff [[Luigi Cadorna]] judged that Italian gains (from Gorizia to [[Trieste]]) were most feasible at the coastal plain east of the lower end of the [[So\u010da]] (Isonzo). However he also believed that the Italian army could strike further north and bypass the mountains on either side of the river so as to come at the Austro-Hungarian forces from the rear.\n\nCadorna had not expected operations in the Isonzo sector to be easy. He was well aware that the river was prone to flooding \u2014 and indeed there were record rainfalls during 1914\u201318.\n\nFurther, when attacking further north the Italian army was faced with something of a dilemma: in order to cross the Isonzo safely it needed to neutralise the Austro-Hungarian defenders on the mountains above, yet to neutralise these forces the Italian forces needed first to cross the river \u2014 an obstacle that the Italians never succeeded in overcoming.\n\nIn the south (along the coastal zone) geographic peculiarities, including an array of ridges and valleys, also gave an advantage to the Austro-Hungarian defenders.\n\n==Casualties==\n[[file:\u00dcberschiffung von Truppen \u00fcber den Jsonzo bei Canziano 31.11.17. (BildID 15608586).jpg|thumb|right|Austrian troops crossing the Isonzo, November 1917]]\nDespite the huge effort and resources poured into the continuing Isonzo struggle, the results were invariably disappointing and without real tactical merit, particularly given the geographical difficulties that were inherent in the campaign.\n\nCumulative casualties of the numerous battles of the Isonzo were enormous. Half of the entire Italian war death total \u2014 some 300,000 of 600,000 \u2014 were suffered along the [[So\u010da]] (Isonzo). Austro-Hungarian losses, while by no means as numerous, were nevertheless high at around 200,000 (of an overall total of around 1.2&nbsp;million casualties).<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/isonzo.htm FirstWorldWar.Com ''The Battles of the Isonzo, 1915-17.'']</ref>\n\nMore than 30,000 casualties were ethnic Slovenes, the majority of them being drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], while Slovene civilian inhabitants from the [[Gorizia and Gradisca]] region also suffered in many thousands because they were resettled in [[refugee camps]] where Slovene refugees were treated as state enemies by Italians, and some thousands died of malnutrition in Italian refugee camps.<ref>Petra Svolj\u0161ak, ''Slovenski begunci v Italiji med prvo svetovno vojno'' (Ljubljana 1991).</ref>\n\n==Number of battles==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-073-25, Isonzo-Schlacht, Trainkolonne am Moistroka-Pass.jpg|thumb|22opx|Austro-Hungarian supply line over the [[Vr\u0161i\u010d Pass]].

The corridor is also known as the \"Ljubljana Gate\".\n\nBy the autumn of 1915 one mile had been won by Italian troops, and by October 1917 a few Austrian mountains and some square miles of land had changed hands several times. Italian troops did not reach the port of [[Trieste]], the Italian General Luigi Cadorna's initial target, until after the [[Armistice]].<ref>A War in Words, p.163, Simon & Schuster, 2003 {{ISBN|0-7432-4831-7}}</ref>\n\n==Primary sector for Italian operations==\nWith the rest of the mountainous 400-mile length of the Front being almost everywhere dominated by Austro-Hungarian forces, the [[So\u010da]] (Isonzo) was the only practical area for Italian military operations during the war. The Austrians had fortified the mountains {{citation needed|date=April 2013}} ahead of the Italians' entry into the war on 23 May 1915.\n\nItalian Chief of Staff [[Luigi Cadorna]] judged that Italian gains (from Gorizia to [[Trieste]]) were most feasible at the coastal plain east of the lower end of the [[So\u010da]] (Isonzo). However he also believed that the Italian army could strike further north and bypass the mountains on either side of the river so as to come at the Austro-Hungarian forces from the rear.\n\nCadorna had not expected operations in the Isonzo sector to be easy. He was well aware that the river was prone to flooding \u2014 and indeed there were record rainfalls during 1914\u201318.\n\nFurther, when attacking further north the Italian army was faced with something of a dilemma: in order to cross the Isonzo safely it needed to neutralise the Austro-Hungarian defenders on the mountains above, yet to neutralise these forces the Italian forces needed first to cross the river \u2014 an obstacle that the Italians never succeeded in overcoming.\n\nIn the south (along the coastal zone) geographic peculiarities, including an array of ridges and valleys, also gave an advantage to the Austro-Hungarian defenders.\n\n==Casualties==\n[[file:\u00dcberschiffung von Truppen \u00fcber den Jsonzo bei Canziano 31.11.17. (BildID 15608586).jpg|thumb|right|Austrian troops crossing the Isonzo, November 1917]]\nDespite the huge effort and resources poured into the continuing Isonzo struggle, the results were invariably disappointing and without real tactical merit, particularly given the geographical difficulties that were inherent in the campaign.\n\nCumulative casualties of the numerous battles of the Isonzo were enormous. Half of the entire Italian war death total \u2014 some 300,000 of 600,000 \u2014 were suffered along the [[So\u010da]] (Isonzo). Austro-Hungarian losses, while by no means as numerous, were nevertheless high at around 200,000 (of an overall total of around 1.2&nbsp;million casualties).<ref>[http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/isonzo.htm FirstWorldWar.Com ''The Battles of the Isonzo, 1915-17.'']</ref>\n\nMore than 30,000 casualties were ethnic Slovenes, the majority of them being drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], while Slovene civilian inhabitants from the [[Gorizia and Gradisca]] region also suffered in many thousands because they were resettled in [[refugee camps]] where Slovene refugees were treated as state enemies by Italians, and some thousands died of malnutrition in Italian refugee camps.<ref>Petra Svolj\u0161ak, ''Slovenski begunci v Italiji med prvo svetovno vojno'' (Ljubljana 1991).</ref>\n\n==Number of battles==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1970-073-25, Isonzo-Schlacht, Trainkolonne am Moistroka-Pass.jpg|thumb|22opx|Austro-Hungarian supply line over the [[Vr\u0161i\u010d Pass]].

expropriated in 1938, it was demolished in July 1939 for the enlargement of Borgo Sant'Angelo and of via della Traspontina, as part of the works for the opening of [[Via della Conciliazione]].<ref name=gi9068/>\n\nAfter the demolition of its seat, in 1969 the archconfraternity was merged with that of [[Santa Maria Annunziata in Borgo]] and since then it has been officiating in the rebuilt [[Santa Maria Annunziata in Borgo|oratory of the Annunziata]] (\"la Nunziatina\") on [[Lungotevere Vaticano]].<ref name=gi9068/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Borgo - oratorio dell Annunziata - Madonna del latte (Antoniazzo) 1010915.JPG|thumb|''[[Nursing Madonna]]'', fresco attributed to [[Antoniazzo Romano]], once in the church, now in the ''Nunziatina'' oratory.]]\n\n===Architecture===\nThe facade of the church had one [[Classical order|order]] surmounted by an [[attic]].<ref name=gi9070>Gigli (1990) p. 70</ref> The lower part had a [[Portal (architecture)|portal]] flanked by two [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] and was marked by [[pilaster]]s, while the attic was divided by frames separated by tapered pilasters.<ref name=gi9070/> The crowning of the facade was a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] surmounted by two oriflammes, which framed a [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] bearing the [[latin language|latin]] inscription: \"DIVO MICHAELI ARCHANGELO\".<ref name=gi9070/><ref name=gia146/> On the roof between the church and the oratory stood a [[bell-gable]].<ref name=gia146/>\n\n===Interior===\nThe church had a single [[nave]] with only one [[chapel]] dedicated to the Virgin on the left side of the first [[Bay (architecture)|bay]].<ref name=gia145/> The shrine had three [[Altar in the Catholic Church|altar]]s: on the main one there was a painting of St. Michael by [[Giovanni de Vecchi]]; the one on the right was dedicated to the [[crucifix]], the one on the left to the [[Virgin Mary]], with [[fresco]]es by [[Giovanni Battista della Marca]], a [[mannerism|late Mannerist]] painter, including the ''Procession of Saint Gregory the Great'', commissioned by the confraternity with the aim of reinforcing the foundation legend and so increasing its prestige.<ref name=gi9070/><ref name=gia145/><ref name=gia146/>\n\nThe church housed several works of art, including a painting by della Marca depicting the apparition of Michael the Archangel on the top of the castle and a bronze statue of the Archangel by the French sculptor [[Louis-Albert Lefeuvre]] donated by [[Pope Leo XIII]] (r. 1878-1903).<ref name=gi9070/> On the ceiling there was a late 17th-century [[fresco]] of the Archangel subduing [[satan|the devil]].<ref name=gia147>Giacomini (2016) p. 147</ref>\n\nThe [[sacristy]] housed one of the most interesting documents of the early Roman Middle Ages: the [[pavonazzetto marble]] tombstone of the [[notary]] Eugenius in memory of his son Boetius, who died aged 11 on 25 October 577, and of his wife Argenta, deceased seven months later.<ref name=gi9070/><ref name=gia148>Giacomini (2016) p. 148</ref> The [[stele]], perhaps originally in the [[quadriporticus]] of the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], was moved here during the 16th century.<ref name=gi9070/>\n\nIn the courtyard of the church, in a niche of the ''passetto'', in 1825 a [[fresco]] by [[Antoniazzo Romano]] depicting the ''Madonna del latte col Bambino''  (\"[[Nursing Madonna]]\") was discovered by accident.<ref name=gi9070/><ref name=gia148>Giacomini (2016) p. 148</ref> The Madonna, which was later [[Coronation of the Virgin|crowned]] under the name of ''Refugium Peccatorum'' (\"shelter of the sinners\"), was detached from the wall and exhibited to the [[veneration]] of the faithful above the left altar of the church, a work by [[Giuseppe Valadier]].<ref name=gi9070/>\n\nIn 1867 the [[lunette]]s of the church were [[fresco]]ed by Attilio Palombi with scenes from the life of the confraternity.<ref name=gi9070/> On the same occasion, the remaking of the marble pavement caused the dispersion of several medieval tombstones.<ref name=gi9070/> \n\nDue to the merging of the archconfraternity with that of Santa Maria Annunziata, after the demolition of the church almost all the furnishings and works of art contained there, included the ''Nursing Madonna'' and the fresco by della Marca, were moved to the nearby ''Nunziatina'' Oratory.<ref name=gi9070/>\nSome architectural elements of the building, dismantled during the demolition, are preserved in the municipal storerooms.<ref name=gia148/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book\n | author=Borgatti, Mariano\n | title=Borgo e S.

It began on 30 August 2009 with the first matches of the ranking groups and will end in late May 2010 with the last matches of the promotion playoffs.\n\n== Competition format ==\nThe 2009\u201310 season started with 45 teams distributed over four \"ranking groups\". Each ranking group comprised eleven teams (with the exception of Group 3, which featured twelve teams) according to geographical criteria. The teams of each group played a conventional double round-robin schedule against the other teams of their group.\n\nUpon conclusion of the ranking groups, the best two sides of each eleven-team group and the best three sides of the twelve-team group advanced to the \"promotion group\", while the remaining nine teams remained in their respective groups, which were now called \"classification groups\". The teams of the classification groups retained their complete records in the process. As in the previous round, each team played a double round-robin schedule against the other teams of its respective group.\n\nA total of three promotion spots to the [[TFF First League]] were played out. Two of them were reserved for the best two teams of the promotion group, which were directly promoted. The third spot was decided through a play-off round and was competed among the teams ranked third through sixth of the promotion group and the winners of the four classification groups.

It began on 30 August 2009 with the first matches of the ranking groups and will end in late May 2010 with the last matches of the promotion playoffs.\n\n== Competition format ==\nThe 2009\u201310 season started with 45 teams distributed over four \"ranking groups\". Each ranking group comprised eleven teams (with the exception of Group 3, which featured twelve teams) according to geographical criteria. The teams of each group played a conventional double round-robin schedule against the other teams of their group.\n\nUpon conclusion of the ranking groups, the best two sides of each eleven-team group and the best three sides of the twelve-team group advanced to the \"promotion group\", while the remaining nine teams remained in their respective groups, which were now called \"classification groups\". The teams of the classification groups retained their complete records in the process. As in the previous round, each team played a double round-robin schedule against the other teams of its respective group.\n\nA total of three promotion spots to the [[TFF First League]] were played out. Two of them were reserved for the best two teams of the promotion group, which were directly promoted. The third spot was decided through a play-off round and was competed among the teams ranked third through sixth of the promotion group and the winners of the four classification groups. The bottom three teams of the classification groups were directly relegated to the [[TFF Third League]].\n\n== Teams ==\n{{Location map+|Turkey |width=800 |float=left |caption=Locations of teams in the 2009\u201310 TFF Second League.<br/>Key: Red \u2013 Promotion Group, Black \u2013 CG1, Blue \u2013 CG2, Green \u2013 CG3, Purple \u2013 CG4 |places=\n<!--PROMOTION GROUP-->\n{{Location map~|Turkey|marksize=8|lat=39.866667 |long=32.866667 |label=[[Etimesgut \u015eekerspor|ETI]]<br>[[T\u00fcrk Telekom Gen\u00e7lik Spor Kul\u00fcb\u00fc|TEL]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|marksize=8|lat=38.8333 |long=28.1667 |label=[[Akhisar B.G.S.|AKH]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|marksize=8|lat=40.533333 |long=34.95 |label=[[\u00c7orumspor|\u00c7OR]] |position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|marksize=8|lat=38.433333 |long=27.15 |label=[[G\u00f6ztepe A.\u015e.|G\u00d6Z]] |position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|marksize=8|lat=41.016667 |long=28.966667 |label=[[G\u00fcng\u00f6ren Belediye Spor|G\u00dcN]]<br/>&nbsp; |position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|marksize=8|lat=37.066667 |long=37.383333 |label=[[\u015eanl\u0131urfaspor|\u015eAN]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|marksize=8|lat=40.316667 |long=36.55 |label=[[Tokatspor|TOK]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|marksize=8|lat=36.5817 |long=36.165 |label=[[\u0130skenderun Demir \u00c7elikspor|\u0130D\u00c7]]}}\n<!--CLASSIFICATION GROUP 1-->\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=black_pog.svg||lat=40.766667 |long=29.916667 |label=[[K\u00f6rfez Belediyespor|K\u00d6R]] |position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=black_pog.svg||lat=39.416667 |long=29.983333 |label=[[TK\u0130 Tav\u015fanl\u0131 Linyitspor|TK\u0130]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=black_pog.svg||lat=40.98 |long=28.9 |label=[[Beykoz 1908 S.K.D.|BEY]]<br>[[Ey\u00fcpspor|EYP]]<br>[[\u0130stanbulspor A.\u015e.|\u0130ST]]<br>[[Pendikspor|PEN]]<br>[[Sar\u0131yer G.K.|SAR]]<br>[[Tepecik B.S.|TEP]]<br>[[Zeytinburnuspor|ZEY]] |position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=black_pog.svg|lat=40.8 |long=29.433333 |label=[[Gebzespor|GEB]] |position=top}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=black_pog.svg|lat=39.907778 |long=30.036667 |label=[[Boz\u00fcy\u00fckspor|BOZ]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=black_pog.svg|lat=40.65 |long=29.266667 |label=[[Yalovaspor|YAL]] |position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=black_pog.svg|lat=40.783333 |long=30.4 |label=[[Sakaryaspor|SAK]]}}\n<!--CLASSIFICATION GROUP 2-->\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=blue_pog.svg||lat=40.93 |long=28.97 |label=<!--See Istanbul Group 1 clubs-->}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=blue_pog.svg|lat=38.8333 |long=28.1667 |label=[[Turgutluspor|TUR]] |position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=blue_pog.svg|lat=36.55 |long=32 |label=[[Alanyaspor|ALA]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=blue_pog.svg|lat=37.766667 |long=29.083333 |label=[[Denizli B.S.K.|DEN]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=blue_pog.svg|lat=36.651389 |long=29.123056 |label=[[Fethiyespor|FET]] |position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=blue_pog.svg|lat=37.866667 |long=32.483333 |label=[[Konya \u015eeker S.K.|K\u015eE]]}}\n<!--CLASSIFICATION GROUP 3-->\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=green_pog.svg|lat=39.84 |long=32.83 |label=[[ABB Bugsa\u015f S.K.|BUG]]<br>[[Pursaklarspor A.\u015e.|PUR]] |position=left}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=green_pog.svg|lat=41 |long=39.733333 |label=[[Ofspor|OF]]<br>[[Trabzon Karadenizspor|TKA]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=green_pog.svg|lat=40.6 |long=33.616667 |label=[[\u00c7ank\u0131r\u0131 Belediye Spor|\u00c7AN]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=green_pog.svg|lat=39.9 |long=41.27 |label=[[Erzurumspor|ERZ]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=green_pog.svg|lat=39.15 |long=34.166667 |label=[[Yeni K\u0131r\u015fehirspor|YKI]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=green_pog.svg|lat=40.616667 |long=43.1 |label=[[Karsspor|KRS]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=green_pog.svg|lat=41.016667 |long=39.583333 |label=[[Ak\u00e7aabat Sebatspor|ASB]] |position=left}}\n<!--CLASSIFICATION GROUP 4-->\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=purple_pog.svg|lat=37 |long=35.321333 |label=[[Adana Demirspor|ADD]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=purple_pog.svg|lat=38.683333 |long=39.216667 |label=[[Elaz\u0131\u011fspor|ELA]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=purple_pog.svg|lat=38.066667 |long=38.016667 |label=[[Malatyaspor|MAL]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=purple_pog.svg|lat=37.9819 |long=40.2106 |label=[[Diskispor|DIS]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=purple_pog.svg|lat=38.494167 |long=43.38 |label=[[Belediye Vanspor|VAN]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=purple_pog.svg|lat=37.583333 |long=36.933333 |label=[[Kahramanmara\u015fspor|KHM]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=purple_pog.svg|lat=37.764167 |long=38.276167 |label=[[Ad\u0131yamanspor|ADI]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=purple_pog.svg|lat=37.316667 |long=40.737778 |label=[[Mardinspor|MAR]]}}\n{{Location map~|Turkey|mark=purple_pog.svg|lat=36.916667 |long=34.9 |label=[[Tarsus Idman Yurdu|T\u0130Y]] |position=left}}\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The Thirteen Colonies had very similar political, constitutional, and legal systems, and were dominated by Protestant English-speakers. The northern colonies were founded primarily for religious reasons, while the southern colonies were founded for financial profit and business expansion. All thirteen were part of [[British America|Britain's possessions]] in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada, Florida, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe colonial population grew from about 2,000 to 2.4 million between 1625 and 1775, sometimes displacing American Indians. This population included people subject to a system of [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slavery]] which was legal in all of the colonies prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=\"Rodriguez2007\">{{cite book|author=Junius P. Rodriguez|title=Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X44KbDBl9gC&pg=PA88|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-544-5|page=88}}</ref> In the 18th century, the British government operated its colonies under a policy of [[mercantilism]], in which the central government administered its possessions for the economic benefit of the mother country.\n\nThe Thirteen Colonies had a high degree of self-governance and active local elections, and they resisted London's demands for more control. The [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \"[[Rights of Englishmen|Rights as Englishmen]]\", especially the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\". Grievances with the British government led to the [[American Revolution]], in which the colonies worked together to form the [[Continental Congress]]. The colonists fought the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383) with the aid of the [[Kingdom of France]] and, to a much smaller degree, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Kingdom of Spain]].<ref>Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\n== British colonies ==\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in America. The London Company established the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]] in 1607, the first permanently settled English colony on the continent. The Plymouth Company founded the [[Popham Colony]] on the [[Kennebec River]], but it was short-lived. The [[Plymouth Council for New England]] sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620 which was settled by English Puritan separatists, known today as the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].<ref>Richter, pp. 152\u201353</ref> The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown. The Thirteen Colonies were complete with the establishment of the [[Province of Georgia]] in 1732, although the term \"Thirteen Colonies\" became current only in the context of the [[American Revolution]].<ref>The number 13 is mentioned as early as 1720 by [[Abel Boyer]], ''The Political State of Great Britain'' vol. 19, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M31YAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA376 p. 376]: \"so in this Country we have Thirteen Colonies at least severally govern'd by their respective Commanders in Chief, according to their peculiar Laws and Constitutions.\" This includes Carolina as a single colony and does not include Georgia, but instead counts Nova Scotia and [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]] as British colonies. Also see [[John Roebuck]], ''An Enquiry, Whether the Guilt of the Present Civil War in America, Ought to be Imputed to Great Britain Or America'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=lqdbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA21  p. 21]: \"though the colonies be thus absolutely subject to the parliament of England, the individuals of which the colony consist, may enjoy security, and freedom; there is not a single inhabitant, of the thirteen colonies, now in arms, but who may be conscious of the truth of this assertion\". ''The critical review, or annals of literature'' vol. 48 (1779), [https://books.google.com/books?id=F4tKAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA136  p. 136]: \"during the last war, no part of his majesty's dominions contained a greater proportion of faithful subjects than the Thirteen Colonies.\"</ref>\n\nIn London beginning in 1660, all colonies were governed through a state department known as the Southern Department, and a committee of the Privy Council called the [[Board of Trade and Plantations]].  In 1768, a specific state department was created for America, but it was disbanded in 1782 when the Home Office took responsibility.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/colonial-office/ |title=Colonial Office |last=Foulds |first=Nancy Brown |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |language=en |access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref>\n\n=== New England colonies ===\n{{main|New England Colonies}}\n1.

It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]] who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]].<ref>Robert M. Weir, ''Colonial South Carolina: A History'' (1983).</ref>\n\n===New England===\nThe [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the Church of England, which they perceived as corrupted. They initially moved to the Netherlands, but eventually sailed to America in 1620 on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Upon their arrival, they drew up the [[Mayflower Compact]], by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.<ref>Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War Paperback'' (2007).</ref>\n\nMore Puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, ideologically pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards'' (1995).</ref>\n\n[[Roger Williams]] established [[Providence Plantations]] in 1636 on land provided by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] sachem [[Canonicus]]. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements; he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution, providing for majority rule \"in civil things\" and \"liberty of conscience\" in religious matters.<ref name=\"taylor\"/><ref>Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)</ref> In 1637, a second group including [[Anne Hutchinson]] established a second settlement on [[Aquidneck Island]], also known as Rhode Island.\n\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]]. Massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\n\nIn 1685, King [[James II of England]] closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]], putting the region under control of Governor [[Edmund Andros]]. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. Andros was overthrown and the dominion was closed in 1689, after the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed King James II; the former colonies were re-established.<ref name=\"HallLederKammen2012\">{{cite book|editor1=Michael G.

The [[Dutch West India Company]] established permanent settlements on the Hudson River, creating the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. In 1626, [[Peter Minuit]] purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the [[Lenape]] Indians and established the outpost of [[New Amsterdam]].<ref>Richter, pp. 138\u201340</ref> Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 159\u2013\n60</ref> It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships.<ref>Richter pp. 212\u201313</ref> The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning [[Atlantic slave trade]], supplying enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America and [[Barbados]].<ref>Richter pp. 214\u201315</ref> The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did.

Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany, while people from New England started moving in as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.<ref>Michael G.

From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 319\u201322</ref> The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the [[Province of North-Carolina]] and the [[Province of South Carolina]]. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 323\u201324</ref>\n\n[[File:North America 1748.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748]]\nIn the 1730s, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentarian]] [[James Oglethorpe]] proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \"worthy poor\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on June 9, 1732.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp Colonial charters, grants and related documents]</ref> Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 358\u201359</ref>\n\nThe colonial population of Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the Thirteen Colonies stood at 1.5 million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of [[British North America]].<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 20</ref> More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and [[Boston]] had a population in excess of 16,000, which was small by European standards.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 23</ref> By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the [[gross domestic product]] of the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 25</ref>\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the [[Ohio River]] valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases.<ref>Richter, pp. 373\u201374</ref> Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the [[Ohio Company]] to promote the settlement of [[Ohio Country]].<ref>Richter, pp. 376\u201377</ref>\n\n===Global trade and immigration===\nThe British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.<ref>Richter, pp. 329\u201330</ref> American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins.<ref>Richter, pp. 332\u201336</ref> British North America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many North American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 330\u201331</ref>\n\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.<ref>Richter, pp. 346\u201347</ref> Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations.<ref>Richter, pp. 351\u201352</ref> There were some slave revolts, such as the [[Stono Rebellion]] and the [[New York Conspiracy of 1741]], but these uprisings were suppressed.<ref>Richter, pp. 353\u201354</ref>\n\nA small proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries. These immigrants traveled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Numerous settlers immigrated from [[Ireland]],<ref>Richter, p. 360</ref> both Catholic and Protestant\u2014particularly \"[[Old and New Light|New Light]]\" [[Ulster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]].<ref>Richter, p. 361</ref> Protestant Germans also migrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania.<ref>Richter, p. 362</ref> In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the [[First Great Awakening]].<ref>Middlekauff, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]] sparked the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]'s [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|assault]] on [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartegena de Indias]], a Spanish city in South America.<ref>Richter, p. 345</ref> The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but most colonists called it [[King George's War]].<ref>Richter, pp. 379\u201380</ref> In 1745, British and colonial forces [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured]] the town of [[Louisbourg]], and the war came to an end with the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for [[Chennai|Madras]] and other territories.<ref>Richter, pp. 380\u201381</ref> In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.<ref>Richter, pp. 383\u201385</ref>\n\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]]. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.<ref name=\"anderson\">Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \"[[world war]]\". During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\n\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably [[George Washington]], which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.<ref name=\"anderson\"/> The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops. At the 1754 [[Albany Congress]], Pennsylvania colonist [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed the [[Albany Plan]] which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 390\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War; land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\n\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.<ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\n===Growing dissent===\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51\u201353</ref> They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764. Later acts included the [[Currency Act of 1764]], the [[Stamp Act of 1765]], and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 94\u201396, 107</ref>\n\nThe British also sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French by keeping them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America'' (2006), pp. 92\u201398</ref> Some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation, however, and continued to move west and establish farms.<ref>W.

Pole, [https://www.questia.com/read/89805613 ''Political Representation in England and the Origins of the American Republic''] (London; Melbourne: Macmillan, 1966), 31 [[Questia Online Library]]</ref> They argued that the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament, so it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them. Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\n\nColonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]], which reduced taxes on tea sold by the [[East India Company]] in an effort to undercut competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 when the [[Sons of Liberty]] dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent [[Thomas Gage]] to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201321</ref> Colonists elected delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] which convened in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the [[Continental Association]].

Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at [[Concord, Massachusetts]], but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], then lay [[Siege of Boston|siege to Boston]].<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 132\u201333</ref>\n\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the [[Continental Congress]] hosted a convention of delegates for the 13 colonies.

It established a government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money. General Washington took command of the Patriot soldiers in New England and forced the British to withdraw from Boston. In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, they defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], Britain officially recognized the independence of the United States of America.\n\n==Thirteen British colonies population==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right; margin-left:8px; margin-right:0;\"\n|+ Population of the thirteen British colonies<ref>Note: the population figures are estimates by historians; they do not include the Indian tribes outside the jurisdiction of the colonies.

From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\n\n==Religion==\nProtestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies, although there were also Catholics, Jews, and [[deists]], and a large fraction had no religious connection. The [[Church of England]] was officially established in most of the South. The [[Puritan movement]] became the [[Congregational church]], and it was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 18th century.<ref>Stephen Foster, ''The Long Argument: English Puritanism and the Shaping of New England Culture, 1570\u20131700;'' (1996).</ref> In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses.

Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The [[Reformed tradition]] was the foundation for [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregationalist]], and [[Continental Reformed]] denominations. French [[Huguenots]] set up their own Reformed congregations. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was strong among [[Dutch Americans]] in New York and New Jersey, while [[Lutheranism]] was prevalent among [[German American|German immigrants]]. Germans also brought diverse forms of [[Anabaptism]], especially the [[Mennonite]] variety. [[Reformed Baptist]] preacher [[Roger Williams]] founded [[Providence Plantations]] which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. Jews were clustered in a few port cities.

The oldest colleges were [[Harvard College|New College (Harvard)]], [[Princeton College|College of New Jersey (Princeton)]], [[Yale College|Collegiate School (Yale)]], [[Columbia University|King's College (Columbia)]], and the [[Brown University|College of Rhode Island (Brown)]]. Other colleges were [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania)]], [[Rutgers College|Queen's College (Rutgers)]] and [[Dartmouth College]] in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the [[College of William and Mary]] which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\n\nThe southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children, mirroring the common belief in Europe. Wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from Britain or sent children to school in England. By the 1700s, university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors.<ref>Urban, Wayne J. and Jennings L. Wagoner, Jr. ''American Education: A History''.

Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college.

Wagoner Jr., ''American Education: A History'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 11\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\n\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial ([[royal colony]]), [[Proprietary colony|proprietary]], and [[Charter colony|charter]]. These governments were all subordinate to the British monarch with no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the [[Board of Trade]] in London beginning late in the 17th century.\n\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of Britain. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\n\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.<ref>John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  online]</ref>\n\nCharter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.<ref>Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [https://archive.org/details/americancolonia00kellgoog  online]</ref> [[Providence Plantations]] merged with the settlements at [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] to form the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also became a charter colony in 1636.\n\n===British role===\nAfter 1680, the imperial government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\n\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \"Imperial school\" led by [[Herbert L. Osgood]], [[George Louis Beer]], [[Charles McLean Andrews]], and [[Lawrence H. Gipson]]. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=27787750|url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/7801/9315|title=The Imperial School of American Colonial Historians|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|last1=Savelle|first1=Max|year=1949}}</ref>\n\n===Self-government===\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of [[suffrage]] than Britain or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Robert\">Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689\u20131776'' (1977)</ref> Voters were required to hold an \"interest\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\".<ref>Thomas Cooper and David James McCord, eds. ''The Statutes at Large of South Carolina: Acts, 1685\u20131716'' (1837) p. 688</ref> The main legal criterion for having an \"interest\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders\u2014that is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote'' (2000) pp. 5\u20138</ref>\n\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches\u2014all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate [[George Washington]] spent \u00a339 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \"swill the planters with bumbo\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.<ref>Daniel Vickers, ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006) p. 300</ref>\n\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.<ref name=\"Robert\" />\n\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 led by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the [[Rights of Englishmen]] which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. (2004), p. 665</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain\u2014its merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.<ref>Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204\u201311]</ref>\n\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>George Otto Trevelyan, ''The American revolution: Volume 1'' [https://archive.org/details/americanrevolut14trevgoog/page/n13 <!-- pg=128 quote=smuggling american revolution. --> (1899) p. 128 online]</ref> The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb [[History of the Royal Navy#Expansion of the fighting force, 1642\u20131689|Royal Navy]], which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.</ref>\n\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \"Then and there the child Independence was born.\"<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>\n\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\n\n==Other British colonies==\n{{main|British America}}\n[[File:British Colonies in North America c1750 v2.png|thumb|right|British colonies in North America, {{Circa|1750}}{{ordered list|[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]|Nova Scotia|Thirteen Colonies|Bermuda|[[Bahamas]]|[[British Honduras]]|[[Jamaica]]|[[British Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]]}}]]\n\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the [[British America|New World]]. Those in the [[British West Indies]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Bermuda]], and [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over, and later  sold it to the United States). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.<ref>Jack P.

It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nNova Scotia had a large [[Yankee]] element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \"neutrality\". In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.<ref>Meinig pp. 313\u201314; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 61</ref>\n\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The [[Quebec Act of 1774]] gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|capture Canada]] in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.<ref>Meinig pp 314\u201315; Greene and Pole (2004) ch 61</ref>\n\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, [[Grenada]], and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, ''An Empire Divided: The American Revolution and the British Caribbean'' (2000) ch 6</ref>\n\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \"passive allies\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.<ref>Meinig pp. 315\u201316; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 63</ref>\n\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.<ref>Meinig p. 316</ref> However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the war in 1783.

The Thirteen Colonies had very similar political, constitutional, and legal systems, and were dominated by Protestant English-speakers. The northern colonies were founded primarily for religious reasons, while the southern colonies were founded for financial profit and business expansion. All thirteen were part of [[British America|Britain's possessions]] in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada, Florida, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe colonial population grew from about 2,000 to 2.4 million between 1625 and 1775, sometimes displacing American Indians.

The [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \"[[Rights of Englishmen|Rights as Englishmen]]\", especially the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\". Grievances with the British government led to the [[American Revolution]], in which the colonies worked together to form the [[Continental Congress]]. The colonists fought the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383) with the aid of the [[Kingdom of France]] and, to a much smaller degree, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Kingdom of Spain]].<ref>Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\n== British colonies ==\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in America.

The Plymouth Company founded the [[Popham Colony]] on the [[Kennebec River]], but it was short-lived. The [[Plymouth Council for New England]] sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620 which was settled by English Puritan separatists, known today as the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].<ref>Richter, pp. 152\u201353</ref> The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown.

It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]] who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]].<ref>Robert M. Weir, ''Colonial South Carolina: A History'' (1983).</ref>\n\n===New England===\nThe [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the Church of England, which they perceived as corrupted. They initially moved to the Netherlands, but eventually sailed to America in 1620 on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Upon their arrival, they drew up the [[Mayflower Compact]], by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.<ref>Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War Paperback'' (2007).</ref>\n\nMore Puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, ideologically pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards'' (1995).</ref>\n\n[[Roger Williams]] established [[Providence Plantations]] in 1636 on land provided by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] sachem [[Canonicus]]. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements; he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution, providing for majority rule \"in civil things\" and \"liberty of conscience\" in religious matters.<ref name=\"taylor\"/><ref>Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)</ref> In 1637, a second group including [[Anne Hutchinson]] established a second settlement on [[Aquidneck Island]], also known as Rhode Island.\n\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]]. Massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\n\nIn 1685, King [[James II of England]] closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]], putting the region under control of Governor [[Edmund Andros]]. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. Andros was overthrown and the dominion was closed in 1689, after the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed King James II; the former colonies were re-established.<ref name=\"HallLederKammen2012\">{{cite book|editor1=Michael G.

The [[Dutch West India Company]] established permanent settlements on the Hudson River, creating the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. In 1626, [[Peter Minuit]] purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the [[Lenape]] Indians and established the outpost of [[New Amsterdam]].<ref>Richter, pp. 138\u201340</ref> Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 159\u2013\n60</ref> It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships.<ref>Richter pp. 212\u201313</ref> The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning [[Atlantic slave trade]], supplying enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America and [[Barbados]].<ref>Richter pp. 214\u201315</ref> The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did. Many of those who did immigrate to the colony were English, [[German people|German]], [[Walloons|Walloon]], or [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]].<ref>Richter pp. 215\u201317</ref>\n\nIn 1638, Sweden established the colony of [[New Sweden]] in the [[Delaware Valley]]. The operation was led by former members of the Dutch West India Company, including Peter Minuit.<ref>Richter, p. 150</ref> New Sweden established extensive trading contacts with English colonies to the south, and shipped much of the tobacco produced in Virginia.<ref>Richter p. 213</ref> The colony was conquered by the Dutch in 1655,<ref>Richter, p. 262</ref> while Sweden was engaged in the [[Second Northern War]].\n\nBeginning in the 1650s, the English and Dutch engaged in a [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|series of wars]], and the English sought to conquer New Netherland.<ref>Richter pp. 247\u201348</ref> [[Richard Nicolls]] captured the lightly defended New Amsterdam in 1664, and his subordinates quickly captured the remainder of New Netherland.<ref>Richter, pp. 248\u201349</ref> The 1667 [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] ended the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] and confirmed English control of the region.<ref>Richter, p. 249</ref> The Dutch briefly regained control of parts of New Netherland in the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]], but surrendered claim to the territory in the 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]], ending the Dutch colonial presence in North America.<ref>Richter p. 261</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the British renamed the colony \"York City\" or \"New York\". Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany, while people from New England started moving in as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.<ref>Michael G.

From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 319\u201322</ref> The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the [[Province of North-Carolina]] and the [[Province of South Carolina]]. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 323\u201324</ref>\n\n[[File:North America 1748.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748]]\nIn the 1730s, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentarian]] [[James Oglethorpe]] proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \"worthy poor\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on June 9, 1732.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp Colonial charters, grants and related documents]</ref> Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 358\u201359</ref>\n\nThe colonial population of Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the Thirteen Colonies stood at 1.5 million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of [[British North America]].<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 20</ref> More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and [[Boston]] had a population in excess of 16,000, which was small by European standards.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 23</ref> By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the [[gross domestic product]] of the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 25</ref>\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the [[Ohio River]] valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases.<ref>Richter, pp. 373\u201374</ref> Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the [[Ohio Company]] to promote the settlement of [[Ohio Country]].<ref>Richter, pp. 376\u201377</ref>\n\n===Global trade and immigration===\nThe British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.<ref>Richter, pp. 329\u201330</ref> American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins.<ref>Richter, pp. 332\u201336</ref> British North America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many North American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 330\u201331</ref>\n\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.<ref>Richter, pp. 346\u201347</ref> Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations.<ref>Richter, pp. 351\u201352</ref> There were some slave revolts, such as the [[Stono Rebellion]] and the [[New York Conspiracy of 1741]], but these uprisings were suppressed.<ref>Richter, pp. 353\u201354</ref>\n\nA small proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries. These immigrants traveled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Numerous settlers immigrated from [[Ireland]],<ref>Richter, p. 360</ref> both Catholic and Protestant\u2014particularly \"[[Old and New Light|New Light]]\" [[Ulster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]].<ref>Richter, p. 361</ref> Protestant Germans also migrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania.<ref>Richter, p. 362</ref> In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the [[First Great Awakening]].<ref>Middlekauff, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]] sparked the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]'s [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|assault]] on [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartegena de Indias]], a Spanish city in South America.<ref>Richter, p. 345</ref> The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but most colonists called it [[King George's War]].<ref>Richter, pp. 379\u201380</ref> In 1745, British and colonial forces [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured]] the town of [[Louisbourg]], and the war came to an end with the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for [[Chennai|Madras]] and other territories.<ref>Richter, pp. 380\u201381</ref> In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.<ref>Richter, pp. 383\u201385</ref>\n\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]]. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.<ref name=\"anderson\">Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \"[[world war]]\". During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\n\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably [[George Washington]], which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.<ref name=\"anderson\"/> The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops. At the 1754 [[Albany Congress]], Pennsylvania colonist [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed the [[Albany Plan]] which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 390\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War; land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\n\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.<ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\n===Growing dissent===\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51\u201353</ref> They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764. Later acts included the [[Currency Act of 1764]], the [[Stamp Act of 1765]], and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 94\u201396, 107</ref>\n\nThe British also sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French by keeping them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America'' (2006), pp. 92\u201398</ref> Some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation, however, and continued to move west and establish farms.<ref>W.

Rowman & Littlefield. p. 92. {{ISBN|0-7425-1189-8}}</ref> The proclamation was soon modified and was no longer a hindrance to settlement, but the fact angered the colonists that it had been promulgated without their prior consultation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holton | first1 = Woody | year = 1994 | title = The Ohio Indians and the coming of the American revolution in Virginia | url = | journal = Journal of Southern History | volume = 60 | issue = 3| pages = 453\u201378 | doi = 10.2307/2210989 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin - Join or Die.jpg|thumb|alt=''[[Join, or Die]]'' by Benjamin Franklin was recycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule|''[[Join, or Die]]'' by [[Benjamin Franklin]] was recycled to encourage the former colonies to unite against British rule.]]\nParliament had directly levied duties and excise taxes on the colonies, bypassing the colonial legislatures, and Americans began to insist on the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\" with intense protests over the [[Stamp Act of 1765]].<ref>J. R. Pole, [https://www.questia.com/read/89805613 ''Political Representation in England and the Origins of the American Republic''] (London; Melbourne: Macmillan, 1966), 31 [[Questia Online Library]]</ref> They argued that the colonies had no representation in the British Parliament, so it was a violation of their rights as Englishmen for taxes to be imposed upon them. Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\n\nColonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]], which reduced taxes on tea sold by the [[East India Company]] in an effort to undercut competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 when the [[Sons of Liberty]] dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent [[Thomas Gage]] to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201321</ref> Colonists elected delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] which convened in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the [[Continental Association]]. The boycott proved effective and the value of British imports dropped dramatically.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 123\u201327</ref> The Thirteen Colonies became increasingly divided between [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] opposed to British rule and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who supported it.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201338</ref>\n\n==American Revolution==\n{{main|American Revolution}}\n[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|upright=1.50|Map of the Thirteen Colonies (red) and nearby colonial areas (1763\u20131775) just before the Revolutionary War]]\n\nIn response, the colonies formed bodies of elected representatives known as [[Provincial Congress]]es, and Colonists began to boycott imported British merchandise.<ref>T.H. Breen, ''American Insurgents, American Patriots: The Revolution of the People'' (2010) pp. 81\u201382</ref> Later in 1774, 12 colonies sent representatives to the [[First Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]. During the [[Second Continental Congress]], the remaining colony of Georgia sent delegates, as well.\n\nMassachusetts Governor [[Thomas Gage]] feared a confrontation with the colonists; he requested reinforcements from Britain, but the British government was not willing to pay for the expense of stationing tens of thousands of soldiers in the Thirteen Colonies. Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at [[Concord, Massachusetts]], but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], then lay [[Siege of Boston|siege to Boston]].<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 132\u201333</ref>\n\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the [[Continental Congress]] hosted a convention of delegates for the 13 colonies. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states.<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]], ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2007)</ref> The [[Second Continental Congress]] assembled in May 1775 and began to coordinate armed resistance against Britain. It established a government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money. General Washington took command of the Patriot soldiers in New England and forced the British to withdraw from Boston. In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, they defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], Britain officially recognized the independence of the United States of America.\n\n==Thirteen British colonies population==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right; margin-left:8px; margin-right:0;\"\n|+ Population of the thirteen British colonies<ref>Note: the population figures are estimates by historians; they do not include the Indian tribes outside the jurisdiction of the colonies.

From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\n\n==Religion==\nProtestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies, although there were also Catholics, Jews, and [[deists]], and a large fraction had no religious connection. The [[Church of England]] was officially established in most of the South. The [[Puritan movement]] became the [[Congregational church]], and it was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 18th century.<ref>Stephen Foster, ''The Long Argument: English Puritanism and the Shaping of New England Culture, 1570\u20131700;'' (1996).</ref> In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses.

Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The [[Reformed tradition]] was the foundation for [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregationalist]], and [[Continental Reformed]] denominations. French [[Huguenots]] set up their own Reformed congregations. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was strong among [[Dutch Americans]] in New York and New Jersey, while [[Lutheranism]] was prevalent among [[German American|German immigrants]]. Germans also brought diverse forms of [[Anabaptism]], especially the [[Mennonite]] variety.

The oldest colleges were [[Harvard College|New College (Harvard)]], [[Princeton College|College of New Jersey (Princeton)]], [[Yale College|Collegiate School (Yale)]], [[Columbia University|King's College (Columbia)]], and the [[Brown University|College of Rhode Island (Brown)]]. Other colleges were [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania)]], [[Rutgers College|Queen's College (Rutgers)]] and [[Dartmouth College]] in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the [[College of William and Mary]] which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\n\nThe southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children, mirroring the common belief in Europe. Wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from Britain or sent children to school in England. By the 1700s, university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors.<ref>Urban, Wayne J. and Jennings L. Wagoner, Jr. ''American Education: A History''.

Wagoner Jr., ''American Education: A History'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 11\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\n\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial ([[royal colony]]), [[Proprietary colony|proprietary]], and [[Charter colony|charter]]. These governments were all subordinate to the British monarch with no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the [[Board of Trade]] in London beginning late in the 17th century.\n\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of Britain. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\n\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.<ref>John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  online]</ref>\n\nCharter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.<ref>Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [https://archive.org/details/americancolonia00kellgoog  online]</ref> [[Providence Plantations]] merged with the settlements at [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] to form the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also became a charter colony in 1636.\n\n===British role===\nAfter 1680, the imperial government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\n\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \"Imperial school\" led by [[Herbert L. Osgood]], [[George Louis Beer]], [[Charles McLean Andrews]], and [[Lawrence H. Gipson]]. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=27787750|url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/7801/9315|title=The Imperial School of American Colonial Historians|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|last1=Savelle|first1=Max|year=1949}}</ref>\n\n===Self-government===\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of [[suffrage]] than Britain or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Robert\">Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689\u20131776'' (1977)</ref> Voters were required to hold an \"interest\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\".<ref>Thomas Cooper and David James McCord, eds. ''The Statutes at Large of South Carolina: Acts, 1685\u20131716'' (1837) p. 688</ref> The main legal criterion for having an \"interest\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders\u2014that is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote'' (2000) pp. 5\u20138</ref>\n\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches\u2014all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate [[George Washington]] spent \u00a339 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \"swill the planters with bumbo\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.<ref>Daniel Vickers, ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006) p. 300</ref>\n\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.<ref name=\"Robert\" />\n\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 led by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the [[Rights of Englishmen]] which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. (2004), p. 665</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain\u2014its merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.<ref>Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204\u201311]</ref>\n\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>George Otto Trevelyan, ''The American revolution: Volume 1'' [https://archive.org/details/americanrevolut14trevgoog/page/n13 <!-- pg=128 quote=smuggling american revolution. --> (1899) p. 128 online]</ref> The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb [[History of the Royal Navy#Expansion of the fighting force, 1642\u20131689|Royal Navy]], which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.</ref>\n\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \"Then and there the child Independence was born.\"<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>\n\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\n\n==Other British colonies==\n{{main|British America}}\n[[File:British Colonies in North America c1750 v2.png|thumb|right|British colonies in North America, {{Circa|1750}}{{ordered list|[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]|Nova Scotia|Thirteen Colonies|Bermuda|[[Bahamas]]|[[British Honduras]]|[[Jamaica]]|[[British Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]]}}]]\n\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the [[British America|New World]]. Those in the [[British West Indies]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Bermuda]], and [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over, and later  sold it to the United States). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.<ref>Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds. '\"A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2004) ch. 63</ref> The British crown had only recently acquired those lands, and many of the issues facing the Thirteen Colonies did not apply to them, especially in the case of Quebec and Florida.<ref>Lawrence Gipson, ''The British Empire Before the American Revolution'' (15 volumes, 1936\u20131970), highly detailed discussion of every British colony in the New World in the 1750s and 1760s</ref>\n\nNewfoundland was exempt from the Navigation Acts and shared none of the grievances of the continental colonies. It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nNova Scotia had a large [[Yankee]] element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \"neutrality\". In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.<ref>Meinig pp. 313\u201314; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 61</ref>\n\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The [[Quebec Act of 1774]] gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|capture Canada]] in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.<ref>Meinig pp 314\u201315; Greene and Pole (2004) ch 61</ref>\n\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, [[Grenada]], and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, ''An Empire Divided: The American Revolution and the British Caribbean'' (2000) ch 6</ref>\n\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \"passive allies\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.<ref>Meinig pp. 315\u201316; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 63</ref>\n\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.<ref>Meinig p. 316</ref> However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the war in 1783.

The Philippines holds two types of special elections: those that were supposed to be held on [[Elections in the Philippines|election day]] but were delayed, and those held after an office has become vacant. This article describes the second type.\n\n==Scheduling==\nAs stipulated in [[Republic Acts of the Philippines|Republic Act]] (R.A.) No. 6645 approved on December 28, 1987, once a vacancy occurs in the Senate at least 18 months, or in the House of Representatives at least (1) year, before the next scheduled election, the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]], upon receipt of a resolution from the chamber where the vacancy occurred, shall schedule a special election. The special election will then be held not earlier than 45 days and not later than 90 days from the date of the resolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno6645.html |title=REPUBLIC ACT NO. 6645  \u2013 AN ACT PRESCRIBING THE MANNER OF FILING A VACANCY IN THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |date=July 19, 1998 |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Republic Act No. 7166 approved on November 26, 1991, amended parts of R.A. No. 6645. When a vacancy in the House of Representatives occurs before one year before the expiration of the term, the special election shall be held not earlier than 60 days and not later than 90 days after occurrence of the vacancy. For the Senate, if the vacancy occurs one year before the expiration of the term, the special election shall be held on the day of the next succeeding regular election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1991/ra_7166_1991.html |title=AN ACT PROVIDING FOR SYNCHRONIZED NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTIONS AND FOR ELECTORAL REFORMS, AUTHORIZING APPROPRIATIONS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES  |publisher=The Lawphil Project |date=November 26, 1991 |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}</ref>\n, \nWith the passed of Republic Act No. 8295 in 1997, if there is only one candidate running for the position, that candidate would be proclaimed as the winner, and an election would no longer be held.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comelec.gov.ph/?r=References/RelatedLaws/ElectionLaws/OtherElectionLaws/RA8295 |title=AN ACT PROVIDING FOR THE PROCLAMATION OF A LONE CANDIDATE FOR ANY ELECTIVE OFFICE IN A SPECIAL ELECTION, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES |publisher=[[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] |accessdate=February 16, 2015}}</ref> This is unlike in regularly scheduled elections where voting would still be held, and the candidate has to get one vote in order to be elected.\n\nNot all vacancies that occurred a year before the next regular election resulted in a special election. To save money, the [[Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines|Speaker]] appoints a caretaker representative from a nearby district. In same cases a caretaker representative was appointed while an election date was considered.\n\nAs with general elections, special elections are [[Election day|usually scheduled]] on a Monday. In some cases, election days are declared as holidays.\n\n==House of Representatives==\nSince the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 elections]], there have been two types of elected representatives, those who represent [[single-member districts]] and those elected via the party-list system. When a vacancy occurs for a party-list representative, the next-ranked nominee from the party replaces his predecessor. For district representatives, a special election will be held to determine who shall succeed the predecessor. During the [[Third Philippine Republic]], where representatives had four-year terms, the special election was held together with the mid-term election.\n\nA special election will not be held if the vacancy occurred less than a year before the next regularly scheduled election.\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:92%\"\n|-\n![[Legislative districts of the Philippines|District]] !![[Philippine Legislature]]!!

In ''Tolentino vs. Comelec'', the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] ruled that the commission did not comply with the requirements of R.A. 6645, nor did the commission \"give formal notice that it would proclaim as winner the senatorial candidate receiving the 13th highest number of votes in the special election.\" However, the court ruled that while the commission failed to give notice of the time of the special election, it did not negate the calling of such election, \"indispensable to the election's validity.\" Since R.A. 6645 as amended \"charges the voters with knowledge of this statutory notice and Comelec's failure to give the additional notice did not negate the calling of such special election, much less invalidate it\", the court dismissed the petition for lack of merit and allowed the result of the election to stand.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2004/jan2004/148334.htm |title=ARTURO M.

In all cases, the thirteenth-placed senator in the immediately preceding election was not given the former's seat since the vacancy occurred after the election.\n*In [[1998 Philippine presidential election|1998]], senator [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] was elected vice president midway through her term. Arroyo's seat was up for the [[2001 Philippine general election|2001 election]] and no special elections were held, nor was the thirteenth-placed candidate during the [[1998 Philippine general election|1998 Senate election]] ([[Roberto Pagdanganan]]) proclaimed winner. Later that year, [[Marcelo Fernan]] died in office, leaving two vacant seats in the Senate (Fernan's seat was also up in 2001).\n*In [[2004 Philippine presidential election|2004]], senator [[Noli de Castro]] was elected vice president midway through his term . De Castro's seat was up for the [[2007 Philippine general election|2007 election]] and no special election was held, nor was the thirteenth-placed candidate during the [[2004 Philippine general election|2004 Senate election]] ([[Robert Barbers]]) proclaimed winner.\n*In [[2007 Philippine general election|2007]], senator [[Alfredo Lim]] was elected [[mayor of Manila]] midway through his term. Lim's seat was up for the [[2010 Philippine general election|2010 election]] and no special election was held, nor was the thirteenth-placed candidate during the [[2007 Philippine Senate election|2007 Senate election]] ([[Aquilino Pimentel III]]) proclaimed winner. On August 15, 2011, Pimentel assumed the seat of [[Juan Miguel Zubiri]] after allegations of [[electoral fraud]].\n*In [[2010 Philippine presidential election|2010]], senator [[Benigno Aquino III]] was elected president midway through his term. Aquino's seat was up for the [[2013 Philippine Senate election|2013 election]] and no special election was held, nor was the thirteenth-placed candidate during the [[2010 Philippine Senate election|2010 Senate election]] ([[Risa Hontiveros-Baraquel]]) proclaimed winner.\nIn all of those cases, the thirteenth-placed candidate was not given the vacant seat as the voters elected for only ''twelve'' senators.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/insights/06/17/10/senate-facts-miriam-coronel-ferrer |title=Senate facts \u2013 Miriam Coronel Ferrer |first=Miriam |last=Coronel Ferrer |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |work=ABS-CBNNews.com}}</ref>\n\nNote that this is not a problem for senators elected prior to 1971, as long as they are elected to a new position prior to the second senate election of their terms (there were two elections for the senate for senators at that time). For senators elected since 1987, their seats will be vacant since there will be no intervening senate elections from the day they gave up their seat up to the expiration of their term.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130209040326/http://www.congress.gov.ph/orphil/index.php Online roster of Philippine legislators] (House of Representatives)\n*[http://www.comelec.gov.ph/?r=References/ComelecResolutions/SpecialElections Commission on Elections' special elections webpage]\n\n{{Special Elections to the Philippine Congress}}\n{{Philippine elections}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Special elections to the Philippine Congress}}\n[[Category:Lists of by-elections|Philippine Congress]]\n[[Category:Legislative elections in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Special elections to the Congress of the Philippines|*]]\n[[Category:Philippines politics-related lists]]\n", "name_user": "PiaLily", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_special_elections_to_the_Philippine_Congress"}
