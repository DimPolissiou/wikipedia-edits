Established in 1889, it is one of [[Cleveland]]'s historical [[streetcar suburb]]s and part of the [[Greater Cleveland|Greater Cleveland Metropolitan Area]]. The population was 52,131 at the [[2010 United States Census]], making it the third largest city in Cuyahoga County, behind Cleveland and [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=U.S. Census website|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref> Its population density is the highest of any city in Ohio and is roughly comparable to that of [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2019}}\nLakewood was incorporated as a village in 1889, and named for its lakefront location.<ref>{{cite book|last=Overman|first=William Daniel|title=Ohio Town Names|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015015361465;view=1up;seq=88|year=1958|publisher=Atlantic Press|location=Akron, OH|page=72}}</ref>\n\n===Earliest Days===\nThe wilderness west of the Cuyahoga River was delayed being settled due to a treaty the American government made with the Indians in 1785, whereby no white man was to settle on that land. Consequently, when Moses Cleaveland arrived in 1796, his activities were confined to the east side of the river. Subsequently, in Detroit, Michigan, on January 18, 1796, twenty-nine leaders of the Ottawa, Chippewa, and other tribes signed another treaty that provided for the lease of the lands west of the Cuyahoga River for 999 years for the sum of five shillings per acre.\n\nBut it wasn't until the treaty of July 4, 1805, that the lands actually opened and settlers permanently inhabited the territory. The treaty was approximately $5,000, which included the cost of rum, tobacco, and presents, as well as the fees for commissioners, agents, and contractors. This land in Ohio\u2014an area now occupied by Lakewood, Rocky River, Fairview Park, and the section of Cleveland known as West Park\u2014was purchased from the Connecticut Land Company by a syndicate of six men headed by Judson Canfield on April 4, 1807, for the sum of $26,084.\n\n===First Government===\nLakewood, the first suburb west of Cleveland on the shores of Lake Erie, began as Township 7, Range 14, of the Connecticut Western Reserve in 1805. It was a wooded wilderness through which cut the old Huron Post Road that ran from Buffalo, New York, to Detroit, Michigan. In 1819 a small group of eighteen families living in the area of present-day Lakewood, Rocky River, and part of Cleveland's West Park neighborhood named the growing community Rockport Township. In April of that year, the first election took place in Rufus Wright's tavern with a member of each household present. Three were elected as trustees: Henry Alger, Erastus Johnson, and Rufus Wright. Elected as overseers of the poor were James Nicholson and Samuel Dean. Henry Canfield was elected clerk. This type of government served Rockport for the next 70 years, with an election held each year.\n\n[[File:Underground Railroad Marker.jpg|thumb|[[Underground Railroad]] marker at Lakewood Park.]]\nIn 1889 East Rockport, with 400 residents, separated from the township and became the Hamlet of Lakewood. Settlement accelerated rapidly, with Lakewood becoming a village with 3,500 residents in 1903. City status, with 12,000 residents, came just eight years later. By 1930 the population of Lakewood was 70,509.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe early settlers in Township 7 sustained their lives through farming. The land was ideal for fruit farming and many vineyards began to emerge. The fertile soil and lake climate that were ideal for producing crops is what attracted many people to move to the township. There was also vast amounts of trees to be used for building homes and other structures. The most common occupations in Lakewood were farming and the building trades.\n\n===First Roads===\nRoads were the earliest influence on development in Lakewood. The Rockport Plank Road Company improved the old Detroit Road in 1848, opening a toll road from present-day West 25th Street in Cleveland to five miles west of the Rocky River. It continued operating as a toll road until 1901. A series of bridges spanning the Rocky River Valley, the first of which was built in 1821, improved commerce between Cleveland and the emerging communities to its west. An 1874 atlas of Cuyahoga County shows present-day main roads such as Detroit Avenue, Madison Avenue, Franklin Boulevard, Hilliard Road, Warren Road, and Riverside Drive.\n\n===Schools===\n\nUnder the Ohio Common School Act of April 9, 1867, three schools were allotted to East Rockport, called 6, 8, and 10; they were later designated East, Middle, and West. Each school had one teacher. As the community began to grow and more schools were required, the school board adopted the policy of honoring Ohio's presidents by assigning their names to the school buildings.\n\n===Railroads===\n\nThe Rocky River Railroad was organized in 1869 by speculators as an excursion line to bring Clevelanders to the resort area they developed at the mouth of the Rocky River. Financially unsuccessful as a pleasure and amusement venture, the line was sold to the Nickel Plate Railroad in 1881. The railroad line still exists today, running in an east\u2013west direction north of Detroit Avenue.\n\n==Government==\nLakewood is governed by an elected mayor and elected council. The council has seven members, with four members representing wards in the city and the other three are at-large council members.<ref>{{cite web |title=Third Amended Charter of the City of Lakewood, Ohio |url=http://www.onelakewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Third-Amended-Charter-of-the-City-of-Lakewood-as-amended-by-the-electorate-11052019.pdf |publisher=The City of Lakewood, Ohio |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> Lakewood is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by [[Marcy Kaptur]] (OH-9, D)<ref>{{cite web |title=District |url=https://kaptur.house.gov/district |website=Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>.

The houses are distinctive and most of the streets are named after birds. Birdtown was designated a National Register Historic District in 2006. It is adjacent to Madison Park, the former Union Carbide factory, and the W. 117th St. Rapid Transit Station. Many of the original houses built there were boarding houses.  Birdtown achieved National Historic Register status in 2006.\n* '''Clifton Boulevard''' - Lined with big trees and multi-family homes, apartment complexes, and 4&times;4 brick structures, and turn of the century single family colonials, the seven-lane Clifton Boulevard is one of the busiest streets in greater Cleveland.\n* '''[[Clifton Park (Lakewood, Ohio)|Clifton Park]]''' - The wealthiest neighborhood of Lakewood is situated in the northwestern corner of the city, and consists mostly of magnificent Victorian mansions. It is bounded by Sloane on the south, West Clifton on the east, The Rocky River on the west, and Lake Erie on the north. Built in the late 19th century, this area has been historically, and continues to be, home to many of greater Cleveland's most prominent citizens. Includes the private Clifton Beach community.\n* '''Downtown Lakewood''' - The main section of Lakewood is centered at Detroit Avenue and Warren Road. This district was formally identified when Lakewood was chosen as a member of the national MainStreet program in 2005. The area is lined with office buildings, restaurants, and variety shops. Lakewood Library, the [[USPS]], Former Lakewood Hospital, and Lakewood City Schools are all located in this district.\n* '''The Edge''' - This easternmost neighborhood includes many concert venues, pubs, and taverns, and co-exists partially in the city of [[Cleveland]].\n*'''Victorian Village''' - This was named after the large Victorian homes on Grace, Clarence and Cohassett Avenues on the city's east end.

Construction began in 2004 of roughly 200 condos, lofts, and live-work spaces.\n* '''West End''' - The West End is the westernmost neighborhood of Lakewood, along the Rocky River Reservation. In 2002, the administration of Mayor Madelaine Cain proposed to seize homes in this area using eminent domain, to replace them with retail development.

 Established in 1889, it is one of [[Cleveland]]'s historical [[streetcar suburb]]s and part of the [[Greater Cleveland|Greater Cleveland Metropolitan Area]]. The population was 52,131 at the [[2010 United States Census]], making it the third largest city in Cuyahoga County, behind Cleveland and [[Parma, Ohio|Parma]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=U.S. Census website|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref> Its population density is the highest of any city in Ohio and is roughly comparable to that of [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2019}}\nLakewood was incorporated as a village in 1889, and named for its lakefront location.<ref>{{cite book|last=Overman|first=William Daniel|title=Ohio Town Names|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015015361465;view=1up;seq=88|year=1958|publisher=Atlantic Press|location=Akron, OH|page=72}}</ref>\n\n===Earliest Days===\nThe wilderness west of the Cuyahoga River was delayed being settled due to a treaty the American government made with the Indians in 1785, whereby no white man was to settle on that land. Consequently, when Moses Cleaveland arrived in 1796, his activities were confined to the east side of the river. Subsequently, in Detroit, Michigan, on January 18, 1796, twenty-nine leaders of the Ottawa, Chippewa, and other tribes signed another treaty that provided for the lease of the lands west of the Cuyahoga River for 999 years for the sum of five shillings per acre.\n\nBut it wasn't until the treaty of July 4, 1805, that the lands actually opened and settlers permanently inhabited the territory. The treaty was approximately $5,000, which included the cost of rum, tobacco, and presents, as well as the fees for commissioners, agents, and contractors. This land in Ohio\u2014an area now occupied by Lakewood, Rocky River, Fairview Park, and the section of Cleveland known as West Park\u2014was purchased from the Connecticut Land Company by a syndicate of six men headed by Judson Canfield on April 4, 1807, for the sum of $26,084.\n\n===First Government===\nLakewood, the first suburb west of Cleveland on the shores of Lake Erie, began as Township 7, Range 14, of the Connecticut Western Reserve in 1805. It was a wooded wilderness through which cut the old Huron Post Road that ran from Buffalo, New York, to Detroit, Michigan. In 1819 a small group of eighteen families living in the area of present-day Lakewood, Rocky River, and part of Cleveland's West Park neighborhood named the growing community Rockport Township. In April of that year, the first election took place in Rufus Wright's tavern with a member of each household present. Three were elected as trustees: Henry Alger, Erastus Johnson, and Rufus Wright. Elected as overseers of the poor were James Nicholson and Samuel Dean. Henry Canfield was elected clerk. This type of government served Rockport for the next 70 years, with an election held each year.\n\n[[File:Underground Railroad Marker.jpg|thumb|[[Underground Railroad]] marker at Lakewood Park.]]\nIn 1889 East Rockport, with 400 residents, separated from the township and became the Hamlet of Lakewood. Settlement accelerated rapidly, with Lakewood becoming a village with 3,500 residents in 1903. City status, with 12,000 residents, came just eight years later. By 1930 the population of Lakewood was 70,509.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe early settlers in Township 7 sustained their lives through farming. The land was ideal for fruit farming and many vineyards began to emerge. The fertile soil and lake climate that were ideal for producing crops is what attracted many people to move to the township. There was also vast amounts of trees to be used for building homes and other structures. The most common occupations in Lakewood were farming and the building trades.\n\n===First Roads===\nRoads were the earliest influence on development in Lakewood. The Rockport Plank Road Company improved the old Detroit Road in 1848, opening a toll road from present-day West 25th Street in Cleveland to five miles west of the Rocky River. It continued operating as a toll road until 1901. A series of bridges spanning the Rocky River Valley, the first of which was built in 1821, improved commerce between Cleveland and the emerging communities to its west. An 1874 atlas of Cuyahoga County shows present-day main roads such as Detroit Avenue, Madison Avenue, Franklin Boulevard, Hilliard Road, Warren Road, and Riverside Drive.\n\n===Schools===\n\nUnder the Ohio Common School Act of April 9, 1867, three schools were allotted to East Rockport, called 6, 8, and 10; they were later designated East, Middle, and West. Each school had one teacher. As the community began to grow and more schools were required, the school board adopted the policy of honoring Ohio's presidents by assigning their names to the school buildings.\n\n===Railroads===\n\nThe Rocky River Railroad was organized in 1869 by speculators as an excursion line to bring Clevelanders to the resort area they developed at the mouth of the Rocky River. Financially unsuccessful as a pleasure and amusement venture, the line was sold to the Nickel Plate Railroad in 1881. The railroad line still exists today, running in an east\u2013west direction north of Detroit Avenue.\n\n==Government==\nLakewood is governed by an elected mayor and elected council. The council has seven members, with four members representing wards in the city and the other three are at-large council members.<ref>{{cite web |title=Third Amended Charter of the City of Lakewood, Ohio |url=http://www.onelakewood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Third-Amended-Charter-of-the-City-of-Lakewood-as-amended-by-the-electorate-11052019.pdf |publisher=The City of Lakewood, Ohio |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref> Lakewood is represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by [[Marcy Kaptur]] (OH-9, D)<ref>{{cite web |title=District |url=https://kaptur.house.gov/district |website=Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=15 April 2020}}</ref>.

The houses are distinctive and most of the streets are named after birds. Birdtown was designated a National Register Historic District in 2006. It is adjacent to Madison Park, the former Union Carbide factory, and the W. 117th St. Rapid Transit Station. Many of the original houses built there were boarding houses.  Birdtown achieved National Historic Register status in 2006.\n* '''Clifton Boulevard''' - Lined with big trees and multi-family homes, apartment complexes, and 4&times;4 brick structures, and turn of the century single family colonials, the seven-lane Clifton Boulevard is one of the busiest streets in greater Cleveland.\n* '''[[Clifton Park (Lakewood, Ohio)|Clifton Park]]''' - The wealthiest neighborhood of Lakewood is situated in the northwestern corner of the city, and consists mostly of magnificent Victorian mansions. It is bounded by Sloane on the south, West Clifton on the east, The Rocky River on the west, and Lake Erie on the north. Built in the late 19th century, this area has been historically, and continues to be, home to many of greater Cleveland's most prominent citizens. Includes the private Clifton Beach community.\n* '''Downtown Lakewood''' - The main section of Lakewood is centered at Detroit Avenue and Warren Road. This district was formally identified when Lakewood was chosen as a member of the national MainStreet program in 2005. The area is lined with office buildings, restaurants, and variety shops. Lakewood Library, the [[USPS]], Former Lakewood Hospital, and Lakewood City Schools are all located in this district.\n* '''The Edge''' - This easternmost neighborhood includes many concert venues, pubs, and taverns, and co-exists partially in the city of [[Cleveland]].\n*'''Victorian Village''' - This was named after the large Victorian homes on Grace, Clarence and Cohassett Avenues on the city's east end. When constructed in the early 1900s, it served as residences for executives from the National Carbon Company.\n* '''[[Lakewood gold coast|The Gold Coast]]''' - Collection of high rises on the northeast end of Lakewood, bordering Lake Erie.\n* '''Rockport Square''' - Rockport Square (not to be confused with the former Rockport Township) is an urban renewal project along Detroit Avenue on the eastern side of the city. Construction began in 2004 of roughly 200 condos, lofts, and live-work spaces.\n* '''West End''' - The West End is the westernmost neighborhood of Lakewood, along the Rocky River Reservation. In 2002, the administration of Mayor Madelaine Cain proposed to seize homes in this area using eminent domain, to replace them with retail development. After a citizen-led resistance attracted national media attention from ''60 Minutes'', the West End proposal failed in a 2003 referendum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://clevelandmagazine.com/in-the-cle/the-read/articles/how-the-west-end-was-won|title=How the West End Was Won|website=clevelandmagazine.com}}</ref>\n* Lakewood's nickname \"City of Beautiful Homes\" is due to the fact the city was intentionally designed in the early 1900s with a lack of industry and an emphasis on a diverse variety of residential housing structures including many large Tudors mainly near the lakeshore, and multi-family and smaller single family homes in many other sections of the city.\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n* The [[GCRTA|Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]]'s Cleveland State Line (routes 55,55A,55B,55C), run east and west along Clifton Boulevard, terminating at [[Cleveland State University]] in [[downtown Cleveland]] to the east and in [[Fairview Park, Ohio|Fairview Park]] (55) or [[Bay Village, Ohio|Bay Village]] (55B) and [[Westlake, Ohio|Westlake]] (55C) to the west.

The Twins shared both facilities with the [[Minnesota Vikings]], and the Metrodome with the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota Golden Gophers football team]].\n\nThe final budget for construction was $435 million, of which $175 million was paid by the Twins and $260 million was paid by [[Hennepin County, Minnesota|Hennepin County]] by way of a 0.15% county-wide sales tax. An additional $120 million in infrastructure costs were split between the county ($90 million), the team ($20 million), [[Target Corporation]] ($4.5 million), the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] ($3.5 million) and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority ($2 million) bringing the project's total cost to US$555 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ballparkauthority.com/Budget.html|title=Target Field Construction Budget|website= Minnesota Ballpark Authority|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Target Field.jpg|thumb|Armed Services Appreciation Day, on July 3, 2011.

During the run-up to the St. Paul referendum in 1999, an independent working group was formed by Minneapolis businessmen Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin, representatives of a group of investors which owned the Rapid Park parking lot in the [[Warehouse District, Minneapolis|historic warehouse district]] on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis. This group, initially known as Minnesota Urban Ballpark, and later as MN Twinsville, formed with the express purpose of bringing their land into the discussion about sites for a new Twins ballpark.\n\nAt first, the 8-acre site appeared to be an extremely unlikely location for a modern professional baseball facility. Besides being far smaller than most MLB sites (modern facilities typically require {{convert|16-20|acres}}), it was hemmed in by railroad tracks, a [[Interstate 394|freeway]], and two city streets passing on bridges. Though very near to [[Target Center]], it was also adjacent to the [http://www.hennepin.us/your-government/facilities/hennepin-energy-recovery-center Hennepin Energy Recovery Center] (HERC), more commonly known as the city's \"garbage burner,\" considered by some to be an undesirable neighbor for a ballpark.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.twincities.com/2007/01/29/draft-study-garbage-burner-wont-harm-fans-at-new-twins-stadium/|title=Draft study: Garbage burner won\u2019t harm fans at new Twins stadium |work=Pioneer Press|author1=Gurnon, Emily |date=29 January 2007|accessdate=20 April 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nBut the site's perceived liabilities were easily offset by significant assets.

The Metrodome was climate-controlled, and thus, protected the baseball schedule during the entire time that it had been the venue for the Minnesota Twins.

The [[Minnesota Wild]] will be hosting the game against the [[St. Louis Blues|Saint Louis Blues]].\n\n==Features==\n{{prose|section|date=December 2017}}\n\n===The stadium===\n*The popular left-field [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] roof deck features mostly standing room and the only bonfire in the Majors.\n*The bullpens are \"double-decker\" style in left-center field.  The Twins' pen is farthest from the field, with the opposing team's pen below it, closest to the field.\n*The batter's eye featured 14 young [[Picea mariana|black spruce]] trees (each about 6 feet high) the first year.  After criticism from Twins and opposing players concerning the shadows that they cast, the trees were removed prior to the second year.  Some were auctioned to fans and ticket holders while the rest were donated to [[List of Minnesota state parks|Minnesota state parks]].\n*[[Kasota limestone]] is used in much of the stadium and is from [[Kasota, Minnesota|Kasota]], near [[Mankato, Minnesota|Mankato]].\n*The admission gates are numbered according to former Twins legends and roughly located near to the positions that they played;\n**Left field gate is #6 honoring [[Tony Oliva]] (with his bronze statue nearby)\n**Centerfield gate is #3 for [[Harmon Killebrew]]\n**Target Plaza gate (in right field) is #34 in tribute to [[Kirby Puckett]]\n**Right field gate is #29 in tribute to [[Rod Carew]]\n**Home plate gate is #14 in honor of [[Kent Hrbek]] (featuring his bronze statue)\n\n===Target Plaza===\nTarget Plaza is the gathering area behind the right field gate (Gate 34). On the wall of the adjacent parking garage facing the ballpark is a wind veil that makes waves as the wind blows.  At night, color-changing lights add to the effect. Near the wind veil there are 9 topiary frames each {{convert|40|ft|m}} high shaped like baseball bats with hops growing on them. They are lit up every night with the same color changing scheme as the veil, however, during games they are lit up red, in sequential order, to denote the current inning.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/sports/twins/90324237.html Visuals big part of trip to Target Field] ''[[Star Tribune]]''</ref>  In this plaza are statues of former players [[Kirby Puckett]], [[Rod Carew]], [[Kent Hrbek]] and [[Harmon Killebrew]], as well as former owners [[Calvin Griffith]], [[Carl Pohlad]] and his wife, Eloise Pohlad and Twins mascot TC Bear.<ref>{{cite news |title=Carew Supports Griffith Statue Being Placed Near His Target Field Gate|first=Paul|last=Walsh|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/101657538.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=August 27, 2010|accessdate=August 27, 2010}}</ref>\n\nA large \"Golden Glove\" sits in the plaza in recognition of all Twins players to win the Gold Glove Award.  The statue can be sat on and is a popular photo attraction.  It is located exactly {{convert|520|ft|m}} from home plate, the distance of Harmon Killebrew's longest home run at Met Stadium (although his was hit into the left field upper deck).\n\nThere is also a monument that shows all the venues that Minnesota-based baseball teams played in. On the rails of the pedestrian skybridge are pennants that contain the rosters of all the Twins teams, and pennants of players, coaches, front office people, and other contributors who have been elected to the Twins Hall of Fame.\n\n===The field===\nThe main flagpoles are in right field near the Plaza.  The largest pole, which flies the Stars and Stripes, is the original pole used at [[Metropolitan Stadium]].  It was relocated to the Richfield Legion Post 435 after the Met was demolished, and, after being cut in half and refurbished, was re-installed for baseball at Target Field.  The first flags\u2014both US and POW/MIA\u2014donated by Post 435 were raised at the first Twins exhibition game by veteran and flagpole historian B.W. McEvers of Bloomington. On September 6, [[Jim Thome]] hit a solo home run against the [[Kansas City Royals]] that hit the flag pole.\n\nThe championship banners fly on small flagpoles located on the upper rim of the stadium beyond left field.  Each pole recognizes each division, league, and world championship since the team's arrival in {{mlby|1961}}.  On the stadium's upper rim in right-center field are small flagpoles that fly the flag for all the teams (including the Twins) in the division.  The order that the flags fly are determined by the divisional standings.\n\nHome plate is the same one used at the Metrodome.  After the Twins' final dome game (Game 3 of the [[2009 American League Division Series|2009 ALDS]]), the plate was dug up and later installed at Target Field. In addition, several handfuls of dirt were taken from the sliding pit and pitcher's mound areas from the Metrodome and scattered near their counterparts at Target Field.\n\n===Twins bars and restaurants===\nAt Target Field, there are four prominent bars and restaurants:\n\n*The Town Ball Tavern is located on the upper concourse by the left field corner, and is famous for serving the [[Jucy Lucy]] burger. The wood flooring is the same used on the basketball court at the [[Minneapolis Armory]] during the NBA [[Minneapolis Lakers]] stay, before leaving for Los Angeles.\n*Hrbek's is located on the main concourse behind home plate, and is named after former Twins [[first baseman]] [[Kent Hrbek]].\n*There are two bars located on the upper concourse behind home plate, collectively called the Two Gingers Pubs. In one of these bars, fans can watch the Target Field organist, Sue Nelson, perform during games. Out of these three bars and restaurants, the Two Gingers Pub (formerly known as the Twins Pub) is the only one that does not serve food, however it is the only one in which the field is visible from inside.\n*The former Metropolitan Club (reserved for season ticket holders) was renovated prior to the 2019 season as restaurant Bat & Barrel, along with expansion of Target Plaza by moving Gate 34 further toward 1st Ave.\n\nConcessions throughout also include several Minnesota favorites like walleye, wild rice soup, Kramarczuk's sausages, as well as a \"State Fair Foods\" stand where many items are served \"on a stick\", such as the J.D. Hoyt's pork chop.\n\nIn 2018, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] declared Target Field number one on its annual list of [[vegan]]-friendly ballparks, thanks to the availability of foods like tofu vindaloo, vegan Sriracha Brats and Italian Sausages, [[Daiya]] cheese pizza, and Field Roast burgers and dogs.<ref>Kevin Reichard, \"Target Field Leads List of Vegan-Friendly Ballparks,\" [https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/06/04/target-field-leads-list-of-vegan-friendly-ballparks/ BallparkDigest.com], 4 June 2018.</ref>\n\n===Minnie and Paul logo===\n[[File:Minnie and Paul.jpg|thumb|right|300px.|Minnie and Paul, representing the Twin Cities, is the logo for the Minnesota Twins.]]\nA large version of the Twins' original \"Minnie and Paul\" logo (designed by local artist, Ray Barton <ref>{{cite web |title=Ray Barton obituary|url=http://www.harrisfam.org/rootspersona-tree-2/ray-alphonzo-barton/|work=Harris family genealogy site|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>) stands in center field.  It shows two players wearing the uniforms of the two minor-league teams that played in the Twin Cities before the Twins' arrival, the [[Minneapolis Millers]] and [[St. Paul Saints (1901\u201360)|St. Paul Saints]], shaking hands across the [[Mississippi River]].  During various points in the game, the strobe lights surrounding the logo flash. This sign was a concept designed and illustrated by RipBang Studios but built by others.\n\nWhen the Twins score a run by any means other than a home run, the strobe lights trace the border from the bottom-left corner for each Twins player that crosses home plate, symbolizing that a Twins player rounded the bases. For each strikeout, the corners of the sign flash to portray the strike zone. The strobe lights will flash at the end of the top of an inning if the Twins do not surrender a run during the inning. After a Twins home run, the strobe lights flash, Minnie and Paul shake hands, and the Mississippi River flows. After a Twins victory, the \"T\" and \"s\" in \"Twins\" will blink to show the message \"Twins win\" in addition to the animation shown following a Twins home run.\n\n==METRO and commuter rail connections==\nThe stadium is well-connected to the city's transit network, being immediately adjacent to the \"A\" and \"B\" [[parking ramp]]s of the large ABC Ramps complex at the end of [[Interstate 394]], which include two major transit bus terminals and link to the rest of downtown Minneapolis via [[skyway]].  Over 8,000 people typically arrive to each game via the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] and [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]], both of which terminate at [[Target Field (Metro Transit station)|Target Field Station]], just 10 yards from the park's Gate 6. For fans arriving from the northwest suburbs, the [[Northstar Line]] commuter rail terminates in downtown Minneapolis with a station underneath the ballpark.\n\n==Park firsts==\nThe first \"soft event\" at Target Field was an open house held for season ticket holders on March 20 and 21, 2010.[[File:First Pitch at Target Field.jpg|thumb|First Pitch at Target Field, thrown by Jordan, Minnesota native T.J.

An additional $120 million in infrastructure costs were split between the county ($90 million), the team ($20 million), [[Target Corporation]] ($4.5 million), the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] ($3.5 million) and the Minnesota Ballpark Authority ($2 million) bringing the project's total cost to US$555 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ballparkauthority.com/Budget.html|title=Target Field Construction Budget|website= Minnesota Ballpark Authority|language=en|accessdate=April 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Target Field.jpg|thumb|Armed Services Appreciation Day, on July 3, 2011.

During the run-up to the St. Paul referendum in 1999, an independent working group was formed by Minneapolis businessmen Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin, representatives of a group of investors which owned the Rapid Park parking lot in the [[Warehouse District, Minneapolis|historic warehouse district]] on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis. This group, initially known as Minnesota Urban Ballpark, and later as MN Twinsville, formed with the express purpose of bringing their land into the discussion about sites for a new Twins ballpark.\n\nAt first, the 8-acre site appeared to be an extremely unlikely location for a modern professional baseball facility.

Pawlenty advanced a plan that could build up to three stadiums (Twins, Vikings, and Gophers) albeit with uncertain financing. That uncertainty, combined with dollar amounts now in the billions, and intense partisan bickering over unrelated budget issues, meant that the stadium bill took a back seat and was not passed during the [https://www.leg.state.mn.us/lrl/timecapsule/session?sess=83 2004 session].\n\nBehind the scenes in 2004, Hennepin County, led by commissioner [[Mike Opat]], continued negotiations with the Twins, settling on the rough framework for financing which was ultimately used.\n\nAnd the city of Minneapolis, acting on the recommendation of its own advisory committee, worked out an option (assignable to Hennepin County) to purchase the Rapid Park land.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=|title=$10 reserves site for possible Twins park|last=Sitaramiah|first=Gita|date=February 14, 2004|work=St. Paul Pioneer Press|access-date=}}</ref> They agreed to pay $12.95 million plus {{convert|5|acre}} of adjacent land in exchange for the rights to purchase the {{convert|8|acre|adj=on}} main ballpark site, effectively agreeing to pay $4.3 million per acre.

No action was taken in either the regular session or the special session which resolved the budget dispute. Until the very end of the year, proponents held out hope that Pawlenty would call a second special session just for the purpose of dealing with the stadium issue, but he did not.\n\n=== Success (2006) ===\nWith the entire Minnesota Legislature up for reelection in 2006, the session began with no expectation that a ballpark bill could pass. All parties were now committed to both the Hennepin County financing plan and the Rapid Park site, meaning all of the building blocks were in place for a deal, but optimism among the stakeholders was almost impossible to find.\n\nIt took Twins fan and blogger [https://www.lib.umn.edu/about/staff/shane-nackerud Shane Nackerud] to discover that the votes were there. He had long maintained a detailed spreadsheet of legislator statements on the ballpark issue, and was shocked to find, at the beginning of 2006, that the totals ran counter to the conventional wisdom. Both the House and the Senate contained enough \"yes\" votes to make passage possible.

But eminent domain did offer them the advantage of getting started on construction while working out the details of the land price later.\n\nOn September 19, 2006, Hennepin County officially authorized acquisition of the land, including doing so under eminent domain proceedings, if necessary. In late October the initial county appraisal of the land came in at the same $13.5 million that had been budgeted. Eminent domain proceedings were then initiated on November 1, 2006 as a precaution in case no agreement on land value could be reached by the time construction needed to start. The county set March 1, 2007 as the target date for finalizing acquisition of the Rapid Park site.

The Metrodome was climate-controlled, and thus, protected the baseball schedule during the entire time that it had been the venue for the Minnesota Twins. However, many Twins fans and baseball purists argue that this same sterile, climate-controlled environment creates a less-than-desirable atmosphere for watching baseball.

It is located exactly {{convert|520|ft|m}} from home plate, the distance of Harmon Killebrew's longest home run at Met Stadium (although his was hit into the left field upper deck).\n\nThere is also a monument that shows all the venues that Minnesota-based baseball teams played in. On the rails of the pedestrian skybridge are pennants that contain the rosters of all the Twins teams, and pennants of players, coaches, front office people, and other contributors who have been elected to the Twins Hall of Fame.\n\n===The field===\nThe main flagpoles are in right field near the Plaza.  The largest pole, which flies the Stars and Stripes, is the original pole used at [[Metropolitan Stadium]].  It was relocated to the Richfield Legion Post 435 after the Met was demolished, and, after being cut in half and refurbished, was re-installed for baseball at Target Field.  The first flags\u2014both US and POW/MIA\u2014donated by Post 435 were raised at the first Twins exhibition game by veteran and flagpole historian B.W. McEvers of Bloomington. On September 6, [[Jim Thome]] hit a solo home run against the [[Kansas City Royals]] that hit the flag pole.\n\nThe championship banners fly on small flagpoles located on the upper rim of the stadium beyond left field.  Each pole recognizes each division, league, and world championship since the team's arrival in {{mlby|1961}}.  On the stadium's upper rim in right-center field are small flagpoles that fly the flag for all the teams (including the Twins) in the division.  The order that the flags fly are determined by the divisional standings.\n\nHome plate is the same one used at the Metrodome.  After the Twins' final dome game (Game 3 of the [[2009 American League Division Series|2009 ALDS]]), the plate was dug up and later installed at Target Field. In addition, several handfuls of dirt were taken from the sliding pit and pitcher's mound areas from the Metrodome and scattered near their counterparts at Target Field.\n\n===Twins bars and restaurants===\nAt Target Field, there are four prominent bars and restaurants:\n\n*The Town Ball Tavern is located on the upper concourse by the left field corner, and is famous for serving the [[Jucy Lucy]] burger. The wood flooring is the same used on the basketball court at the [[Minneapolis Armory]] during the NBA [[Minneapolis Lakers]] stay, before leaving for Los Angeles.\n*Hrbek's is located on the main concourse behind home plate, and is named after former Twins [[first baseman]] [[Kent Hrbek]].\n*There are two bars located on the upper concourse behind home plate, collectively called the Two Gingers Pubs. In one of these bars, fans can watch the Target Field organist, Sue Nelson, perform during games. Out of these three bars and restaurants, the Two Gingers Pub (formerly known as the Twins Pub) is the only one that does not serve food, however it is the only one in which the field is visible from inside.\n*The former Metropolitan Club (reserved for season ticket holders) was renovated prior to the 2019 season as restaurant Bat & Barrel, along with expansion of Target Plaza by moving Gate 34 further toward 1st Ave.\n\nConcessions throughout also include several Minnesota favorites like walleye, wild rice soup, Kramarczuk's sausages, as well as a \"State Fair Foods\" stand where many items are served \"on a stick\", such as the J.D. Hoyt's pork chop.\n\nIn 2018, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] declared Target Field number one on its annual list of [[vegan]]-friendly ballparks, thanks to the availability of foods like tofu vindaloo, vegan Sriracha Brats and Italian Sausages, [[Daiya]] cheese pizza, and Field Roast burgers and dogs.<ref>Kevin Reichard, \"Target Field Leads List of Vegan-Friendly Ballparks,\" [https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/06/04/target-field-leads-list-of-vegan-friendly-ballparks/ BallparkDigest.com], 4 June 2018.</ref>\n\n===Minnie and Paul logo===\n[[File:Minnie and Paul.jpg|thumb|right|300px.|Minnie and Paul, representing the Twin Cities, is the logo for the Minnesota Twins.]]\nA large version of the Twins' original \"Minnie and Paul\" logo (designed by local artist, Ray Barton <ref>{{cite web |title=Ray Barton obituary|url=http://www.harrisfam.org/rootspersona-tree-2/ray-alphonzo-barton/|work=Harris family genealogy site|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>) stands in center field.  It shows two players wearing the uniforms of the two minor-league teams that played in the Twin Cities before the Twins' arrival, the [[Minneapolis Millers]] and [[St. Paul Saints (1901\u201360)|St. Paul Saints]], shaking hands across the [[Mississippi River]].  During various points in the game, the strobe lights surrounding the logo flash. This sign was a concept designed and illustrated by RipBang Studios but built by others.\n\nWhen the Twins score a run by any means other than a home run, the strobe lights trace the border from the bottom-left corner for each Twins player that crosses home plate, symbolizing that a Twins player rounded the bases. For each strikeout, the corners of the sign flash to portray the strike zone. The strobe lights will flash at the end of the top of an inning if the Twins do not surrender a run during the inning. After a Twins home run, the strobe lights flash, Minnie and Paul shake hands, and the Mississippi River flows. After a Twins victory, the \"T\" and \"s\" in \"Twins\" will blink to show the message \"Twins win\" in addition to the animation shown following a Twins home run.\n\n==METRO and commuter rail connections==\nThe stadium is well-connected to the city's transit network, being immediately adjacent to the \"A\" and \"B\" [[parking ramp]]s of the large ABC Ramps complex at the end of [[Interstate 394]], which include two major transit bus terminals and link to the rest of downtown Minneapolis via [[skyway]].  Over 8,000 people typically arrive to each game via the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|METRO Blue Line]] and [[Green Line (Minnesota)|METRO Green Line]], both of which terminate at [[Target Field (Metro Transit station)|Target Field Station]], just 10 yards from the park's Gate 6. For fans arriving from the northwest suburbs, the [[Northstar Line]] commuter rail terminates in downtown Minneapolis with a station underneath the ballpark.\n\n==Park firsts==\nThe first \"soft event\" at Target Field was an open house held for season ticket holders on March 20 and 21, 2010.[[File:First Pitch at Target Field.jpg|thumb|First Pitch at Target Field, thrown by Jordan, Minnesota native T.J.
