It was intended to replace the earlier [[MG 34]], which was more expensive and took much longer to produce, but both weapons were produced until the end of World War II.\n\nDesigned to be low-cost and easy to build, the MG 42 proved to be highly reliable and easy to operate. It is most notable for its very high cyclic rate for a gun using full power service cartridges, averaging about 1,200 rounds per minute compared to around 850 for the MG 34, and perhaps 450 to 600 for other common machine guns like the [[M1919 Browning machine gun|M1919 Browning]] or [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]]. This ability made it extremely effective in providing [[suppressive fire]], and its unique sound led to it being nicknamed \"Hitler's buzzsaw\".<ref name=\"SAOTH-10th\">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Joseph E.|title=Small Arms of the World|date=1973|publisher=Stackpole Co.|location=Harrisburg, PA, USA|edition=10th}}</ref>\n\nThe MG 42 was adopted by several armed organizations after the war, and was both copied and [[Licensed production|built under licence]]. The MG 42's lineage continued past Nazi Germany's defeat, forming the basis for the nearly identical ''MG1'' (MG 42/59), chambered in [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]], which subsequently evolved into the MG1A3, and later the [[Bundeswehr]]'s [[Rheinmetall MG 3|MG 3]], Italian [[:it:Beretta MG 42/59|MG 42/59]] and Austrian [[MG 74]]. It also spawned the Yugoslav unlicensed nearly identical Zastava [[#M53|M53]].\n\nThe MG 42 lent many design elements to the Swiss [[MG 51]] and [[SIG MG 710-3]], American [[M60 machine gun|M60]] and Belgian [[FN MAG|MAG]] general-purpose machine guns and the Spanish [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] [[CETME Ameli|Ameli]] [[light machine gun]] though these machine guns feature other operating mechanisms or actions than the MG 42 and its lineage.\n\n==History==\n===Before World War I===\nEven before [[World War I]], the German military was already looking forward to replacing the heavy machine guns which proved to be such a success in that war. The [[MG 13|MG13]] was one of the first developments toward a goal of producing a weapon that could perform multiple roles, rather than just one. The MG13 was the result of reengineering the Dreyse Water-cooled machine gun to fit the new requirement.<ref name=\"SAOTH-10th\" /> The twin-barreled [[Gast gun]] was developed with the goal of providing a high cyclic rate of fire weapon for anti-aircraft use which was reported to have reached cyclic rates of fire as high as 1,600 rounds per minute.<ref name=\"SAOTH-10th\" />\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:German Machine Gunner (7527779440).jpg|thumb|left|Wehrmacht reenactors with a MG 34 general-purpose machine gun mounted on a ''Lafette 34'' tripod]]\n\nThis eventually led to the ''Einheitsmaschinengewehr'' (Universal machine gun) introducing an entirely new concept in automatic firepower. By changing its mount, sights and feed mechanism, the operator could radically transform an ''Einheitsmaschinengewehr'' for several purposes.\n\nThe [[MG 34]] is considered to be the first modern [[general-purpose machine gun]] or ''Einheitsmaschinengewehr''. It was developed to use the standard German 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser full-power rifle round.<ref name=\"SAOTH-10th\" /> It was envisaged and well developed to provide portable [[Light machine gun|light]] and [[medium machine gun]] infantry cover, anti-aircraft coverage, and even sniping ability. Equipped with a quick-change barrel and fed either with [[Belt (firearms)#Non-Disintegrating|non-disintegrating metallic-link belts]], or from a 50-round ''Gurttrommel'' (belt drum) or a 75-round spring-loaded [[Drum magazine|saddle-drum]] ''Patronentrommel 34'' magazines (with a simple change of the feed cover for a Trommelhalter magazine holder), the MG 34 could sustain fire for much longer periods of time than other portable [[Squad automatic weapon|squad-level weapons]] such as the American [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|B.A.R.]] and the British [[Bren Gun]], both of which were fed by [[Magazine (firearms)|box magazines]], while also being much lighter and more portable than crew-served weapons like the [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning M1919]] or [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] machine guns (which also lacked quick-change barrels). The MG 34 was also quite versatile; not only was it able to be fed from belted ammunition or a saddle drum magazine, it could also be fired from a bipod, an innovative ''Lafette 34'' tripod or various pintle mounts for armored vehicles. Switching between a bipod and a tripod required no special tools, as the mounting latch was spring-loaded. As the '''MG 34 ''Panzerlauf''''', it was used throughout the war as secondary armament on [[panzer]]s and other vehicles. One attempt at improvement was the '''MG 34S''', an incremental improvement on the basic 34 design. The improvements consisted of a shortened and lightened barrel, a stiffer recoil spring and a more potent recoil booster to increase the rate of fire. The MG 34S could cope with a cyclic fire rate of 1,200 rounds per minute but its components became highly stressed. Later in the war, the MG 34 was used as the basis for the [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[MG 81]] flexible defensive gun that had a cyclic fire rate of 1,400-1,600 rounds per minute. However, the MG 34 did have its drawbacks, such as sensitivity to dirt and mud, and comparatively complex and expensive production.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=W.H.B.|title=Small Arms of the World|date=1973|publisher=Stackpole|pages=437\u2013442|edition=10th}}</ref>\n\n===Development of the MG 42===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-109-14A, Frankreich, MG-Sch\u00fctze.jpg|thumb|left|A German [[Waffen SS]] soldier involved in heavy fighting in and around the French town of [[Caen]] in mid-1944. He is carrying an MG 42 configured as a light support weapon with a folding [[bipod]] and detachable 50-round belt drum container.]]\n\nIn order to address these issues, a contest was held for a true MG 34 replacement. Three companies were asked to submit designs: Metall und Lackierwarenfabrik Johannes Gro\u00dffu\u00df AG of [[D\u00f6beln]], [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]] of [[S\u00f6mmerda]], and St\u00fcbgen of [[Erfurt]].<ref name=\"Willbanks\">Willbanks, James: ''Machine Guns: An Illustrated History of Their Impact'', page 115. ABC-CLIO, 2004.</ref> Of the number of proposals submitted, Gro\u00dffu\u00df AG's proved to be the best design by far, employing a unique [[Recoil operation|recoil-operated]] [[Roller locked|roller locking]] mechanism whereas the two competing designs used a [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-actuated]] system.<ref name=\"Willbanks\"/> The company had no earlier experience in weapons manufacture, specializing in [[Stamping (metalworking)|pressed and stamped steel]] components (the company's staple product was [[sheet metal]] [[lantern]]s). Dr.-Ing. [[Werner Gruner]], one of the leading design engineers with Gro\u00dffu\u00df, knew nothing about machine guns when he was given the task of being involved with the project, although he specialized in the technology of mass production. [[:de:Werner Gruner|Gruner]] would attend an army machine gunner's course to familiarize himself with the utility and characteristics of such a weapon, also seeking input from soldiers. He then recycled an existing [[Mauser]]-developed operating system and incorporated features from his experiences with army machine gunners and lessons learned during the early stages of the war.<ref name=\"Willbanks\"/> Being made largely out of stamped appropriately hardened metal, the new design required considerably less machining and fewer high grade steel alloys. It was much simpler to build than other machine guns\u2014it took 75 [[man hour]]s to complete the new gun as opposed to 150 man hours for the MG 34 (a 50% reduction)\u2014and cost 250 [[German reichsmark|RM]] as opposed to 327 RM (a 24% reduction).\n\nThe resulting '''MG 39''' remained similar to the earlier MG 34 overall, a deliberate decision made to maintain familiarity. The only major changes from the gunner's perspective were dropping of the drum-magazine feed option, leaving the weapon to fire [[Belt (firearm)|belted ammunition]], or from a single 50-round drum-shaped ''Gurttrommel'' belt container fitted to the gun's receiver, and simplifying the weapon's [[Iron sights|open sights]] for aiming purposes. All these changes were intended to increase, maintain, or accommodate the gun's high practical rate of fire. Although made of relatively inexpensive and simple parts, the prototypes also proved to be considerably more rugged and resistant to jamming than the precisely machined and somewhat temperamental MG 34. A limited run of about 1,500 of its immediate predecessor, the MG 39/41, was completed in 1941 and tested in combat trials.\n\n===Adoption of the MG 42===\nThe weapon was officially accepted, and the main manufacturing of the production design began in 1942, as the '''MG 42''', contracts going to [[:de:Metall- und Lackwarenfabrik Johannes Gro\u00dffu\u00df|Gro\u00dffu\u00df]], [[Mauser-Werke]], [[Simson (company)#1934\u201348|Gustloff-Werke]] and others. Production during the war amounted to over 400,000 units (17,915 units in 1942, 116,725 in 1943, 211,806 in 1944, and 61,877 in 1945).<ref name=\"Folke Myrvang 2003\"/>\n\n===MG 42 nicknames===\nThe distinctive sound caused by the high cyclic firing rate gave rise to the nickname \"Hitler's buzzsaw\" and the German soldiers' ''Hitlers\u00e4ge'', ''Singende S\u00e4ge'', ''Knochens\u00e4ge'' or ''elektrisches MG'' (\"Hitler's saw\", \"Singing saw\", \"Bone saw\" or \"electric machine gun\"). The gun (like the MG 34) was sometimes called \"Spandau\" by British troops, a traditional generic term for all German machine guns, left over from the famous Allied nickname for the [[MG 08]] [[Maxim gun|Maxim]]-derivative used by German forces during World War I and derived from [[Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken|its manufacturer]]'s plates noting the city of [[Spandau]] where some were produced.<ref>[http://ww2db.com/weapon.php?q=10 MG 42 Machine Gun], World War II Database</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/mgun_spandau.htm |title=Encyclopedia - Spandau Gun |website=Firstworldwar.com |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref> [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|Brazilian expeditionary soldiers]] fighting in Italy used to refer to MG 42 as ''Lourdinha''; this nickname is due to the fact that the bride of one of the soldiers, named Maria de Lourdes, was a seamstress and the sound of MG 42 was similar to the sound of her sewing machine (''Lourdinha'' is a common nickname in Brazil for women called Maria de Lourdes).<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-43398292 | title=O soldado que transformou em m\u00fasica uma batalha hist\u00f3rica para o Brasil na 2\u00aa Guerra| newspaper=BBC News Brasil| date=2018-03-18| last1=Bernardo| first1=Andr\u00e9}}</ref><ref>http://rubi.casaruibarbosa.gov.br/bitstream/20.500.11997/3875/1/Di%2bi%CC%81rio%20Carioca%20-%20DE%20-%2019441945.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ufjf.br/ppghistoria/files/2009/12/Marcos-Antonio-T-Costa9.pdf</ref>\n\n== Small arms doctrine ==\n[[File:MG42 1 noBG.jpg|thumb|MG 42 with its bipod unfolded]]\n\nThe German tactical doctrine of the era based a [[squad]]'s firepower on the general-purpose machine gun in the light machine gun role so that the role of the rifleman was largely to carry ammunition and provide covering fire for the machine gunners. The advantage of the general purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit.<ref>Hogg, Ian V., & Weeks, John.

It was possible for operating crews to lay down a non-stop barrage of fire, pausing only when the barrel had to be replaced.  This allowed the MG 42 to tie up significantly larger numbers of enemy troops.  The Americans and the British trained their troops to take cover from the fire of an MG 42, and assault the position during the small time window of barrel replacement, which took around 4 to 7 seconds (estimated).\n\nThe German military kept issuing [[Karabiner 98k]] [[bolt-action]] rifles and did experiment with semi-automatic rifles throughout World War II. They fielded the [[Gewehr 41]] series of which fewer than 150,000 were built, and the [[Gewehr 43|Gewehr 43/Karabiner 43]] series of which 402,713 were built. They also introduced the first [[assault rifle]] in 1943 \u2013 the [[MP43]] / [[MP44]] / [[StG 44]] series, producing 425,977 of these. But the Karabiner 98k was made in far greater numbers - over 14,600,000 - and due to the relatively limited production of the semi-automatic and assault rifles, the bolt-action Karabiner remained the primary service weapon until the last days of World War II, and was manufactured until the surrender in May 1945.\n\nThe Allied nations squad tactical doctrines of World War II centered on the rifleman, with the machine gun serving a support role, and they utilised weapons with cyclic fire rates of typically 450\u2013600 rounds per minute. The American military had standardized a [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] rifle in 1936 (the [[M1 Garand]]) that could be effectively fired more rapidly than the preceding bolt-action rifles. The Allied nations had machine guns with similar rates of fire, but mounted them almost exclusively in aircraft, where the fleeting opportunities for firing made such high rates necessary.  The only similar Allied weapon was the [[Vickers K machine gun|Vickers K aircraft gun]], and that was used by ground forces only in specialized circumstances.\n\n===Light machine gun fire support role===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-204-1727-18, Jugoslawien, Soldaten mit MG 42 im Schnee.jpg|thumb|Machine gun team in Yugoslavia]]\n\nA German infantry ''Gruppe'' (squad) consisted of ten men; a non-commissioned officer or ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' squad leader, deputy squad leader, a three-man machine gun team (machine gunner, assistant gunner/loader and ammunition carrier) and five riflemen. As personal small arms the squad leader was issued a [[rifle]] or as of around 1941 a [[submachine gun]], the  machine gunner and his assistant were issued [[pistol]]s and the deputy squad leader, ammunition carrier and the riflemen were issued rifles. The riflemen carried additional ammunition, [[hand grenade]]s, explosive charges or a machine gun tripod as required and provided security and covering fire for the machine gun team.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Delf|first1=Stephen Bull; illustrated by Mike Chappell & Brian|title=World War II infantry tactics: squad and platoon|date=2004|publisher=Osprey|location=Osceola, WI|pages=22\u201323|isbn=9781841766621}}</ref><ref>[http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/cgsc/carl/wwIIspec/number09.pdf The German Squad In Combat].

A high [[Rate of fire#Cyclic rate|cyclic rate of fire]] is advantageous for use against targets that are exposed to a general-purpose machine gun for a limited time span, like aircraft or targets that minimize their exposure time by quickly moving from cover to cover. For targets that can be fired on by a general-purpose machine gun for longer periods than just a few seconds, the cyclic firing rate becomes less important. As a consequence, one of the MG 42's most notable features was in its high cyclic rate of fire of about 1,200 to 1,500 rounds per minute, twice the rate of the Vickers and Browning machine guns, which fired at a rate of about 600 rounds per minute.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/> The ear could not easily discern the sound of individual [[bullet|shot]]s being fired, instead hearing a sound described as like \"ripping cloth\" or a buzzsaw.\n\nThe MG 42's high cyclic rate of fire sometimes proved a liability mainly in that, while the weapon could be used to devastating effect, it could quickly exhaust its ammunition supply. For this reason, it was not uncommon for all soldiers operating near an MG 42 to carry extra ammunition, thus providing the MG 42 with a backup source when its main supply was exhausted. Another disadvantage of the MG 42 was that the high cyclic rate of fire led to the barrel overheating quickly during rapid fire. After around 150 rounds of rapid fire, the gun operator would open a side hatch (leading to the barrel) and replace the hot barrel with a new cool(er) one. Non-observance of this technical limitation renders the barrel prematurely unusable.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/> The machine gun crew member responsible for a hot barrel change was issued protective asbestos gloves to prevent burns to the hands.\n\nThe German military instructed that sustained fire must be avoided at all costs. They ruled that the results of sustained fire were disappointing and that the expenditure of ammunition involved was \"intolerable.\"<ref name=\"GermanMG42Views\" /> In the bipod-mounted light machine gun role, MG 42 users were trained to fire short bursts of 3 to 7 rounds and strive to optimize their aim between bursts fired in succession.<ref name=\"GermanMG42Views\" /> For its medium machine gun role, the MG 42 was matched to the newly developed ''Lafette 42'' [[tripod]]. In the tripod-mounted medium machine gun role, MG 42 users were trained to fire short bursts and bursts of 20 to 50 rounds and strive to optimize their aim between bursts fired in succession.<ref name=\"GermanMG42Views\" /> As a consequence of factors like the time spent reloading, aiming, changing hot barrels if necessary to allow for cooling, the MG 42's practical [[Rate of fire#Sustained or effective rate|effective rate of fire]] was 154 rounds per minute, versus 150 rounds per minute for the MG 34.<ref name=\"GermanMG42Views\" />\n\n==Design details==\n[[Image:DCB Shooting MG42 Roller system.JPG|thumb|right|MG 42 roller-locked system]]\n[[File:Schnittbild.MG3.jpg|thumb|MG3 in 7.62mm NATO]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J14917, Sizilien, Fla - MG sichert Kolonne bei der Rast.jpg|thumb|MG 42 with auxiliary anti-aircraft \"spider web\" ring sight mounted]]\n\nThe MG 42 is a [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]], air-cooled, [[belt fed]], [[open bolt]], recoil-operated machine gun with a quick change barrel.\n\nThe MG 42 weighed 11.57&nbsp;kg in the light machine gun role with the [[bipod]], lighter than the MG 34 and easily portable. The bipod, the same one used on the MG 34, could be mounted to the front or the center of the gun depending on how and where it was being used.\n\nThe roller-locked bolt assembly consists of a bolt head, two rollers, a striker sleeve, bolt body, and a large multi strands around a central coil return spring, which is responsible for pushing the bolt assembly into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the bolt assembly, the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The bolt assembly locks with the barrel's breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.\n\nThe roller-locked recoil operation functions as follows: two cylindrical rollers, positioned in tracks on the bolt head, are pushed outwards into matching tracks in the barrel extension by the striker sleeve and lock the bolt in place against the breech. Upon firing, rearward force from the recoil of the cartridge ignition pushes the striker assembly back and allows the rollers to move inwards, back to their previous position, unlocking the bolt head and allowing the bolt assembly and barrel to recoil, extracting the spent cartridge and ejecting it down. The return spring then pushes the bolt assembly forwards again, pushing a new cartridge out of the belt into the breech, and the sequence repeats as long as the trigger is depressed. The MG 42 is capable only of [[Automatic firearm|fully automatic]] fire. Single shots are difficult, even for experienced operators, due to the weapon's rate of fire. The usual training objective is to be able to fire a burst of no more than three rounds. The weapon features a [[recoil booster]] at the muzzle to increase rearwards force due to recoil, therefore improving functional reliability and rate of fire.\n\nThe cyclic firing rate of the MG 42 can be altered by installing different bolts and recoil springs. A heavier bolt uses more recoil energy to overcome inertia, thus slowing the cyclic rate of the machine gun. Heavy bolts also were used along with stiffer [[Hooke's law|return springs]]. The standard MG 42 bolt weight for a normal rate of fire is {{convert|550|g|oz|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"WG-MG42-3\">{{cite web|title=MG 42 and MG 3 machine gun|url=http://modernfirearms.net/machine/de/mg-42-and-mg-3-e.html|website=World Guns|accessdate=18 February 2017|date=2010-10-27}}</ref>\n\nThe shoulder stock is designed to permit gripping with the left hand to hold it secure against the shoulder.\n\nThe open-type [[iron sight]]ing line has a relatively short {{convert|430|mm|in|1|sp=us}} radius and consists of a \"\u2227-type\" height adjustable front sight on a folding post and a leaf rear sight with an open V-notch sliding on a ramp, graduated from {{convert|200|to|2,000|m|yds|0|sp=us}} in {{convert|100|m|yds|0|sp=us}} increments.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/> An auxiliary anti-aircraft \"spider web\" ring sight is kept in the maintenance kit, that can be fitting on the barrel jacket to be used in conjunction with a folding anti-aircraft rear peep sight that is attached by a hinge to the rear sight element base.\n\nThe {{convert|530|mm|in|1|sp=us}} long barrel of the MG 42 could be quickly changed by the machine gun crew and weighed {{convert|1.75|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} including the locking piece.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/> The barrels could have traditional [[rifling]] or [[polygonal rifling]]. Polygonal rifling was an outgrowth of a [[cold forming|cold-hammer forging]] process developed by German engineers before World War II. The process addressed the need to produce more durable machine gun barrels in less time than those produced with traditional methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=37197|title=Barrels and Bullets: Conventional Versus Polygonal Rifling - Human Events|website=humanevents.com}}</ref> Later produced barrel bores featured [[Chrome plating#Hard|hard-chrome plating]] to make them more durable. The different versions meant that the service life of an MG 42 barrel varied between 3,500 and 8,000 rounds assuming the barrel was used according to regulation that prohibited rapid firing over 150 rounds. Excessive overheating caused by rapid firing about 500 rounds through a barrel resulted in unacceptable wear of the bore rendering the barrel useless.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/>\nThe method of barrel change made the MG 42 unsuitable for secondary or co-axial armament on World War II era German tanks with the exception of the [[Jagdpanzer IV]]. Early versions of the Jagdpanzer IV carried two standard (no modification made) MG 42s on both sides of the gun mantlet/glacis, firing through a ball slot which was protected by an armored cover (with the MG 42 retracted) when not in use. Later version Jagdpanzer IVs carried only one MG 42 on the left side.\n\nThe MG 42 incorporated lessons hard-won on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Both the cocking handle and the catch for the top cover to the working parts were designed so that the gunner could operate them wearing arctic mittens or with a stick or rod. This was vital for winter conditions where contact by bare flesh on cold metal could cause severe injury, such as instant [[frostbite]]. The MG 42 also functioned well in other climates; dust and dirt in North Africa and Italy was less likely to jam the MG 42 than the more temperamental MG 34.\n\nThe original MG 42 roller-locked action had an undesirable tendency to exhibit bolt-bounce. It was possible to unintentionally have high gas pressure in the MG 42 when the action was not fully locked. This causes unacceptable dangerous conditions. Once the problem was identified, the temporary solution was to design and manufacture ammunition with primers with a slightly slower ignition time which allowed the rollers to settle into lockup and issue that ammunition specifically for MG 42 use.<ref name=\"waffen-welt.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.waffen-welt.de/bilder/DiePatrone7.92x57.pdf|title=Die Patrone 7.92mm (8x57)|author=|date=|website=waffen-welt.de|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>. A more practical solution to control the harmonics in the roller/wedge system was needed. The roller-locking system inherent problem was solved by developing and adding bolt-bounce preventing bolt catches to the action.<ref>[https://www.mg-42.net/mg42_bolt_catches.htm MG 42 bolt catches]</ref>\n\nThe MG 42 belt-feed mechanism was copied and used in the design of the [[M60 machine gun]].<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 379\">Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. 7th Edition. by Ian V.

An accessory to lengthen these sights' periscope was available to use these sights behind cover. It could be set up in a prone, kneeling or high position. The ''Lafette 42'' weighed {{convert|20.5|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} on its own and was a simplified version of the ''Lafette 34'' used for the MG 34, as the MG 42 could be operated more easily from a ''Lafette'' and featured no semi-automatic firing mode. The legs could be extended with a ''Lafetteaufsatzst\u00fcck'' to allow it to be used in the anti-aircraft role, and when lowered, it could be placed to allow the gun to be fired \"remotely\" while it swept an arc in front of the mounting with fire. Mounted to the Lafette and aimed through the telescopic sight, the effective range of the MG 42 could be extended out to {{convert|3500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} when fired indirectly. The ''Lafette 42'' tripod also had a bolt box to store a (spare) bolt and return spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bergflak.com/lafette/Lafetteindex.html|title=The Lafette 34 and 42 main index page|website=www.bergflak.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother unique feature of German World War II machine guns was the ''Tiefenfeuerautomat'' feature on the ''Lafette 42'' tripod. If selected, this feature mechanically controlled the rise and fall of the gun, elevating the gun for five rounds and then depressing it for four rounds. It lengthened the [[Field of fire (weaponry)|beaten zone]] by walking the fire in wave-like motions up and down the range in a predefined area. The length of the beaten zone could be set on the ''Tiefenfeuerautomat''. E.g., being unsure whether the real distance was {{convert|2000|or|2300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}, the gunner could make the mount do an automatic sweep between the elevations for {{convert|1900|to|2400|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} and back. This sweeping of a selected beaten zone continued as long as the gun fired. The ''Lafette 42'' had a ''Richt- und \u00dcberschie\u00dftafel'' (Overhead firing table) riveted to the rear body of the searchfire mechanism from the very start of production until the very end of it. In the later stages of World War II ballistic correction directions were added for overshooting friendly forces with [[7.92\u00d757mm_Mauser#German_military_standard_ball_service_rifle_cartridge_evolution|S.m.E. - ''Spitzgescho\u00df mit Eisenkern'' (spitzer with iron core)]] ammunition of which the external ballistic behaviour started to significantly deviate from {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} upwards compared to the ''s.S.

For this reason, the MG 45 is considered a different type of firearm, as the mechanisms of these two guns are different. It used steel of lesser quality, which reduced weight to 9&nbsp;kg, while retaining the horizontal cocking handle. First tests were undertaken in June 1944, but development dragged on and eventually only ten were built. The tested MG 45/42V fired 120,000 rounds in succession at a cyclic rate of fire around 1,350 rounds per minute.\n\nThe '''MG 42V''' had some influence in the post-war development of roller-delayed blowback system, as employed in issued [[CETME]], [[Sig Holding|SIG]] and [[Heckler & Koch]] small arms.\n\n=== T24 machine gun ===\n{{main|T24 machine gun}}\n\n[[File:T24mg6.jpg|thumb|T24 machine gun prototype mounted on a tripod]]\n\nThe [[T24 machine gun]] was a prototype reverse engineered copy of the German MG 42 general-purpose machine gun developed during World War II as a possible replacement for the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] and M1919A4 for infantry squads. The T24 was chambered for the [[.30-06 Springfield]] cartridge.\n\nBy February 1943, US ordnance authorities published the first report on the MG 42, following testing of a captured gun. The quick barrel changing and belt feed systems were considered some of the best design features. The US Army wanted to be able to manufacture this general-purpose gun because it was technically advanced and much easier to make than the World War II US light and medium machine guns and it was decided to convert several MG 42s to fire .30-06 Springfield M2 ball ammunition.<ref name=\"The M60 Machine Gun pages 12-13\">The M60 Machine Gun, Kevin Dockery, pages 12\u201313, Retrieved 1 May 2018</ref><ref name=\"US T24 Machine gun MG42\">[http://www.forgottenweapons.com/light-machine-guns/us-t24-machine-gun-mg42 US T24 Machine gun (MG42)] forgottenweapons.com; Retrieved 1 July 2014</ref>\n\nSaginaw Steering Gear Division of General Motors received a contract to construct two working converted MG 42 prototypes designated as the T24 machine gun.

A second attempt had the same result. The other prototype was plagued with excessive ejection failures and to a lesser extent failures to feed. The average cyclic rate of fire of the tested weapon was 614 rounds per minute. During January to February 1944 Aberdeen Proving Ground tests unsatisfactory functioning led to substitutions and changes of various parts in an effort to place the weapon in a position to continue the test, but all efforts failed. Firings were discontinued in February 1944 after 51 malfunctions and firing a total of 1,583 rounds by authorization of Major C. Balleisen, O.C.O. when it became evident the weapon required further development.<ref name=\"US T24 Machine gun MG42\"/><ref name=\"The M60 Machine Gun pages 12-13\"/> In March 1944 the US military concluded that functioning of the T24 machine gun prototype was unsatisfactory and recommended that further development was required before this weapon be subjected to the lengthy and severe standard light machine gun test.<ref name=\"US T24 Machine gun MG42\"/>\nHowever, the realization that the .30-06 Springfield cartridge was too long for the prototype gun's mechanism to easily and reliably work with resulted in the discarding of the project.<ref name=\"US T24 Machine gun MG42\"/> Saginaw Steering Gear did not get the opportunity to correct the flaws that caused the inability to obtain reliable uninterrupted automatic functioning and further optimize and ready the weapon for mass production before World War II ended.<ref name=\"The M60 Machine Gun pages 12-13\"/>\n\n=== MG 51 ===\n{{main|MG 51}}\n[[File:7.5mm MG 51.jpg|thumb|Swiss built W+F Bern MG 51]]\n\nThe Swiss [[MG 51]] or ''7.5 mm Maschinengewehr 1951'' was based on the design of the MG 42 chambered for [[7.5\u00d755mm Swiss|7.5\u00d755mm Swiss GP 11]]. The final design, which appeared in 1950, was in most respects still similar to the MG 42, although many components were produced by machining instead of stamping, which increased the weight, the stability and the production costs of the machine gun. To prevent short shots [[Waffenfabrik Bern]] changed the locking system from roller to [[flapper locking]]. These locking methods are similar in concept.

Starting in 1959 these [[Browning M1919]] were largely replaced by the MG 42 with modified barrel and bolt for the new 7.62\u00d751mm NATO. But to introduce a modern weapon of its own production the Office of Defence Technology, in cooperation with [[Steyr Mannlicher]] and [[Beretta]] developed a gun specifically for the Austrian Army. The German MG 42/59 that was introduced in 1959 with the Bundeswehr to replace the U.S. machine guns, served as the basis, which was similar to the Austrian 7.62&nbsp;mm MG 42. Targets were to reduce, among other things, the cyclic rate of fire and weight and have more versatile sights and mount. The development of the weapon was completed in 1974. It replaced from this year the MG 42 as the MG 74 of the Austrian Federal Army.\n\nThe modifications to the basic MG 42 design include an extra heavy bolt ({{convert|950|g|oz|2|abbr=on}} vs. the {{convert|675|g|oz|2|abbr=on}} MG 3 bolt) which reduces the cyclic rate of fire to around 850 rounds per minute. Rate of fire can be varied up to cyclic rate of fire to around 1,150 rounds per minute, if necessary, by changing the bolt and recoil spring. In addition, a select fire trigger group was added to allow semi-automatic fire (single shot) compared to the traditional fully automatic only fire capability of the original MG 42 design. The MG 74 also has a modern polymer stock and handgrips to save weight. Usually colored a dark green, adjustable rear sight (35\u00b0 horizontal, vertical 15\u00b0) and additional anti-aircraft sight can be mounted optional.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/infanterie/mg74.htm 7,62 mm Maschinengewehr MG 74 (Steyr)]</ref>\n\n===SIG MG710===\n{{main|SIG MG 710-3}}\n[[File:SIG MG 710-3.jpg|thumb|Sig MG 710-3]]\n\nThe Swiss [[SIG MG 710-3]] general-purpose machine gun was based on the design of the MG42V/MG45 using a slight modification of the roller-delayed action and chambered for 7.62\u00d751mm NATO.

It was intended to replace the earlier [[MG 34]], which was more expensive and took much longer to produce, but both weapons were produced until the end of World War II.\n\nDesigned to be low-cost and easy to build, the MG 42 proved to be highly reliable and easy to operate. It is most notable for its very high cyclic rate for a gun using full power service cartridges, averaging about 1,200 rounds per minute compared to around 850 for the MG 34, and perhaps 450 to 600 for other common machine guns like the [[M1919 Browning machine gun|M1919 Browning]] or [[Bren light machine gun|Bren]]. This ability made it extremely effective in providing [[suppressive fire]], and its unique sound led to it being nicknamed \"Hitler's buzzsaw\".<ref name=\"SAOTH-10th\">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Joseph E.|title=Small Arms of the World|date=1973|publisher=Stackpole Co.|location=Harrisburg, PA, USA|edition=10th}}</ref>\n\nThe MG 42 was adopted by several armed organizations after the war, and was both copied and [[Licensed production|built under licence]]. The MG 42's lineage continued past Nazi Germany's defeat, forming the basis for the nearly identical ''MG1'' (MG 42/59), chambered in [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]], which subsequently evolved into the MG1A3, and later the [[Bundeswehr]]'s [[Rheinmetall MG 3|MG 3]], Italian [[:it:Beretta MG 42/59|MG 42/59]] and Austrian [[MG 74]]. It also spawned the Yugoslav unlicensed nearly identical Zastava [[#M53|M53]].\n\nThe MG 42 lent many design elements to the Swiss [[MG 51]] and [[SIG MG 710-3]], American [[M60 machine gun|M60]] and Belgian [[FN MAG|MAG]] general-purpose machine guns and the Spanish [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] [[CETME Ameli|Ameli]] [[light machine gun]] though these machine guns feature other operating mechanisms or actions than the MG 42 and its lineage.\n\n==History==\n===Before World War I===\nEven before [[World War I]], the German military was already looking forward to replacing the heavy machine guns which proved to be such a success in that war. The [[MG 13|MG13]] was one of the first developments toward a goal of producing a weapon that could perform multiple roles, rather than just one. The MG13 was the result of reengineering the Dreyse Water-cooled machine gun to fit the new requirement.<ref name=\"SAOTH-10th\" /> The twin-barreled [[Gast gun]] was developed with the goal of providing a high cyclic rate of fire weapon for anti-aircraft use which was reported to have reached cyclic rates of fire as high as 1,600 rounds per minute.<ref name=\"SAOTH-10th\" />\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:German Machine Gunner (7527779440).jpg|thumb|left|Wehrmacht reenactors with a MG 34 general-purpose machine gun mounted on a ''Lafette 34'' tripod]]\n\nThis eventually led to the ''Einheitsmaschinengewehr'' (Universal machine gun) introducing an entirely new concept in automatic firepower. By changing its mount, sights and feed mechanism, the operator could radically transform an ''Einheitsmaschinengewehr'' for several purposes.\n\nThe [[MG 34]] is considered to be the first modern [[general-purpose machine gun]] or ''Einheitsmaschinengewehr''. It was developed to use the standard German 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser full-power rifle round.<ref name=\"SAOTH-10th\" /> It was envisaged and well developed to provide portable [[Light machine gun|light]] and [[medium machine gun]] infantry cover, anti-aircraft coverage, and even sniping ability. Equipped with a quick-change barrel and fed either with [[Belt (firearms)#Non-Disintegrating|non-disintegrating metallic-link belts]], or from a 50-round ''Gurttrommel'' (belt drum) or a 75-round spring-loaded [[Drum magazine|saddle-drum]] ''Patronentrommel 34'' magazines (with a simple change of the feed cover for a Trommelhalter magazine holder), the MG 34 could sustain fire for much longer periods of time than other portable [[Squad automatic weapon|squad-level weapons]] such as the American [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|B.A.R.]] and the British [[Bren Gun]], both of which were fed by [[Magazine (firearms)|box magazines]], while also being much lighter and more portable than crew-served weapons like the [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning M1919]] or [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] machine guns (which also lacked quick-change barrels). The MG 34 was also quite versatile; not only was it able to be fed from belted ammunition or a saddle drum magazine, it could also be fired from a bipod, an innovative ''Lafette 34'' tripod or various pintle mounts for armored vehicles. Switching between a bipod and a tripod required no special tools, as the mounting latch was spring-loaded. As the '''MG 34 ''Panzerlauf''''', it was used throughout the war as secondary armament on [[panzer]]s and other vehicles. One attempt at improvement was the '''MG 34S''', an incremental improvement on the basic 34 design. The improvements consisted of a shortened and lightened barrel, a stiffer recoil spring and a more potent recoil booster to increase the rate of fire. The MG 34S could cope with a cyclic fire rate of 1,200 rounds per minute but its components became highly stressed. Later in the war, the MG 34 was used as the basis for the [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[MG 81]] flexible defensive gun that had a cyclic fire rate of 1,400-1,600 rounds per minute. However, the MG 34 did have its drawbacks, such as sensitivity to dirt and mud, and comparatively complex and expensive production.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=W.H.B.|title=Small Arms of the World|date=1973|publisher=Stackpole|pages=437\u2013442|edition=10th}}</ref>\n\n===Development of the MG 42===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1983-109-14A, Frankreich, MG-Sch\u00fctze.jpg|thumb|left|A German [[Waffen SS]] soldier involved in heavy fighting in and around the French town of [[Caen]] in mid-1944. He is carrying an MG 42 configured as a light support weapon with a folding [[bipod]] and detachable 50-round belt drum container.]]\n\nIn order to address these issues, a contest was held for a true MG 34 replacement. Three companies were asked to submit designs: Metall und Lackierwarenfabrik Johannes Gro\u00dffu\u00df AG of [[D\u00f6beln]], [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig]] of [[S\u00f6mmerda]], and St\u00fcbgen of [[Erfurt]].<ref name=\"Willbanks\">Willbanks, James: ''Machine Guns: An Illustrated History of Their Impact'', page 115. ABC-CLIO, 2004.</ref> Of the number of proposals submitted, Gro\u00dffu\u00df AG's proved to be the best design by far, employing a unique [[Recoil operation|recoil-operated]] [[Roller locked|roller locking]] mechanism whereas the two competing designs used a [[Gas-operated reloading|gas-actuated]] system.<ref name=\"Willbanks\"/> The company had no earlier experience in weapons manufacture, specializing in [[Stamping (metalworking)|pressed and stamped steel]] components (the company's staple product was [[sheet metal]] [[lantern]]s). Dr.-Ing. [[Werner Gruner]], one of the leading design engineers with Gro\u00dffu\u00df, knew nothing about machine guns when he was given the task of being involved with the project, although he specialized in the technology of mass production. [[:de:Werner Gruner|Gruner]] would attend an army machine gunner's course to familiarize himself with the utility and characteristics of such a weapon, also seeking input from soldiers. He then recycled an existing [[Mauser]]-developed operating system and incorporated features from his experiences with army machine gunners and lessons learned during the early stages of the war.<ref name=\"Willbanks\"/> Being made largely out of stamped appropriately hardened metal, the new design required considerably less machining and fewer high grade steel alloys. It was much simpler to build than other machine guns\u2014it took 75 [[man hour]]s to complete the new gun as opposed to 150 man hours for the MG 34 (a 50% reduction)\u2014and cost 250 [[German reichsmark|RM]] as opposed to 327 RM (a 24% reduction).\n\nThe resulting '''MG 39''' remained similar to the earlier MG 34 overall, a deliberate decision made to maintain familiarity. The only major changes from the gunner's perspective were dropping of the drum-magazine feed option, leaving the weapon to fire [[Belt (firearm)|belted ammunition]], or from a single 50-round drum-shaped ''Gurttrommel'' belt container fitted to the gun's receiver, and simplifying the weapon's [[Iron sights|open sights]] for aiming purposes. All these changes were intended to increase, maintain, or accommodate the gun's high practical rate of fire. Although made of relatively inexpensive and simple parts, the prototypes also proved to be considerably more rugged and resistant to jamming than the precisely machined and somewhat temperamental MG 34. A limited run of about 1,500 of its immediate predecessor, the MG 39/41, was completed in 1941 and tested in combat trials.\n\n===Adoption of the MG 42===\nThe weapon was officially accepted, and the main manufacturing of the production design began in 1942, as the '''MG 42''', contracts going to [[:de:Metall- und Lackwarenfabrik Johannes Gro\u00dffu\u00df|Gro\u00dffu\u00df]], [[Mauser-Werke]], [[Simson (company)#1934\u201348|Gustloff-Werke]] and others. Production during the war amounted to over 400,000 units (17,915 units in 1942, 116,725 in 1943, 211,806 in 1944, and 61,877 in 1945).<ref name=\"Folke Myrvang 2003\"/>\n\n===MG 42 nicknames===\nThe distinctive sound caused by the high cyclic firing rate gave rise to the nickname \"Hitler's buzzsaw\" and the German soldiers' ''Hitlers\u00e4ge'', ''Singende S\u00e4ge'', ''Knochens\u00e4ge'' or ''elektrisches MG'' (\"Hitler's saw\", \"Singing saw\", \"Bone saw\" or \"electric machine gun\"). The gun (like the MG 34) was sometimes called \"Spandau\" by British troops, a traditional generic term for all German machine guns, left over from the famous Allied nickname for the [[MG 08]] [[Maxim gun|Maxim]]-derivative used by German forces during World War I and derived from [[Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken|its manufacturer]]'s plates noting the city of [[Spandau]] where some were produced.<ref>[http://ww2db.com/weapon.php?q=10 MG 42 Machine Gun], World War II Database</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/mgun_spandau.htm |title=Encyclopedia - Spandau Gun |website=Firstworldwar.com |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}</ref> [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|Brazilian expeditionary soldiers]] fighting in Italy used to refer to MG 42 as ''Lourdinha''; this nickname is due to the fact that the bride of one of the soldiers, named Maria de Lourdes, was a seamstress and the sound of MG 42 was similar to the sound of her sewing machine (''Lourdinha'' is a common nickname in Brazil for women called Maria de Lourdes).<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/brasil-43398292 | title=O soldado que transformou em m\u00fasica uma batalha hist\u00f3rica para o Brasil na 2\u00aa Guerra| newspaper=BBC News Brasil| date=2018-03-18| last1=Bernardo| first1=Andr\u00e9}}</ref><ref>http://rubi.casaruibarbosa.gov.br/bitstream/20.500.11997/3875/1/Di%2bi%CC%81rio%20Carioca%20-%20DE%20-%2019441945.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ufjf.br/ppghistoria/files/2009/12/Marcos-Antonio-T-Costa9.pdf</ref>\n\n== Small arms doctrine ==\n[[File:MG42 1 noBG.jpg|thumb|MG 42 with its bipod unfolded]]\n\nThe German tactical doctrine of the era based a [[squad]]'s firepower on the general-purpose machine gun in the light machine gun role so that the role of the rifleman was largely to carry ammunition and provide covering fire for the machine gunners. The advantage of the general purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit.<ref>Hogg, Ian V., & Weeks, John.

Elite PUBLISHING|website=murdercube.com}}</ref>\nThis meant that German forces deployed far more machine guns per equivalent-sized unit than the Allies,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} and that Allied troops assaulting a German position almost invariably faced the firepower of the MG 42.  It was possible for operating crews to lay down a non-stop barrage of fire, pausing only when the barrel had to be replaced.  This allowed the MG 42 to tie up significantly larger numbers of enemy troops.  The Americans and the British trained their troops to take cover from the fire of an MG 42, and assault the position during the small time window of barrel replacement, which took around 4 to 7 seconds (estimated).\n\nThe German military kept issuing [[Karabiner 98k]] [[bolt-action]] rifles and did experiment with semi-automatic rifles throughout World War II. They fielded the [[Gewehr 41]] series of which fewer than 150,000 were built, and the [[Gewehr 43|Gewehr 43/Karabiner 43]] series of which 402,713 were built. They also introduced the first [[assault rifle]] in 1943 \u2013 the [[MP43]] / [[MP44]] / [[StG 44]] series, producing 425,977 of these. But the Karabiner 98k was made in far greater numbers - over 14,600,000 - and due to the relatively limited production of the semi-automatic and assault rifles, the bolt-action Karabiner remained the primary service weapon until the last days of World War II, and was manufactured until the surrender in May 1945.\n\nThe Allied nations squad tactical doctrines of World War II centered on the rifleman, with the machine gun serving a support role, and they utilised weapons with cyclic fire rates of typically 450\u2013600 rounds per minute. The American military had standardized a [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] rifle in 1936 (the [[M1 Garand]]) that could be effectively fired more rapidly than the preceding bolt-action rifles. The Allied nations had machine guns with similar rates of fire, but mounted them almost exclusively in aircraft, where the fleeting opportunities for firing made such high rates necessary.  The only similar Allied weapon was the [[Vickers K machine gun|Vickers K aircraft gun]], and that was used by ground forces only in specialized circumstances.\n\n===Light machine gun fire support role===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-204-1727-18, Jugoslawien, Soldaten mit MG 42 im Schnee.jpg|thumb|Machine gun team in Yugoslavia]]\n\nA German infantry ''Gruppe'' (squad) consisted of ten men; a non-commissioned officer or ''[[Unteroffizier]]'' squad leader, deputy squad leader, a three-man machine gun team (machine gunner, assistant gunner/loader and ammunition carrier) and five riflemen. As personal small arms the squad leader was issued a [[rifle]] or as of around 1941 a [[submachine gun]], the  machine gunner and his assistant were issued [[pistol]]s and the deputy squad leader, ammunition carrier and the riflemen were issued rifles.

A high [[Rate of fire#Cyclic rate|cyclic rate of fire]] is advantageous for use against targets that are exposed to a general-purpose machine gun for a limited time span, like aircraft or targets that minimize their exposure time by quickly moving from cover to cover. For targets that can be fired on by a general-purpose machine gun for longer periods than just a few seconds, the cyclic firing rate becomes less important. As a consequence, one of the MG 42's most notable features was in its high cyclic rate of fire of about 1,200 to 1,500 rounds per minute, twice the rate of the Vickers and Browning machine guns, which fired at a rate of about 600 rounds per minute.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/> The ear could not easily discern the sound of individual [[bullet|shot]]s being fired, instead hearing a sound described as like \"ripping cloth\" or a buzzsaw.\n\nThe MG 42's high cyclic rate of fire sometimes proved a liability mainly in that, while the weapon could be used to devastating effect, it could quickly exhaust its ammunition supply. For this reason, it was not uncommon for all soldiers operating near an MG 42 to carry extra ammunition, thus providing the MG 42 with a backup source when its main supply was exhausted. Another disadvantage of the MG 42 was that the high cyclic rate of fire led to the barrel overheating quickly during rapid fire. After around 150 rounds of rapid fire, the gun operator would open a side hatch (leading to the barrel) and replace the hot barrel with a new cool(er) one. Non-observance of this technical limitation renders the barrel prematurely unusable.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/> The machine gun crew member responsible for a hot barrel change was issued protective asbestos gloves to prevent burns to the hands.\n\nThe German military instructed that sustained fire must be avoided at all costs. They ruled that the results of sustained fire were disappointing and that the expenditure of ammunition involved was \"intolerable.\"<ref name=\"GermanMG42Views\" /> In the bipod-mounted light machine gun role, MG 42 users were trained to fire short bursts of 3 to 7 rounds and strive to optimize their aim between bursts fired in succession.<ref name=\"GermanMG42Views\" /> For its medium machine gun role, the MG 42 was matched to the newly developed ''Lafette 42'' [[tripod]]. In the tripod-mounted medium machine gun role, MG 42 users were trained to fire short bursts and bursts of 20 to 50 rounds and strive to optimize their aim between bursts fired in succession.<ref name=\"GermanMG42Views\" /> As a consequence of factors like the time spent reloading, aiming, changing hot barrels if necessary to allow for cooling, the MG 42's practical [[Rate of fire#Sustained or effective rate|effective rate of fire]] was 154 rounds per minute, versus 150 rounds per minute for the MG 34.<ref name=\"GermanMG42Views\" />\n\n==Design details==\n[[Image:DCB Shooting MG42 Roller system.JPG|thumb|right|MG 42 roller-locked system]]\n[[File:Schnittbild.MG3.jpg|thumb|MG3 in 7.62mm NATO]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J14917, Sizilien, Fla - MG sichert Kolonne bei der Rast.jpg|thumb|MG 42 with auxiliary anti-aircraft \"spider web\" ring sight mounted]]\n\nThe MG 42 is a [[7.92\u00d757mm Mauser]], air-cooled, [[belt fed]], [[open bolt]], recoil-operated machine gun with a quick change barrel.\n\nThe MG 42 weighed 11.57&nbsp;kg in the light machine gun role with the [[bipod]], lighter than the MG 34 and easily portable. The bipod, the same one used on the MG 34, could be mounted to the front or the center of the gun depending on how and where it was being used.\n\nThe roller-locked bolt assembly consists of a bolt head, two rollers, a striker sleeve, bolt body, and a large multi strands around a central coil return spring, which is responsible for pushing the bolt assembly into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the bolt assembly, the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The bolt assembly locks with the barrel's breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.\n\nThe roller-locked recoil operation functions as follows: two cylindrical rollers, positioned in tracks on the bolt head, are pushed outwards into matching tracks in the barrel extension by the striker sleeve and lock the bolt in place against the breech. Upon firing, rearward force from the recoil of the cartridge ignition pushes the striker assembly back and allows the rollers to move inwards, back to their previous position, unlocking the bolt head and allowing the bolt assembly and barrel to recoil, extracting the spent cartridge and ejecting it down. The return spring then pushes the bolt assembly forwards again, pushing a new cartridge out of the belt into the breech, and the sequence repeats as long as the trigger is depressed. The MG 42 is capable only of [[Automatic firearm|fully automatic]] fire. Single shots are difficult, even for experienced operators, due to the weapon's rate of fire. The usual training objective is to be able to fire a burst of no more than three rounds. The weapon features a [[recoil booster]] at the muzzle to increase rearwards force due to recoil, therefore improving functional reliability and rate of fire.\n\nThe cyclic firing rate of the MG 42 can be altered by installing different bolts and recoil springs. A heavier bolt uses more recoil energy to overcome inertia, thus slowing the cyclic rate of the machine gun. Heavy bolts also were used along with stiffer [[Hooke's law|return springs]]. The standard MG 42 bolt weight for a normal rate of fire is {{convert|550|g|oz|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"WG-MG42-3\">{{cite web|title=MG 42 and MG 3 machine gun|url=http://modernfirearms.net/machine/de/mg-42-and-mg-3-e.html|website=World Guns|accessdate=18 February 2017|date=2010-10-27}}</ref>\n\nThe shoulder stock is designed to permit gripping with the left hand to hold it secure against the shoulder.\n\nThe open-type [[iron sight]]ing line has a relatively short {{convert|430|mm|in|1|sp=us}} radius and consists of a \"\u2227-type\" height adjustable front sight on a folding post and a leaf rear sight with an open V-notch sliding on a ramp, graduated from {{convert|200|to|2,000|m|yds|0|sp=us}} in {{convert|100|m|yds|0|sp=us}} increments.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/> An auxiliary anti-aircraft \"spider web\" ring sight is kept in the maintenance kit, that can be fitting on the barrel jacket to be used in conjunction with a folding anti-aircraft rear peep sight that is attached by a hinge to the rear sight element base.\n\nThe {{convert|530|mm|in|1|sp=us}} long barrel of the MG 42 could be quickly changed by the machine gun crew and weighed {{convert|1.75|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} including the locking piece.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/> The barrels could have traditional [[rifling]] or [[polygonal rifling]]. Polygonal rifling was an outgrowth of a [[cold forming|cold-hammer forging]] process developed by German engineers before World War II. The process addressed the need to produce more durable machine gun barrels in less time than those produced with traditional methods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=37197|title=Barrels and Bullets: Conventional Versus Polygonal Rifling - Human Events|website=humanevents.com}}</ref> Later produced barrel bores featured [[Chrome plating#Hard|hard-chrome plating]] to make them more durable. The different versions meant that the service life of an MG 42 barrel varied between 3,500 and 8,000 rounds assuming the barrel was used according to regulation that prohibited rapid firing over 150 rounds. Excessive overheating caused by rapid firing about 500 rounds through a barrel resulted in unacceptable wear of the bore rendering the barrel useless.<ref name=MG42handbookHDV1817/>\nThe method of barrel change made the MG 42 unsuitable for secondary or co-axial armament on World War II era German tanks with the exception of the [[Jagdpanzer IV]]. Early versions of the Jagdpanzer IV carried two standard (no modification made) MG 42s on both sides of the gun mantlet/glacis, firing through a ball slot which was protected by an armored cover (with the MG 42 retracted) when not in use. Later version Jagdpanzer IVs carried only one MG 42 on the left side.\n\nThe MG 42 incorporated lessons hard-won on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. Both the cocking handle and the catch for the top cover to the working parts were designed so that the gunner could operate them wearing arctic mittens or with a stick or rod. This was vital for winter conditions where contact by bare flesh on cold metal could cause severe injury, such as instant [[frostbite]]. The MG 42 also functioned well in other climates; dust and dirt in North Africa and Italy was less likely to jam the MG 42 than the more temperamental MG 34.\n\nThe original MG 42 roller-locked action had an undesirable tendency to exhibit bolt-bounce. It was possible to unintentionally fire the MG 42 when the action was not fully locked causing dangerous conditions. Once the problem was identified, the temporary solution was to design and manufacture ammunition with primers with a slightly slower ignition time which allowed the rollers to settle into lockup and issue that ammunition specifically for MG 42 use.<ref name=\"waffen-welt.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.waffen-welt.de/bilder/DiePatrone7.92x57.pdf|title=Die Patrone 7.92mm (8x57)|author=|date=|website=waffen-welt.de|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>. A more practical solution to control the harmonics in the roller/wedge system was needed. The roller-locking system inherent problem was solved by developing and adding bolt-bounce preventing bolt catches to the action.<ref>[https://www.mg-42.net/mg42_bolt_catches.htm MG 42 bolt catches]</ref>\n\nThe MG 42 belt-feed mechanism was copied and used in the design of the [[M60 machine gun]].<ref name=\"Century 2000. page 379\">Military Small Arms of the 20th Century. 7th Edition. by Ian V.

An accessory to lengthen these sights' periscope was available to use these sights behind cover. It could be set up in a prone, kneeling or high position. The ''Lafette 42'' weighed {{convert|20.5|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} on its own and was a simplified version of the ''Lafette 34'' used for the MG 34, as the MG 42 could be operated more easily from a ''Lafette'' and featured no semi-automatic firing mode. The legs could be extended with a ''Lafetteaufsatzst\u00fcck'' to allow it to be used in the anti-aircraft role, and when lowered, it could be placed to allow the gun to be fired \"remotely\" while it swept an arc in front of the mounting with fire. Mounted to the Lafette and aimed through the telescopic sight, the effective range of the MG 42 could be extended out to {{convert|3500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} when fired indirectly. The ''Lafette 42'' tripod also had a bolt box to store a (spare) bolt and return spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bergflak.com/lafette/Lafetteindex.html|title=The Lafette 34 and 42 main index page|website=www.bergflak.com}}</ref>\n\nAnother unique feature of German World War II machine guns was the ''Tiefenfeuerautomat'' feature on the ''Lafette 42'' tripod. If selected, this feature mechanically controlled the rise and fall of the gun, elevating the gun for five rounds and then depressing it for four rounds. It lengthened the [[Field of fire (weaponry)|beaten zone]] by walking the fire in wave-like motions up and down the range in a predefined area. The length of the beaten zone could be set on the ''Tiefenfeuerautomat''. E.g., being unsure whether the real distance was {{convert|2000|or|2300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}, the gunner could make the mount do an automatic sweep between the elevations for {{convert|1900|to|2400|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} and back. This sweeping of a selected beaten zone continued as long as the gun fired. The ''Lafette 42'' had a ''Richt- und \u00dcberschie\u00dftafel'' (Overhead firing table) riveted to the rear body of the searchfire mechanism from the very start of production until the very end of it. In the later stages of World War II ballistic correction directions were added for overshooting friendly forces with [[7.92\u00d757mm_Mauser#German_military_standard_ball_service_rifle_cartridge_evolution|S.m.E. - ''Spitzgescho\u00df mit Eisenkern'' (spitzer with iron core)]] ammunition of which the external ballistic behaviour started to significantly deviate from {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} upwards compared to the ''s.S.

For this reason, the MG 45 is considered a different type of firearm, as the mechanisms of these two guns are different. It used steel of lesser quality, which reduced weight to 9&nbsp;kg, while retaining the horizontal cocking handle. First tests were undertaken in June 1944, but development dragged on and eventually only ten were built. The tested MG 45/42V fired 120,000 rounds in succession at a cyclic rate of fire around 1,350 rounds per minute.\n\nThe '''MG 42V''' had some influence in the post-war development of roller-delayed blowback system, as employed in issued [[CETME]], [[Sig Holding|SIG]] and [[Heckler & Koch]] small arms.\n\n=== T24 machine gun ===\n{{main|T24 machine gun}}\n\n[[File:T24mg6.jpg|thumb|T24 machine gun prototype mounted on a tripod]]\n\nThe [[T24 machine gun]] was a prototype reverse engineered copy of the German MG 42 general-purpose machine gun developed during World War II as a possible replacement for the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]] and M1919A4 for infantry squads. The T24 was chambered for the [[.30-06 Springfield]] cartridge.\n\nBy February 1943, US ordnance authorities published the first report on the MG 42, following testing of a captured gun. The quick barrel changing and belt feed systems were considered some of the best design features. The US Army wanted to be able to manufacture this general-purpose gun because it was technically advanced and much easier to make than the World War II US light and medium machine guns and it was decided to convert several MG 42s to fire .30-06 Springfield M2 ball ammunition.<ref name=\"The M60 Machine Gun pages 12-13\">The M60 Machine Gun, Kevin Dockery, pages 12\u201313, Retrieved 1 May 2018</ref><ref name=\"US T24 Machine gun MG42\">[http://www.forgottenweapons.com/light-machine-guns/us-t24-machine-gun-mg42 US T24 Machine gun (MG42)] forgottenweapons.com; Retrieved 1 July 2014</ref>\n\nSaginaw Steering Gear Division of General Motors received a contract to construct two working converted MG 42 prototypes designated as the T24 machine gun.

A second attempt had the same result. The other prototype was plagued with excessive ejection failures and to a lesser extent failures to feed. The average cyclic rate of fire of the tested weapon was 614 rounds per minute. During January to February 1944 Aberdeen Proving Ground tests unsatisfactory functioning led to substitutions and changes of various parts in an effort to place the weapon in a position to continue the test, but all efforts failed. Firings were discontinued in February 1944 after 51 malfunctions and firing a total of 1,583 rounds by authorization of Major C. Balleisen, O.C.O. when it became evident the weapon required further development.<ref name=\"US T24 Machine gun MG42\"/><ref name=\"The M60 Machine Gun pages 12-13\"/> In March 1944 the US military concluded that functioning of the T24 machine gun prototype was unsatisfactory and recommended that further development was required before this weapon be subjected to the lengthy and severe standard light machine gun test.<ref name=\"US T24 Machine gun MG42\"/>\nHowever, the realization that the .30-06 Springfield cartridge was too long for the prototype gun's mechanism to easily and reliably work with resulted in the discarding of the project.<ref name=\"US T24 Machine gun MG42\"/> Saginaw Steering Gear did not get the opportunity to correct the flaws that caused the inability to obtain reliable uninterrupted automatic functioning and further optimize and ready the weapon for mass production before World War II ended.<ref name=\"The M60 Machine Gun pages 12-13\"/>\n\n=== MG 51 ===\n{{main|MG 51}}\n[[File:7.5mm MG 51.jpg|thumb|Swiss built W+F Bern MG 51]]\n\nThe Swiss [[MG 51]] or ''7.5 mm Maschinengewehr 1951'' was based on the design of the MG 42 chambered for [[7.5\u00d755mm Swiss|7.5\u00d755mm Swiss GP 11]]. The final design, which appeared in 1950, was in most respects still similar to the MG 42, although many components were produced by machining instead of stamping, which increased the weight, the stability and the production costs of the machine gun. To prevent short shots [[Waffenfabrik Bern]] changed the locking system from roller to [[flapper locking]]. These locking methods are similar in concept.

Starting in 1959 these [[Browning M1919]] were largely replaced by the MG 42 with modified barrel and bolt for the new 7.62\u00d751mm NATO. But to introduce a modern weapon of its own production the Office of Defence Technology, in cooperation with [[Steyr Mannlicher]] and [[Beretta]] developed a gun specifically for the Austrian Army. The German MG 42/59 that was introduced in 1959 with the Bundeswehr to replace the U.S. machine guns, served as the basis, which was similar to the Austrian 7.62&nbsp;mm MG 42. Targets were to reduce, among other things, the cyclic rate of fire and weight and have more versatile sights and mount. The development of the weapon was completed in 1974. It replaced from this year the MG 42 as the MG 74 of the Austrian Federal Army.\n\nThe modifications to the basic MG 42 design include an extra heavy bolt ({{convert|950|g|oz|2|abbr=on}} vs. the {{convert|675|g|oz|2|abbr=on}} MG 3 bolt) which reduces the cyclic rate of fire to around 850 rounds per minute. Rate of fire can be varied up to cyclic rate of fire to around 1,150 rounds per minute, if necessary, by changing the bolt and recoil spring. In addition, a select fire trigger group was added to allow semi-automatic fire (single shot) compared to the traditional fully automatic only fire capability of the original MG 42 design. The MG 74 also has a modern polymer stock and handgrips to save weight. Usually colored a dark green, adjustable rear sight (35\u00b0 horizontal, vertical 15\u00b0) and additional anti-aircraft sight can be mounted optional.<ref>[http://www.doppeladler.com/oebh/infanterie/mg74.htm 7,62 mm Maschinengewehr MG 74 (Steyr)]</ref>\n\n===SIG MG710===\n{{main|SIG MG 710-3}}\n[[File:SIG MG 710-3.jpg|thumb|Sig MG 710-3]]\n\nThe Swiss [[SIG MG 710-3]] general-purpose machine gun was based on the design of the MG42V/MG45 using a slight modification of the roller-delayed action and chambered for 7.62\u00d751mm NATO. Its cyclic rate of fire is 900 rounds per minute.
