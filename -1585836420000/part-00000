They continued appearing on ''Radio Free Oz'', which later moved to [[KRLA 1110]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and then [[KMET (FM)|KMET FM]], through February 1969. They produced fifteen [[album|record album]]s and a [[single (music)|45 rpm single]] under contract to\n[[Columbia Records]] from 1967 through 1976,<ref>This total includes one release on Columbia's subsidiary label, [[Epic Records]].</ref> and had three nationally syndicated radio programs: ''The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour'' [sic] in 1970 on [[KPPC-FM]]; and ''[[Dear Friends (radio program)|Dear Friends]]'' (1970\u20131971) and ''Let's Eat!'' (1971\u20131972) on KPFK. They also appeared in front of live audiences, and continued to write, perform, and record on other labels, occasionally taking sabbaticals during which they wrote or performed solo or in smaller groups.\n\nThe Firesign Theatre was the brainchild of [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]], and all of its material was conceived, written, and performed by its members Bergman, [[Philip Proctor]], [[Phil Austin]], and [[David Ossman]]. The group's name stems from [[astrology]], because all four were born under the three \"[[Astrology and the classical elements|fire signs]]\": [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] (Austin), [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (Proctor), and [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] (Bergman and Ossman). Their popularity peaked in the early 1970s, and ebbed in the [[Reagan Era]]. They experienced a revival and second wave of popularity in the 1990s and continued to write, record and perform until Bergman's death in 2012.\n\nIn 1997, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the Firesign Theatre among the \"Thirty Greatest Comedy Acts of All Time\". Their 1970 album ''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]'' was nominated in 1971 for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] by the [[World Science Fiction Society]], and their next album ''[[I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus]]'' received the same nomination in 1972. Later, they received nominations for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] for three of their albums: ''[[The Three Faces of Al]]'' (1984), ''[[Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death]]'' (1998), and ''[[Bride of Firesign]]'' (2001). In 2005, the US [[Library of Congress]] added ''Don't Crush That Dwarf'' to the [[National Recording Registry]] and called the group \"[[the Beatles]] of comedy.\"\n\n==Before ''Firesign''==\n[[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]] and [[Philip Proctor]] met while attending [[Yale University]] in the late 1950s, where Proctor studied acting, and Bergman edited the Yale comedy magazine. Bergman studied playwriting and collaborated as lyricist with [[Austin Pendleton]] in 1958 on two [[Yale Dramatic Association|Yale Dramat]] musicals in which Proctor starred: ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'', and ''[[Edwin Booth|Booth]] Is Back In Town''.<ref name=\"Firesignmedia_Bergman\">{{cite web|title=Who Am Us, Anyway?

According to Austin, the show \"featured everybody who was anybody in the artistic world who passed through LA.\" Guests included the band [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Andy Warhol]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> In November, Proctor was in Los Angeles looking for acting work and watching the [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]]. When he discovered he was sitting on a newspaper photo of Bergman, he called his college buddy, who recruited him as the fourth man for his comedy group.\n\nBergman originally named the group the \"Oz Firesign Theatre\" because all four were born under the three [[astrological sign|astrological fire sign]]s (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius), and debuted them on his November 17, 1966 show. He had to drop \"Oz\" from the name after legal threats from [[Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]], who owned movie rights to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and [[Return to Oz|other associated works]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n==''Radio Free Oz''==\nThe Firesigns initially chose an [[improvisational theatre|improvisational]] style, and carried it to a level which revolutionized [[radio comedy]]. According to Proctor:<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n{{Quote|We each independently created our own material and characters and brought them together, not knowing what the others were going to pull. And it was all based on put-ons; that is, we were assuming characters that were assumed to be real by the listeners.

We could be as outrageous as we wanted to be and they believed us\u2014which was astonishingly funny and interesting and terrifying to us, because it showed the power of the medium and the gullibility and vulnerability of most people.}}\n\nOn nights when he had no guests, Bergman would have the Firesigns come on the air and pretend (including himself) to be outrageously interesting guests. On their November 17, 1966 debut, they pretended to be the panel of an imaginary \"Oz Film Festival\": Bergman was film critic Peter Volta, \"writing a history of world cinema one frame at a time\"; Ossman was Raul Saez, maker of \u201cthrown camera\u201d films, who had just won a grant to roll a [[70 mm film]] camera down the [[Andes mountains]]; Austin was Jack Love, making \"Living Room Theatre\" porn films like ''The Nun'' and ''Blondie Pays the Rent''; and Proctor was Jean-Claude Jean-Claude, creator of the \"Nouvelle Nouvelle Vague Vague movement\" and director of a documentary ''Two Weeks With Fred'', which lasts a full two weeks.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/>\n\nBy 1967, Bergman had the Firesign Theatre appear regularly on ''Radio Free Oz''.<ref name=\"DearFriends_liner_notes\">{{cite AV media |people= |date=1972 |title= Dear Friends |trans-title= |medium=CD liner |language= |url=https://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=df-ln |access-date=March 27, 2020 |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> The Firesigns were strongly influenced by the British ''[[The Goon Show|Goon Show]]''.

Bergman countered with a proposal for a Firesign Theatre album, and this led to a five-year<ref>According to Ossman's ''Martian Space Party Diary'', Columbia signed the Firesigns to a second five-year contract on March 9, 1972.</ref> recording contract with the label.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Usher also used the Firesigns' audio collages on songs by [[The Byrds]] (\"Draft Morning\") and [[Sagittarius (band)|Sagittarius]] (the [[Single (music)|45 RPM]] version of \"Hotel Indiscreet\") in 1967 and 1968.\n\nThe album was given the [[non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] title ''[[Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him]]'', from Bergman's undeveloped 1965 idea for a comic film. The Firesigns changed their improvisational style, producing tightly scripted and memorized material. According to Bergman: \"There was no leader. Everything was communally written, and if one person didn't agree about something, no matter how strongly the other three felt about it, it didn't go in.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> The Firesigns always billed themselves alphabetically on their album jackets and other printed materials. \nThe resulting synergy created the feeling of a fifth Firesign; according to Austin: \"It's like, suddenly there is this fifth guy that actually does the writing. We all vaguely sort of know him, and a lot of the time take credit for him.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> This resulted in the group inventing the name \"4 or 5 Krazy Guys Publishing\" to copyright their work.<ref name=\"Bozos_liner_notes\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus |title-link= |year=1971 |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=bozos-ln |access-date=April 4, 2019 |type=liner notes |publisher= |id= |location= |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401143251/http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=bozos-ln |archivedate=April 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Their contract with Columbia, in exchange for a low royalty rate, gave them unlimited studio time, allowing them to perfect their writing and recording.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n''Electrician'' revolutionized the concept of the [[comedy album]]: it consists of four radio plays. Side one is a trilogy of pieces: starting with \"Temporarily Humboldt County\", a satire of the Europeans' displacement of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]; followed by \"W. C. Fields Forever\", a satire of the 1960s [[hippie]] culture; leading into \"Trente-Huit Cunegonde (Returned for Regrooving)\", a projected future in which the roles of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] and [[the Establishment]] culture are reversed. Side two, the title track, is a [[stream-of-consciousness]] play about an American tourist to an [[Eastern Bloc]] country (Proctor), who ends up in prison and is rescued by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. It was recorded in [[CBS]]'s Los Angeles radio studio from which ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' and others had been broadcast; the original [[RCA]] microphones and [[sound effects]] devices were used. It was released in January 1968, selling a modest 12,000 copies in its first year.\n\nThe Firesigns continued to work on the radio and began performing in [[folk club]]s such as the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> ''Radio Free Oz'' moved again to [[KMET (FM)|KMET FM]] until February 1969. ''The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour''{{sic|nolink=y}} aired for two hours on Sunday nights on [[KPPC-FM]] in 1970.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/> They would concentrate their writing on the folk club material, and produce improvisational skit material for the ''Radio Hour'' and its successors.\n\nThe Firesigns almost lost their recording contract after their first album. According to Bergman: \"Columbia was going to kick us off the label, so we scripted the next record and the old guard at Columbia took a look at the script and said 'This isn't funny\u2014this is dirty!' And to our rescue came [[James William Guercio]] [producer of [[the Buckinghams]]]\nand [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]].\" Austin says, \"With Hammond backing us up, CBS came around.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> They went on to produce three more Columbia studio albums from 1969 to 1971. Each grew technically more sophisticated, taking advantage of [[multitrack recording|up to 16 tape tracks]] and [[Dolby noise reduction]] by 1970.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All]]'', released in 1969, consists of a stream-of-consciousness play on side one about a man named Babe (Bergman) who buys a car and goes on a road trip that turns into a parody of [[Norman Corwin]]'s 1941 patriotic radio pageant ''[[We Hold These Truths]]''.<ref>[http://www.doctechnical.com/fst/notes/hcyb-cd.htm CD Liner Notes by David Ossman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026043336/http://www.doctechnical.com/fst/notes/hcyb-cd.htm |date=2006-10-26 }}</ref> Side two, ''The Further Adventures of [[Nick Danger]]'', is a parody of 1940s radio, about a [[hard-boiled detective]] (Austin) who became possibly the Firesigns' most famous character.\n\n''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]'' (1970) is a single play centered around an actor named George Tirebiter (Ossman), who gradually ages into an old man while watching his old movies on television: a [[the Aldrich Family|Henry Aldrich]] parody ''High School Madness'' (in which he is named Porgie Tirebiter), and the [[Korean War]] film ''Parallel Hell''. ''Dwarf'' marked a high point in the Firesign's use of [[blue comedy]]: Porgie has explicit sex with the [[Negro]] housemaid as creaking bedsprings are heard. This album was nominated for a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] in 1971 by the [[World Science Fiction Society]],<ref name=\"Hugo71\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1971-hugo-awards/ |title=1971 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2010-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164616/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1971-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''Dwarf'' brought a level of success to the Firesigns that started to spoil them. Bergman said, \"We toured after ''Dwarf'' and we began to realize the extent we were influencing people. We realized that FM radio was playing our albums whole, and that people were memorizing them.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Austin said of this period, \"At that point we began not to get along with each other that well, and the being taken so seriously \u2014- ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' did a long article on us, and we were being compared to [[James Joyce]] \u2014- there was a prideful attitude that took over. But we weren't making money; we might as well have been teaching school somewhere and worrying about making tenure for all the money we were making. So in some sense we didn't really understand what we were doing, which is why we were never able to make a second ''Dwarf'', which to me is a real disappointment.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\nTheir fourth album, ''[[I Think We're All Bozos On This Bus]]'' (1971), also a single play, centers on a young, [[PDP-10|early-technology computer]] [[security hacker|hacker]] (Proctor) and an older \"bozo\" with a large nose that honks like a clown's (Austin), who attend a [[Walt Disney World|Disneyesque]] Future Fair. The blue comedy was dialed back from explicit to suggestive, as a scientist invents a machine that mimics sexual intercourse. This album also received a Hugo nomination in 1972.<ref name=\"Hugo72\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1972-hugo-awards/ |title=1972 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2010-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164619/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1972-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, from September 9, 1970 to February 17, 1971, they were performing a one-hour weekly live series on KPFK, ''[[Dear Friends (radio program)|Dear Friends]]''. These programs were recorded and then edited into slightly shorter shows and syndicated to radio stations across the country on [[12\" LP]] albums. Their fifth album, [[Dear Friends (album)|''Dear Friends'']], was a double-record compilation of what they considered the best segments from the series, released in January 1972. ''Dear Friends'' was followed with the KPFK show ''Let's Eat!'' in 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/> Both titles came from lines uttered by televangelist Pastor Rod Flash (Proctor) on his \"Hour of Reckoning\" program in ''Don't Crush That Dwarf''.\n\nIn 1970, the group had performed a live stage show, the [[Shakespeare]] parody ''The Count of Monte Cristo'', at [[Columbia University]]. In January 1972 they decided to expand this and retitle it ''Anything You Want To'' for their next album. On March 9, Columbia signed them to a second five-year contract.<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> On March 30, they ended ''Let's Eat!'' with a live broadcast titled ''Martian Space Party'', which was also recorded on 16-track tape and filmed. The Firesigns combined parts of the two shows with some new studio material to produce their sixth album ''[[Not Insane or Anything You Want To]]''.

They turned this into a [[vaudeville]]-type show which they played on tour. While promoting the show, they did a radio interview with disk jockey [[Wolfman Jack]].<ref name=\"P&B_OTR\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Ossman wrote a solo album ''[[How Time Flys]]'', based on the Mark Time astronaut character he created for a ''Dear Friends'' skit, used on ''I Think We're All Bozos'', and was cut from ''Not Insane''.<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> He co-directed the album with Columbia producer Steve Gillmor, and the other three Firesigns starred on it, along with several guest personalities including Wolfman Jack, [[Harry Shearer]] of [[The Credibility Gap]], and broadcast journalist [[Lew Irwin]]. Mark returns on New Year's Eve, 1999, from a twenty-year round trip to [[Planet X]], only to find the space program has been dismantled, and no one cares about him except for an eccentric [[impresario]] (Bergman) who kidnaps him for his video recordings of encounters with alien life.\n\nAustin wrote the solo album ''[[Roller Maidens From Outer Space]]'', based on a [[hardboiled detective]] in the same vein as his [[Nick Danger]] character introduced on the B side of ''How Can You Be In Two Places...''. ''Roller Maidens'', released in March 1974 on Columbia's [[Epic Records|Epic label]], also featured all four Firesigns, and included actors [[Richard Paul (actor)|Richard Paul]] and [[Michael C. Gwynne]]. The album satirizes [[television show|series television]], [[televangelist]]s, the [[1973 oil crisis]], and the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]].\n\n===Comedy style===\nThe Firesigns made use of [[inside joke|inside humor]]. They peppered ''Waiting for the Electrician'' and ''How Can You Be in Two Places At Once'' with Beatles references not found on the band's [[top 40]] material:<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Firesign characters would quote lyrics from songs such as \"[[The Word (song)|The Word]]\" and \"[[I'm So Tired]]\". The name of Danger's criminal nemesis Rocky Rococo was a parody of the Beatles' \"[[Rocky Raccoon]]\", and Danger's girlfriend has multiple names but \"everyone knew her as Nancy\" just like Rocky Raccoon's girlfriend.\n\nLater the Firesigns would create their own inside jokes by referring to their own previously released material. A famous example is when a confused caller tries to order a pizza from Nick Danger; the other side of this phone conversation is portrayed in ''Dwarf'' as George Tirebiter is the frustrated, hungry caller trying to get food delivered from \"Nick's\".\n\n\"He's no fun, he fell right over\" became a famous [[catchphrase]] delivered by Austin in ''How Can You Be In Two Places at Once''. This was repeated in ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' and ''How Time Flys''.\n\n===Reunion===\nThe group reunited in late August 1973 to produce the [[Sherlock Holmes]] parody ''[[The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra]]'',<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> based on one of the plays from their 1967 Magic Mushroom broadcasts, ''By the Light of the Silvery''. This was released on vinyl in January 1974. The Firesigns sold this script to science fiction writer [[Harlan Ellison]] for Book Three of Ellison's [[anthology]] ''[[The Last Dangerous Visions]]'', which Ellison never completed.\n\nIn October 1974, the Firesigns released their seventh album ''[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]'', which satirized the developing [[New Age]] movement. Ossman said this record \"grew out of our basic interest in those [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] things ... from [[Carlos Castaneda|Castaneda]] to the [[hollow Earth]] theory to [[Uri Geller|the guy who bends spoons]]. Originally, when we started writing it, it was going to be a much more complicated and 'cinematic' record; we were trying to write a radio movie.\" The Firesigns produced a film made by [[Allen Daviau]] (who later filmed ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'') using the album as the soundtrack.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> The film was shown in a live appearance at [[Stanford University]] and released on [[VHS]] video tape in 1993.\n\nIn 1975, they released the [[black comedy]] album ''[[In the Next World, You're on Your Own]]'', written by Austin and Ossman. The story centers on an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[police corruption|dirty cop]] (Proctor), whose son (Bergman) is a by-the-book cop, whose daughter (Proctor) is a porn actress, and whose wife (Ossman) lives in a [[soap opera]]. In a parody of [[Marlon Brando]]'s [[45th Academy Awards|1973 Academy Awards protest]], the brother and sister stage a [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack on an [[Academy Awards|Oscar awards]] ceremony. This album, like ''Not Insane'', also sold poorly, and Columbia declined to offer them a third contract in 1976.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> This time, the Firesigns didn't protest. Bergman said, \"The group had really split apart; we had just burned out. I mean it was five years non-stop work. We would stop one album and start writing the next. Frankly, we didn't have five more albums in us at that point.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n===Second split===\nAs Austin looked back from September 1993 on this period, he wrote that he saw Proctor and Bergman wanting to take the Firesign Theatre in a different direction than he did, moving away from intensely written albums released one per year, to more live performances with lighter material.<ref name=\"FightingClowns_linerNotes\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=Fighting Clowns |title-link= |year=1993 |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=fc-ln |access-date=February 1, 2018 |first=Phil |last=Austin |author-link=Phil Austin |type=liner notes |publisher= |id= |location= |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226220607/http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=fc-ln |archivedate=December 26, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Proctor and Bergman turned their attention in 1975 to producing a live show recorded on the Columbia album ''[[What This Country Needs (Proctor and Bergman album)|What This Country Needs]]'', based in part on material from ''TV or Not TV'' and named for a song added to the show.\n\nThe Firesign Theatre closed out their Columbia Records contract with a greatest-hits compilation ''[[Forward Into the Past]]'' in 1976.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Meanwhile, Austin and Ossman toured the west coast, billing themselves as \"Dr. Firesign's Theatre of Mystery\".<ref name=\"FightingClowns_linerNotes\"/> They produced a live stage show ''Radio Laffs of 1940'', which included a second episode of the private eye character [[Nick Danger]], \"School For Actors\"; and a soap opera \"Over the Edge\".

A Firesign Chat]]'' based largely on unreleased ''Dear Friends'' and ''Let's Eat'' radio material. Proctor and Bergman appeared as regulars on a 1977 summer replacement TV series hosted by the [[Starland Vocal Band]]. Proctor and Bergman gave up their road performances after witnessing the September 4, 1977 [[Golden Dragon Massacre]], and in 1978 released another studio album ''[[Give Us a Break (Proctor and Bergman album)|Give Us a Break]]'', which lampooned radio and television. The Starland Vocal Band also performed short comic [[bumper music|radio breaks]] on this album.<ref name=\"P&B_OTR\"/>\n\n[[Norman Lear]] and [[Bud Yorkin]]'s [[Tandem Productions]] bought the rights to Nick Danger for a TV series to star [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]]; and in 1978, [[New Line Cinema]] began negotiations to make a movie starring [[Chevy Chase]].

When the syndication went unsold, Austin approached [[Rhino Records]] and secured a deal to release the five episodes in 1979 on a 12-minute [[extended play]] (EP) record.<ref name=\"BoxOfDanger\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Proctor and Bergman produced a film, ''[[J-Men Forever]]'', using clips from old [[Republic Pictures]] [[movie serial]]s with [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] dialogue, combined with new footage of them as FBI agents tracking down a villain known as \"the Lightning Bug\" voiced by disk jockey [[M. G. Kelly]]. This became popular on the 1980s late-night TV series ''[[Night Flight (TV series)|Night Flight]]''.\n\nAustin called Bergman in late 1979 to make peace and reunite the Firesigns. This resulted in a series of shows performed at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy Theatre]] in Los Angeles: \"The Owl and the Octopus Show\"; \"The Joey Demographico Show\"; \"Nick Danger: Men in Hats\"; and \"Welcome to Billville\". These included songs with music written by Austin, and were recorded; the live recordings were used to produce their last album of the decade, the 1980 ''[[Fighting Clowns]]''. They also produced a show, \"Presidents in Hell\" ([[FDR]], [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], and [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]), which was not recorded.<ref name=\"FightingClowns_linerNotes\"/>\n\n==Reagan Era==\n{{Quote frame|...there was something about the Eighties \u2013 the anti-surrealist<br /> politics of the Eighties \u2013 that was wrong for the Firesign Theatre. |author=David Ossman<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> |align=right}}\nThe popularity of the group cooled off after 1980 as the social and political climate of the United States changed with the [[Reagan Era|election of President Ronald Reagan]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> In 1982, they produced the album ''[[Lawyer's Hospital]]'' from a collection of live appearances, [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) performances, and the Jack Poet Volkswagen commercials from ''Radio Free Oz''. They also expanded their 1972 Shakespeare parody into a road show, ''Shakespeare's Lost Comedie'' and released it on a 1982 vinyl LP, which required editing down; it would be re-released uncut on CD in 2001 and retitled ''[[Anythynge You Want To]]''.\n\nOssman left the group in early 1982 to take a producer's job for NPR in Washington DC.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/><ref name=\"BoxOfDanger\"/> The remaining three Firesigns produced a new album in 1984, ''[[The Three Faces of Al]]'', with the further adventures of Nick Danger.

He studied economics at Yale (class of 1961), and was managing editor of the university's comedy magazine. In his second graduate year he became a fellow in playwriting. As a member of the [[Yale Dramatic Association]], he co-wrote two musical comedies with [[Austin Pendleton]]. Later, he considered attending medical school, and helped produce a machine for viewing angio cardiograms and measuring blockage of the arteries of the heart.<ref name=\"Firesignmedia_Bergman\"/> He had a deep voice, and frequently took African American roles in Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works.\n\n[[File:Philip Proctor 05.jpg|thumb|upright=0.35]]\n[[Philip Proctor]] (born under the fire sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] in Goshen, Indiana<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> on July 28, 1940) was a boy soprano in a children's choir, and studied acting at Yale.

He became a professional actor, with a role on the soap opera ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', before contacting Bergman and joining him on ''Radio Free Oz'' in 1966. Proctor's adult tenor voice enables him to do a convincing female voice without using [[falsetto]]; therefore he usually did most of the female roles in the Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works, though the other three Firesigns occasionally did female voices. He also has done celebrity voice impersonations on Firesign material, including [[W.C. Fields]] (''Waiting For the Electrician'' and ''How Can You Be In Two Places...''), [[Robert F.

But in 1985, by which time the chain had grown to 62 restaurants and the Firesigns had passed their \"golden age\", they sent the owners a letter claiming ownership of the name. The pizza chain's lawyers found a similar case where an Austin, Texas pizzeria named Conan's ran afoul of the copyright owners, producers of the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. Since the creator of the [[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|''Conan the Barbarian'' comic]] had similarly endorsed the restaurant by drawing Conan on its walls, the suit lost in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], so the Firesigns settled out of court.<ref name=\"IB_news\"/>\n\n===Mark Time awards===\nOssman and his second wife Judith Walcutt formed Otherworld Media Productions in 1985 to produce [[audio theatre]].

They continued appearing on ''Radio Free Oz'', which later moved to [[KRLA 1110]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and then [[KMET (FM)|KMET FM]], through February 1969. They produced fifteen [[album|record album]]s and a [[single (music)|45 rpm single]] under contract to\n[[Columbia Records]] from 1967 through 1976,<ref>This total includes one release on Columbia's subsidiary label, [[Epic Records]].</ref> and had three nationally syndicated radio programs: ''The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour'' [sic] in 1970 on [[KPPC-FM]]; and ''[[Dear Friends (radio program)|Dear Friends]]'' (1970\u20131971) and ''Let's Eat!'' (1971\u20131972) on KPFK. They also appeared in front of live audiences, and continued to write, perform, and record on other labels, occasionally taking sabbaticals during which they wrote or performed solo or in smaller groups.\n\nThe Firesign Theatre was the brainchild of [[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]], and all of its material was conceived, written, and performed by its members Bergman, [[Philip Proctor]], [[Phil Austin]], and [[David Ossman]]. The group's name stems from [[astrology]], because all four were born under the three \"[[Astrology and the classical elements|fire signs]]\": [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] (Austin), [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] (Proctor), and [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] (Bergman and Ossman). Their popularity peaked in the early 1970s, and ebbed in the [[Reagan Era]]. They experienced a revival and second wave of popularity in the 1990s and continued to write, record and perform until Bergman's death in 2012.\n\nIn 1997, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' ranked the Firesign Theatre among the \"Thirty Greatest Comedy Acts of All Time\". Their 1970 album ''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]'' was nominated in 1971 for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] by the [[World Science Fiction Society]], and their next album ''[[I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus]]'' received the same nomination in 1972. Later, they received nominations for the [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album]] for three of their albums: ''[[The Three Faces of Al]]'' (1984), ''[[Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death]]'' (1998), and ''[[Bride of Firesign]]'' (2001). In 2005, the US [[Library of Congress]] added ''Don't Crush That Dwarf'' to the [[National Recording Registry]] and called the group \"[[the Beatles]] of comedy.\"\n\n==Before ''Firesign''==\n[[Peter Bergman (comedian)|Peter Bergman]] and [[Philip Proctor]] met while attending [[Yale University]] in the late 1950s, where Proctor studied acting, and Bergman edited the Yale comedy magazine. Bergman studied playwriting and collaborated as lyricist with [[Austin Pendleton]] in 1958 on two [[Yale Dramatic Association|Yale Dramat]] musicals in which Proctor starred: ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'', and ''[[Edwin Booth|Booth]] Is Back In Town''.<ref name=\"Firesignmedia_Bergman\">{{cite web|title=Who Am Us, Anyway?

According to Austin, the show \"featured everybody who was anybody in the artistic world who passed through LA.\" Guests included the band [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Andy Warhol]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> In November, Proctor was in Los Angeles looking for acting work and watching the [[Sunset Strip curfew riots]]. When he discovered he was sitting on a newspaper photo of Bergman, he called his college buddy, who recruited him as the fourth man for his comedy group.\n\nBergman originally named the group the \"Oz Firesign Theatre\" because all four were born under the three [[astrological sign|astrological fire sign]]s (Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius), and debuted them on his November 17, 1966 show. He had to drop \"Oz\" from the name after legal threats from [[Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]], who owned movie rights to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and [[Return to Oz|other associated works]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n==''Radio Free Oz''==\nThe Firesigns initially chose an [[improvisational theatre|improvisational]] style, and carried it to a level which revolutionized [[radio comedy]]. According to Proctor:<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n{{Quote|We each independently created our own material and characters and brought them together, not knowing what the others were going to pull. And it was all based on put-ons; that is, we were assuming characters that were assumed to be real by the listeners.

Bergman countered with a proposal for a Firesign Theatre album, and this led to a five-year<ref>According to Ossman's ''Martian Space Party Diary'', Columbia signed the Firesigns to a second five-year contract on March 9, 1972.</ref> recording contract with the label.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Usher also used the Firesigns' audio collages on songs by [[The Byrds]] (\"Draft Morning\") and [[Sagittarius (band)|Sagittarius]] (the [[Single (music)|45 RPM]] version of \"Hotel Indiscreet\") in 1967 and 1968.\n\nThe album was given the [[non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]] title ''[[Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him]]'', from Bergman's undeveloped 1965 idea for a comic film. The Firesigns changed their improvisational style, producing tightly scripted and memorized material. According to Bergman: \"There was no leader. Everything was communally written, and if one person didn't agree about something, no matter how strongly the other three felt about it, it didn't go in.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> The Firesigns always billed themselves alphabetically on their album jackets and other printed materials. \nThe resulting synergy created the feeling of a fifth Firesign; according to Austin: \"It's like, suddenly there is this fifth guy that actually does the writing. We all vaguely sort of know him, and a lot of the time take credit for him.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> This resulted in the group inventing the name \"4 or 5 Krazy Guys Publishing\" to copyright their work.<ref name=\"Bozos_liner_notes\">{{Cite AV media notes |title=I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus |title-link= |year=1971 |url=http://www.firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=bozos-ln |access-date=April 4, 2019 |type=liner notes |publisher= |id= |location= |ref=harv |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401143251/http://firesigntheatre.com/media/media.php?item=bozos-ln |archivedate=April 1, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Their contract with Columbia, in exchange for a low royalty rate, gave them unlimited studio time, allowing them to perfect their writing and recording.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n''Electrician'' revolutionized the concept of the [[comedy album]]: it consists of four radio plays. Side one is a trilogy of pieces: starting with \"Temporarily Humboldt County\", a satire of the Europeans' displacement of the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]; followed by \"W. C. Fields Forever\", a satire of the 1960s [[hippie]] culture; leading into \"Trente-Huit Cunegonde (Returned for Regrooving)\", a projected future in which the roles of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|hippie counterculture]] and [[the Establishment]] culture are reversed. Side two, the title track, is a [[stream-of-consciousness]] play about an American tourist to an [[Eastern Bloc]] country (Proctor), who ends up in prison and is rescued by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. It was recorded in [[CBS]]'s Los Angeles radio studio from which ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' and others had been broadcast; the original [[RCA]] microphones and [[sound effects]] devices were used. It was released in January 1968, selling a modest 12,000 copies in its first year.\n\nThe Firesigns continued to work on the radio and began performing in [[folk club]]s such as the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]].<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> ''Radio Free Oz'' moved again to [[KMET (FM)|KMET FM]] until February 1969. ''The Firesign Theatre Radio Hour Hour''{{sic|nolink=y}} aired for two hours on Sunday nights on [[KPPC-FM]] in 1970.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/> They would concentrate their writing on the folk club material, and produce improvisational skit material for the ''Radio Hour'' and its successors.\n\nThe Firesigns almost lost their recording contract after their first album. According to Bergman: \"Columbia was going to kick us off the label, so we scripted the next record and the old guard at Columbia took a look at the script and said 'This isn't funny\u2014this is dirty!' And to our rescue came [[James William Guercio]] [producer of [[the Buckinghams]]]\nand [[John Hammond (producer)|John Hammond]].\" Austin says, \"With Hammond backing us up, CBS came around.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> They went on to produce three more Columbia studio albums from 1969 to 1971. Each grew technically more sophisticated, taking advantage of [[multitrack recording|up to 16 tape tracks]] and [[Dolby noise reduction]] by 1970.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\n''[[How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All]]'', released in 1969, consists of a stream-of-consciousness play on side one about a man named Babe (Bergman) who buys a car and goes on a road trip that turns into a parody of [[Norman Corwin]]'s 1941 patriotic radio pageant ''[[We Hold These Truths]]''.<ref>[http://www.doctechnical.com/fst/notes/hcyb-cd.htm CD Liner Notes by David Ossman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026043336/http://www.doctechnical.com/fst/notes/hcyb-cd.htm |date=2006-10-26 }}</ref> Side two, ''The Further Adventures of [[Nick Danger]]'', is a parody of 1940s radio, about a [[hard-boiled detective]] (Austin) who became possibly the Firesigns' most famous character.\n\n''[[Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers]]'' (1970) is a single play centered around an actor named George Tirebiter (Ossman), who gradually ages into an old man while watching his old movies on television: a [[the Aldrich Family|Henry Aldrich]] parody ''High School Madness'' (in which he is named Porgie Tirebiter), and the [[Korean War]] film ''Parallel Hell''. ''Dwarf'' marked a high point in the Firesign's use of [[blue comedy]]: Porgie has explicit sex with the [[Negro]] housemaid as creaking bedsprings are heard. This album was nominated for a [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]] in 1971 by the [[World Science Fiction Society]],<ref name=\"Hugo71\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1971-hugo-awards/ |title=1971 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2010-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164616/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1971-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''Dwarf'' brought a level of success to the Firesigns that started to spoil them. Bergman said, \"We toured after ''Dwarf'' and we began to realize the extent we were influencing people. We realized that FM radio was playing our albums whole, and that people were memorizing them.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Austin said of this period, \"At that point we began not to get along with each other that well, and the being taken so seriously \u2014- ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' did a long article on us, and we were being compared to [[James Joyce]] \u2014- there was a prideful attitude that took over. But we weren't making money; we might as well have been teaching school somewhere and worrying about making tenure for all the money we were making. So in some sense we didn't really understand what we were doing, which is why we were never able to make a second ''Dwarf'', which to me is a real disappointment.\"<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/>\n\nTheir fourth album, ''[[I Think We're All Bozos On This Bus]]'' (1971), also a single play, centers on a young, [[PDP-10|early-technology computer]] [[security hacker|hacker]] (Proctor) and an older \"bozo\" with a large nose that honks like a clown's (Austin), who attend a [[Walt Disney World|Disneyesque]] Future Fair. The blue comedy was dialed back from explicit to suggestive, as a scientist invents a machine that mimics sexual intercourse. This album also received a Hugo nomination in 1972.<ref name=\"Hugo72\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1972-hugo-awards/ |title=1972 Hugo Awards |publisher=World Science Fiction Society |accessdate=2010-04-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507164619/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1972-hugo-awards/ |archivedate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, from September 9, 1970 to February 17, 1971, they were performing a one-hour weekly live series on KPFK, ''[[Dear Friends (radio program)|Dear Friends]]''. These programs were recorded and then edited into slightly shorter shows and syndicated to radio stations across the country on [[12\" LP]] albums. Their fifth album, [[Dear Friends (album)|''Dear Friends'']], was a double-record compilation of what they considered the best segments from the series, released in January 1972. ''Dear Friends'' was followed with the KPFK show ''Let's Eat!'' in 1971 and 1972.<ref name=\"20th_anniversary\"/> Both titles came from lines uttered by televangelist Pastor Rod Flash (Proctor) on his \"Hour of Reckoning\" program in ''Don't Crush That Dwarf''.\n\nIn 1970, the group had performed a live stage show, the [[Shakespeare]] parody ''The Count of Monte Cristo'', at [[Columbia University]]. In January 1972 they decided to expand this and retitle it ''Anything You Want To'' for their next album. On March 9, Columbia signed them to a second five-year contract.<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> On March 30, they ended ''Let's Eat!'' with a live broadcast titled ''Martian Space Party'', which was also recorded on 16-track tape and filmed. The Firesigns combined parts of the two shows with some new studio material to produce their sixth album ''[[Not Insane or Anything You Want To]]''.

They turned this into a [[vaudeville]]-type show which they played on tour. While promoting the show, they did a radio interview with disk jockey [[Wolfman Jack]].<ref name=\"P&B_OTR\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, Ossman wrote a solo album ''[[How Time Flys]]'', based on the Mark Time astronaut character he created for a ''Dear Friends'' skit, used on ''I Think We're All Bozos'', and was cut from ''Not Insane''.<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> He co-directed the album with Columbia producer Steve Gillmor, and the other three Firesigns starred on it, along with several guest personalities including Wolfman Jack, [[Harry Shearer]] of [[The Credibility Gap]], and broadcast journalist [[Lew Irwin]]. Mark returns on New Year's Eve, 1999, from a twenty-year round trip to [[Planet X]], only to find the space program has been dismantled, and no one cares about him except for an eccentric [[impresario]] (Bergman) who kidnaps him for his video recordings of encounters with alien life.\n\nAustin wrote the solo album ''[[Roller Maidens From Outer Space]]'', based on a [[hardboiled detective]] in the same vein as his [[Nick Danger]] character introduced on the B side of ''How Can You Be In Two Places...''. ''Roller Maidens'', released in March 1974 on Columbia's [[Epic Records|Epic label]], also featured all four Firesigns, and included actors [[Richard Paul (actor)|Richard Paul]] and [[Michael C. Gwynne]]. The album satirizes [[television show|series television]], [[televangelist]]s, the [[1973 oil crisis]], and the [[Presidency of Richard Nixon]].\n\n===Comedy style===\nThe Firesigns made use of [[inside joke|inside humor]]. They peppered ''Waiting for the Electrician'' and ''How Can You Be in Two Places At Once'' with Beatles references not found on the band's [[top 40]] material:<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> Firesign characters would quote lyrics from songs such as \"[[The Word (song)|The Word]]\" and \"[[I'm So Tired]]\". The name of Danger's criminal nemesis Rocky Rococo was a parody of the Beatles' \"[[Rocky Raccoon]]\", and Danger's girlfriend has multiple names but \"everyone knew her as Nancy\" just like Rocky Raccoon's girlfriend.\n\nLater the Firesigns would create their own inside jokes by referring to their own previously released material. A famous example is when a confused caller tries to order a pizza from Nick Danger; the other side of this phone conversation is portrayed in ''Dwarf'' as George Tirebiter is the frustrated, hungry caller trying to get food delivered from \"Nick's\".\n\n\"He's no fun, he fell right over\" became a famous [[catchphrase]] delivered by Austin in ''How Can You Be In Two Places at Once''. This was repeated in ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' and ''How Time Flys''.\n\n===Reunion===\nThe group reunited in late August 1973 to produce the [[Sherlock Holmes]] parody ''[[The Tale of the Giant Rat of Sumatra]]'',<ref name=\"MSPdiary\"/> based on one of the plays from their 1967 Magic Mushroom broadcasts, ''By the Light of the Silvery''. This was released on vinyl in January 1974. The Firesigns sold this script to science fiction writer [[Harlan Ellison]] for Book Three of Ellison's [[anthology]] ''[[The Last Dangerous Visions]]'', which Ellison never completed.\n\nIn October 1974, the Firesigns released their seventh album ''[[Everything You Know Is Wrong]]'', which satirized the developing [[New Age]] movement. Ossman said this record \"grew out of our basic interest in those [[parapsychology|parapsychological]] things ... from [[Carlos Castaneda|Castaneda]] to the [[hollow Earth]] theory to [[Uri Geller|the guy who bends spoons]]. Originally, when we started writing it, it was going to be a much more complicated and 'cinematic' record; we were trying to write a radio movie.\" The Firesigns produced a film made by [[Allen Daviau]] (who later filmed ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'') using the album as the soundtrack.<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> The film was shown in a live appearance at [[Stanford University]] and released on [[VHS]] video tape in 1993.\n\nIn 1975, they released the [[black comedy]] album ''[[In the Next World, You're on Your Own]]'', written by Austin and Ossman. The story centers on an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] [[police corruption|dirty cop]] (Proctor), whose son (Bergman) is a by-the-book cop, whose daughter (Proctor) is a porn actress, and whose wife (Ossman) lives in a [[soap opera]]. In a parody of [[Marlon Brando]]'s [[45th Academy Awards|1973 Academy Awards protest]], the brother and sister stage a [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack on an [[Academy Awards|Oscar awards]] ceremony.

He studied economics at Yale (class of 1961), and was managing editor of the university's comedy magazine. In his second graduate year he became a fellow in playwriting. As a member of the [[Yale Dramatic Association]], he co-wrote two musical comedies with [[Austin Pendleton]]. Later, he considered attending medical school, and helped produce a machine for viewing angio cardiograms and measuring blockage of the arteries of the heart.<ref name=\"Firesignmedia_Bergman\"/> He had a deep voice, and frequently took African American roles in Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works.\n\n[[File:Philip Proctor 05.jpg|thumb|upright=0.35]]\n[[Philip Proctor]] (born under the fire sign [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] in Goshen, Indiana<ref name=\"Stereo_review\"/> on July 28, 1940) was a boy soprano in a children's choir, and studied acting at Yale. There, he met his future partner Bergman in the Yale Dramatic Association, where he starred in the two musical comedies written by Bergman and Pendleton. He became a professional actor, with a role on the soap opera ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', before contacting Bergman and joining him on ''Radio Free Oz'' in 1966. Proctor's adult tenor voice enables him to do a convincing female voice without using [[falsetto]]; therefore he usually did most of the female roles in the Firesign Theatre and Proctor and Bergman works, though the other three Firesigns occasionally did female voices. He also has done celebrity voice impersonations on Firesign material, including [[W.C. Fields]] (''Waiting For the Electrician'' and ''How Can You Be In Two Places...''), [[Robert F.

He also could do an old-man voice as Doc Technical in the ''Dear Friends'' radio \"Mark Time\" episode, and applied his impersonation of [[Richard Nixon]] as presidents in several Firesign and solo works (''Bozos'', ''How Time Flys'', ''Roller Maidens'', and ''Everything You Know Is Wrong'').

But in 1985, by which time the chain had grown to 62 restaurants and the Firesigns had passed their \"golden age\", they sent the owners a letter claiming ownership of the name. The pizza chain's lawyers found a similar case where an Austin, Texas pizzeria named Conan's ran afoul of the copyright owners, producers of the 1982 film ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''. Since the creator of the [[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|''Conan the Barbarian'' comic]] had similarly endorsed the restaurant by drawing Conan on its walls, the suit lost in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], so the Firesigns settled out of court.<ref name=\"IB_news\"/>\n\n===Mark Time awards===\nOssman and his second wife Judith Walcutt formed Otherworld Media Productions in 1985 to produce [[audio theatre]].
