Tests performed on serum are further categorized by the reason for performing the test:  maternal serum, adult tumor marker, and pediatric tumor marker.\n\n==Serum==\nThe standard is a quantitative test, reporting a measured concentration of AFP in the sample, but there is also a less expensive qualitative test, reporting only that the concentration is normal or high.  The qualitative test is appropriate only in some circumstances.\n\nThe resulting test report should specify the assay method and equipment used, and the report of a quantitative test should also provide a reference range for the test result.  Many laboratories report reference ranges that are based on all other samples tested in that laboratory, necessarily including samples with abnormal AFP concentrations due to disease.  Superior reference ranges are produced by research on healthy subjects.\n\nAFP test results often are reported as either ng/ml or MoM ([[multiple of the median]], where the median is calculated for an appropriate reference population).\n\n===Maternal testing for fetal screening===\nAbnormally elevated AFP in the serum of a pregnant woman can have one or more of these sources:\n\n* a problem with the fetus\n* a problem with the placenta\n* a [[tumor]] or [[liver]] disease in the woman\n* a normally elevated AFP in the fetus or woman (some people naturally have very high AFP)\n\nUsual follow-up steps include (1) a prenatal [[ultrasound]] exam to look for fetal abnormalities and/or (2) measurement of AFP in amniotic fluid obtained via [[amniocentesis]].\n\n[[Maternal]] serum AFP ('''MSAFP''') varies by [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] during the course of a normal pregnancy.  MSAFP increases rapidly until about 32 weeks gestation, then decreases gradually.  After the pregnancy ends it decreases rapidly, with a [[half-life]] of about 5 days.\n\nTypically, MSAFP is measured in the beginning of the second trimester (14\u201316 weeks).  It may be measured alone or as part of a package of [[Prenatal diagnosis|routine prenatal screening]] tests, such as a [[triple test]] or [[quad test]].\n\nBecause MSAFP test results must be interpreted according to the gestational age, they often are reported in terms of [[multiple of the median]] (MoM).  Because the median is calculated from tests of other women's pregnancies at the same gestational age, in effect MoM is independent of gestational age, but depend on accurate gestational dating.  A typical normal range is 0.5 to 2.0 or 2.5 MoM.\n\n* MSAFP ''above'' normal is seen in [[multiple birth|multiple gestation]], when there is [[placental abruption]], as well as in a number of fetal abnormalities, such as [[neural tube defect]]s including [[spina bifida]] and [[anencephaly]], and [[abdominal wall defect]]s.
