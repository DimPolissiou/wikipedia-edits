{"title_page": "Insulated-gate bipolar transistor", "text_new": "[[Image:IGBT symbol.gif|right|thumb|300px|IGBT schematic symbol]]\nAn '''insulated-gate bipolar transistor''' ('''IGBT''') is a three-terminal [[power semiconductor device]] primarily used as an electronic switch which, as it was developed, came to combine high efficiency and fast switching. It consists of four alternating layers (P-N-P-N) that are controlled by a [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) [[Metal gate|gate]] structure without regenerative action. Although the structure of the IGBT is topologically the same as a [[thyristor]] with a 'MOS' gate ([[MOS-controlled thyristor|MOS gate thyristor]]), the thyristor action is completely suppressed and only the [[transistor]] action is permitted in the entire device operation range.   It is used in [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]] in high power applications: [[variable-frequency drive]]s (VFDs), [[electric car]]s, trains, variable speed refrigerators, lamp ballasts, arc-welding machines, and air-conditioners.\n\nSince it is designed to turn on and off rapidly, the IGBT can synthesize complex waveforms with [[pulse-width modulation]] and [[low-pass filter]]s, so it is also used in [[switching amplifier]]s in sound systems and industrial [[control system]]s.   In switching applications modern devices feature [[Pulse repetition frequency|pulse repetition rate]]s well into the ultrasonic range\u2014frequencies which are at least ten times the highest audio frequency handled by the device when used as an analog audio amplifier. {{As of|2010}}, the IGBT is the second most widely used power transistor, after the [[power MOSFET]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+\n!colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\"|IGBT comparison table <ref>[http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/power/insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor.html Basic Electronics Tutorials.]</ref>\n|+\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n! width=\"155\" height=\"16\" | Device characteristic\n! width=\"135\" | Power [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]]\n! width=\"135\" | [[Power MOSFET]]\n! width=\"135\" | IGBT\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Voltage rating\n | High <1kV\n | High <1kV\n | Very high >1kV\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Current rating\n | High <500A\n |High >500A\n | High >500A\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"19\" | Input drive\n | Current ratio h<sub>FE</sub> <br />20-200 \n | Voltage V<sub>GS</sub> <br />3-10 V\n | Voltage V<sub>GE</sub> <br />4-8 V\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Input impedance\n | Low\n | High\n | High\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Output impedance\n | Low\n | Medium\n | Low\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Switching speed\n | Slow (\u00b5s)\n | Fast (ns)\n | Medium\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Cost\n | Low\n | Medium\n | High\n\n|}\n\n==Device structure==\n\n[[Image:IGBT Cross Section.jpg|right|thumb|Cross-section of a typical IGBT showing internal connection of MOSFET and bipolar device]]\n\nAn IGBT cell is constructed similarly to a n-channel vertical-construction [[power MOSFET]], except the n+ drain is replaced with a p+ collector layer, thus forming a vertical PNP [[bipolar junction transistor]].\nThis additional p+ region creates a cascade connection of a PNP bipolar junction transistor with the surface n-channel [[MOSFET]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:IvsV IGBT.png|thumb|right|300px|Static characteristic of an IGBT]]\n\nThe [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) was invented by [[Mohamed M.

This invention realized complete suppression of the parasitic thyristor action, for the first time, because the maximal collector current was limited by the saturation current and never exceeded the latch-up current. After the invention of the device design concept of non-latch-up IGBTs, IGBTs evolved rapidly, and the design of non-latch-up IGBTs became a de facto standard and the patent of non-latch-up IGBTs became the basic IGBT patent of actual devices.\n\nIn the early development stage of IGBT, all the researchers tried to increase the latch-up current itself in order to suppress the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor. However, all these efforts failed because IGBT could conduct enormously large current. Successful suppression of the latch-up was made possible by limiting the maximal collector current, which IGBT could conduct, below the latch-up current by controlling/reducing the saturation current of the inherent MOSFET. This was the concept of non-latch-up IGBT. \u201cBecke\u2019s device\u201d was made possible by the non-latch-up IGBT.\n\nThe IGBT is characterized by its ability to simultaneously handle a high voltage and a large current. The product of the voltage and the current density that the IGBT can handle reached more than 5{{E|5}} W/cm<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=\"A.Nakagawa 1987\"/><ref name=\"A. Nakagawa pp. 150\u2013153\"/> which far exceeded the value, 2{{E|5}} W/cm<sup>2</sup>, of existing power devices such as bipolar transistors and power MOSFETs. This is a consequence of the large [[safe operating area]] of the IGBT. The IGBT is the most rugged and the strongest power device that ever developed, thus, providing users with easy use of the device and displaced bipolar transistors and even [[Gate turn-off thyristor|GTOs]]. \nThis excellent feature of the IGBT had suddenly emerged when the non-latch-up IGBT was established in 1984 by solving the problem of so-called \u201clatch-up,\u201d which is the main cause of device destruction or device failure. Before that, the developed devices were very weak and were easy to be destroyed because of \u201clatch-up.\u201d\n\n===Practical devices===\nPractical devices capable of operating over an extended current range were first reported by [[B.

D. Plummer in 1978 (US Patent Re.33209) is the same structure as a thyristor with a MOS gate. Plummer discovered and proposed that the device can be used as a transistor although the device operates as a thyristor in higher current density level.  J. D. Plummer reported this fact in his technical paper: \"A MOS-Controlled Triac Device\" B.W. Scharf and J.D. Plummer, 1978 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, SESSION XVI FAM 16.6.<ref>\"A MOS-Controlled Triac Device\" B.W. Scharf and J.D. Plummer, 1978 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, SESSION XVI FAM 16.6</ref>  The device proposed by J. D. Plummer is referred here as \u201cPlummer\u2019s device.\u201d On the other hand, Hans W. Becke proposed, in 1980, another device in which the thyristor action is completely eliminated under any device operating conditions although the basic device structure is the same as that proposed by J. D. Plummer. The device developed by Hans W. Becke is referred here as \u201cBecke\u2019s device\u201d and is described in US Patent 4364073. The difference between \u201cPlummer\u2019s device\u201d and \u201cBecke\u2019s device\u201d is that \u201cPlummer\u2019s device\u201d has the mode of thyristor action in its operation range and \u201cBecke\u2019s device\u201d never has the mode of thyristor action in its entire operation range. This is a critical point, because the thyristor action is the same as so-called \u201clatch-up.\u201d \u201cLatch-up\u201d is the main cause of fatal device failure. Thus, theoretically, \u201cPlummer\u2019s device\u201d never realizes a rugged or strong power device which has a large safe operating area. The large safe operating area can be achieved only after \u201clatch-up\u201d is completely suppressed and eliminated in the entire device operation range.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} However, the Becke's patent (US Patent 4364073) did not disclose any measures to realize actual devices.\n\nDespite Becke\u2019s patent describing a similar structure to Baliga's earlier IGBT device,<ref name=\"Baliga\"/> several IGBT manufacturers paid the license fee of Becke\u2019s patent.<ref name=\"U.

The IGBT accounts for 27% of the power transistor market, second only to the power MOSFET (53%), and ahead of the [[RF amplifier]] (11%) and [[bipolar junction transistor]] (9%).<ref>{{cite news |title=Power Transistor Market Will Cross $13.0 Billion in 2011 |url=http://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Power-Transistor-Market-Will-Cross-130-Billion-In-2011/ |accessdate=15 October 2019 |work=IC Insights |date=June 21, 2011}}</ref> The IGBT is widely used in [[consumer electronics]], [[industrial technology]], the [[energy sector]], [[aerospace]] electronic devices, and [[transportation]].\n\n==Advantages==\nThe IGBT combines the simple gate-drive characteristics of [[power MOSFET]]s with the high-current and low-saturation-voltage capability of [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistor]]s. The IGBT combines an isolated-gate [[field-effect transistor|FET]] for the control input and a bipolar power [[transistor]] as a switch in a single device. The IGBT is used in medium- to high-power applications like [[switched-mode power supplies]], [[traction motor]] control and [[induction heating]]. Large IGBT modules typically consist of many devices in parallel and can have very high current-handling capabilities in the order of hundreds of [[ampere]]s with blocking voltages of {{nowrap|6500 [[volts|V]]}}. These IGBTs can control loads of hundreds of [[kilowatts]].\n\n==Comparison with power MOSFETs==\nAn IGBT features a significantly lower forward voltage drop compared to a conventional MOSFET in higher blocking voltage rated devices, although MOSFETS exhibit much lower forward voltage at lower current densities due to the absence of a diode Vf in the IGBT's output BJT. As the blocking voltage rating of both MOSFET and IGBT devices increases, the depth of the n- drift region must increase and the doping must decrease, resulting in roughly square relationship decrease in forward conduction versus blocking voltage capability of the device. By injecting minority carriers (holes) from the collector p+ region into the n- drift region during forward conduction, the resistance of the n- drift region is considerably reduced. However, this resultant reduction in on-state forward voltage comes with several penalties:\n\n* The additional PN junction blocks reverse current flow. This means that unlike a MOSFET, IGBTs cannot conduct in the reverse direction. In bridge circuits, where reverse current flow is needed, an additional diode (called a [[flyback diode|freewheeling diode]]) is placed in parallel (actually [[Antiparallel (electronics)|anti-parallel]]) with the IGBT to conduct current in the opposite direction. The penalty isn't overly severe because at higher voltages, where IGBT usage dominates, discrete diodes have a significantly higher performance than the body diode of a MOSFET.\n* The reverse bias rating of the N-drift region to collector P+ diode is usually only of tens of volts, so if the circuit application applies a reverse voltage to the IGBT, an additional series diode must be used.\n* The minority carriers injected into the N-drift region take time to enter and exit or recombine at turn-on and turn-off. This results in longer switching times, and hence higher switching loss compared to a power MOSFET. \n* The on-state forward voltage drop in IGBTs behaves very differently from power MOSFETS. The MOSFET voltage drop can be modeled as a resistance, with the voltage drop proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like voltage drop (typically of the order of 2V) increasing only with the [[natural logarithm|log]] of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.\n\nIn general, high voltage, high current and low switching frequencies favor the IGBT while low voltage, medium current and high switching frequencies are the domain of the MOSFET.\n\n==IGBT models==\nCircuits with IGBTs can be developed and [[computer modeling|modeled]] with various [[electronic circuit simulation|circuit simulating]] computer programs such as [[SPICE]], [[Saber (software)|Saber]], and other programs. To simulate an IGBT circuit, the device (and other devices in the circuit) must have a model which predicts or simulates the device's response to various voltages and currents on their electrical terminals. For more precise simulations the effect of temperature on various parts of the IGBT may be included with the simulation.\nTwo common methods of modeling are available: [[semiconductor device physics|device physics]]-based model, [[equivalent circuit]]s or macromodels. [[SPICE]] simulates IGBTs using a macromodel that combines an ensemble of components like [[field-effect transistor|FET]]s and [[bipolar junction transistor|BJT]]s in a [[Darlington transistor|Darlington configuration]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} An alternative physics-based model is the Hefner model, introduced by Allen Hefner of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. Hefner's model is fairly complex that has shown very good results. Hefner's model is described in a 1988 paper and was later extended to a thermo-electrical model which include the IGBT's response to internal heating. This model has been added to a version of the [[Saber (software)|Saber]] simulation software.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Hefner Jr. |first1 = Allen R Jr |last2= Diebolt |first2= DM |title= An experimentally verified IGBT model implemented in the Saber circuit simulator |journal= IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics |volume= 9 |issue= 5 |pages= 532\u2013542 |year= 1994 |doi = 10.1109/63.321038 |bibcode = 1994ITPE....9..532H |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f4b9608b9160423b3048a804665dc19661838f05 }}</ref>\n\n==IGBT failure mechanisms==\nThe failure mechanisms of IGBTs includes overstress (O) and wearout(wo) separately.\n\nThe wearout failures mainly include bias temperature instability (BTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB), electromigration (ECM), solder fatigue, material reconstruction, corrosion.

It consists of four alternating layers (P-N-P-N) that are controlled by a [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor]] (MOS) [[Metal gate|gate]] structure without regenerative action. Although the structure of the IGBT is topologically the same as a [[thyristor]] with a 'MOS' gate ([[MOS-controlled thyristor|MOS gate thyristor]]), the thyristor action is completely suppressed and only the [[transistor]] action is permitted in the entire device operation range.   It is used in [[switching power supply|switching power supplies]] in high power applications: [[variable-frequency drive]]s (VFDs), [[electric car]]s, trains, variable speed refrigerators, lamp ballasts, and air-conditioners.\n\nSince it is designed to turn on and off rapidly, the IGBT can synthesize complex waveforms with [[pulse-width modulation]] and [[low-pass filter]]s, so it is also used in [[switching amplifier]]s in sound systems and industrial [[control system]]s.   In switching applications modern devices feature [[Pulse repetition frequency|pulse repetition rate]]s well into the ultrasonic range\u2014frequencies which are at least ten times the highest audio frequency handled by the device when used as an analog audio amplifier. {{As of|2010}}, the IGBT is the second most widely used power transistor, after the [[power MOSFET]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|+\n!colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\"|IGBT comparison table <ref>[http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/power/insulated-gate-bipolar-transistor.html Basic Electronics Tutorials.]</ref>\n|+\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n! width=\"155\" height=\"16\" | Device characteristic\n! width=\"135\" | Power [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]]\n! width=\"135\" | [[Power MOSFET]]\n! width=\"135\" | IGBT\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Voltage rating\n | High <1kV\n | High <1kV\n | Very high >1kV\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Current rating\n | High <500A\n |High >500A\n | High >500A\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"19\" | Input drive\n | Current ratio h<sub>FE</sub> <br />20-200 \n | Voltage V<sub>GS</sub> <br />3-10 V\n | Voltage V<sub>GE</sub> <br />4-8 V\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Input impedance\n | Low\n | High\n | High\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Output impedance\n | Low\n | Medium\n | Low\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Switching speed\n | Slow (\u00b5s)\n | Fast (ns)\n | Medium\n\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n| height=\"16\" | Cost\n | Low\n | Medium\n | High\n\n|}\n\n==Device structure==\n\n[[Image:IGBT Cross Section.jpg|right|thumb|Cross-section of a typical IGBT showing internal connection of MOSFET and bipolar device]]\n\nAn IGBT cell is constructed similarly to a n-channel vertical-construction [[power MOSFET]], except the n+ drain is replaced with a p+ collector layer, thus forming a vertical PNP [[bipolar junction transistor]].\nThis additional p+ region creates a cascade connection of a PNP bipolar junction transistor with the surface n-channel [[MOSFET]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:IvsV IGBT.png|thumb|right|300px|Static characteristic of an IGBT]]\n\nThe [[metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor]] (MOSFET) was invented by [[Mohamed M.

This invention realized complete suppression of the parasitic thyristor action, for the first time, because the maximal collector current was limited by the saturation current and never exceeded the latch-up current. After the invention of the device design concept of non-latch-up IGBTs, IGBTs evolved rapidly, and the design of non-latch-up IGBTs became a de facto standard and the patent of non-latch-up IGBTs became the basic IGBT patent of actual devices.\n\nIn the early development stage of IGBT, all the researchers tried to increase the latch-up current itself in order to suppress the latch-up of the parasitic thyristor. However, all these efforts failed because IGBT could conduct enormously large current. Successful suppression of the latch-up was made possible by limiting the maximal collector current, which IGBT could conduct, below the latch-up current by controlling/reducing the saturation current of the inherent MOSFET. This was the concept of non-latch-up IGBT. \u201cBecke\u2019s device\u201d was made possible by the non-latch-up IGBT.\n\nThe IGBT is characterized by its ability to simultaneously handle a high voltage and a large current. The product of the voltage and the current density that the IGBT can handle reached more than 5{{E|5}} W/cm<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=\"A.Nakagawa 1987\"/><ref name=\"A. Nakagawa pp. 150\u2013153\"/> which far exceeded the value, 2{{E|5}} W/cm<sup>2</sup>, of existing power devices such as bipolar transistors and power MOSFETs. This is a consequence of the large [[safe operating area]] of the IGBT. The IGBT is the most rugged and the strongest power device that ever developed, thus, providing users with easy use of the device and displaced bipolar transistors and even [[Gate turn-off thyristor|GTOs]]. \nThis excellent feature of the IGBT had suddenly emerged when the non-latch-up IGBT was established in 1984 by solving the problem of so-called \u201clatch-up,\u201d which is the main cause of device destruction or device failure. Before that, the developed devices were very weak and were easy to be destroyed because of \u201clatch-up.\u201d\n\n===Practical devices===\nPractical devices capable of operating over an extended current range were first reported by [[B.

D. Plummer. The device developed by Hans W. Becke is referred here as \u201cBecke\u2019s device\u201d and is described in US Patent 4364073. The difference between \u201cPlummer\u2019s device\u201d and \u201cBecke\u2019s device\u201d is that \u201cPlummer\u2019s device\u201d has the mode of thyristor action in its operation range and \u201cBecke\u2019s device\u201d never has the mode of thyristor action in its entire operation range. This is a critical point, because the thyristor action is the same as so-called \u201clatch-up.\u201d \u201cLatch-up\u201d is the main cause of fatal device failure. Thus, theoretically, \u201cPlummer\u2019s device\u201d never realizes a rugged or strong power device which has a large safe operating area. The large safe operating area can be achieved only after \u201clatch-up\u201d is completely suppressed and eliminated in the entire device operation range.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} However, the Becke's patent (US Patent 4364073) did not disclose any measures to realize actual devices.\n\nDespite Becke\u2019s patent describing a similar structure to Baliga's earlier IGBT device,<ref name=\"Baliga\"/> several IGBT manufacturers paid the license fee of Becke\u2019s patent.<ref name=\"U. S. Patent No. 4,364,073\"/> [[Toshiba]] commercialized \u201cnon-latch-up IGBT\u201d in 1985. Stanford University insisted in 1991 that Toshiba\u2019s device infringed US Patent RE33209 of \u201cPlummer\u2019s device.\u201d Toshiba answered that \u201cnon-latch-up IGBTs\u201d never latched up in the entire device operation range and thus did not infringe US Patent RE33209 of \u201cPlummer\u2019s patent.\u201d Stanford University never responded after Nov. 1992. Toshiba purchased the license of \u201cBecke\u2019s patent\u201d but never paid any license fee for \u201cPlummer\u2019s device.\u201d Other IGBT manufacturers also paid the license fee for Becke\u2019s patent.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Main|List of MOSFET applications#Insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)}}\n{{See also|LDMOS#Applications|Power MOSFET|RF CMOS#Applications}}\n\n{{As of|2010}}, the IGBT is the second most widely used [[power transistor]], after the power MOSFET. The IGBT accounts for 27% of the power transistor market, second only to the power MOSFET (53%), and ahead of the [[RF amplifier]] (11%) and [[bipolar junction transistor]] (9%).<ref>{{cite news |title=Power Transistor Market Will Cross $13.0 Billion in 2011 |url=http://www.icinsights.com/news/bulletins/Power-Transistor-Market-Will-Cross-130-Billion-In-2011/ |accessdate=15 October 2019 |work=IC Insights |date=June 21, 2011}}</ref> The IGBT is widely used in [[consumer electronics]], [[industrial technology]], the [[energy sector]], [[aerospace]] electronic devices, and [[transportation]].\n\n==Advantages==\nThe IGBT combines the simple gate-drive characteristics of [[power MOSFET]]s with the high-current and low-saturation-voltage capability of [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistor]]s. The IGBT combines an isolated-gate [[field-effect transistor|FET]] for the control input and a bipolar power [[transistor]] as a switch in a single device. The IGBT is used in medium- to high-power applications like [[switched-mode power supplies]], [[traction motor]] control and [[induction heating]]. Large IGBT modules typically consist of many devices in parallel and can have very high current-handling capabilities in the order of hundreds of [[ampere]]s with blocking voltages of {{nowrap|6500 [[volts|V]]}}. These IGBTs can control loads of hundreds of [[kilowatts]].\n\n==Comparison with power MOSFETs==\nAn IGBT features a significantly lower forward voltage drop compared to a conventional MOSFET in higher blocking voltage rated devices, although MOSFETS exhibit much lower forward voltage at lower current densities due to the absence of a diode Vf in the IGBT's output BJT. As the blocking voltage rating of both MOSFET and IGBT devices increases, the depth of the n- drift region must increase and the doping must decrease, resulting in roughly square relationship decrease in forward conduction versus blocking voltage capability of the device. By injecting minority carriers (holes) from the collector p+ region into the n- drift region during forward conduction, the resistance of the n- drift region is considerably reduced. However, this resultant reduction in on-state forward voltage comes with several penalties:\n\n* The additional PN junction blocks reverse current flow. This means that unlike a MOSFET, IGBTs cannot conduct in the reverse direction. In bridge circuits, where reverse current flow is needed, an additional diode (called a [[flyback diode|freewheeling diode]]) is placed in parallel (actually [[Antiparallel (electronics)|anti-parallel]]) with the IGBT to conduct current in the opposite direction. The penalty isn't overly severe because at higher voltages, where IGBT usage dominates, discrete diodes have a significantly higher performance than the body diode of a MOSFET.\n* The reverse bias rating of the N-drift region to collector P+ diode is usually only of tens of volts, so if the circuit application applies a reverse voltage to the IGBT, an additional series diode must be used.\n* The minority carriers injected into the N-drift region take time to enter and exit or recombine at turn-on and turn-off. This results in longer switching times, and hence higher switching loss compared to a power MOSFET. \n* The on-state forward voltage drop in IGBTs behaves very differently from power MOSFETS. The MOSFET voltage drop can be modeled as a resistance, with the voltage drop proportional to current. By contrast, the IGBT has a diode-like voltage drop (typically of the order of 2V) increasing only with the [[natural logarithm|log]] of the current. Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller blocking voltages, so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the blocking voltage and current involved in a particular application.\n\nIn general, high voltage, high current and low switching frequencies favor the IGBT while low voltage, medium current and high switching frequencies are the domain of the MOSFET.\n\n==IGBT models==\nCircuits with IGBTs can be developed and [[computer modeling|modeled]] with various [[electronic circuit simulation|circuit simulating]] computer programs such as [[SPICE]], [[Saber (software)|Saber]], and other programs. To simulate an IGBT circuit, the device (and other devices in the circuit) must have a model which predicts or simulates the device's response to various voltages and currents on their electrical terminals. For more precise simulations the effect of temperature on various parts of the IGBT may be included with the simulation.\nTwo common methods of modeling are available: [[semiconductor device physics|device physics]]-based model, [[equivalent circuit]]s or macromodels. [[SPICE]] simulates IGBTs using a macromodel that combines an ensemble of components like [[field-effect transistor|FET]]s and [[bipolar junction transistor|BJT]]s in a [[Darlington transistor|Darlington configuration]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} An alternative physics-based model is the Hefner model, introduced by Allen Hefner of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. Hefner's model is fairly complex that has shown very good results. Hefner's model is described in a 1988 paper and was later extended to a thermo-electrical model which include the IGBT's response to internal heating. This model has been added to a version of the [[Saber (software)|Saber]] simulation software.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Hefner Jr. |first1 = Allen R Jr |last2= Diebolt |first2= DM |title= An experimentally verified IGBT model implemented in the Saber circuit simulator |journal= IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics |volume= 9 |issue= 5 |pages= 532\u2013542 |year= 1994 |doi = 10.1109/63.321038 |bibcode = 1994ITPE....9..532H |url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f4b9608b9160423b3048a804665dc19661838f05 }}</ref>\n\n==IGBT failure mechanisms==\nThe failure mechanisms of IGBTs includes overstress (O) and wearout(wo) separately.\n\nThe wearout failures mainly include bias temperature instability (BTI), hot carrier injection (HCI), time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB), electromigration (ECM), solder fatigue, material reconstruction, corrosion.

In the 1990s the stadium was redesigned to meet the UEFA requirements therefore its capacity was reduced to 18,100. When Ferencv\u00e1ros qualified for the [[1995\u201396 UEFA Champions League group stage]], a new journalist stand was built over the main stand.\n\nOn 21 December 2007, the stadium's name was changed from \u00dcll\u0151i \u00fati Stadion to Stadion Albert Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n. [[Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n Albert]], the former Ferencv\u00e1ros icon, was present at the inauguration ceremony.\nThere were many plans on how to increase the capacity of the stadium in case the [[Hungarian Football Federation]] won the bid for the [[UEFA Euro 2008]] or the [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. However, the Federation did not win any bids therefore the reconstruction of the stadium was delayed.\n\nWhen Kevin McCabe became the owner of the club the reconstruction was on schedule again. Later, McCabe sold his team to the Hungarian state and the reconstruction did not take place.\n\n[[File:Stade Budapest 08667.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Groupama Ar\u00e9na]] (2014\u2013present)]]\n{{Main article|Groupama Ar\u00e9na}}\n[[Groupama Ar\u00e9na]], [[multi-purpose stadium]], is the third home of the club.

The new stadium was rotated by 90 degrees in order to meet UEFA requirements. Therefore, the main stand which was parallel to the [[\u00dcll\u0151i \u00fat]] became parallel to the [[Hung\u00e1ria k\u00f6r\u00fat]]. As part of the national stadium reconstruction programme the new stadium was built between 2013 and 2014.\n\nThe stadium was designed by \u00c1gnes Streit and Szabolcs Kormos and was built by Market \u00c9p\u00edt\u0151 Zrt from 2013 to 2014.

India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at [[Lord's]], becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen [[Sunil Gavaskar|Gavaskar]], [[Gundappa Viswanath|Viswanath]], [[Kapil Dev]], and the [[Indian spin quartet]].\n\nTraditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has improved its overseas form, especially in limited-overs cricket, since the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. It has won the [[India at the Cricket World Cup|Cricket World Cup]] twice \u2013 in [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] under the captaincy of [[Kapil Dev]] and in [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]] under the captaincy of [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]]. After winning the 2011 World Cup, India became only the third team after [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]] and Australia to have won the [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] more than once,<ref name=\"BBC-Power\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444277.stm|title=India power past Sri Lanka to Cricket World Cup triumph|work=BBC Sport|date=2 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2011|first=Sam|last=Sheringham|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403035451/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444277.stm|archive-date=3 April 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> and the first cricket team to win the World Cup at home. It also won the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]], under the captaincy of [[MS Dhoni]]. It was also the joint champions of [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]], along with [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]].\n\nThe Indian cricket team has rivalries with other Test-playing nations, most notably [[India\u2013Pakistan cricket rivalry|with Pakistan]], the political arch-rival of India. However, in recent times, rivalries with nations like Australia, South Africa and England have also gained prominence.\n\n{{as of|2020|February|10|df=}}, India is ranked first in Tests, second in ODIs and fourth in T20Is by the ICC.<ref name=\"ICC rankings - ICC Test, ODI and Twenty20 rankings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/page/211271.html|title=ICC rankings \u2013 ICC Test, ODI and Twenty20 rankings \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|access-date=2 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303202904/http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/page/211271.html|archive-date=3 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Virat Kohli]] is the current captain of the team across all formats, while the head coach is [[Ravi Shastri]].<ref name=\"Shastri In\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/1110473.html|title=Shastri, Zaheer, Dravid in India's new coaching team|date=11 July 2017|accessdate=11 July 2017|work=ESPN cricinfo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711191312/http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/1110473.html|archive-date=11 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|History of the Indian cricket team}}\n[[File:Probir Sen with Queen Elizabeth II.png|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] with members of the Indian team during the [[Indian cricket team in England in 1952|Indian tour of England in 1952]].]]\n===Early history (1700s - 1918)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India to 1918}}\nThe British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Downing|first= Clement|title= A History of the Indian Wars|year= 1737|editor= William Foster|location= London}}</ref> In 1848, the [[Parsi]] community in [[Bombay]] formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians.

However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides. On 24 August 1959, India lost by an innings in the Test to complete the only 5\u20130 whitewash ever inflicted by England. The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961\u201362 and also won a home series against New Zealand. They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967\u201368.\n\nThe key to India's [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] in the 1970s were the [[Indian spin quartet]] \u2013 [[Bishen Bedi]], [[E.A.S. Prasanna]], [[BS Chandrasekhar]] and [[Srinivas Venkataraghavan]]. This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and [[Gundappa Viswanath]]. Indian [[cricket pitch|pitches]] have had the tendency to support [[spin bowling|spin]] and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of [[Ajit Wadekar]]. Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while [[Dilip Sardesai]]'s 112 played a big part in their one Test win.\n\n===One-day cricket and ICC Cricket World Cup success (1970-1985)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 1970\u201371 to 1985}}\n[[File:Indian Cricket Team Test Results.svg|thumb|A graph showing India's Test match results against all Test match teams from 1932 to September 2006.]]\nThe advent of [[One Day International]] (ODI) cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considered strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defensive approach to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/team-india-on-the-brink-of-odi-record-at-vizag-remain-torchbearers-of-50-over-format/story-B1DIaBOhWX4DP2chPHzk6M.html|title=Team India on the brink of ODI record at Vizag, remain torchbearers of 50-over format|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024113206/https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/team-india-on-the-brink-of-odi-record-at-vizag-remain-torchbearers-of-50-over-format/story-B1DIaBOhWX4DP2chPHzk6M.html|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live|date=23 October 2018}}</ref> Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.\n\nIn contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and was particularly strong at home, where their combination of stylish batsmen and beguiling spinners were at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976, when they chased 403 to win, thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain [[Clive Lloyd]] dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack instead. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without any individual batsman scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by [[Mohinder Amarnath]]. This innings was only the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.\n\nDuring the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy [[Mohammed Azharuddin]], [[Dilip Vengsarkar]] and all-rounders [[Kapil Dev]] and [[Ravi Shastri]]. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and the two-time defending champions West Indies in the final at Lords, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the [[Asia Cup]] and in 1985, won the [[World Championship of Cricket]] in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the [[Indian subcontinent]]. India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.\n\n===Late 20th century (1985-2000)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 1985\u201386 to 2000}}\n[[File:Kumble edited.jpg|thumb|With 619 wickets, [[Anil Kumble]] is the world's third highest wicket-taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket-taker.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30176.html |title=Cricinfo- Anil Kumble |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=20 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211161513/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30176.html |archive-date=11 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\nThe addition of [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, [[Javagal Srinath]], India's fastest bowler since [[Amar Singh (cricketer)|Amar Singh]] made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the [[South Asia|subcontinent]] while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as [[Sourav Ganguly]] and [[Rahul Dravid]], later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's. Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best-ranked team in the world.\n\nAfter failing to reach the semifinals at the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3\u20130 on a tour of Australia and then 2\u20130 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman [[Ajay Jadeja]] were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as \"the Indian cricket's worst hour\". However, the new core \u2013 Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly \u2013 swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19352766 | work=BBC News | title=India cricket: Middle-order retirements are end of era | date=23 August 2012 | access-date=22 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018224629/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19352766 | archive-date=18 October 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Turn of the millennium (2000-present)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 2000\u201301}}\nSince 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly and guidance of [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]], India's first ever foreign [[List of India national cricket coaches|coach]]. India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. [[Australian national cricket captains|Australian captain]] [[Steve Waugh]] labelled India as the \"Final Frontier\" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|title = Steve Waugh Column|work = Steve Waugh|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017222838/http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|archive-date = 17 October 2007|url-status = live}}</ref> Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka and then went to the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] in South Africa where they reached the final, only to be beaten by Australia. The 2003\u201304 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1\u20131 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.\n\n[[File:Wankhede-1.JPG|thumb|The Indian cricket team in action at Wankhede Stadium.]]\nAt the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1\u20131. [[Greg Chappell]] took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, [[Suresh Raina]], and the coming of age of players like [[Irfan Pathan]] and [[Yuvraj Singh]]. A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and [[Virender Sehwag]] were selected to play for the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]] in the 2005 \"[[ICC Super Series|SuperTest]]\" against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = TWI gets production rights for India-Pakistan series|work = The Hindu \u2013 Sport|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126145458/http://hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|archive-date = 26 November 2007|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4\u20131 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1\u20130 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to lose the series 2\u20131. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = India can find right balance before World Cup|work = Jamie Alter|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126145458/http://hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|archive-date = 26 November 2007|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2006, India played and won its first ever [[Twenty20]] international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like [[Robin Uthappa]] saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round.\n\n====Success under Dhoni====\nAfter [[Indian cricket team in England in 2007|winning the Test series against England]] in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team, following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever [[Twenty20 World Cup]] held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007\u201308, they toured Australia where India lost the highly controversial home [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 2007-08|Test series]] 2\u20131 but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia.\n\nIn April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2\u20130 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2\u20130 in the home test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1\u20131.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-india-2010/content/current/series/463136.html The series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308152608/http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-india-2010/content/current/series/463136.html |date=8 March 2011 }} cricinfo</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|-\n|+'''India's results in International Matches'''\n|-\n!

The disastrous whitewashes saw the retirement of Dravid and [[VVS Laxman]] from Test cricket in 2012. Tendulkar retired in November 2013 after his 200th Test match. With Ganguly retired in 2008, this period signalled the end of the fabled middle-order batting line-up India had for over a decade. In 2012, India continued to face a tough transition period as they were beaten 2\u20131 in a home Test series by England. This was the first time India were beaten by England at home since [[English cricket team in India and Sri Lanka in 1984\u201385|1984\u201385]]. This was followed by a 2\u20131 loss in the ODI series against Pakistan, India's arch-rivals, at home. India were then knocked out in the second round of the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]]. India also failed to qualify for the [[2012 Asia Cup]] final which closed out a disappointing year for India. However, 2013 saw a resurgence in Indian cricket.\n\n====Worldwide limited-overs success====\nIn early 2013, India returned the favour to Australia and whitewashed them 4\u20130 at home in a Test series. India then beat the Aussies 3\u20132 in the 7-match ODI series and won the one-off T20I. However, India lost heavily against New Zealand and South Africa away from home and led to heavy criticism of Indian cricketers for not being able to perform overseas. India defeated England in the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]] final and [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] became the first captain in history to win the three major ICC trophies, namely- [[ICC Cricket World Cup]], [[ICC World Twenty20]] and ICC Champions Trophy. This was followed by a victory in the [[West Indies Triangular Series in 2013]] consisting of India, West Indies and Sri Lanka. In 2014, India toured Bangladesh and England. Although they beat the former 2\u20130 in 3 One Day Internationals, Team India were beaten 3\u20131 in 5 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] by England. This series included a famous win for the Indian team in the first match of the series at Lord's. The Test series was followed by a 3\u20131 win for the Indians in a 5-match ODI series and a loss in a one-off T20, both against England.\n\nIndia failed to reach the final of the [[Asia Cup]] yet again in 2014. In the [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]] hosted in Bangladesh, India narrowly missed out on another ICC trophy by losing to Sri Lanka in the final. This tournament saw the rise of [[Virat Kohli]] as one of the best limited overs batsmen in world cricket, as he was adjudged the man of the series. India soon comprehensively beat Sri Lanka and West Indies in ODI series to cement their position at the top of the ODI rankings. India toured Australia towards the end of 2014 for a 4-match Test series, which is remembered for MS Dhoni's sudden retirement from Test cricket after the end of the second Test. Virat Kohli was appointed as the captain of Team India in Test matches but he was unable to turn the series around and India lost 2\u20130. Kohli's first series win as captain came away from home in a 3-match Test series vs Sri Lanka, which signalled the beginning of an unbeaten Test series run for India.\n\n2015 saw the beginning of India's dominance at home in Test matches under new captain Virat Kohli when they comprehensively beat South Africa. This series was the beginning of an unbeaten streak of 19 Test matches for India which was brought to an end by Australia in early 2017. This series also saw the emergence of [[Ravichandran Ashwin]] and [[Ravindra Jadeja]] as two of the best spinners and all-rounders. They spun webs around touring batsmen, much like the spinning quartet of the 1970s. This was followed by limited overs victories over Australia and Sri Lanka away from home. India was knocked out of the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup|2015 World Cup]] in the semi-final stage, to eventual winners Australia. India began 2016 by winning the [[2016 Asia Cup]], remaining unbeaten throughout the tournament, beating Pakistan along the way. India were favourites to win the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20]] which was being held at home, but they lost in the semi-final to eventual champions West Indies. Virat Kohli was again named the man of the series.\n\nIn 2016, \"The Grand Home Season\" began for India, including series at home against New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia. India whitewashed New Zealand to regain the number one ranking in Test cricket after almost 10 years. Before the series against England in November 2016, MS Dhoni resigned as captain of India in limited overs, thus handing the captaincy to Virat Kohli across all formats. India beat England across all three formats, with a notable 4\u20130 win in the Test series. This was followed by Test series wins against Bangladesh and Australia,  which meant India reclaimed the [[Border Gavaskar Trophy]]. Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest cricketer of all time to reach 250 wickets; he and Ravindra Jadeja occupied the top two spots in both the ICC Bowlers and All-Rounders rankings at the time. In the process, India became the third team (after South Africa and Australia) to have won their most recent Test series against all the other Test-playing nations.

In addition to their whites, Indian fielders wear a dark blue cap or a white wide-brimmed sun hat, with the BCCI logo in the center. Helmets are also dark blue. Some players sport the Indian flag on their helmet.\n\nThe branding is minimal for whites; the BCCI logo is placed on the left chest while the team sponsor's (currently OPPO) logo is present on the right chest. The kit manufacturer's (Nike) logo would be printed on the sleeve of the players' leading arms.\n\n=== Limited overs ===\nSince colours have made their way into international cricket, the Indian cricket team has chosen blue as their primary colour. The blue colour of the uniform has earned them the nickname of 'Men in Blue' for the Indian cricket team. The secondary colour has changed over the years while yellow and orange have been dominant. With the inception of the [[World Series Cup]] in 1979, each team had to don a primary and secondary colour on their uniforms and the Indian team elected to wear light blue as their primary colour and yellow as their secondary colour. The team has worn different shades of blue since then. For the 1992 World Cup ([[1992 Cricket World Cup|Benson & Hedges World Cup]]), the team's colours were changed to navy-blue by [[ISC (sportswear)|ISC]], the common kit manufacturer for the tournament. A light shade of blue with yellow as secondary colour and a strip with 10 different colours (representing different nations) was adapted on the uniform for the 1996 World Cup ([[1996 Cricket World Cup|Wills World Cup]]) while an even lighter shade of blue and a dominant yellow was used by [[ASICS]], the common kit manufacturer for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]]. The ICC no longer appoints a common kit manufacturer for its tournaments.\n\nDifferent designs were adopted on the playing jerseys over the years and the most predominant one has been 'India' text written in yellow over a diagonal splash of the tricolour. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] acquired the kit manufacturing rights for the team in 2005 and designed new jerseys for the 2007 World Cup with the lightest shade of blue used by the team till date and golden yellow as the secondary colour. A new tricolour accent was implemented on the right side of the jersey. The colour was changed to a darker feroza blue in 2009 with orange replacing yellow as the secondary colour.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Team-Indias-new-jersey-unveiled/articleshow/4148955.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Team India's new jersey unveiled | date=18 February 2009 | access-date=18 February 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220120150/http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Team-Indias-new-jersey-unveiled/articleshow/4148955.cms | archive-date=20 February 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA New Jersey was unveiled by Nike with a bolder ultramarine blue shade<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/top-stories/28250944_1_new-jersey-new-odi-kit-ravi-kallayil|title=Team India dazzles in 'ultramarine' blue new jersey|date=20 October 2010|work=The Times of India|access-date=1 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044102/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/top-stories/28250944_1_new-jersey-new-odi-kit-ravi-kallayil|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and a new tricolour accent placed on both sides of the jersey in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/30804/team-india-gets-new-nike-odi-kit|title=Team India gets new Nike ODI kit|work=Cricbuzz|access-date=29 November 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829110012/https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/30804/team-india-gets-new-nike-odi-kit|archive-date=29 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A reddish-orange shade was used as the secondary colour on this uniform.

For T20 kits, in addition to these, the sponsor's logo is also present on the back, below the players' numbers. However, for ICC tournaments, the tournament logo is placed on the right chest and the sponsor's logo is allowed only on the sleeve of the players' leading arms.

Most grounds are under the administration of various state cricket boards as opposed to being under the control of the BCCI. The Bombay Gymkhana was the first ground in India to host a full-scale cricket match featuring an Indian cricket team. This was between the Parsis and the Europeans in 1877. The first stadium to host a Test match in India was also the Gymkhana Ground in [[Bombay]] in 1933, the only Test it ever hosted. The second and third Tests in the 1933 series were hosted at [[Eden Gardens]] and [[Chepauk]]. The [[Feroz Shah Kotla Ground]] in Delhi was the first stadium to host a Test match after independence, a draw against the West Indies in 1948, the first of a 5-Test series. 21 stadiums in India have hosted at least one [[List of Test cricket grounds|official Test match]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of world-class cricket stadiums in India, with multiple Test venues in [[Indore]], [[Chandigarh]] [[Mohali]], [[Chennai]], [[Mumbai]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Rajkot]], [[Ranchi]], [[Pune]], [[Dharamshala]] and [[Nagpur]].\n\nEden Gardens in Kolkata has hosted the most Tests, and also has the second-largest [[seating capacity]] of any cricket stadium in the world, being capable of holding more than 66,000 spectators. Founded in 1864, it is one of the most historical stadiums in India, having hosted numerous historical and controversial matches.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/57980.html |title = Cricinfo \u2013 Grounds: Eden Gardens |work = Cricinfo |accessdate = 21 September 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006041632/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/57980.html |archive-date = 6 October 2006 |url-status = live }}</ref> Other major stadiums in India include the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, which was established in 1883 and hosted memorable matches including Anil Kumble's ten wickets in an innings haul against Pakistan.

[[Wankhede Stadium]], established in 1974, has a capacity to hold 33,000 spectators and is currently the most popular venue in the city. It has hosted 24 Test matches. It was the unofficial successor of the Brabourne Stadium, which is also located in Mumbai. Mumbai is often considered the cricketing capital of India because of its fans and the talent it produces (see [[Mumbai cricket team]]) and thus the stadium regularly hosts major Test matches.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html|title = Cricinfo \u2013 Grounds: Wankhede Stadium|work = Cricinfo|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061104024543/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/58324.html|archive-date = 4 November 2006|url-status = live}}</ref> The [[M.

India's first captain was [[CK Nayudu]], who led the team in four matches against England: one in England in 1932 and a series of three matches at home in 1933\u201334. [[Lala Amarnath]], India's fourth captain, led the team in its first Test match after [[Partition of India|Indian independence]]. He also captained the side to its first Test victory and first series win, both in a three-match series at home against Pakistan in 1952\u201353. From 1952 until 1961\u201362, India had a number of captains such as [[Vijay Hazare]], [[Polly Umrigar]] and [[Nari Contractor]].\n\nThe Nawab of Pataudi, [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi]], was the team's captain for 36 Test matches from 1961\u201362 to 1969\u201370, returning for another four matches against West Indies in 1974\u201375. In the early years of his captaincy tenure, the team was whitewashed in the West Indies, England and Australia. However, in 1967\u201368, Pataudi led India on its maiden New Zealand tour, which ended in India winning the Test series 3\u20131. In 1970\u201371, [[Ajit Wadekar]] took over the captaincy from Pataudi. Under Wadekar's captaincy, India registered its first Test series win in the West Indies and England. India played its first ODI in 1974, also under his captaincy. India won its first ODI under the captaincy of [[Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan]] in the [[1975 Cricket World Cup]], against [[East African cricket team|East Africa]]. Between 1975\u201376 and 1978\u201379, [[Bishen Singh Bedi]] captained the team in 22 Tests and 4 ODIs, winning 6 Tests and one ODI.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1983 Cricket WC.jpg|thumb|Kapil Dev led the Indian team to victory at the 1983 World Cup.]] -->\n[[Sunil Gavaskar]] took over as Test and ODI captain in 1978\u201379, leading India in 47 Test matches and 37 ODIs, winning 9 Tests and 14 ODIs. He was succeeded by [[Kapil Dev]] in the 1980s, who captained for 34 Test matches, including 4 victories. Kapil Dev led India to victory in 39 of his 74 ODIs in charge, including the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]]. Kapil Dev also captained India's 2\u20130 Test series victory in England in 1986. Between 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390, India had three captains in [[Dilip Vengsarkar]], Ravi Shastri and [[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]]. Vengsarkar took over the captaincy from Kapil Dev after the 1987 Cricket World Cup. Although he started with two centuries in his first series as captain, his captaincy period was turbulent{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and he lost the job following a disastrous tour of the West Indies in early-1989 and a stand-off with the Indian cricket board (BCCI).\n\nIndia has had six regular Test captains since [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] took charge in 1989. Azharuddin led the team in 47 Test matches from 1989\u201390 to 1998\u201399, winning 14, and in 174 ODIs, winning 90. He was followed by Sachin Tendulkar, who captained the team in 25 Test matches and 73 ODIs in the late 1990s; Tendulkar was relatively unsuccessful<ref>{{cite news|title=Tendulkar on his captains: Ganguly was aggressive, Rahul methodical, Dhoni instinctive|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/tendulkar-on-his-captains-ganguly-was-aggressive-rahul-methodical-dhoni-instinctive-1791655.html|accessdate=1 July 2015|work=[[Firstpost]]|date=7 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715070716/http://www.firstpost.com/sports/tendulkar-on-his-captains-ganguly-was-aggressive-rahul-methodical-dhoni-instinctive-1791655.html|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/sports/replacing-sachin-tendulkar-with-azharuddin-as-captain-in-1997-big-mystery-1553577.html|title=Replacing Sachin with Azhar as captain in 1997: When selectors spun the ball|accessdate=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109181442/http://news.oneindia.in/sports/replacing-sachin-tendulkar-with-azharuddin-as-captain-in-1997-big-mystery-1553577.html|archive-date=9 November 2014|url-status=live|date=6 November 2014}}</ref> as a captain, winning only 4 Test matches and 23 ODIs. He was replaced as ODI captain by [[Ajay Jadeja]] and then by [[Sourav Ganguly]].\n\nGanguly became the regular captain of the team in both Tests and ODIs in 2000. He remained captain until 2005\u201306 and became the then most successful Indian captain, winning 21 of his 49 Test matches in charge and 76 of his 146 ODIs. Under his captaincy, India became the joint-winners of the [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka, and the runners-up of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. India lost only three Tests at home under Ganguly and managed to draw Test series in England and Australia. [[Rahul Dravid]] took over as Test captain in 2005. In 2006, he led India to its first Test series victory in the West Indies in more than 30 years.\n\nIn September 2007, [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] was named as the new captain of the ODI and [[T20I]] teams, after Dravid stepped down from the post. Soon after taking up the captaincy, Dhoni led the team to the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural World Twenty20]] title. [[Anil Kumble]] was appointed Test captain in November 2007, but retired from international cricket in November 2008 after captaining in 14 Tests. Dhoni succeeded him as the Test captain, making him the captain in all formats. Under the captaincy of Dhoni, the Indian team held the number one position in the [[ICC Test Championship|Test rankings]] for 21 months (from November 2009 to August 2011), and set a national record for most back-to-back ODI wins (nine straight wins).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090213041951/http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA|url-status=dead|title=The Canadian Press: Sri Lanka denies India 5-0 rout by winning final ...|date=13 February 2009|archivedate=13 February 2009}}</ref> Dhoni also led the team to victory in 2011 Cricket World Cup and [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]]. Thus, Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies, namely- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. However, the team performed poorly in away Tests from 2011 to 2014 and Dhoni retired from Test cricket in December 2014, with [[Virat Kohli]] being named as the new Test captain. Dhoni resigned as captain of the ODI and T20 teams in January 2017 and Kohli succeeded him at the position.\n\nUnder Kohli's captaincy, India was unbeaten in 19 Test matches, starting from a 3\u20130 series win over New Zealand and ending with a 2\u20131 series win over Australia. India has an unbeaten streak of winning 9 consecutive Test series as of Dec 2017, starting with a 2\u20131 series win over Sri Lanka. India also became only the third team after Australia and South Africa to have won their most recent Test series simultaneously against all the other Test playing nations. As per winning percentage in Test matches, Kohli is India's most successful test captain, having won more than 61% of Test matches (at least 2 games).\n\n==Squad==\nThis lists all the players who have played for India in the past 12 months and the formats in which they have played.

He holds the record of most appearances in both Tests and ODIs, most runs in both Tests and ODIs and most centuries in Tests and ODIs. The highest score by an Indian is the 319 scored by [[Virender Sehwag]] in Chennai. It is the second [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century in Test cricket]] by an Indian, the first being a 309 also made by Sehwag although against Pakistan. The team's highest ever score was a 759/7 against England at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai in 2016, while its lowest was 42 against England in 1974. In ODIs, the team's highest score is 418/5 against West Indies at Indore in 2011\u201312. India score 413\u20135 in a match against [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] which is the highest score ever in Cricket World Cup history. In the same match, India set a world record of the highest winning margin in an ODI match of 257 runs.\n\nIndia has also had some very strong bowling figures, with spin bowler Anil Kumble being a member of the elite group of 3 bowlers who have taken 600 Test wickets. In 1999, Anil Kumble emulated [[Jim Laker]] to become the second bowler to take all ten wickets in a Test match innings when he took 10 wickets for 74 runs against Pakistan at the [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] in [[Delhi]].\n\nMany of the Indian cricket team's records are also [[Test cricket records|world records]], for example Sachin Tendulkar's century tally (in Tests and ODIs) and run tally (also in both Tests and ODIs). Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 183 not out against Sri Lanka in 2005 is the world record score by a wicketkeeper in ODIs. The Indian cricket team also holds the record sequence of 17 successful run-chases in ODIs,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-www1.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/248029.html|title = Dravid rues faulty execution|work=Cricinfo Staff| accessdate =21 September 2006|date = 21 May 2006}}</ref> which ended in a dramatic match against the West Indies in May 2006, which India lost by just 1 run when Yuvraj Singh was bowled by Dwayne Bravo's full toss.\n\nSachin Tendulkar was the first batsman to score 200 runs (he was unbeaten on 200 from 147 deliveries including 25x4 and 3x6) in a single ODI innings, on 24 February 2010 against South Africa in [[Gwalior]]. On 8 December 2011, this achievement was eclipsed by compatriot Virender Sehwag, who scored 219 runs from 149 deliveries (25x4 | 7x6) versus [[West Indies]] in [[Indore]]. On 13 November 2014 the record was broken by another Indian opening batsmen, [[Rohit Sharma]], who scored 264 runs from 173 deliveries (33x4 | 9x6) against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in Kolkata. In 2013, MS Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Virat Kohli became the first cricketer to win back-to-back man of the series awards in the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]]. In 2017, Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest cricketer in history to reach 250 wickets. He and Ravindra Jadeja are considered to be the best bowlers in Test cricket and occupy the top two spots in the rankings for Test bowlers {{as of|2017|May|lc=y}}.

In tours between these two nations, cricket visas are often employed to accommodate for the tens of thousands of fans wishing to cross the border to watch cricket. This intense fan dedication is one of the major causes of the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI's]] financial success.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050221/sports.htm#1|title = 10,000 Visas for Pak Cricket Fans|work = The Tribune, Chandigarh|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903055335/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050221/sports.htm#1|archive-date = 3 September 2006|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are downsides to having such a cricket-loving population. Many Indians hold [[Cricket in India|cricket]] very close to their hearts and losses are not received well by the Indian population. In some cases, particularly after losses to Pakistan or after a long string of weak performances, there have been reports of player [[effigy|effigies]] being burnt in the streets and vandalism of player homes.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2871400/2871497.stm|title = Ganguly's Debt of Gratitude|work = BBC News|accessdate = 21 September 2006|date = 21 March 2003|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090113015842/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2871400/2871497.stm|archive-date = 13 January 2009|url-status = live}}</ref> In many cases, players have come under intense attention from the media for negative reasons, this has been considered as one of the reasons for Sourav Ganguly being left out of the Indian team. At times, when a match is surrounded by controversy, it has resulted in a debacle. For example, when India slid to defeat against Australia at [[Brabourne Stadium]] in 1969, fans began throwing stones and bottles onto the field as well as setting fire to the stands, before laying siege to the Australian dressing rooms. During the same tour, a stampede occurred at Eden Gardens when tickets were oversold and India fell to another loss; the Australian team bus was later stoned with bricks .<ref name=\"Riots\">{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/243910.html|title = I predict a riot|work = Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson|accessdate = 22 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208133819/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/243910.html|archive-date = 8 February 2007|url-status = live|date = 11 April 2006}}</ref> A similar event occurred during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]], where India were losing the semi-final to Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens. In this case, the fan behaviour was directed at the Indian team in disappointment at their lacklustre performance. An armed guard had to be placed at the home of captain [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] to ensure his safety.<ref name=\"Riots\"/> Indian fans have also been passionate in their following of Sachin Tendulkar, who has been commonly thought of as one of the best batsmen in the world. Glorified for the bulk of his career, a riot occurred in early 1999 in a Test against Pakistan at [[Eden Gardens]] after a collision with Pakistani paceman [[Shoaib Akhtar]] saw him run out, forcing police to eject spectators and the game to be played in an empty stadium. Although in 2006, a string of low scores resulted in Tendulkar being booed by the Mumbai crowd when he got out against England<ref name=\"Sachinboo\">{{cite web|url = http://www.indiadaily.org/entry/sachin-tendulkar-booed-by-wankhede-crowd/|title = Sachin Tendulkar booed by Wankhede Crowd|work = India Daily|publisher = India Daily|accessdate = 15 January 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061011174138/http://www.indiadaily.org/entry/sachin-tendulkar-booed-by-wankhede-crowd/|archive-date = 11 October 2006|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nOften, fans engage in protests regarding players if they believe that regionalism has affected selection, or because of regional partisan support for local players. In 2005, when Sourav Ganguly was dropped from the team, Ganguly's home town [[Kolkata]] erupted in protests.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2005/dec/15protest.htm|title = Protests rock Kolkata over Ganguly's exclusion|work = Rediff|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051218094401/http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2005/dec/15protest.htm|archive-date = 18 December 2005|url-status = live}}</ref> India later played a match against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] in [[Kolkata]], West Bengal.

For all national women's cricket teams, the female players are paid much less their male counterparts, and the women's teams do not receive as much popular support or recognition as the men's team. The women's teams also have a less packed schedule compared to men's teams and play fewer matches. The Indian women's cricket team played its first [[Women's Test cricket|Test match]] in 1976, when they drew with the [[West Indian women's cricket team|West Indies]] in a six-match series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/94140.html|work=ESPNcricinfo|author1=Subhin Harika|date=13 June 2017|title=History of Indian women' cricket team|access-date=13 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803215829/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/94140.html|archive-date=3 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Women's Cricket World Cup]] was held in India in 1978 and featured 4 teams. India lost both the matches they have played. Their next appearance in the Test and ODI circuit was against Australia in 1984, in which the Test series was tied but the [[Women's one-day international cricket|ODI series]] was lost in a whitewash.\n\nThe Indian women's cricket team has since picked up their form, reaching the finals in the World Cup, but then losing to [[Australia national women's cricket team|Australia]]. The Women's Asia Cup of 2005\u201306 was won by India, who beat Sri Lanka in the final. They also beat the West Indies in the 2004\u201305 season, winning the 5 ODI series 5\u20130. They were knocked out in the group stage of the [[2013 Women's Cricket World Cup]] held in India.

India's national cricket team did not play its first Test match until 25 June 1932 at [[Lord's]], becoming the sixth team to be granted test cricket status. From 1932 India had to wait until 1952, almost 20 years for its first Test victory. In its first fifty years of international cricket, India was one of the weaker teams, winning only 35 of the first 196 Test matches it played. The team, however, gained strength in the 1970s with the emergence of players such as batsmen [[Sunil Gavaskar|Gavaskar]], [[Gundappa Viswanath|Viswanath]], [[Kapil Dev]], and the [[Indian spin quartet]].\n\nTraditionally much stronger at home than abroad, the Indian team has improved its overseas form, especially in limited-overs cricket, since the start of the 21st century, winning Test matches in [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. It has won the [[India at the Cricket World Cup|Cricket World Cup]] twice \u2013 in [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]] under the captaincy of [[Kapil Dev]] and in [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]] under the captaincy of [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]]. After winning the 2011 World Cup, India became only the third team after [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]] and Australia to have won the [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] more than once,<ref name=\"BBC-Power\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444277.stm|title=India power past Sri Lanka to Cricket World Cup triumph|work=BBC Sport|date=2 April 2011|accessdate=2 April 2011|first=Sam|last=Sheringham|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403035451/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/9444277.stm|archive-date=3 April 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> and the first cricket team to win the World Cup at home. It also won the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]], under the captaincy of [[MS Dhoni]]. It was also the joint champions of [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]], along with [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]].\n\nThe Indian cricket team has rivalries with other Test-playing nations, most notably [[India\u2013Pakistan cricket rivalry|with Pakistan]], the political arch-rival of India. However, in recent times, rivalries with nations like Australia, South Africa and England have also gained prominence.\n\n{{as of|2020|February|10|df=}}, India is ranked first in Tests, second in ODIs and fourth in T20Is by the ICC.<ref name=\"ICC rankings - ICC Test, ODI and Twenty20 rankings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/page/211271.html|title=ICC rankings \u2013 ICC Test, ODI and Twenty20 rankings \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=[[ESPNcricinfo]]|access-date=2 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303202904/http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/page/211271.html|archive-date=3 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Virat Kohli]] is the current captain of the team across all formats, while the head coach is [[Ravi Shastri]].<ref name=\"Shastri In\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/1110473.html|title=Shastri, Zaheer, Dravid in India's new coaching team|date=11 July 2017|accessdate=11 July 2017|work=ESPN cricinfo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711191312/http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/1110473.html|archive-date=11 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|History of the Indian cricket team}}\n[[File:Probir Sen with Queen Elizabeth II.png|thumb|[[Queen Elizabeth II]] with members of the Indian team during the [[Indian cricket team in England in 1952|Indian tour of England in 1952]].]]\n===Early history (1700s - 1918)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India to 1918}}\nThe British brought cricket to India in the early 1700s, with the first cricket match played in 1721.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Downing|first= Clement|title= A History of the Indian Wars|year= 1737|editor= William Foster|location= London}}</ref> In 1848, the [[Parsi]] community in [[Bombay]] formed the Oriental Cricket Club, the first cricket club to be established by Indians.

However, they did not win again in the remainder of the decade and lost badly to strong Australian and English sides. On 24 August 1959, India lost by an innings in the Test to complete the only 5\u20130 whitewash ever inflicted by England. The next decade saw India's reputation develop as a team with a strong record at home. They won their first Test series against England at home in 1961\u201362 and also won a home series against New Zealand. They managed to draw home series against Pakistan and Australia and another series against England. In this same period, India also won its first series outside the subcontinent, against New Zealand in 1967\u201368.\n\nThe key to India's [[bowling (cricket)|bowling]] in the 1970s were the [[Indian spin quartet]] \u2013 [[Bishen Bedi]], [[E.A.S. Prasanna]], [[BS Chandrasekhar]] and [[Srinivas Venkataraghavan]]. This period also saw the emergence of two of India's best ever batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar and [[Gundappa Viswanath]]. Indian [[cricket pitch|pitches]] have had the tendency to support [[spin bowling|spin]] and the spin quartet exploited this to create collapses in opposing batting line-ups. These players were responsible for the back-to-back series wins in 1971 in the West Indies and in England, under the captaincy of [[Ajit Wadekar]]. Gavaskar scored 774 runs in the West Indian series while [[Dilip Sardesai]]'s 112 played a big part in their one Test win.\n\n===One-day cricket and ICC Cricket World Cup success (1970-1985)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 1970\u201371 to 1985}}\n[[File:Indian Cricket Team Test Results.svg|thumb|A graph showing India's Test match results against all Test match teams from 1932 to September 2006.]]\nThe advent of [[One Day International]] (ODI) cricket in 1971 created a new dimension in the cricket world. However, India was not considered strong in ODIs at this point and batsmen such as the captain Gavaskar were known for their defensive approach to batting. India began as a weak team in ODIs and did not qualify for the second round in the first two editions of the Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/team-india-on-the-brink-of-odi-record-at-vizag-remain-torchbearers-of-50-over-format/story-B1DIaBOhWX4DP2chPHzk6M.html|title=Team India on the brink of ODI record at Vizag, remain torchbearers of 50-over format|access-date=24 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024113206/https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/team-india-on-the-brink-of-odi-record-at-vizag-remain-torchbearers-of-50-over-format/story-B1DIaBOhWX4DP2chPHzk6M.html|archive-date=24 October 2018|url-status=live|date=23 October 2018}}</ref> Gavaskar infamously blocked his way to 36 not out off 174 balls against England in the first World Cup in 1975, India scored just 132 for 3 and lost by 202 runs.\n\nIn contrast, India fielded a strong team in Test matches and was particularly strong at home, where their combination of stylish batsmen and beguiling spinners were at their best. India set a then Test record in the third Test against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1976, when they chased 403 to win, thanks to 112 from Viswanath. This West Indian defeat is considered to be a watershed in the history of their cricket because it led to captain [[Clive Lloyd]] dispensing with spin altogether and relying entirely on a four-man pace attack instead. In November 1976, the team established another record by scoring 524 for 9 declared against New Zealand at Kanpur without any individual batsman scoring a century. There were six fifties, the highest being 70 by [[Mohinder Amarnath]]. This innings was only the eighth instance in Test cricket where all eleven batsmen reached double figures.\n\nDuring the 1980s, India developed a more attack-minded batting line-up with stroke makers such as the wristy [[Mohammed Azharuddin]], [[Dilip Vengsarkar]] and all-rounders [[Kapil Dev]] and [[Ravi Shastri]]. India won the Cricket World Cup in 1983, defeating the favourites and the two-time defending champions West Indies in the final at Lords, owing to a strong bowling performance. In spite of this, the team performed poorly in the Test arena, including 28 consecutive Test matches without a victory. In 1984, India won the [[Asia Cup]] and in 1985, won the [[World Championship of Cricket]] in Australia. Apart from this, India remained a weak team outside the [[Indian subcontinent]]. India's Test series victory in 1986 against England remained the last Test series win by India outside the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] for the next 19 years. The 1980s saw Gavaskar and Kapil Dev (India's best all-rounder to date) at the pinnacle of their careers. Gavaskar made a Test record 34 centuries as he became the first man to reach the 10,000 run mark. Kapil Dev later became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket with 434 wickets. The period was also marked by an unstable leadership, with Gavaskar and Kapil exchanging the captaincy several times.\n\n===Late 20th century (1985-2000)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 1985\u201386 to 2000}}\n[[File:Kumble edited.jpg|thumb|With 619 wickets, [[Anil Kumble]] is the world's third highest wicket-taker in Tests and India's highest Test and ODI wicket-taker.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30176.html |title=Cricinfo- Anil Kumble |publisher=Content-usa.cricinfo.com |accessdate=20 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211161513/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/player/30176.html |archive-date=11 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>]]\nThe addition of [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and Anil Kumble to the national side in 1989 and 1990 further improved the team. The following year, [[Javagal Srinath]], India's fastest bowler since [[Amar Singh (cricketer)|Amar Singh]] made his debut. Despite this, during the 1990s, India did not win any of its 33 Tests outside the [[South Asia|subcontinent]] while it won 17 out of its 30 Tests at home. After being eliminated by neighbours Sri Lanka on home soil at the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] semifinal, the team underwent a year of change as [[Sourav Ganguly]] and [[Rahul Dravid]], later to become captains of the team, made their debut in the same Test at Lord's. Tendulkar replaced Azharuddin as captain in late 1996, but after a personal and team form slump, Tendulkar relinquished the captaincy and Azharuddin was reinstated at the beginning of 1998. With the captaincy burden removed, Tendulkar was the world's leading run-scorer in both Tests and ODIs, as India enjoyed a home Test series win over Australia, the best-ranked team in the world.\n\nAfter failing to reach the semifinals at the [[1999 Cricket World Cup]], Tendulkar was again made captain, and had another poor run, losing 3\u20130 on a tour of Australia and then 2\u20130 at home to South Africa. Tendulkar resigned, vowing never to captain the team again. Ganguly was appointed the new captain and the team was further damaged in 2000 when former captain Azharuddin and fellow batsman [[Ajay Jadeja]] were implicated in a match-fixing scandal and given life and five years bans respectively. This period was described by the BBC as \"the Indian cricket's worst hour\". However, the new core \u2013 Tendulkar, Dravid, Kumble and Ganguly \u2013 swore not to let this happen to them again, and lead Indian cricket out of the dark times. And the first three put aside personal ambitions to let Ganguly lead them into a new era.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19352766 | work=BBC News | title=India cricket: Middle-order retirements are end of era | date=23 August 2012 | access-date=22 June 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018224629/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-19352766 | archive-date=18 October 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Turn of the millennium (2000-present)===\n{{see also|History of cricket in India from 2000\u201301}}\nSince 2000, the Indian team underwent major improvements under the captaincy of Sourav Ganguly and guidance of [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]], India's first ever foreign [[List of India national cricket coaches|coach]]. India maintained their unbeaten home record against Australia in Test series after defeating them in 2001. The series was famous for the Kolkata Test match, in which India became only the third team in the history of Test cricket to win a Test match after following on. [[Australian national cricket captains|Australian captain]] [[Steve Waugh]] labelled India as the \"Final Frontier\" as a result of his side's inability to win a Test series in India.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|title = Steve Waugh Column|work = Steve Waugh|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071017222838/http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/NATIONAL/IND/NEWS/STEVEWAUGH_COLUMN.html|archive-date = 17 October 2007|url-status = live}}</ref> Victory in 2001 against the Australians marked the beginning of a dream run for India under their captain Ganguly, winning Test matches in [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]], Sri Lanka, West Indies and England. The England series is also known for India's highest ODI run-chase of 325 runs at Lord's which came in the Natwest ODI Series final against England. In the same year, India were joint-winners of the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka and then went to the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]] in South Africa where they reached the final, only to be beaten by Australia. The 2003\u201304 season also saw India play out a Test series in Australia where they drew 1\u20131 with the world champions, and then win a Test and ODI series in Pakistan.\n\n[[File:Wankhede-1.JPG|thumb|The Indian cricket team in action at Wankhede Stadium.]]\nAt the end of the 2004 season, India suffered from lack of form and fitness from its older players. A defeat in a following home Test series against Australia was followed by an ODI home series defeat against Pakistan followed by a Test series levelled 1\u20131. [[Greg Chappell]] took over from John Wright as the coach of the Indian cricket team following the series, and his methods proved to be controversial during the beginning of his tenure. The tension resulted in a fallout between Chappell and Ganguly, resulting in Rahul Dravid being made captain. This triggered a revival in the team's fortunes, following the emergence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, [[Suresh Raina]], and the coming of age of players like [[Irfan Pathan]] and [[Yuvraj Singh]]. A thumping home series victory over Sri Lanka in 2005 and a drawn series with South Africa put India at second place in the ICC ODI rankings. Dravid, Tendulkar and [[Virender Sehwag]] were selected to play for the [[2005 ICC Super Series|ICC World XI]] in the 2005 \"[[ICC Super Series|SuperTest]]\" against Australia. A convincing ODI series win in Pakistan in early 2006, following a loss in the Test series, gave India the world record of 17 successive ODI victories while batting second.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = TWI gets production rights for India-Pakistan series|work = The Hindu \u2013 Sport|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126145458/http://hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|archive-date = 26 November 2007|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Towards the middle of 2006, however, a 4\u20131 series loss in the West Indies gave rise to a slump in India's ODI form, while they achieved a 1\u20130 victory in the Test series that followed, giving them their first Test series victory in the Caribbean since 1971. India's ODI form slumped further with a disappointing performance in the 2006 Champions Trophy and a drubbing in the ODI series in South Africa. This was followed yet again by an initial good performance in the Tests, giving India its first Test match win in South Africa, although they went on to lose the series 2\u20131. This Test series was marked by Ganguly's comeback to the Indian team.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|title = India can find right balance before World Cup|work = Jamie Alter|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071126145458/http://hinduonnet.com/2005/03/02/stories/2005030204681900.htm|archive-date = 26 November 2007|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2006, India played and won its first ever [[Twenty20]] international in South Africa, becoming the most recent Test team to play Twenty20 cricket. The beginning of 2007 had seen a revival in the Indian team's ODI fortunes before the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. Series victories against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, marked by the comeback of Ganguly, and strong form by Tendulkar, and the emergence of young players like [[Robin Uthappa]] saw many pundits to tip India as a real contender to win the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]]. However, defeats to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw India fail to reach the second round.\n\n====Success under Dhoni====\nAfter [[Indian cricket team in England in 2007|winning the Test series against England]] in August 2007, Dravid stepped down as the captain of the team, following which Dhoni was made the captain of the Twenty20 and ODI team. In September 2007, India won the first-ever [[Twenty20 World Cup]] held in South Africa, beating Pakistan by 5 runs in the final. In 2007\u201308, they toured Australia where India lost the highly controversial home [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 2007-08|Test series]] 2\u20131 but managed to win the CB series the following month with a whitewash final of Australia.\n\nIn April 2009, India secured their first Test series win in New Zealand in 41 years. After beating Sri Lanka 2\u20130 in December 2009, India became the No. 1 Test team in the world. They retained the ranking by drawing series against South Africa and Sri Lanka. In October 2010, India whitewashed Australia 2\u20130 in the home test series, giving them back-to-back series wins against them. Later that year, India managed to draw the Test series in South Africa at 1\u20131.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-india-2010/content/current/series/463136.html The series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308152608/http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-india-2010/content/current/series/463136.html |date=8 March 2011 }} cricinfo</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em;\"\n|-\n|+'''India's results in International Matches'''\n|-\n!

The disastrous whitewashes saw the retirement of Dravid and [[VVS Laxman]] from Test cricket in 2012. Tendulkar retired in November 2013 after his 200th Test match. With Ganguly retired in 2008, this period signalled the end of the fabled middle-order batting line-up India had for over a decade. In 2012, India continued to face a tough transition period as they were beaten 2\u20131 in a home Test series by England. This was the first time India were beaten by England at home since [[English cricket team in India and Sri Lanka in 1984\u201385|1984\u201385]]. This was followed by a 2\u20131 loss in the ODI series against Pakistan, India's arch-rivals, at home. India were then knocked out in the second round of the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]]. India also failed to qualify for the [[2012 Asia Cup]] final which closed out a disappointing year for India. However, 2013 saw a resurgence in Indian cricket.\n\n====Worldwide limited-overs success====\nIn early 2013, India returned the favour to Australia and whitewashed them 4\u20130 at home in a Test series. India then beat the Aussies 3\u20132 in the 7-match ODI series and won the one-off T20I. However, India lost heavily against New Zealand and South Africa away from home and led to heavy criticism of Indian cricketers for not being able to perform overseas. India defeated England in the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]] final and [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] became the first captain in history to win the three major ICC trophies, namely- [[ICC Cricket World Cup]], [[ICC World Twenty20]] and ICC Champions Trophy. This was followed by a victory in the [[West Indies Triangular Series in 2013]] consisting of India, West Indies and Sri Lanka. In 2014, India toured Bangladesh and England. Although they beat the former 2\u20130 in 3 One Day Internationals, Team India were beaten 3\u20131 in 5 [[Test cricket|Test matches]] by England. This series included a famous win for the Indian team in the first match of the series at Lord's. The Test series was followed by a 3\u20131 win for the Indians in a 5-match ODI series and a loss in a one-off T20, both against England.\n\nIndia failed to reach the final of the [[Asia Cup]] yet again in 2014. In the [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]] hosted in Bangladesh, India narrowly missed out on another ICC trophy by losing to Sri Lanka in the final. This tournament saw the rise of [[Virat Kohli]] as one of the best limited overs batsmen in world cricket, as he was adjudged the man of the series. India soon comprehensively beat Sri Lanka and West Indies in ODI series to cement their position at the top of the ODI rankings. India toured Australia towards the end of 2014 for a 4-match Test series, which is remembered for MS Dhoni's sudden retirement from Test cricket after the end of the second Test. Virat Kohli was appointed as the captain of Team India in Test matches but he was unable to turn the series around and India lost 2\u20130. Kohli's first series win as captain came away from home in a 3-match Test series vs Sri Lanka, which signalled the beginning of an unbeaten Test series run for India.\n\n2015 saw the beginning of India's dominance at home in Test matches under new captain Virat Kohli when they comprehensively beat South Africa. This series was the beginning of an unbeaten streak of 19 Test matches for India which was brought to an end by Australia in early 2017. This series also saw the emergence of [[Ravichandran Ashwin]] and [[Ravindra Jadeja]] as two of the best spinners and all-rounders. They spun webs around touring batsmen, much like the spinning quartet of the 1970s. This was followed by limited overs victories over Australia and Sri Lanka away from home. India was knocked out of the [[2015 ICC Cricket World Cup|2015 World Cup]] in the semi-final stage, to eventual winners Australia. India began 2016 by winning the [[2016 Asia Cup]], remaining unbeaten throughout the tournament, beating Pakistan along the way. India were favourites to win the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20]] which was being held at home, but they lost in the semi-final to eventual champions West Indies. Virat Kohli was again named the man of the series.\n\nIn 2016, \"The Grand Home Season\" began for India, including series at home against New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia. India whitewashed New Zealand to regain the number one ranking in Test cricket after almost 10 years. Before the series against England in November 2016, MS Dhoni resigned as captain of India in limited overs, thus handing the captaincy to Virat Kohli across all formats. India beat England across all three formats, with a notable 4\u20130 win in the Test series. This was followed by Test series wins against Bangladesh and Australia,  which meant India reclaimed the [[Border Gavaskar Trophy]]. Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest cricketer of all time to reach 250 wickets; he and Ravindra Jadeja occupied the top two spots in both the ICC Bowlers and All-Rounders rankings at the time. In the process, India became the third team (after South Africa and Australia) to have won their most recent Test series against all the other Test-playing nations.

In addition to their whites, Indian fielders wear a dark blue cap or a white wide-brimmed sun hat, with the BCCI logo in the center. Helmets are also dark blue. Some players sport the Indian flag on their helmet.\n\nThe branding is minimal for whites; the BCCI logo is placed on the left chest while the team sponsor's (currently OPPO) logo is present on the right chest. The kit manufacturer's (Nike) logo would be printed on the sleeve of the players' leading arms.\n\n=== Limited overs ===\nSince colours have made their way into international cricket, the Indian cricket team has chosen blue as their primary colour. The blue colour of the uniform has earned them the nickname of 'Men in Blue' for the Indian cricket team. The secondary colour has changed over the years while yellow and orange have been dominant. With the inception of the [[World Series Cup]] in 1979, each team had to don a primary and secondary colour on their uniforms and the Indian team elected to wear light blue as their primary colour and yellow as their secondary colour. The team has worn different shades of blue since then. For the 1992 World Cup ([[1992 Cricket World Cup|Benson & Hedges World Cup]]), the team's colours were changed to navy-blue by [[ISC (sportswear)|ISC]], the common kit manufacturer for the tournament. A light shade of blue with yellow as secondary colour and a strip with 10 different colours (representing different nations) was adapted on the uniform for the 1996 World Cup ([[1996 Cricket World Cup|Wills World Cup]]) while an even lighter shade of blue and a dominant yellow was used by [[ASICS]], the common kit manufacturer for the [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999 World Cup]]. The ICC no longer appoints a common kit manufacturer for its tournaments.\n\nDifferent designs were adopted on the playing jerseys over the years and the most predominant one has been 'India' text written in yellow over a diagonal splash of the tricolour. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] acquired the kit manufacturing rights for the team in 2005 and designed new jerseys for the 2007 World Cup with the lightest shade of blue used by the team till date and golden yellow as the secondary colour. A new tricolour accent was implemented on the right side of the jersey. The colour was changed to a darker feroza blue in 2009 with orange replacing yellow as the secondary colour.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Team-Indias-new-jersey-unveiled/articleshow/4148955.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Team India's new jersey unveiled | date=18 February 2009 | access-date=18 February 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220120150/http://cricket.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Team-Indias-new-jersey-unveiled/articleshow/4148955.cms | archive-date=20 February 2009 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nA New Jersey was unveiled by Nike with a bolder ultramarine blue shade<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/top-stories/28250944_1_new-jersey-new-odi-kit-ravi-kallayil|title=Team India dazzles in 'ultramarine' blue new jersey|date=20 October 2010|work=The Times of India|access-date=1 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044102/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-20/top-stories/28250944_1_new-jersey-new-odi-kit-ravi-kallayil|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> and a new tricolour accent placed on both sides of the jersey in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/30804/team-india-gets-new-nike-odi-kit|title=Team India gets new Nike ODI kit|work=Cricbuzz|access-date=29 November 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829110012/https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/30804/team-india-gets-new-nike-odi-kit|archive-date=29 August 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A reddish-orange shade was used as the secondary colour on this uniform.

The tricolour accent made a return to the uniform as a single thin strip on either sides of upper chest.\n\nIn addition to the blue uniforms, the caps worn by the players are similar to the design of uniforms. The wide-brimmed sun hats are usually white while the helmets used by the players are of darker blue.\n\nSimilar to the first-class kits, BCCI logo is placed on the left chest while the logo of the kit manufacturer (Nike) sits on the right chest. The official team sponsor's logo (currently BYJU'S) is present on the central part of the jersey usually above 'INDIA' text as well as the sleeve of the players' leading arms. For T20 kits, in addition to these, the sponsor's logo is also present on the back, below the players' numbers. However, for ICC tournaments, the tournament logo is placed on the right chest and the sponsor's logo is allowed only on the sleeve of the players' leading arms. The kit manufacturer's logo in such cases will be printed on the sleeve of the players' non-leading arms.

The Bombay Gymkhana was the first ground in India to host a full-scale cricket match featuring an Indian cricket team. This was between the Parsis and the Europeans in 1877. The first stadium to host a Test match in India was also the Gymkhana Ground in [[Bombay]] in 1933, the only Test it ever hosted. The second and third Tests in the 1933 series were hosted at [[Eden Gardens]] and [[Chepauk]]. The [[Feroz Shah Kotla Ground]] in Delhi was the first stadium to host a Test match after independence, a draw against the West Indies in 1948, the first of a 5-Test series. 21 stadiums in India have hosted at least one [[List of Test cricket grounds|official Test match]].

Founded in 1864, it is one of the most historical stadiums in India, having hosted numerous historical and controversial matches.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/57980.html |title = Cricinfo \u2013 Grounds: Eden Gardens |work = Cricinfo |accessdate = 21 September 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061006041632/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/57980.html |archive-date = 6 October 2006 |url-status = live }}</ref> Other major stadiums in India include the Feroz Shah Kotla Ground, which was established in 1883 and hosted memorable matches including Anil Kumble's ten wickets in an innings haul against Pakistan.

[[Wankhede Stadium]], established in 1974, has a capacity to hold 33,000 spectators and is currently the most popular venue in the city. It has hosted 24 Test matches. It was the unofficial successor of the Brabourne Stadium, which is also located in Mumbai.

India's first captain was [[CK Nayudu]], who led the team in four matches against England: one in England in 1932 and a series of three matches at home in 1933\u201334. [[Lala Amarnath]], India's fourth captain, led the team in its first Test match after [[Partition of India|Indian independence]]. He also captained the side to its first Test victory and first series win, both in a three-match series at home against Pakistan in 1952\u201353. From 1952 until 1961\u201362, India had a number of captains such as [[Vijay Hazare]], [[Polly Umrigar]] and [[Nari Contractor]].\n\nThe Nawab of Pataudi, [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi]], was the team's captain for 36 Test matches from 1961\u201362 to 1969\u201370, returning for another four matches against West Indies in 1974\u201375. In the early years of his captaincy tenure, the team was whitewashed in the West Indies, England and Australia. However, in 1967\u201368, Pataudi led India on its maiden New Zealand tour, which ended in India winning the Test series 3\u20131. In 1970\u201371, [[Ajit Wadekar]] took over the captaincy from Pataudi. Under Wadekar's captaincy, India registered its first Test series win in the West Indies and England. India played its first ODI in 1974, also under his captaincy. India won its first ODI under the captaincy of [[Srinivasaraghavan Venkataraghavan]] in the [[1975 Cricket World Cup]], against [[East African cricket team|East Africa]]. Between 1975\u201376 and 1978\u201379, [[Bishen Singh Bedi]] captained the team in 22 Tests and 4 ODIs, winning 6 Tests and one ODI.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1983 Cricket WC.jpg|thumb|Kapil Dev led the Indian team to victory at the 1983 World Cup.]] -->\n[[Sunil Gavaskar]] took over as Test and ODI captain in 1978\u201379, leading India in 47 Test matches and 37 ODIs, winning 9 Tests and 14 ODIs. He was succeeded by [[Kapil Dev]] in the 1980s, who captained for 34 Test matches, including 4 victories. Kapil Dev led India to victory in 39 of his 74 ODIs in charge, including the [[1983 Cricket World Cup]]. Kapil Dev also captained India's 2\u20130 Test series victory in England in 1986. Between 1987\u201388 and 1989\u201390, India had three captains in [[Dilip Vengsarkar]], Ravi Shastri and [[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]]. Vengsarkar took over the captaincy from Kapil Dev after the 1987 Cricket World Cup. Although he started with two centuries in his first series as captain, his captaincy period was turbulent{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and he lost the job following a disastrous tour of the West Indies in early-1989 and a stand-off with the Indian cricket board (BCCI).\n\nIndia has had six regular Test captains since [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] took charge in 1989. Azharuddin led the team in 47 Test matches from 1989\u201390 to 1998\u201399, winning 14, and in 174 ODIs, winning 90. He was followed by Sachin Tendulkar, who captained the team in 25 Test matches and 73 ODIs in the late 1990s; Tendulkar was relatively unsuccessful<ref>{{cite news|title=Tendulkar on his captains: Ganguly was aggressive, Rahul methodical, Dhoni instinctive|url=http://www.firstpost.com/sports/tendulkar-on-his-captains-ganguly-was-aggressive-rahul-methodical-dhoni-instinctive-1791655.html|accessdate=1 July 2015|work=[[Firstpost]]|date=7 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715070716/http://www.firstpost.com/sports/tendulkar-on-his-captains-ganguly-was-aggressive-rahul-methodical-dhoni-instinctive-1791655.html|archive-date=15 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/sports/replacing-sachin-tendulkar-with-azharuddin-as-captain-in-1997-big-mystery-1553577.html|title=Replacing Sachin with Azhar as captain in 1997: When selectors spun the ball|accessdate=8 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141109181442/http://news.oneindia.in/sports/replacing-sachin-tendulkar-with-azharuddin-as-captain-in-1997-big-mystery-1553577.html|archive-date=9 November 2014|url-status=live|date=6 November 2014}}</ref> as a captain, winning only 4 Test matches and 23 ODIs. He was replaced as ODI captain by [[Ajay Jadeja]] and then by [[Sourav Ganguly]].\n\nGanguly became the regular captain of the team in both Tests and ODIs in 2000. He remained captain until 2005\u201306 and became the then most successful Indian captain, winning 21 of his 49 Test matches in charge and 76 of his 146 ODIs. Under his captaincy, India became the joint-winners of the [[2002 ICC Champions Trophy]] with Sri Lanka, and the runners-up of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. India lost only three Tests at home under Ganguly and managed to draw Test series in England and Australia. [[Rahul Dravid]] took over as Test captain in 2005. In 2006, he led India to its first Test series victory in the West Indies in more than 30 years.\n\nIn September 2007, [[Mahendra Singh Dhoni]] was named as the new captain of the ODI and [[T20I]] teams, after Dravid stepped down from the post. Soon after taking up the captaincy, Dhoni led the team to the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural World Twenty20]] title. [[Anil Kumble]] was appointed Test captain in November 2007, but retired from international cricket in November 2008 after captaining in 14 Tests. Dhoni succeeded him as the Test captain, making him the captain in all formats. Under the captaincy of Dhoni, the Indian team held the number one position in the [[ICC Test Championship|Test rankings]] for 21 months (from November 2009 to August 2011), and set a national record for most back-to-back ODI wins (nine straight wins).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20090213041951/http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5gOJEqagSwUYDvgJXf2lhE0pHlBjA|url-status=dead|title=The Canadian Press: Sri Lanka denies India 5-0 rout by winning final ...|date=13 February 2009|archivedate=13 February 2009}}</ref> Dhoni also led the team to victory in 2011 Cricket World Cup and [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy]]. Thus, Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies, namely- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. However, the team performed poorly in away Tests from 2011 to 2014 and Dhoni retired from Test cricket in December 2014, with [[Virat Kohli]] being named as the new Test captain. Dhoni resigned as captain of the ODI and T20 teams in January 2017 and Kohli succeeded him at the position.\n\nUnder Kohli's captaincy, India was unbeaten in 19 Test matches, starting from a 3\u20130 series win over New Zealand and ending with a 2\u20131 series win over Australia. India has an unbeaten streak of winning 9 consecutive Test series as of Dec 2017, starting with a 2\u20131 series win over Sri Lanka. India also became only the third team after Australia and South Africa to have won their most recent Test series simultaneously against all the other Test playing nations. As per winning percentage in Test matches, Kohli is India's most successful test captain, having won more than 61% of Test matches (at least 2 games).\n\n==Squad==\nThis lists all the players who have played for India in the past 12 months and the formats in which they have played.

He holds the record of most appearances in both Tests and ODIs, most runs in both Tests and ODIs and most centuries in Tests and ODIs. The highest score by an Indian is the 319 scored by [[Virender Sehwag]] in Chennai. It is the second [[List of Test cricket triple centuries|triple century in Test cricket]] by an Indian, the first being a 309 also made by Sehwag although against Pakistan. The team's highest ever score was a 759/7 against England at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai in 2016, while its lowest was 42 against England in 1974. In ODIs, the team's highest score is 418/5 against West Indies at Indore in 2011\u201312. India score 413\u20135 in a match against [[Bermuda cricket team|Bermuda]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] which is the highest score ever in Cricket World Cup history. In the same match, India set a world record of the highest winning margin in an ODI match of 257 runs.\n\nIndia has also had some very strong bowling figures, with spin bowler Anil Kumble being a member of the elite group of 3 bowlers who have taken 600 Test wickets. In 1999, Anil Kumble emulated [[Jim Laker]] to become the second bowler to take all ten wickets in a Test match innings when he took 10 wickets for 74 runs against Pakistan at the [[Feroz Shah Kotla]] in [[Delhi]].\n\nMany of the Indian cricket team's records are also [[Test cricket records|world records]], for example Sachin Tendulkar's century tally (in Tests and ODIs) and run tally (also in both Tests and ODIs). Mahendra Singh Dhoni's 183 not out against Sri Lanka in 2005 is the world record score by a wicketkeeper in ODIs. The Indian cricket team also holds the record sequence of 17 successful run-chases in ODIs,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://content-www1.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/248029.html|title = Dravid rues faulty execution|work=Cricinfo Staff| accessdate =21 September 2006|date = 21 May 2006}}</ref> which ended in a dramatic match against the West Indies in May 2006, which India lost by just 1 run when Yuvraj Singh was bowled by Dwayne Bravo's full toss.\n\nSachin Tendulkar was the first batsman to score 200 runs (he was unbeaten on 200 from 147 deliveries including 25x4 and 3x6) in a single ODI innings, on 24 February 2010 against South Africa in [[Gwalior]]. On 8 December 2011, this achievement was eclipsed by compatriot Virender Sehwag, who scored 219 runs from 149 deliveries (25x4 | 7x6) versus [[West Indies]] in [[Indore]]. On 13 November 2014 the record was broken by another Indian opening batsmen, [[Rohit Sharma]], who scored 264 runs from 173 deliveries (33x4 | 9x6) against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] in Kolkata. In 2013, MS Dhoni became the first captain in history to win all three major ICC trophies- ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, ICC World Twenty20 in 2007 and ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, Virat Kohli became the first cricketer to win back-to-back man of the series awards in the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] and [[2014 ICC World Twenty20]]. In 2017, Ravichandran Ashwin became the fastest cricketer in history to reach 250 wickets. He and Ravindra Jadeja are considered to be the best bowlers in Test cricket and occupy the top two spots in the rankings for Test bowlers {{as of|2017|May|lc=y}}. Virat Kohli became the first captain in history to score double tons in three consecutive series, against New Zealand, England and Bangladesh in 2017.\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|Indian cricket team records}}\n{{further|India national cricket team record by opponent}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Tests===\n{{main|List of India Test cricket records}}\n'''Test record versus other nations'''\n{{India Test cricket records by opponent}}\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n'''Most Test runs for India'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Cricket Records {{!}} Records {{!}} India {{!}} Test matches {{!}} Most runs|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=1;id=6;type=team|website=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=29 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913072807/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?class=1%3Bid%3D6%3Btype%3Dteam|archive-date=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#bdb76b;\"\n!

In tours between these two nations, cricket visas are often employed to accommodate for the tens of thousands of fans wishing to cross the border to watch cricket. This intense fan dedication is one of the major causes of the [[Board of Control for Cricket in India|BCCI's]] financial success.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050221/sports.htm#1|title = 10,000 Visas for Pak Cricket Fans|work = The Tribune, Chandigarh|accessdate = 21 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903055335/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050221/sports.htm#1|archive-date = 3 September 2006|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are downsides to having such a cricket-loving population. Many Indians hold [[Cricket in India|cricket]] very close to their hearts and losses are not received well by the Indian population. In some cases, particularly after losses to Pakistan or after a long string of weak performances, there have been reports of player [[effigy|effigies]] being burnt in the streets and vandalism of player homes.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2871400/2871497.stm|title = Ganguly's Debt of Gratitude|work = BBC News|accessdate = 21 September 2006|date = 21 March 2003|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090113015842/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/cwc2003/hi/newsid_2870000/newsid_2871400/2871497.stm|archive-date = 13 January 2009|url-status = live}}</ref> In many cases, players have come under intense attention from the media for negative reasons, this has been considered as one of the reasons for Sourav Ganguly being left out of the Indian team. At times, when a match is surrounded by controversy, it has resulted in a debacle. For example, when India slid to defeat against Australia at [[Brabourne Stadium]] in 1969, fans began throwing stones and bottles onto the field as well as setting fire to the stands, before laying siege to the Australian dressing rooms. During the same tour, a stampede occurred at Eden Gardens when tickets were oversold and India fell to another loss; the Australian team bus was later stoned with bricks .<ref name=\"Riots\">{{cite web|url = http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/243910.html|title = I predict a riot|work = Andrew Miller and Martin Williamson|accessdate = 22 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070208133819/http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/243910.html|archive-date = 8 February 2007|url-status = live|date = 11 April 2006}}</ref> A similar event occurred during the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]], where India were losing the semi-final to Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens. In this case, the fan behaviour was directed at the Indian team in disappointment at their lacklustre performance. An armed guard had to be placed at the home of captain [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] to ensure his safety.<ref name=\"Riots\"/> Indian fans have also been passionate in their following of Sachin Tendulkar, who has been commonly thought of as one of the best batsmen in the world. Glorified for the bulk of his career, a riot occurred in early 1999 in a Test against Pakistan at [[Eden Gardens]] after a collision with Pakistani paceman [[Shoaib Akhtar]] saw him run out, forcing police to eject spectators and the game to be played in an empty stadium. Although in 2006, a string of low scores resulted in Tendulkar being booed by the Mumbai crowd when he got out against England<ref name=\"Sachinboo\">{{cite web|url = http://www.indiadaily.org/entry/sachin-tendulkar-booed-by-wankhede-crowd/|title = Sachin Tendulkar booed by Wankhede Crowd|work = India Daily|publisher = India Daily|accessdate = 15 January 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061011174138/http://www.indiadaily.org/entry/sachin-tendulkar-booed-by-wankhede-crowd/|archive-date = 11 October 2006|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nOften, fans engage in protests regarding players if they believe that regionalism has affected selection, or because of regional partisan support for local players. In 2005, when Sourav Ganguly was dropped from the team, Ganguly's home town [[Kolkata]] erupted in protests.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2005/dec/15protest.htm|title = Protests rock Kolkata over Ganguly's exclusion|work = Rediff|accessdate = 14 October 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051218094401/http://in.rediff.com/cricket/2005/dec/15protest.htm|archive-date = 18 December 2005|url-status = live}}</ref> India later played a match against [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] in [[Kolkata]], West Bengal. The Indian team was booed by the crowd who supported South Africa instead of India in response to Ganguly's dropping.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Similar regional divisions in India regarding selection have also caused protests against the team, with political activists from the regional Kalinga Kamgar Sena party in [[Odisha]] disrupting the arrival of the team in [[Cuttack]] for an ODI over the lack of a [[Odisha cricket team|local player]] in the team, with one activist manhandling coach [[Greg Chappell]].<ref>{{cite news|title =Security concerns over Barabati Stadium's future|url =http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/indvwi/content/current/story/277430.html|date =24 January 2007|accessdate =25 January 2007|publisher =[[Cricinfo]]|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070127090954/http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/indvwi/content/current/story/277430.html|archive-date =27 January 2007|url-status =live}}</ref> Similar treatment was handed to [[Sunil Gavaskar]] in the [[1987 Cricket World Cup knockout stage|1987 World Cup Semi Finals]] by crowds at [[Wankhede Stadium]] when he got [[bowled]] by [[Philip DeFreitas]].<ref name=\"Sachinboo\"/>\n\nA successful string of results, victories against arch-rivals Pakistan or victory in major tournaments such as the [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] are greeted with particular ecstasy from the Indian fans.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040402/sports.htm#5|title = The Entire Nation Erupts with Joy|work = The Tribune, Chandigarh|accessdate = 20 September 2006|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060910193235/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040402/sports.htm#5|archive-date = 10 September 2006|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n==India women's national cricket team==\n{{Main|India women's national cricket team}}\n[[File:Snehal Pradhan (10 March 2009, Sydney) 2.jpg|right|240px|thumb|alt=Eight female cricketers stand on a field.

For all national women's cricket teams, the female players are paid much less their male counterparts, and the women's teams do not receive as much popular support or recognition as the men's team. The women's teams also have a less packed schedule compared to men's teams and play fewer matches. The Indian women's cricket team played its first [[Women's Test cricket|Test match]] in 1976, when they drew with the [[West Indian women's cricket team|West Indies]] in a six-match series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/94140.html|work=ESPNcricinfo|author1=Subhin Harika|date=13 June 2017|title=History of Indian women' cricket team|access-date=13 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803215829/http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/94140.html|archive-date=3 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Women's Cricket World Cup]] was held in India in 1978 and featured 4 teams. India lost both the matches they have played. Their next appearance in the Test and ODI circuit was against Australia in 1984, in which the Test series was tied but the [[Women's one-day international cricket|ODI series]] was lost in a whitewash.\n\nThe Indian women's cricket team has since picked up their form, reaching the finals in the World Cup, but then losing to [[Australia national women's cricket team|Australia]]. The Women's Asia Cup of 2005\u201306 was won by India, who beat Sri Lanka in the final. They also beat the West Indies in the 2004\u201305 season, winning the 5 ODI series 5\u20130. They were knocked out in the group stage of the [[2013 Women's Cricket World Cup]] held in India. India reached the final of the [[2017 ICC Women's Cricket World Cup|2017 World Cup]] but lost to England by 9 runs, following which the team was praised by many including Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]].\n\n[[Jhulan Goswami]] is the world's leading ODI wicket-taker while [[Mithali Raj]], the captain, is the leading run-scorer in ODI cricket.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Cricket}}\n\n*[[Cricket in India]]\n*[[Indian Premier League]]\n*[[India A cricket team]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|India national cricket team}}\n*[http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/india/content/ground/country.html?country=6 Cricinfo's List of Indian Grounds]\n*[http://www1.cricinfo.com/db/NATIONAL/IND/ Cricinfo India]\n\n{{India national cricket team}}\n{{International cricket tours of India}}\n{{Navboxes\n|list1 =\n{{Cricket in India}}\n{{ICC Cricket World Cup winners}}\n{{ICC World Twenty20 winners}}\n{{Indians with 100 or more Test caps}}\n{{National cricket teams}}\n{{National sports teams of India}}\n{{Circket Asia Cup Champions}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:India National Cricket Team}}\n[[Category:India in international cricket]]\n[[Category:National cricket teams]]\n[[Category:Laureus World Sports Awards winners]]\n[[Category:Cricket in India]]\n", "name_user": "Ayush678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed Sanju Samson's jersey number", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team"}
