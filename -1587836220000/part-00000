Some of the games follow part of the plot of the films. The characters and related events are described, below, using in-universe tone.\n\n== Background plot ==\nThe first three films featured the concept of a \"terminator\", specifically the titular character, a virtually unstoppable [[cyborg]] assassin who is sent back from the year 2029 by a race of [[artificially intelligent]], computer-controlled machines bent on the extermination of mankind. [[Terminator (character)|The Terminator]]'s mission is to prevent [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]]'s son, [[John Connor]], from forming a resistance against the machines. Rebel [[Kyle Reese]] tries to stop the Terminator. The first film became a pop-culture phenomenon, leading to various [[video game|computer and video games]]. The games are either based directly on the movies or are heavily involved in the film series' expanded universe.\n\n==''The Terminator'' (1984 film) games==\nSeveral video games titled ''The Terminator'' were released, each of them based on the 1984 [[The Terminator|film of the same name]]. By 1988, Danish company Robtek had acquired the license to create games based on the film, but it subsequently went into [[receivership]] before any game could be released.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=March 1989 |title=Pics, Pecs & Pixels |magazine=[[The One (magazine)|The One]] |page=101 |quote=Danish software house cum hardware manufacturer Robtek acquired the licence to interpret Terminator and Terminator II over a year ago, but sadly went into receivership before anything saw the light of day.}}</ref>\n\n===DOS version===\n{{Main|The Terminator (DOS)}}\n''The Terminator'' is a [[DOS]] [[action-adventure game]] based on the first movie.

[[Sunsoft]]'s game, ''[[Journey to Silius]]'', was originally conceived as a game based on the original film. The license expired during production and the final game altered its graphics and created its own storyline.<ref name=JourneytoSilius>{{cite magazine|magazine=Nintendo Power |volume=7|date=July\u2013August 1989|title=Pak Watch - Terminator|page=86}}</ref> An NES game was eventually developed and released in December 1992, it is a side-scrolling platformer developed by [[Radical Entertainment]] and published by [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]] and [[Bethesda Softworks]]. The player plays as Kyle Reese, starting in the future, with a gun and grenades, fighting Terminators. The game consists of platforming and driving stages. The game was criticized for its poor graphics and audio, and for its extreme difficulty due to a lack of continues should the player lose all their lives.\n\n===Sega versions===\n{{anchor|The Terminator (Sega)}}\nThis is a [[video game]] first released in 1992 based on the original 1984 [[The Terminator|film of the same name]]. It was coded by [[Probe Software]] and released by [[Virgin Interactive|Virgin Games]] on all the [[Sega]] [[video game console]]s available at the time; ([[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Sega Master System|Master System]], and [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]]).\n\n''The Terminator'' by Probe Software is an action shooter game for the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]] programmed by [[David Perry (game developer)|David Perry]] and scored by Matt Furniss. The main character, [[Kyle Reese]], traverses through levels that closely parallel the movie's environment. In all levels, the main character has a jump and has various weapons throughout the game. The first level takes place in the future, and the main character has hand grenades, timed bombs, and a machine gun as weapon choices. The later levels take place in modern settings, and the primary weapon is a shotgun only. The final level takes place inside the [[Cyberdyne Systems|Cyberdyne]] factory, where the player battles the [[Terminator (character)|Terminator]] alone. The objective of this level is to lead the Terminator into a compactor which destroys him. Conversions of this same game were also developed by Probe for the [[Sega Master System|Master System]] and [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]].\n\nTo create the character movements in the game, Perry and game producer Neil Young were recorded as they performed the moves. The footage was then digitized in black and white onto an [[Amiga]] computer. With the use of [[Deluxe Paint]], the actors were separated from the backgrounds and colorized before being added into the game.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Rand |first=Paul |date=February 1992 |title=Special Preview: The Terminator |magazine=Computer and Video Games |pages=26\u201327}}</ref>\n\nThe name in text on the scrolling intro, '''\"Hemdale's The Terminator\"''' (only in the Mega Drive/Genesis version) refers to the independent [[Hemdale Film Corporation]], who produced the original movie.

This music is generated in ''[[Q Sound]]''. The objective is identical to the movie, which involves future soldier [[Kyle Reese]] going through the Time Displacement equipment located inside a [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]] base in the year 2029 AD, to go back in time to Los Angeles 1984 to protect [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] from the [[T-800|Terminator]]. It is considered to be the best game based on the original ''The Terminator''.\n\n''[[GameFan]]'' called it a \"great\" action game that made \"good use of the CD with its extra animation, FMV, and great soundtrack.\"<ref name=GF-CD/> ''[[Game Players]]'' rated the game 62 percent and called it an average platform game, but praised the soundtrack and digitized cut scenes.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Terminator (Sega CD) |url=https://archive.org/details/Game_Players_Issue_40_May_1994/n125 |website=Game Players |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |page=124 |date=May 1994}}</ref>\n\nShawn Sackenheim of [[AllGame]] gave the Sega CD version four stars out of five and wrote, \"The graphics always stay pretty bleak, this time from design and not from the system's limitations. Even in the neon lit dance club, TechNoir, the backgrounds remain dark, lit only by the bars of neon lights around the level. [...]. The dark and dreary graphics actually lend themselves nicely to the mood of the game.\" Sackenheim also praised Tallarico's score, saying that it added \"a ton to the impact of the graphics and the mood of each level.\" Sackenheim concluded, \"While it may not have been the best looking action/platformer around, it could definitely give any other game a run for its money.\"<ref name=CD>{{cite web |url= http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1446&tab=review|title= The Terminator (Sega CD) Review|last= Sackenheim|first= Shawn|website= [[AllGame]]|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141115075249/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1446&tab=review|archive-date=November 15, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===SNES version===\n{{anchor|The Terminator (SNES)}}\nThe SNES version is a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Shooter game|shooter]] developed by [[Gray Matter (company)|Gray Matter]] and published by [[Mindscape (company)|Mindscape]] in 1993 for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. The player plays as Kyle Reese trying to stop the Terminator from killing Sarah Connor. The main levels are side-scrolling shooters, the two sub-levels are pseudo-driving levels, where the player has to shoot the Terminator to stop him from shooting back. The game is very difficult, due to the length of the levels and the fact that the player gets no continues if they lose all lives. There is minimal music in the game, as the sound effects tend to be much louder.\n\nReviewers for ''[[GameFan]]'' were critical of the game but praised its driving levels.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Terminator (SNES) |url=https://archive.org/details/Gamefan_Vol_1_Issue_05/page/n14 |website=GameFan |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |pages=15, 48 |date=April 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile game===\n{{anchor|The Terminator (mobile game)}}\nA [[shoot 'em up]] developed by In-Fusio and [[Cybiko]].

Level 2 is an isometric racing game, whereupon the player must race fast enough to catch John Conner on his [[moped]] whilst using weapons to beat back the [[T-1000]], who is fast approaching in a tractor trailer. All the other levels are side-scrolling platform, shooters/beat 'em ups. Level 2 is omitted from the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] versions. From Level 3 onward, the player is not allowed to kill human enemies, to which he will be rewarded with upgraded weaponry at the end of levels for doing so. Level 4 requires the player to visit all ends of the gamescreen in order to collect and set explosive charges. Levels 5 has the player doing some platforming, before finally taking on the T-1000 in the final battle.\n\nPaul Rand of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' rated the NES version 84 percent,<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Rand |first=Paul |date=February 1992 |title=Special Preview: Terminator 2: Judgment Day |magazine=Computer and Video Games |page=28}}</ref> and ''[[Total!]]'' rated it 74 percent.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=March 1992 |title=Terminator 2 |magazine=Total |pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\n===''T2: Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' (Game Boy)===\nThe [[Game Boy]] version is an [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Bits Studios]] and published by [[LJN]].

A follow-up to this game is [[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (pinball)|''Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines'']], featuring a very similar playfield design and rulesheet.\n\n===''T2: Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' (16-bit version)===\nAn [[action-adventure game]] developed by [[Bits Studios]] for the [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. Both versions were released in 1993; the Genesis version was published by [[Flying Edge]], while the Super NES version was published by [[LJN]]. \nIt is based on the [[Terminator 2: Judgment Day|film of the same name]].<ref name=Genesis/><ref name=SNES/>\n\nOne plays as the T-800 sent back in time to 1995, in order to protect John and Sarah Connor from the [[T-1000]]. There are two gameplay types: side-scrolling and driving. During the side-scrolling levels, the player's objective is to locate and retrieve all future objects, which are gray boxes with a flashing light on top, that, when broken open, look like endoskulls. The player must complete all objectives for that mission. Once all objectives are completed, the player goes back to the beginning of the level to finish the mission. Between the side-scrolling levels are the driving levels. During the driving levels, the player's objective is to drive to the next mission location by following compass directions, while avoiding pursuers.\n\nIn the side-scrolling levels, the T-800 has 100% health to begin with, but gets 50% health from the secondary power supply if its health drops to 0%. If the secondary power supply drops to 0%, the T-800 dies and the game ends. In the driving levels, the T-800 has 100% vehicular health, but the game ends if the health reaches 0%.\n\nStarting with Level 3, the T-1000 will appear (or Level 2 if the alarm is tripped or too much time is spent there). The T-1000 attacks using a pistol and arms morphed into stabbing weapons. The T-1000 will mold back into shape if shot, but it will be temporarily incapacitated if it suffers enough damage. The T-1000 does not appear in level 6.\n\nThe T-800 must also protect John Connor starting with Level 3, and Sarah Connor starting with Level 4.  If either one loses all of their health, they will start dying, and the T-800 must heal them by ducking down over them and transferring some of its health to them. If they are left alone for too long, they die, and the game ends. However, Sarah Connor wields a pistol for extra defense. Neither one appears in levels 5 or 6.\n\nBoth versions have different musical instrumentation, different sound effects, and some minor graphical and control differences, but are otherwise identical.\n\nRoss Chamberlain of ''[[Electronic Games]]'' rated the SNES version 86 percent.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chamberlain |first=Ross |date=September 1993 |title=T2: Judgment Day |magazine=Electronic Games |page=62}}</ref> Brett Alan Weiss of [[AllGame]] gave the Super NES version one and a half stars and said the game was on his list of least favorite 16-bit film-based games. Weiss said, \"Although it's pretty easy to figure out given a little time, it's not always readily apparent exactly where you're supposed to go or in what order you must do things within each level. Another thing I can say about this game that doesn't sound completely incendiary is that it does a reasonably good job of following the storyline. Oh, and the music's not too bad, either. It can get a little repetitive, and it may grate on some people's nerves after a while, but it rocks pretty hard, as music in a game of this type should.\" Weiss also said, \"Large areas of blank space (such as the blue backgrounds on level one and the brown walls in level four) hurt this game's visual appeal tremendously, and it's not that great looking to begin with.\"<ref name=SNES>{{cite web |url= http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12343&tab=review|title= T2: Judgment Day (Super NES) Review|last= Weiss|first= Brett Alan|website= AllGame|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141117000339/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12343&tab=review|archive-date=November 17, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nWeiss gave the Genesis version one star out of five and wrote, \"T2: Judgment Day for the Genesis is a truly wretched gaming experience. [...]. It does follow the storyline reasonably well, and you may be interested in playing the game through once, just to see what there is to see, but you won't have a good time doing it. [...]. The graphics are barren in many places and ugly in most others. The sound effects are limp, and the music is in-your-face annoying. The controls are awful. The punching and kicking in this game is less convincing than that of most bad 8-bit games.\" Weiss said the Super NES version \"is superior in every way.

Black is the \"machines\" side: grey-colored robots with metal skeletons, without the [[T-1000]]. The pieces are not taken on the chess board but in futuristic battlefield settings resembling the scenes of the man-machine war from the movie.\n\nThe player can choose from several game types and difficulty settings. The game rates the player in accordance with the [[United States Chess Federation]] scale.\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in 1994 that ''Chess Wars'' was one of \"a host of imitations and look-alikes\" of ''[[Battle Chess]]''. The magazine reported that it crashed so often that the [[chess engine]] could not be evaluated because no game was completed, the [[SVGA graphics]] were \"unimpressive\", transitioning between the board and battles was \"painfully slow\" and the pieces were poorly animated, and falsely claimed to have 4500 [[chess opening]]s when it lacked an [[chess opening book (computers)|opening library]].

If the secondary power supply drops to 0%, the T-800 dies and the game ends. In the driving levels, the T-800 has 100% vehicular health, but the game ends if the health reaches 0%.\n\nStarting with Level 3, the T-1000 will appear (or Level 2 if the alarm is tripped or too much time is spent there). The T-1000 attacks using a pistol and arms morphed into stabbing weapons. The T-1000 will mold back into shape if shot, but it will be temporarily incapacitated if it suffers enough damage. The T-1000 does not appear in level 6.\n\nThe T-800 must also protect John Connor starting with Level 3, and Sarah Connor starting with Level 4.  If either one loses all of their health, they will start dying, and the T-800 must heal them by ducking down over them and transferring some of its health to them. If they are left alone for too long, they die, and the game ends. However, Sarah Connor wields a pistol for extra defense. Neither one appears in levels 5 or 6.\n\nBoth versions have different musical instrumentation, different sound effects, and some minor graphical and control differences, but are otherwise identical.\n\nRoss Chamberlain of ''[[Electronic Games]]'' rated the SNES version 86 percent.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chamberlain |first=Ross |date=September 1993 |title=T2: Judgment Day |magazine=Electronic Games |page=62}}</ref> Brett Alan Weiss of [[AllGame]] gave the Super NES version one and a half stars and said the game was on his list of least favorite 16-bit film-based games. Weiss said, \"Although it's pretty easy to figure out given a little time, it's not always readily apparent exactly where you're supposed to go or in what order you must do things within each level. Another thing I can say about this game that doesn't sound completely incendiary is that it does a reasonably good job of following the storyline. Oh, and the music's not too bad, either. It can get a little repetitive, and it may grate on some people's nerves after a while, but it rocks pretty hard, as music in a game of this type should.\" Weiss also said, \"Large areas of blank space (such as the blue backgrounds on level one and the brown walls in level four) hurt this game's visual appeal tremendously, and it's not that great looking to begin with.\"<ref name=SNES>{{cite web |url= http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12343&tab=review|title= T2: Judgment Day (Super NES) Review|last= Weiss|first= Brett Alan|website= AllGame|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141117000339/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12343&tab=review|archive-date=November 17, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nWeiss gave the Genesis version one star out of five and wrote, \"T2: Judgment Day for the Genesis is a truly wretched gaming experience.

The graphics are barren in many places and ugly in most others. The sound effects are limp, and the music is in-your-face annoying. The controls are awful. The punching and kicking in this game is less convincing than that of most bad 8-bit games.\" Weiss said the Super NES version \"is superior in every way.

The pieces are not taken on the chess board but in futuristic battlefield settings resembling the scenes of the man-machine war from the movie.\n\nThe player can choose from several game types and difficulty settings. The game rates the player in accordance with the [[United States Chess Federation]] scale.\n\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated in 1994 that ''Chess Wars'' was one of \"a host of imitations and look-alikes\" of ''[[Battle Chess]]''. The magazine reported that it crashed so often that the [[chess engine]] could not be evaluated because no game was completed, the [[SVGA graphics]] were \"unimpressive\", transitioning between the board and battles was \"painfully slow\" and the pieces were poorly animated, and falsely claimed to have 4500 [[chess opening]]s when it lacked an [[chess opening book (computers)|opening library]].

At lower realism settings, the F-4 has an internal cannon in addition to the missiles - in contrast to real USN F-4's that were armed only with missiles. A wide range of mission types is available, from simple bomb runs or [[combat air patrol]]s to [[SEAD]] missions requiring close cooperation between the callsigns involved.

The first championship was held in [[1927 World Snooker Championship|1927]] and was won by [[Joe Davis]]. Davis won the first 15 championships before retiring from the event, undefeated, after his [[1946 World Snooker Championship|1946]] success. In the 1950s snooker went into a period of decline and the championship was not held after 1952, although an unofficial championship was held until 1957. In 1964 the championship was revived on a challenge basis and in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]] the championship became a knock-out event again. Since [[1977 World Snooker Championship|1977]] it has been played at the [[Crucible Theatre]] in [[Sheffield]], [[England]]. The tournament is currently played over 17 days and ends on the first Monday in May. In the modern era (since 1969), the best record is that of [[Stephen Hendry]], who won the title seven times. [[Steve Davis]] and [[Ray Reardon]] both won six times while [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won five titles. The current champion is [[Judd Trump]], whose 2019 win was his first.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Professional Snooker Championship (1927\u20131934)===\n{{anchor|Professional Snooker Championship}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, dead frames were played out, whatever the state of the game.

Ronnie O'Sullivan, the second seed, lost to Ali Carter, while Ding Junhui only made it to the quarter-finals before losing to Barry Hawkins. The final was between two of the \"class of '92\", [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[John Higgins]]. Their rivalry dated back to the late 1990s, although only three of their meetings had been in the World Championships - all in semi-finals, in 1999, 2000 (both won by Williams 17\u201315) and 2011 (won by Higgins 17\u201314). The match was closely contested, Williams coming out on top by 18\u201316 to win the World Championship for the first time since 2003, setting a new record for the longest gap between consecutive World Championship victories. He won \u00a3425,000.  Higgins reached the final again in 2019, only to be beaten 18-9 by [[Judd Trump]]. His prize was a record breaking \u00a3500,000. Trump also bettered O'Sullivan's six centuries in the 2013 final \u2013 making seven \u2013 which was also a record.\n\n== Format ==\nThe format for the World Championship has been largely unchanged since [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. It has a knock-out format with 32 players, contested over 17 days ending on the first Monday in May, which is a [[May Day#United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]]. Before 1982 there were a number of different formats used for the Championship. In 1980 and 1981, 24 players played in the final stages at the Crucible. The top eight seeds had a bye in the first round while seeds 9 to 16 played in the first round against eight qualifiers. From 1977 to 1979, the first three years at the Crucible, only 16 players reached the final stages, eight seeds playing eight qualifiers in the first round. Before 1980, the final was not always played over a set number of frames- for example, in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]] [[Ray Reardon]] beat [[Perrie Mans]] in a best-of-49 frames match 25\u201318 and, [[1979 World Snooker Championship|the following year]], [[Terry Griffiths]] defeated [[Dennis Taylor]] 24\u201316 in a best-of-47.\n\n16 of the players reach the final stages directly while the other 16 get there through a qualifying competition. The reigning world champion receives a direct entry and is the number one seed (the World Champion is usually seeded 2nd for all ranking tournaments, and The Masters, for the following season, except for the World Championship where is seeded 1st). The remaining direct entries are based on the latest [[Snooker world rankings|world rankings]], players being seeded based on these world rankings. Since the defending champion is normally ranked in the top 16, the top 16 ranked players generally receive a direct entry.\n\nThe first round is played over 19 frames, played in two sessions. The second round and quarter-finals are the best of 25 frames played over three sessions while the semi-finals and final are played over four sessions, the semi-finals being over 33 frames and the final 35 frames. For the first 12 days of the tournament two matches are played concurrently. For the last five days (the semi-finals and final) only one table is used.\n\nPrior to 1997 the semi-finals were played over 31 frames. Occasionally the dates of the Championship are changed. In 1982 the Championship ended on Sunday 16 May while in 1985, 1990 and 1995 it ended on the last Sunday in April. In each of these years the tournament started on a Friday but, as of 2019, this has not happened since.\n\nSeveral changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship. All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds. The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible, but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds. Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages. The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players, with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Snooker: Stephen Hendry and other champions could return|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=23 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425181726/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Winners ==\n{{Main|List of world snooker champions}}\n\n===Top performers of the modern era===\nThe 'modern' era is considered to start in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]], when the championship reverted to a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out tournament]] format from a challenge format.

The tournament is currently played over 17 days and ends on the first Monday in May. In the modern era (since 1969), the best record is that of [[Stephen Hendry]], who won the title seven times. [[Steve Davis]] and [[Ray Reardon]] both won six times while [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] has won five titles. The current champion is [[Judd Trump]], whose 2019 win was his first.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Professional Snooker Championship (1927\u20131934)===\n{{anchor|Professional Snooker Championship}}\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Previously the draw had been made early in the season and the players made their own arrangements about the dates and venue of matches. The change in format proved a great success and [[Thurston's Hall]] became the primary venue for professional snooker matches. In the period from 1935 to 1940, nearly all World Championship matches were played there and with good attendances the professionals could make some money from their share of the entrance charges. Because of the importance of gate receipts, dead frames were played out, whatever the state of the game.

Ronnie O'Sullivan, the second seed, lost to Ali Carter, while Ding Junhui only made it to the quarter-finals before losing to Barry Hawkins. The final was between two of the \"class of '92\", [[Mark Williams (snooker player)|Mark Williams]] and [[John Higgins]]. Their rivalry dated back to the late 1990s, although only three of their meetings had been in the World Championships - all in semi-finals, in 1999, 2000 (both won by Williams 17\u201315) and 2011 (won by Higgins 17\u201314). The match was closely contested, Williams coming out on top by 18\u201316 to win the World Championship for the first time since 2003, setting a new record for the longest gap between consecutive World Championship victories. He won \u00a3425,000.  Higgins reached the final again in 2019, only to be beaten 18-9 by [[Judd Trump]]. His prize was a record breaking \u00a3500,000. Trump also bettered O'Sullivan's six centuries in the 2013 final \u2013 making seven \u2013 which was also a record.\n\n== Format ==\nThe format for the World Championship has been largely unchanged since [[1982 World Snooker Championship|1982]]. It has a knock-out format with 32 players, contested over 17 days ending on the first Monday in May, which is a [[May Day#United Kingdom|public holiday in the United Kingdom]]. Before 1982 there were a number of different formats used for the Championship. In 1980 and 1981, 24 players played in the final stages at the Crucible. The top eight seeds had a bye in the first round while seeds 9 to 16 played in the first round against eight qualifiers. From 1977 to 1979, the first three years at the Crucible, only 16 players reached the final stages, eight seeds playing eight qualifiers in the first round. Before 1980, the final was not always played over a set number of frames- for example, in [[1978 World Snooker Championship|1978]] [[Ray Reardon]] beat [[Perrie Mans]] in a best-of-49 frames match 25\u201318 and, [[1979 World Snooker Championship|the following year]], [[Terry Griffiths]] defeated [[Dennis Taylor]] 24\u201316 in a best-of-47.\n\n16 of the players reach the final stages directly while the other 16 get there through a qualifying competition. The reigning world champion receives a direct entry and is the number one seed (the World Champion is usually seeded 2nd for all ranking tournaments, and The Masters, for the following season, except for the World Championship where is seeded 1st). The remaining direct entries are based on the latest [[Snooker world rankings|world rankings]], players being seeded based on these world rankings. Since the defending champion is normally ranked in the top 16, the top 16 ranked players generally receive a direct entry.\n\nThe first round is played over 19 frames, played in two sessions. The second round and quarter-finals are the best of 25 frames played over three sessions while the semi-finals and final are played over four sessions, the semi-finals being over 33 frames and the final 35 frames. For the first 12 days of the tournament two matches are played concurrently. For the last five days (the semi-finals and final) only one table is used.\n\nPrior to 1997 the semi-finals were played over 31 frames. Occasionally the dates of the Championship are changed. In 1982 the Championship ended on Sunday 16 May while in 1985, 1990 and 1995 it ended on the last Sunday in April. In each of these years the tournament started on a Friday but, as of 2019, this has not happened since.\n\nSeveral changes to the qualifying system came into effect for the 2015 championship. All living world champions would be extended an opportunity to play in the qualifying rounds. The top 16 seeds would still qualify automatically for the first round at the Crucible, but all non-seeded players would have to start in the first of three qualifying rounds. Previously players seeded 17 to 32 only had to win one qualifying match to reach the final stages. The overall championship would increase from 128 to 144 players, with the additional places made available to former world champions and players from emerging countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Snooker: Stephen Hendry and other champions could return|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=24 April 2014|date=23 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425181726/http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/snooker/27130513|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Winners ==\n{{Main|List of world snooker champions}}\n\n===Top performers of the modern era===\nThe 'modern' era is considered to start in [[1969 World Snooker Championship|1969]], when the championship reverted to a [[Single-elimination tournament|knock-out tournament]] format from a challenge format.

A [[PlayStation 2]] port was in development, but was cancelled early in production.<ref name=\"PS2IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://ie.ign.com/games/dark-earth/ps2-692339|website= [[IGN]]|title= Dark Earth (PlayStation 2)|accessdate = August 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PS2Spy\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/dark-earth/|publisher= [[GameSpy]]|title= Dark Earth (PlayStation 2)|accessdate = October 19, 2013}}</ref> It was a commercial hit, with sales of 500,000 units by 1999.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Dark Earth gameplay.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Combat in ''Dark Earth''.]]\n''Dark Earth'' is a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person]] game centered around item-collection and weapon-based melee combat. The game world is filled with a variety of different weapons which can be used until broken, requiring a constant need to expand the main character Arkhan's weapon collection. The vast majority of the weapons are [[waste picker|scavenged]] or improvised, such as kitchen knives and [[shiv (weapon)|shivs]]. There are a very limited number of [[gun]]s in ''Dark Earth'', as most people have forgotten about firearms. For the select few guns Arkhan finds, there is an equally limited amount of ammo, making guns good for only a limited time. Arkhan must also scavenge for food, as it is his only means of healing.\n\nAs time progresses in Arkhan's quest, he slowly begins to transform into a creature of darkness. His physical appearance, the tone of his voice, and his dialog choices change throughout the course of the game. There is also an option for Arkhan to react to situations with his 'dark side' (i.e. he'll say rude things in dialog or treat his environment more aggressively while searching).\n\nThe environments of the game are all [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]], with [[3D computer graphics|3D]] modeled characters moving atop them (much like ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''). This method, while allowing for more detailed environments, prevents any camera control. All locations have fixed-camera views, which can create difficulty in some fight situations in small areas.\n\n==Story==\n===Background===\n''Dark Earth'' takes place several centuries in the future, when a [[Meteoroid#Meteor|meteor]] collision with Earth (referred to as the \"Great Cataclysm\") has thrown up great clouds of ash and dust, blocking out the light of the sun. Those not killed in the collision were soon hunted by strange creatures of darkness, and so they began to seek a refuge from the \"Dark Earth\" - pockets of land where the light of the sun breached the clouds. Eventually they found such places. Called \"Stallites\", these places of light became cities, and the survivors built temples in honor of the light. The game is set in a Stallite called Sparta.\n\nBy the time of the game, many centuries after the establishment of Sparta, most of the citizens have forgotten their history and now worship the light as a god, Solaar. The city is run by Sunseers, priests of Solaar, who maintain order and prevent the creatures of darkness from entering the city limits. The game focuses on Arkhan, a \"Guardian of Fire\", one of the military protectors of the city.\n\n===Plot===\nThe game begins with Arkhan awakening from a nightmare in which he has a vision of the Great Cataclysm and sees it foretold that a great darkness will threaten Sparta, which he must fight against. He then goes to see the head of the Guardians of Fire, Provost Dhorkan, who orders him to guard the council chamber door at the Temple of Solaar, while the High Sunseer Lory is holding a meeting. On his way to the Temple, Arkhan overhears his father Rylsadhar, also a Sunseer, telling Lory that he fears a great danger is about to engulf Sparta. He gives Lory something, telling her he doesn't feel safe carrying it himself. Arkhan takes his post, but hears a commotion from within the council room. He bursts in to find the Sunseers under attack by two men, one of whom he kills. The other is about to attack Lory, but Arkhan intervenes, and the man throws something in his face and flees. Lory examines Arkhan and sees that he has been contaminated by \"Shankr Archessence.\"\n\nArkhan awakens some time later, and is horrified to discover that he has begun to turn into a creature of darkness. A healer, Thanandar, tells him that he is infected with darkness and the only way to save him is a \"secret energy from the dawn of time.\" Thanandar says that Rylsadhar is one of the few people in Sparta who knows where it is located. Arkhan goes to see Rylsadhar, who tells him he is forbidden to bring him to the secret and must break his vows as a Sunseer to do so, but only after getting approval from Dhorkan. Arkhan then sees Kalhi, his wife, who is horrified at what has happened to him and tells him that Dhorkan has taken control of the city, declared [[martial law]], locked the gates, and sent the Guardians of Fire out to search for more attackers.\n\nArkhan heads to meet his father, but Rylsadhar doesn't arrive, so Arkhan sets out to look for him. He learns that Lory has gone into hiding and that his best friend, and fellow Guardian, Zed, is leading the hunt for more \"heretics\" in the Lower City. Arkhan then learns that Rylsadhar has disappeared, and the Guardians of Fire have arrested Kalhi. He breaks her out of jail and they head to the Lower City to see their friend, the scavenger Danrys, who tells them that they need to speak to a man named Armal Sadak, the chief scavenger. Sadak tells Arkham that the people who attacked the Sunseers are a group of thugs known as the Konkalites who live in the sewers. However, they did so on the orders of someone else, although Sadak doesn't know who. He also recommends that Arkhan find Leona, a [[hermit]] who lives outside Sparta in the Dark Earth.\n\nWhilst Kalhi remains with Danrys, Arkhan heads into the sewers and discovers that the Konkalites' leader, Sordos, is planning to take over the Upper City. Arkhan also learns that Sordos and Dhorkan are working together. However, Dhorkan is not the one behind the attack on the Sunseers. Sordos is in league with another Sunseer, who is behind everything. Arkhan then finds Sordos in conversation with Thanandar, who reveals he is holding Rylsadhar prisoner. Arkhan kills them both and enters the cells, finding Zed. Zed tells Arkhan that Thanandar is behind everything and seeks to find the ancient secret to destroy it and banish the light from Sparta forever. Zed then turns into a creature of darkness, and Arkhan is forced to kill him.\n\nArkhan returns to the Upper City to confront Dhorkan, but he flees through a secret passage in his office. Arkhan pursues him down to the Lower City, where he encounters the resurrected Thanandar. He reveals that Rylsadhar drank the Archessence that fills Thanandar's soul, and now Rylsadhar has become Thanandar's servant. Thanandar sends Rylsadhar to destroy the Well of Light at the heart of the city. Rylsadhar does so, but dies in the process. Arkhan then meets Lory, who tells him that with the destruction of the Well of Light, the walls of the city no longer protect it from the creatures of darkness. She also tells him that the city has only one chance for salvation; Rylsadhar spent many years researching the origins of the light in the Well of Light. If Arkhan can continue Rylsadhar's research, he may find a way to save the city; beneath the city is a source of unlimited light, but it is dormant and needs to be activated - this is what Rylsadhar was researching. Lory gives Arkhan part of the key to Rylsadhar's vault (the item Rylsadhar gave to Lory earlier on) and urges him to find a way to access the light energy.\n\nArkhan then sets about finding the rest of the key. He finds the first part with the city's Master Builder, Bandor, who tells him the other parts of the key are with Zed, and Leona. Arkhan finds and defeats Dhorkan, and then discovers a secret bunker from the time of the Great Cataclysm, containing hibernation pods and video files detailing how people tried to survive in the bunker after the meteor collision. He then meets a thief who is holding Zed's part of the key. Arkhan kills him and takes the key. As he moves around the city, Arkhan notes that everywhere, people are beginning to turn into creatures of darkness. He heads down into the sewers and finds Dhorkan dying in the Konkalite's prison. Dhorkan regrets his actions, realizing that he had been used by Sordos and Thanandar. He advises Arkhan not to face Thananadar, and that the poison thrown in Arkhan's face was actually Thanandar's blood. He dies, and Arkhan then discovers a secret underwater passage to outside of the city.\n\nHe soon encounters Leona. Telling her that the Well of Light has been destroyed, that Rylsadhar is dead and that Thanandar is no longer human, Leona is shocked to hear of what has happened. She reveals that the secret of the Well of Light was known only to a few, known as Initiates, and that knowledge of it goes back to the dawn of time, millennia before the Great Cataclysm. The Well contains the Force of Light, and Rylsadhar was trying to find its source in a tomb deep below the city. Leona reveals that if the source can be found, the Force of Light will destroy the Force of Darkness in Thanandar, who, like Lory, Rylsadhar, Zed and Leona was an Initiate. She then gives him the final part of the key to Rylsadhar's vault. Arkhan heads back to the city, finding dead Guardians everywhere. A dying Guardian reveals that the creatures of darkness have entered Sparta.\n\nArkhan enters Rylsadhar's vault and finds research on how to gain access to the Runka Tomb, the source of the Well of Light. Rylsadhar had discovered how to enter the tomb, but had been unable to find the door. However, using an explosive substance found in the bunker, Akhan is able to find the door, which was hidden in the center of the city. Now almost completely transformed into a creature of darkness, he enters the tomb. Navigating a series of traps, he reaches the center of the tomb, but realizes he has been followed by Thanandar, now transformed into a monster of darkness. Thanandar attempts to destroy the source of Light, but Arkhan blocks him. They fight, and Arkhan is able to defeat and destroy Thanandar.

Although he was critical of the fixed camera angles and the combat system, he wrote that \"''Dark Earth'' features superb graphics, outstanding 3D character animation, and unique action-adventuring in one beautifully crafted package. Adventurers longing for a deep and rich story, with carefully crafted characters, coupled with swashbuckling fighting action and challenging puzzles and problem solving, look no further.\" They were especially impressed with the graphics, which they called \"stunningly gorgeous. The shimmering colors, including translucent stained glass, are breathtaking. Each of the 100, fully 3D animated characters looks unique. As Arkhan and the other characters move, they change size to match the perspective, and the dynamic lighting sources throw properly proportioned shadows.\"<ref name=\"GSpot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-earth-review/1900-2538497/|website=[[GameSpot]] |title=Dark Earth Review|last= Sengstack|first=Jeff|date=November 6, 1997|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[PC Zone]]''{{'}}s Chris Anderson was also impressed, scoring it 82 out of 100, and praising the storyline; \"''Dark Earth'' is more of an interactive cinematic experience than a fully-fledged adventure game. This is no bad thing. The storyline is very convincing and unfolds seamlessly, with cut-scenes popping up at appropriate points in the proceedings to help everything along [...] the rich storyline alone will be enough to keep most people happy, and with the added diversions of hand-to-hand fisticuffs and puzzle-solving elements, ''Dark Earth'' offers a well-rounded gameplay experience that should appeal to many gamers who wouldn't normally be attracted to the adventure genre.\"<ref name=\"Zone\" />\n\n[[Game Revolution]]'s Thomas Garcia scored the game B+. He also criticized the fixed camera angles during combat, but praised the graphics and controls, writing \"''Dark Earth'' is a great game and worth checking out. Its system requirements are quite low; that's an added plus for people with slow systems, and it is certainly not at the sacrifice of otherwise very high-quality graphics and sounds.

A [[PlayStation 2]] port was in development, but was cancelled early in production.<ref name=\"PS2IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://ie.ign.com/games/dark-earth/ps2-692339|website= [[IGN]]|title= Dark Earth (PlayStation 2)|accessdate = August 3, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"PS2Spy\">{{cite web|url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/dark-earth/|publisher= [[GameSpy]]|title= Dark Earth (PlayStation 2)|accessdate = October 19, 2013}}</ref> It was a commercial hit, with sales of 500,000 units by 1999.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Dark Earth gameplay.jpg|thumb|230px|left|Combat in ''Dark Earth''.]]\n''Dark Earth'' is a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person]] game centered around item-collection and weapon-based melee combat. The game world is filled with a variety of different weapons which can be used until broken, requiring a constant need to expand the main character Arkhan's weapon collection. The vast majority of the weapons are [[waste picker|scavenged]] or improvised, such as kitchen knives and [[shiv (weapon)|shivs]]. There are a very limited number of [[gun]]s in ''Dark Earth'', as most people have forgotten about firearms. For the select few guns Arkhan finds, there is an equally limited amount of ammo, making guns good for only a limited time. Arkhan must also scavenge for food, as it is his only means of healing.\n\nAs time progresses in Arkhan's quest, he slowly begins to transform into a creature of darkness. His physical appearance, the tone of his voice, and his dialog choices change throughout the course of the game. There is also an option for Arkhan to react to situations with his 'dark side' (i.e. he'll say rude things in dialog or treat his environment more aggressively while searching).\n\nThe environments of the game are all [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]], with [[3D computer graphics|3D]] modeled characters moving atop them (much like ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]''). This method, while allowing for more detailed environments, prevents any camera control. All locations have fixed-camera views, which can create difficulty in some fight situations in small areas.\n\n==Story==\n===Background===\n''Dark Earth'' takes place several centuries in the future, when a [[Meteoroid#Meteor|meteor]] collision with Earth (referred to as the \"Great Cataclysm\") has thrown up great clouds of ash and dust, blocking out the light of the sun. Those not killed in the collision were soon hunted by strange creatures of darkness, and so they began to seek a refuge from the \"Dark Earth\" - pockets of land where the light of the sun breached the clouds. Eventually they found such places. Called \"Stallites\", these places of light became cities, and the survivors built temples in honor of the light. The game is set in a Stallite called Sparta.\n\nBy the time of the game, many centuries after the establishment of Sparta, most of the citizens have forgotten their history and now worship the light as a god, Solaar. The city is run by Sunseers, priests of Solaar, who maintain order and prevent the creatures of darkness from entering the city limits. The game focuses on Arkhan, a \"Guardian of Fire\", one of the military protectors of the city.\n\n===Plot===\nThe game begins with Arkhan awakening from a nightmare in which he has a vision of the Great Cataclysm and sees it foretold that a great darkness will threaten Sparta, which he must fight against. He then goes to see the head of the Guardians of Fire, Provost Dhorkan, who orders him to guard the council chamber door at the Temple of Solaar, while the High Sunseer Lory is holding a meeting. On his way to the Temple, Arkhan overhears his father Rylsadhar, also a Sunseer, telling Lory that he fears a great danger is about to engulf Sparta. He gives Lory something, telling her he doesn't feel safe carrying it himself. Arkhan takes his post, but hears a commotion from within the council room. He bursts in to find the Sunseers under attack by two men, one of whom he kills. The other is about to attack Lory, but Arkhan intervenes, and the man throws something in his face and flees. Lory examines Arkhan and sees that he has been contaminated by \"Shankr Archessence.\"\n\nArkhan awakens some time later, and is horrified to discover that he has begun to turn into a creature of darkness. A healer, Thanandar, tells him that he is infected with darkness and the only way to save him is a \"secret energy from the dawn of time.\" Thanandar says that Rylsadhar is one of the few people in Sparta who knows where it is located. Arkhan goes to see Rylsadhar, who tells him he is forbidden to bring him to the secret and must break his vows as a Sunseer to do so, but only after getting approval from Dhorkan. Arkhan then sees Kalhi, his wife, who is horrified at what has happened to him and tells him that Dhorkan has taken control of the city, declared [[martial law]], locked the gates, and sent the Guardians of Fire out to search for more attackers.\n\nArkhan heads to meet his father, but Rylsadhar doesn't arrive, so Arkhan sets out to look for him. He learns that Lory has gone into hiding and that his best friend, and fellow Guardian, Zed, is leading the hunt for more \"heretics\" in the Lower City. Arkhan then learns that Rylsadhar has disappeared, and the Guardians of Fire have arrested Kalhi. He breaks her out of jail and they head to the Lower City to see their friend, the scavenger Danrys, who tells them that they need to speak to a man named Armal Sadak, the chief scavenger. Sadak tells Arkham that the people who attacked the Sunseers are a group of thugs known as the Konkalites who live in the sewers. However, they did so on the orders of someone else, although Sadak doesn't know who. He also recommends that Arkhan find Leona, a [[hermit]] who lives outside Sparta in the Dark Earth.\n\nWhilst Kalhi remains with Danrys, Arkhan heads into the sewers and discovers that the Konkalites' leader, Sordos, is planning to take over the Upper City. Arkhan also learns that Sordos and Dhorkan are working together. However, Dhorkan is not the one behind the attack on the Sunseers. Sordos is in league with another Sunseer, who is behind everything. Arkhan then finds Sordos in conversation with Thanandar, who reveals he is holding Rylsadhar prisoner. Arkhan kills them both and enters the cells, finding Zed. Zed tells Arkhan that Thanandar is behind everything and seeks to find the ancient secret to destroy it and banish the light from Sparta forever. Zed then turns into a creature of darkness, and Arkhan is forced to kill him.\n\nArkhan returns to the Upper City to confront Dhorkan, but he flees through a secret passage in his office. Arkhan pursues him down to the Lower City, where he encounters the resurrected Thanandar. He reveals that Rylsadhar drank the Archessence that fills Thanandar's soul, and now Rylsadhar has become Thanandar's servant. Thanandar sends Rylsadhar to destroy the Well of Light at the heart of the city. Rylsadhar does so, but dies in the process. Arkhan then meets Lory, who tells him that with the destruction of the Well of Light, the walls of the city no longer protect it from the creatures of darkness. She also tells him that the city has only one chance for salvation; Rylsadhar spent many years researching the origins of the light in the Well of Light. If Arkhan can continue Rylsadhar's research, he may find a way to save the city; beneath the city is a source of unlimited light, but it is dormant and needs to be activated - this is what Rylsadhar was researching. Lory gives Arkhan part of the key to Rylsadhar's vault (the item Rylsadhar gave to Lory earlier on) and urges him to find a way to access the light energy.\n\nArkhan then sets about finding the rest of the key. He finds the first part with the city's Master Builder, Bandor, who tells him the other parts of the key are with Zed, and Leona. Arkhan finds and defeats Dhorkan, and then discovers a secret bunker from the time of the Great Cataclysm, containing hibernation pods and video files detailing how people tried to survive in the bunker after the meteor collision. He then meets a thief who is holding Zed's part of the key. Arkhan kills him and takes the key. As he moves around the city, Arkhan notes that everywhere, people are beginning to turn into creatures of darkness. He heads down into the sewers and finds Dhorkan dying in the Konkalite's prison. Dhorkan regrets his actions, realizing that he had been used by Sordos and Thanandar. He advises Arkhan not to face Thananadar, and that the poison thrown in Arkhan's face was actually Thanandar's blood. He dies, and Arkhan then discovers a secret underwater passage to outside of the city.\n\nHe soon encounters Leona. Telling her that the Well of Light has been destroyed, that Rylsadhar is dead and that Thanandar is no longer human, Leona is shocked to hear of what has happened. She reveals that the secret of the Well of Light was known only to a few, known as Initiates, and that knowledge of it goes back to the dawn of time, millennia before the Great Cataclysm. The Well contains the Force of Light, and Rylsadhar was trying to find its source in a tomb deep below the city. Leona reveals that if the source can be found, the Force of Light will destroy the Force of Darkness in Thanandar, who, like Lory, Rylsadhar, Zed and Leona was an Initiate. She then gives him the final part of the key to Rylsadhar's vault. Arkhan heads back to the city, finding dead Guardians everywhere. A dying Guardian reveals that the creatures of darkness have entered Sparta.\n\nArkhan enters Rylsadhar's vault and finds research on how to gain access to the Runka Tomb, the source of the Well of Light. Rylsadhar had discovered how to enter the tomb, but had been unable to find the door. However, using an explosive substance found in the bunker, Akhan is able to find the door, which was hidden in the center of the city. Now almost completely transformed into a creature of darkness, he enters the tomb. Navigating a series of traps, he reaches the center of the tomb, but realizes he has been followed by Thanandar, now transformed into a monster of darkness. Thanandar attempts to destroy the source of Light, but Arkhan blocks him. They fight, and Arkhan is able to defeat and destroy Thanandar.

Although he was critical of the fixed camera angles and the combat system, he wrote that \"''Dark Earth'' features superb graphics, outstanding 3D character animation, and unique action-adventuring in one beautifully crafted package. Adventurers longing for a deep and rich story, with carefully crafted characters, coupled with swashbuckling fighting action and challenging puzzles and problem solving, look no further.\" They were especially impressed with the graphics, which they called \"stunningly gorgeous. The shimmering colors, including translucent stained glass, are breathtaking. Each of the 100, fully 3D animated characters looks unique. As Arkhan and the other characters move, they change size to match the perspective, and the dynamic lighting sources throw properly proportioned shadows.\"<ref name=\"GSpot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-earth-review/1900-2538497/|website=[[GameSpot]] |title=Dark Earth Review|last= Sengstack|first=Jeff|date=November 6, 1997|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n''[[PC Zone]]''{{'}}s Chris Anderson was also impressed, scoring it 82 out of 100, and praising the storyline; \"''Dark Earth'' is more of an interactive cinematic experience than a fully-fledged adventure game. This is no bad thing. The storyline is very convincing and unfolds seamlessly, with cut-scenes popping up at appropriate points in the proceedings to help everything along [...] the rich storyline alone will be enough to keep most people happy, and with the added diversions of hand-to-hand fisticuffs and puzzle-solving elements, ''Dark Earth'' offers a well-rounded gameplay experience that should appeal to many gamers who wouldn't normally be attracted to the adventure genre.\"<ref name=\"Zone\" />\n\n[[Game Revolution]]'s Thomas Garcia scored the game B+. He also criticized the fixed camera angles during combat, but praised the graphics and controls, writing \"''Dark Earth'' is a great game and worth checking out. Its system requirements are quite low; that's an added plus for people with slow systems, and it is certainly not at the sacrifice of otherwise very high-quality graphics and sounds.
