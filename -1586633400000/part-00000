By this time Golden Dawn had adopted several southern Balkan focused regional objectives as its main programme: to promote the idea of a [[Megali Idea|Greater Greece]] through the expansion of Greek territory into southern Albania ([[Northern Epirus]]), the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], and southern Bulgaria, and ultimately Greece's reconquest of [[Constantinople]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]) and western Anatolia through war with Turkey. They also called to push for the complete [[Hellenisation]] of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]] through the expulsion of [[Northern Greece|Northern Greece's]] last remaining [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|Macedonian-speaking minority]] (or so-called Slavophone Greeks) and the [[Turks of Western Thrace|Turkish-speaking Muslim minority]] of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] that were settled during the Ottoman period (see [[Western Thrace Turks]]). They also aspire \"to combat Islam in the region\", such as through contributing fighters to the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]] that helped [[Siege of Srebrenica|capture Srebrenica]].<ref>See Golden Dawn journal, summer 1995 issue, for a manifesto of this program.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-2000s, Golden Dawn had redirected its attention to opposing non-European, and particularly Muslim, [[European migrant crisis|immigration]] into the mainly Greek areas of southern Greece and Athens. Golden Dawn had temporarily ceased political operations in 2005 and was absorbed by the [[Patriotic Alliance (Greece)|Patriotic Alliance]]. The Alliance, in turn, ceased operations after Michaloliakos withdrew support in the spring of 2007. Golden Dawn held its sixth congress, in March 2007, where party officials announced the resumption of political activities. At [[2010 Greek local elections|local elections]] on 7 November 2010 Golden Dawn got 5.3% of the vote in the municipality of Athens, winning a seat at the City Council.

By this time Golden Dawn had adopted several southern Balkan focused regional objectives as its main programme: to promote the idea of a [[Megali Idea|Greater Greece]] through the expansion of Greek territory into southern Albania ([[Northern Epirus]]), the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], and southern Bulgaria, and ultimately Greece's reconquest of [[Constantinople]] (modern day [[Istanbul]]) and western Anatolia through war with Turkey. They also called to push for the complete [[Hellenisation]] of [[Greek Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace]] through the expulsion of [[Northern Greece|Northern Greece's]] last remaining [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|Macedonian-speaking minority]] (or so-called Slavophone Greeks) and the [[Turks of Western Thrace|Turkish-speaking Muslim minority]] of [[East Macedonia and Thrace]] that were settled during the Ottoman period (see [[Western Thrace Turks]]). They also aspire \"to combat Islam in the region\", such as through contributing fighters to the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]] that helped [[Siege of Srebrenica|capture Srebrenica]].<ref>See Golden Dawn journal, summer 1995 issue, for a manifesto of this program.</ref>\n\nBy the mid-2000s, Golden Dawn had redirected its attention to opposing non-European, and particularly Muslim, [[European migrant crisis|immigration]] into the mainly Greek areas of southern Greece and Athens. Golden Dawn had temporarily ceased political operations in 2005 and was absorbed by the [[Patriotic Alliance (Greece)|Patriotic Alliance]]. The Alliance, in turn, ceased operations after Michaloliakos withdrew support in the spring of 2007. Golden Dawn held its sixth congress, in March 2007, where party officials announced the resumption of political activities. At [[2010 Greek local elections|local elections]] on 7 November 2010 Golden Dawn got 5.3% of the vote in the municipality of Athens, winning a seat at the City Council.
