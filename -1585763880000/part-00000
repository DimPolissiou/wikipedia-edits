A former village within the County of [[Midlothian]], it lies to the south west of the city, between [[Juniper Green]] (NE) and [[Balerno]] (SW) on the [[A70 road|Lanark Road]]. Administratively, Currie falls within the jurisdiction of the [[Politics of Edinburgh|City of Edinburgh Council]]. It gives its name to a [[Civil parishes in Scotland|civil parish]].\n\nIn 2001 the population of Currie was 8,550 and it contained 3,454 houses.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.currie-scc.gov.uk/ccc11.html | title = Currie Community Council | accessdate = 2012-06-24}}</ref> There has been multiple new housing developments in Currie since 2001 and these figures are highly likely to be much higher to date.\n \n== Etymology ==\nThere is no accepted derivation of the name Currie but it is possibly from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] word ''curagh/curragh'', a wet or boggy plain, or from the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] word ''curi'', a dell or dirt hole.  The neighbouring suburb of [[Balerno]] derives its name from [[Scottish Gaelic]], whilst the nearby [[Pentland Hills]] derive their name from Brythonic, so either is possible.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest record of a settlement in the Currie area is a [[Bronze Age]] razor (1800 BC) found at Kinleith Mill and the stone cists (500 BC) at Duncan's Belt and Blinkbonny. There are a few mentions of this area in [[mediaeval]] and early modern documents. One of the first is when Robert of Kildeleith became Chancellor of Scotland in 1249. Kildeleith means Chapel by the Leith, and survives today as Kinleith. [[Robert the Bruce]] gave [[Riccarton, Edinburgh|Riccarton]] as a wedding present in 1315 and in 1392 the land passed to the family of Bishop Wardlaw. In 1612 the land went to Ludovic Craig, a Senator of the [[College of Justice]]. In 1818 it passed to the female line and became the property of the Gibson-Craigs.\n\nThere has been a Christian community in the area for more than 1,000 years. In 1018, the archdeacons of [[Lothian]] set up their headquarters in the area. [[John Bartholomew]]'s Civic and Ecclesiastical maps of the 13th century do not show Currie, but the Index of Charters 1309-1413 records Currie as being 'favourite hunting grounds' for the Lords and Knights of [[Edinburgh Castle]]. A settlement began to take shape around Currie Kirk and the main Lanark Road, which was the main route south and continues to be known as 'The [[Lang Whang]]'.\n\nThe weaver poet [[James Thomson (weaver poet)|James Thomson]] was brought up in the village in the late 18th century and is commemorated by the dell of the Kinleith Burn being named the \"Poet's Glen\", where it runs down from beside his cottage at Mid Kinleith Farm to join the Water of Leith, and also by a number of street names, (Thomson Road, Thomson Drive, Thomson Crescent), in the east of Currie.\n\nThe war memorial was erected in 1919 to a design by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\nThe period 1921-1951 brought great changes with the building of more council houses in Currie and private building along Lanark Road. Wider scale development began in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the construction of a private housing estate to the east of Curriehill Road. House builders began to promote Currie as a pleasant commuting suburb of Edinburgh and much house building took place to the north of Lanark Road West. Currie High School was constructed on its present site in 1966 and extensively refurbished and renewed in 1997. There was a [[Currie railway station|Currie station]] on [[Balerno line|a short loop railway]] running over what is now the [[Water of Leith Walkway]]. The physical topography has ensured that the original historic core to the south of Lanark Road West including the Water of Leith has remained undeveloped. In March 1972 the historic centre of Currie was declared a [[Conservation Area]].\n\n== Education ==\nThe earliest record of education in the area is contained in the Minutes of Edinburgh Town Council in 1598, when Baillie Lawrence Henderson was sent to \"the toun o Currie to help the gentlemen of the Parish select a Schoolmaister\"; however it is not stated where the school was situated. In 1694, the heritors appointed a Mr Thomson to teach scholars in the Church until Thomas Craig of Riccarton found a place for the building of a school and house for the schoolmaster. The foundations of the school were laid in 1699. The school and school house cost 500 merks and the salary of the schoolmaster was 20 pounds Scots per year.\n\nCurrie is served by [[Currie High School]] (which has been a Green Flag Eco-School since 2004), Nether Currie Primary School and Currie Primary School, formed by an amalgamation in 2005 of Curriehill Primary School and Riccarton Primary School which shared neighbouring campuses. The largest single Year group since the School's inception, was 1984. According to the School Website this number will probably never be equalled or exceeded. CHS has sought to improve facilities since 2000 with additions of All Weather, floodlit Football Pitches. \n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, [[Heriot-Watt University]] moved from its city centre location to occupy the lands of the former Riccarton Estate, gifted to the university by Midlothian County Council in 1966. The move has now been completed and the main campus of Heriot-Watt University occupies and manages a wooded area with enough space for future expansion.\n\n== Sport ==\n\n=== Football ===\nCurrie has two youth football teams Currie Football Club and Currie Star FC (Currie Star play their games in the [[Kingsknowe]] area of [[Edinburgh]]).\n\n=== Rugby ===\nCurrie has one rugby team, Currie RFC who are based and play their home games in the neighbouring village of [[Balerno]].\n\n== Culture and attractions ==\nCurrie has two Scout Groups - the 31st Pentland which has run continuously since 1924 and the 42nd Pentland.\n\nCurrie is a District of Girlguiding Edinburgh.  1st Currie Guides have run continuously since 1921, and 1st Currie Brownies continually since 1933.\n\nOn the first Saturday of May The Currie Riding of the Marches takes place.\n\n== Local History Society ==\n\nCurrie and District Local History Society meets 12 times a year and has speakers on all aspects of the area.\n\nThe society meets every first and third Monday in the month and their year starts in October.\nThe venue is in the Gibson Craig Hall on the Lanark Road in Currie.\n\n==Ethnicity==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]] and added in 1921.<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\nBelow the site of the church close to the Water of Leith is St Mungo's Holy Well with its stone basin and side walls.\n\n===Ministers===\n*Rev James Craig in 1780s<ref>williamsons Street Directory 1784</ref>\n*Rev James Dick ministered 1792 to 1815<ref>Grave of Rev James Dick, Currie Kirkyard</ref>\n*Rev Dr James Langwill ministered 1859 to 1898<ref>Memorial to James Langwill in Currie Kirk</ref>\n\n===Notable Interments===\n*[[Alick Buchanan-Smith, Baron Balerno]] (1898-1984)\n*[[Alick Buchanan-Smith (1932\u20131991)|Alick Laidlaw Buchanan-Smith]] MP (1932-1991)\n*Sir [[Stanley Davidson]] (1894-1981) Professor of Medicine\n*William Henderson (1766-1842) co-founder of [[Scottish Widows]] (large obelisk to the north-west of the churchyard)\n*Dr [[Robert Cranston Low]] MD FRCPE [[FRSE]] (1879-1949) medical author\n*Dr [[Alexander Morison]] (1779-1866)\n*[[Ochterlony baronets|Sir David Ferguson Ochterlony]] (1848-1931) 3rd Baronet Ochterlony\n*Sir [[George Adam Smith]] (1856-1942) including a memorial to his daughter, [[Janet Adam Smith]]\n*Brigadier General Ernest Craig Brown, who gives his name to the military march \"Captain Craig Brown\"<ref>https://boxandfiddlearchive.weebly.com/captain-craig-brown.html</ref>\n\n== Famous residents ==\n\n* [[Stephen Carter, Baron Carter of Barnes]]\n* [[Jamie Dick]] - Youth Olympic Gold Medalist in Curling\n* [[Kate Green]] - Labour MP\n* [[Dougal Haston]] - pioneer of Scottish mountaineering\n* [[Matthew Lloyd]] - Australian Rules footballer, [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]\n* [[Maitland Moir|John Henry Maitland Moir]] - Archimandrite, Greek Orthodox Church of St Andrew\n* [[Matt Scott (rugby union)|Matt Scott]] - Scottish international Rugby Union player\n* [[James Thomson (weaver poet)]]\n*Paul Research and John Mackie of post-punk band [[Scars (band)|The Scars]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edinburghgigarchive.com/page31.htm|title=The Edinburgh Gig Archive - Odds & Ends|website=www.edinburghgigarchive.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Heriot-Watt University]]\n*[[Currie High School]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20100329115029/http://www.curriechs.co.uk/ [last accessed 26 Feb 1013]\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110903142315/http://www.currie-scc.gov.uk/ Currie Community Council]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100329115029/http://www.curriechs.co.uk/ Currie Community High School]\n*[http://www.currierugby.org Currie Rugby Football Club]\n*[http://www.hw.ac.uk Heriot-Watt University]\n*[http://www.currie-pri.edin.sch.uk Currie Primary School]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100609065108/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scottishschoolsonline/schools/nethercurrieprimaryschooledinburghcity.asp Nether Currie Primary's page on Scottish Schools Online]\n*[http://www.curriehistory.org Currie and District Local history Society]\n*[http://www.nethercurrie.edin.sch.uk Nether Currie Primary School]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4t4WGIDAJo St Mungo's Well]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ0tSJqr_QU Curriehill railway station]\n{{Areas of Edinburgh}}\n\n[[Category:Areas of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Parishes formerly in Midlothian]]\n", "name_user": "Barry ferguson 1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "Info re population", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currie"}

The lineup currently consists of founding member and singer Edsel Dope, guitarist Virus, bassist Acey Slade, and drummer Daniel Fox.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early days (1997\u20131998)===\nThe band was founded in 1997 by [[songwriter]] and [[lead vocalist]] [[Edsel Dope]]. As a child, Edsel and his brother Simon Dope were separated when their parents divorced. When the two were adults, they reunited and Simon joined Edsel's band, playing [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s, samples and percussion. The pair then recruited [[Tripp Eisen]] as guitarist, [[Preston Nash]] as drummer, and [[Acey Slade]] as bassist.\n\nUnlike many of the popular bands from the 1990s, Dope derived their sound from influences taken from [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands and fused that with the sound of [[industrial rock]] acts who had made waves earlier in the decade, such as [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Skinny Puppy]].\n\nIn their earliest days, the band sold drugs to survive and purchase instruments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edseldope.com/outburn.html |title=Outburn Magazine |publisher=Edseldope.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> Furthermore, the band name \"Dope\" refers to [[heroin]], which was the common substance Edsel and Simon [[Illegal drug trade|pushed]] around the NYC area as shown by their early T-shirt designs, which prominently displayed [[syringe|hypodermic needles]].\n\nThe band also had some early connections with fellow rockers [[Marilyn Manson]]; ex drummer [[Ginger Fish]] shared an apartment with Edsel Dope in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] during the earlier 1990s, before either of them were in their respective bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edseldope.com/edselbio.html |title=Edsel Dope |publisher=Edsel Dope |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> Also, guitarist [[Zim Zum]] allowed the band to claim that they were \"currently being produced by Zim Zum\" on the cover of their promotional discs to help them gain a record deal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/rock/e4/zimzum.html |title=Zim Zum Interview |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=2010-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423134204/http://www.angelfire.com/rock/e4/zimzum.html |archivedate=2010-04-23 }}</ref> It was originally planned that Zum would produce their debut. However, he was busy recording the album ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' at the time. Lead singer Edsel has also maintained a good friendship with ex-Manson guitarist [[Daisy Berkowitz]].\n\n===''Felons and Revolutionaries'' (1999\u20132000)===\n''[[Felons and Revolutionaries]]'' was created after performing on the [[New York City]] club circuit, and releasing several promotional cassettes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edseldope.com/demos.html |title=Dope Demos |publisher=Edseldope.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> the band was signed by [[Epic Records]]. For the album's recording, Sloane Jentry had left the band and Tripp Eisen moved to guitar, while [[Acey Slade]] was brought in on bass. The album featured fourteen tracks including two covers, which were; \"[[Fuck tha Police]]\" by [[N.W.A]] and \"[[You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)]]\" by English [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]], which featured in the movie ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]''. \"Debonaire\" was also featured on the ''[[Scream 3]]'' movie soundtrack and the first ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' movie during the police raid on Johnny Tran's house scene.\n\nDope toured extensively, taking part in several national tours with various acts ranging from [[Alice Cooper]] to [[Kid Rock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidcollette.com/dope.htm |title=David Collette |publisher=David Collette |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> This helped ''Felons and Revolutionaries''  [[SoundScan]] more than 250,000 units in total.\n\nA live video for the song \"Sick\" was recorded to capture the energy of the group's live show. The first single and non-live [[music video|promotional video]] released by the band from the album was \"Everything Sucks\", which failed to chart. The second single, a cover of \"You Spin Me Round\", saw the band gaining more attention; it received radio play and reached No.&nbsp;37 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks chart|US Mainstream Rock]] charts.\n\n===''Life'' (2001\u20132002)===\nAfter the relative success of their debut album, Dope decided to record a follow up entitled ''[[Life (Dope album)|Life]]''. Several band changes had taken place once more; [[Tripp Eisen]] was fired from the group and joined [[industrial metal]] band [[Static-X]], so [[Virus (musician)|Virus]], a guitarist/producer from New York City who was originally hired for bass, replaced him on guitar in 2000. Acey Slade was moved to the position of guitar, while Sloane Jentry (who had remained friends with the band) rejoined, this time on bass. On drums, Preston Nash was replaced by Racci \"Sketchy\" Shay.\n\nThe two singles from Life; \"Now or Never\" and \"Slipping Away\" reached No.&nbsp;28 and No.&nbsp;29 on the Mainstream Rock charts respectively. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;180 on the [[Billboard charts]]{{which|date=March 2016}} and No.&nbsp;6 on the [[Top Heatseekers]], which up until that point was the band's highest charting. After the album's release, Simon Dope left the group to pursue a career as a [[video game]] producer.\n\n\"Debonaire\" from the first album was used in the movie ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} More soundtrack work was done by Dope in 2002, as the band recorded [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] chairman [[Vince McMahon]]'s theme song \"No Chance (In Hell)\" for the ''[[WWF Forceable Entry]]'' audio release. Dope's music had previously been used as the background theme in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]], and [[Terry Gerin|Rhino]] also used \"Debonaire\" as his entrance theme.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAround this period, Edsel Dope also had a public rivalry with the band [[Murderdolls]], particularly vocalist [[Wednesday 13]]. An early version of that group had featured Racci Shay on drums; and under the name Murderdolls, it featured [[Tripp Eisen]]. Dope guitarist [[Acey Slade]] then left the band to join Murderdolls in mid-2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edseldope.com/aceygone.html |title=Acey to Murderdolls |publisher=Edseldope.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref>\n\n===''Group Therapy'' and ''American Apathy'' (2003\u20132007)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nDisappointed with the label's perceived lack of promotion for the album, the band left Epic and joined Artemis Records, a New York [[independent record label]].\n\nDope's third studio album was titled ''[[Group Therapy (Dope album)|Group Therapy]]''. A song from that album, ''Today is the Day'' served as the official theme song for [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]'s pay-per-view event [[No Mercy 2003]] in October.\n\nBy 2005, Dope had regrouped once more, the band had a new bassist, Brian \"Brix\" Milner (former guitarist and keyboardist for Orlando's [[Skrape]]). For their new album entitled ''[[American Apathy]]'', the band returned to a harder sound similar in some respects to their debut, in an [[industrial metal]] style.\n\nAlthough released eight years after the band formed, four albums in and on an independent label, American Apathy performed well in the charts. It was a No.&nbsp;1 hit on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart, for the first time in the band's history and it also saw the band's highest charting on the Billboard chart to date.\n\nBen Graves of the [[Murderdolls]] joined Dope as the live drummer on a tour of Japan. In 2006 Dope bassist Brix Milner played in Murderdolls front man [[Wednesday 13]]'s solo band, replacing the injured Kid Kid.\n\nEdsel Dope and Virus became involved in an [[Alternative rock|alternative pop/rock]] side-project called Makeshift Romeo.\n\n===''No Regrets'' (2008\u20132012)===\n''No Regrets'' is the band's fifth studio album. The album was released on March 10, 2009. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;88 with 6,200 copies sold in its first week, making it the highest-charted album in the band's history. This CD is different from past releases in that the name of the CD is repeated in many of the songs, including \"Dirty World,\" \"My Funeral,\" \"We Are,\" and the CD's title track. \"Addiction\" is the third single from the album. The song features a guitar solo by the guest musician [[Zakk Wylde]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=113831 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - DOPE: New Song Featuring ZAKK WYLDE Posted Online |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nDope has finished their spring tour of the United States, the tour, which took place over two months, included 22 dates. Tripp Lee played live on bass with the band (although Brix is still listed, and seems doubtful that he will return) and a new drummer named Angel Bartolotta, formerly of [[Pig (band)|Pig]] and [[The Genitorturers]] has joined.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIt was announced on October 15, 2008 that the first single from ''[[No Regrets (Dope album)|No Regrets]]'' is called \"Violence\". The song is currently available to listen on the band's [[MySpace]]. There will be a music video, for \"Violence\", according to the image the band set for album art.  One of the tracks for the album was released in late 2007 in the game, ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. ''Guitar Hero III'' includes a song by Dope called \"Nothing for Me Here\" on the bonus list and mentions that it will be on the band's upcoming album.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nSome time in early 2009, Dope updated their official website, which now features promotion for ''No Regrets'', which was released on March 10, 2009.

Dope's live album, titled \"Live In Moscow\", was released in 2016 summer via a fan-funded process through their website where all those who pre-ordered the live album and/or contributed to the fundraiser would have their name listed in the album's liner notes and would subsequently make the website's virtual thermometer grow as fans shopped around the website. The Thermometer would display the overall progress in reaching various fundraiser goals such as the release of the live DVD and making it to United Kingdom and Europe for a tour.\n\nAfter the release of their first live album, the band announced that they will be releasing their long-awaited album \"[[Blood Money Part 1|Blood Money, Part 1]]\" in the autumn of 2016, also stating that the second part of \"Blood Money\" would not see such lengthy delays as Part 1 did.\n\nDope released the official music video for the two-part album's title track \"Blood Money\" on July 16, 2016.

recent studio album, ''[[Blood Money Part 1]]'', being released on October 28, 2016. The lineup currently consists of founding member and singer Edsel Dope, guitarist Virus, bassist Acey Slade, and drummer Daniel Fox.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early days (1997\u20131998)===\nThe band was founded in 1997 by [[songwriter]] and [[lead vocalist]] [[Edsel Dope]]. As a child, Edsel and his brother Simon Dope were separated when their parents divorced. When the two were adults, they reunited and Simon joined Edsel's band, playing [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]s, samples and percussion. The pair then recruited [[Tripp Eisen]] as guitarist, [[Preston Nash]] as drummer, and [[Acey Slade]] as bassist.\n\nUnlike many of the popular bands from the 1990s, Dope derived their sound from influences taken from [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands and fused that with the sound of [[industrial rock]] acts who had made waves earlier in the decade, such as [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] and [[Skinny Puppy]].\n\nIn their earliest days, the band sold drugs to survive and purchase instruments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edseldope.com/outburn.html |title=Outburn Magazine |publisher=Edseldope.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> Furthermore, the band name \"Dope\" refers to [[heroin]], which was the common substance Edsel and Simon [[Illegal drug trade|pushed]] around the NYC area as shown by their early T-shirt designs, which prominently displayed [[syringe|hypodermic needles]].\n\nThe band also had some early connections with fellow rockers [[Marilyn Manson]]; ex drummer [[Ginger Fish]] shared an apartment with Edsel Dope in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] during the earlier 1990s, before either of them were in their respective bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edseldope.com/edselbio.html |title=Edsel Dope |publisher=Edsel Dope |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> Also, guitarist [[Zim Zum]] allowed the band to claim that they were \"currently being produced by Zim Zum\" on the cover of their promotional discs to help them gain a record deal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/rock/e4/zimzum.html |title=Zim Zum Interview |publisher=Angelfire.com |accessdate=2010-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423134204/http://www.angelfire.com/rock/e4/zimzum.html |archivedate=2010-04-23 }}</ref> It was originally planned that Zum would produce their debut. However, he was busy recording the album ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' at the time. Lead singer Edsel has also maintained a good friendship with ex-Manson guitarist [[Daisy Berkowitz]].\n\n===''Felons and Revolutionaries'' (1999\u20132000)===\n''[[Felons and Revolutionaries]]'' was created after performing on the [[New York City]] club circuit, and releasing several promotional cassettes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edseldope.com/demos.html |title=Dope Demos |publisher=Edseldope.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> the band was signed by [[Epic Records]]. For the album's recording, Sloane Jentry had left the band and Tripp Eisen moved to guitar, while [[Acey Slade]] was brought in on bass. The album featured fourteen tracks including two covers, which were; \"[[Fuck tha Police]]\" by [[N.W.A]] and \"[[You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)]]\" by English [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Dead or Alive (band)|Dead or Alive]], which featured in the movie ''[[American Psycho (film)|American Psycho]]''. \"Debonaire\" was also featured on the ''[[Scream 3]]'' movie soundtrack and the first ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' movie during the police raid on Johnny Tran's house scene.\n\nDope toured extensively, taking part in several national tours with various acts ranging from [[Alice Cooper]] to [[Kid Rock]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidcollette.com/dope.htm |title=David Collette |publisher=David Collette |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref> This helped ''Felons and Revolutionaries''  [[SoundScan]] more than 250,000 units in total.\n\nA live video for the song \"Sick\" was recorded to capture the energy of the group's live show. The first single and non-live [[music video|promotional video]] released by the band from the album was \"Everything Sucks\", which failed to chart. The second single, a cover of \"You Spin Me Round\", saw the band gaining more attention; it received radio play and reached No.&nbsp;37 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks chart|US Mainstream Rock]] charts.\n\n===''Life'' (2001\u20132002)===\nAfter the relative success of their debut album, Dope decided to record a follow up entitled ''[[Life (Dope album)|Life]]''. Several band changes had taken place once more; [[Tripp Eisen]] was fired from the group and joined [[industrial metal]] band [[Static-X]], so [[Virus (musician)|Virus]], a guitarist/producer from New York City who was originally hired for bass, replaced him on guitar in 2000. Acey Slade was moved to the position of guitar, while Sloane Jentry (who had remained friends with the band) rejoined, this time on bass. On drums, Preston Nash was replaced by Racci \"Sketchy\" Shay.\n\nThe two singles from Life; \"Now or Never\" and \"Slipping Away\" reached No.&nbsp;28 and No.&nbsp;29 on the Mainstream Rock charts respectively. The album itself reached No.&nbsp;180 on the [[Billboard charts]]{{which|date=March 2016}} and No.&nbsp;6 on the [[Top Heatseekers]], which up until that point was the band's highest charting. After the album's release, Simon Dope left the group to pursue a career as a [[video game]] producer.\n\n\"Debonaire\" from the first album was used in the movie ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} More soundtrack work was done by Dope in 2002, as the band recorded [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] chairman [[Vince McMahon]]'s theme song \"No Chance (In Hell)\" for the ''[[WWF Forceable Entry]]'' audio release. Dope's music had previously been used as the background theme in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]], and [[Terry Gerin|Rhino]] also used \"Debonaire\" as his entrance theme.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAround this period, Edsel Dope also had a public rivalry with the band [[Murderdolls]], particularly vocalist [[Wednesday 13]]. An early version of that group had featured Racci Shay on drums; and under the name Murderdolls, it featured [[Tripp Eisen]]. Dope guitarist [[Acey Slade]] then left the band to join Murderdolls in mid-2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edseldope.com/aceygone.html |title=Acey to Murderdolls |publisher=Edseldope.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16}}</ref>\n\n===''Group Therapy'' and ''American Apathy'' (2003\u20132007)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nDisappointed with the label's perceived lack of promotion for the album, the band left Epic and joined Artemis Records, a New York [[independent record label]].\n\nDope's third studio album was titled ''[[Group Therapy (Dope album)|Group Therapy]]''. A song from that album, ''Today is the Day'' served as the official theme song for [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]'s pay-per-view event [[No Mercy 2003]] in October.\n\nBy 2005, Dope had regrouped once more, the band had a new bassist, Brian \"Brix\" Milner (former guitarist and keyboardist for Orlando's [[Skrape]]). For their new album entitled ''[[American Apathy]]'', the band returned to a harder sound similar in some respects to their debut, in an [[industrial metal]] style.\n\nAlthough released eight years after the band formed, four albums in and on an independent label, American Apathy performed well in the charts. It was a No.&nbsp;1 hit on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart, for the first time in the band's history and it also saw the band's highest charting on the Billboard chart to date.\n\nBen Graves of the [[Murderdolls]] joined Dope as the live drummer on a tour of Japan. In 2006 Dope bassist Brix Milner played in Murderdolls front man [[Wednesday 13]]'s solo band, replacing the injured Kid Kid.\n\nEdsel Dope and Virus became involved in an [[Alternative rock|alternative pop/rock]] side-project called Makeshift Romeo.\n\n===''No Regrets'' (2008\u20132012)===\n''No Regrets'' is the band's fifth studio album. The album was released on March 10, 2009. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;88 with 6,200 copies sold in its first week, making it the highest-charted album in the band's history. This CD is different from past releases in that the name of the CD is repeated in many of the songs, including \"Dirty World,\" \"My Funeral,\" \"We Are,\" and the CD's title track. \"Addiction\" is the third single from the album. The song features a guitar solo by the guest musician [[Zakk Wylde]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=113831 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - DOPE: New Song Featuring ZAKK WYLDE Posted Online |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-16 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nDope has finished their spring tour of the United States, the tour, which took place over two months, included 22 dates. Tripp Lee played live on bass with the band (although Brix is still listed, and seems doubtful that he will return) and a new drummer named Angel Bartolotta, formerly of [[Pig (band)|Pig]] and [[The Genitorturers]] has joined.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIt was announced on October 15, 2008 that the first single from ''[[No Regrets (Dope album)|No Regrets]]'' is called \"Violence\". The song is currently available to listen on the band's [[MySpace]]. There will be a music video, for \"Violence\", according to the image the band set for album art.  One of the tracks for the album was released in late 2007 in the game, ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. ''Guitar Hero III'' includes a song by Dope called \"Nothing for Me Here\" on the bonus list and mentions that it will be on the band's upcoming album.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nSome time in early 2009, Dope updated their official website, which now features promotion for ''No Regrets'', which was released on March 10, 2009. Previews of eight tracks from the new album can be heard via the music player on the site. In addition to this, the full music video for the single Addiction, which features [[Zakk Wylde]] of [[Black Label Society]] and well-known guitarist for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] is available to be viewed on the site. One of the tracks on the new album is a cover of the [[Billy Idol]] single, \"[[Rebel Yell (song)|Rebel Yell]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dopearmy.com |title=Official Dope website|website=Dopearmy.com |accessdate=2009-02-08}}</ref>\n\nOn July 29, 2008, Dope released ''American Apathy Reloaded''\u2014a CD of remixes and alternate versions of songs from ''American Apathy'', plus a live DVD.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nDope has released a video to go along with the second single on the album, \"6-6-Sick\".{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe song \"Nothing for Me Here\" is featured in the video game [[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]] as a bonus track, therefore making the song's original release date in 2007, 2 years before No Regrets was released.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n[[Virus (guitarist/musician)|Virus]], the lead guitarist, teaches guitar/bass at the Paul Green School of Rock, in Fort Washington, PA.<ref name=\"School of Rock\">{{cite web|title=School of Rock/School Staff|url=http://www.schoolofrock.com/fortwashington/staff_school.php|website=Schoolofrock.com|accessdate=2008-12-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013083608/http://www.schoolofrock.com/fortwashington/staff_school.php|archivedate=2008-10-13}}</ref>\n\n[[Virus (guitarist/musician)|Virus]] also produces up-and-coming bands and writes music for TV and video game companies such as Activision, Disney and ESPN.<ref name=\"Blabbermouth\">{{cite web|last=Blabbermouth News|title=DOPE Guitarist Producing KORE ROZZIK Demo|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=99525|accessdate=2008-12-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211172911/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=99525|archivedate=2008-12-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Dope performed at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gKE67L97SA |title=2011 Gathering of the Juggalos Infomercial |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-06-03 |accessdate=2011-12-07}}</ref>\n\nOn August 12, 2011, Dope played at Mojoes in Joliet, IL.

The album was originally set to be released in March 2014. However, in an interview with Dee J. Nelson, it was said that the release will take place in the summer. The music video for the album's first single \"Selfish\" was released on August 26, 2014 as frontman [[Edsel Dope]] announced that Blood Money will be a two-part album. In 2015, Dope announced the dates for the \"Die Mother Fucker Die\" reunion tour, featuring the classic lineup of Edsel Dope, Virus, Acey Slade, and Racci Shay. Dope also recorded their very first live album in Moscow which featured the four long time friends and bandmates. Dope's live album, titled \"Live In Moscow\", was released in 2016 summer via a fan-funded process through their website where all those who pre-ordered the live album and/or contributed to the fundraiser would have their name listed in the album's liner notes and would subsequently make the website's virtual thermometer grow as fans shopped around the website. The Thermometer would display the overall progress in reaching various fundraiser goals such as the release of the live DVD and making it to United Kingdom and Europe for a tour.\n\nAfter the release of their first live album, the band announced that they will be releasing their long-awaited album \"[[Blood Money Part 1|Blood Money, Part 1]]\" in the autumn of 2016, also stating that the second part of \"Blood Money\" would not see such lengthy delays as Part 1 did.\n\nDope released the official music video for the two-part album's title track \"Blood Money\" on July 16, 2016. The band released the second single on the album entitled \"Hold On\" on August 26, 2016, as well as the official music video. Blood Money part 1 was officially released worldwide on October 28, 2016 via eOne Entertainment.\n\nAfter the release of \"Blood Money, Part 1,\" Dope went to tour Russia and the United Kingdom as the headlining act as well as having toured with the classic lineup featured in the \"Die Mother Fucker Die Reunion\" tour. This reunion tour had guitarist [[Virus (musician)|Virus]], drummer Racci Shay, and bassist [[Acey Slade]] return for the occasion.\n\nIn the beginning of 2017, Dope released tour dates for Spring 2017, touring with co-headliner [[Combichrist]] and supporting acts [[September Mourning]] and Davey Suicide. They also released more tour dates for Fall 2017, this time touring with [[Hed PE]].\n\nIn 2019, Dope toured with [[Static-X]], [[DevilDriver]], [[Wednesday 13]], and Raven Black in the US.

E. Cummings]], at the [[Provincetown Playhouse]].<ref>[http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/Him_program.html \"Him Program (1928)\"]. ''faculty.gvsu.edu''. Retrieved 2020-02-14.</ref> He claimed that he got the roles because one of them required shooting [[craps]], which he did well, and a friend in the company volunteered him. He appeared in a series of short-lived plays through the early 1930s, including ''The House Beautiful'', which [[Dorothy Parker]] famously derided as \"the play lousy\".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Early film roles===\nIn 1932, Stander landed his first credited film role in the [[Warner Bros.|Warner]]-[[Vitaphone]] short feature ''[[In the Dough]]'' (1932), with [[Fatty Arbuckle]] and [[Shemp Howard]]. He made several other shorts, the last being ''The Old Grey Mayor'' (1935) with [[Bob Hope]] in 1935. That same year, he was cast in a feature, [[Ben Hecht]]'s ''[[The Scoundrel (1935 film)|The Scoundrel]]'' (1935), with [[No\u00ebl Coward]]. He moved to [[Hollywood]] and signed a contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]. Stander was in a string of films over the next three years, appearing most notably in [[Frank Capra|Frank Capra's]] ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) with [[Gary Cooper]], ''[[Meet Nero Wolfe]]'' (1936) playing [[Archie Goodwin (character)|Archie Goodwin]], ''[[The League of Frightened Men (1937 film)|The League of Frightened Men]]'' (1937), and ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937) with [[Janet Gaynor]] and [[Fredric March]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Radio roles===\nStander's distinctive rumbling voice, tough-guy demeanor, and talent with accents made him a popular radio actor. In the 1930s and 1940s, he was on ''The Eddie Cantor Show'', [[Bing Crosby]]'s [[Kraft Music Hall|KMH show]], the ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' production of ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', ''[[Fred Allen|The Fred Allen Show]]'',<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=K7N3EkU2lIMC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=Fred+Allen+Lionel+stander&source=bl&ots=g9HMPWBq5Y&sig=Q9k2KdygRP62CEJsjG-0hscd4MI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tf2tU8y3Aq3U4QSWwYDwBQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Fred%20Allen%20Lionel%20stander&f=false Fred Allen's Radio Comedy]</ref> the ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]'' series with [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Agnes Moorehead]], ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' on [[NBC]], ''[[Stage Door Canteen]]'' on [[CBS]], the ''Lincoln Highway Radio Show'' on NBC, and ''[[The Jack Paar Show]]'', among others.\n\nIn 1941, he starred in a short-lived radio show called ''The Life of Riley'' on CBS, no relation to the radio, film, and television character later made famous by [[William Bendix]]. Stander played the role of Spider Schultz in both [[Harold Lloyd]]'s film ''[[The Milky Way (1936 film)|The Milky Way]]'' (1936) and its remake ten years later, ''[[The Kid from Brooklyn]]'' (1946), starring [[Danny Kaye]]. He was a regular on Danny Kaye's zany comedy-variety [[radio show]] on CBS (1946&ndash;1947), playing himself as \"just the elevator operator\" amidst the antics of Kaye, future ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' star [[Eve Arden]], and bandleader [[Harry James]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nAlso during the 1940s, he played several characters on ''[[Woody Woodpecker|The Woody Woodpecker]]'' and ''[[Andy Panda]]'' animated theatrical shorts, produced by [[Walter Lantz]]. For ''Woody Woodpecker'', he provided the voice of [[Buzz Buzzard]], but was blacklisted from the Lantz studio in 1951 and was replaced by [[Dal McKennon]].\n\n===Activism===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lionel Stander in MORE THAN A SECRETARY.JPG|thumb|Lionel Stander in ''More Than a Secretary'' (1936)|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 25 April 2008}}]] -->Strongly of communist ideology and pro-labor, Stander espoused a variety of social and political causes, and was a founding member of the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. At a SAG meeting held during a 1937 studio technicians' strike, he told the assemblage of 2000 members: \"With the eyes of the whole world on this meeting, will it not give the Guild a black eye if its members continue to cross picket lines?\" (The ''NYT'' reported: \"Cheers mingled with boos greeted the question.\")  Stander also supported the Conference of Studio Unions in its fight against the Mob-influenced International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees ([[IATSE]]). Also in 1937, Ivan F. Cox, a deposed officer of the San Francisco longshoremen's union, sued Stander and a host of others, including union leader [[Harry Bridges]], actors [[Fredric March]], [[Franchot Tone]], [[Mary Astor]], [[James Cagney]], [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]], and director [[William Dieterle]]. The charge, according to ''Time'' magazine, was \"conspiring to propagate Communism on the Pacific Coast, causing Mr. Cox to lose his job\".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn 1938, Columbia Pictures head [[Harry Cohn]] allegedly called Stander \"a Red son of a bitch\" and threatened a US$100,000 fine against any studio that renewed his contract. Despite critical acclaim for his performances, Stander's film work dropped off drastically. After appearing in 15 films in 1935 and 1936, he was in only six in 1937 and 1938. This was followed by just six films from 1939 through 1943, none made by major studios, the most notable being ''[[Guadalcanal Diary (film)|Guadalcanal Diary]]'' (1943).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Stander and HUAC===\n{{original research|date=October 2017}}\nStander was among the first group of Hollywood actors to be [[subpoena]]ed before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) in 1940 for supposed Communist activities. At a grand jury hearing in Los Angeles in August 1940\u2014the transcript of which was shortly released to the press\u2014[[John R. Leech]], the self-described former \"chief functionary\" of the Communist Party in Los Angeles, named Stander as a CP member, along with more than 15 other Hollywood notables, including [[Franchot Tone]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Cagney]], [[Clifford Odets]] and [[Budd Schulberg]]. Stander subsequently forced himself into the grand jury hearing, and the district attorney cleared him of the allegations.\n\nStander appeared in no films between 1944 and 1945. Then, with HUAC's attentions focused elsewhere due to World War II, he played in a number of mostly second-rate pictures from independent studios through the late 1940s. These include Ben Hecht's ''[[Specter of the Rose]]'' (1946); the [[Preston Sturges]] comedy ''[[The Sin of Harold Diddlebock]]'' (1947) with [[Harold Lloyd]]; and ''[[Trouble Makers (1948 film)|Trouble Makers]]'' (1948) with [[The Bowery Boys]]. One classic emerged from this period of his career, the Preston Sturges comedy ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1948 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'' (1948) with [[Rex Harrison]].\n\nIn 1947, HUAC turned its attention once again to Hollywood. That October, Howard Rushmore, who had belonged to the CPUSA in the 1930s and written film reviews for the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', testified that writer [[John Howard Lawson]], whom he named as a Communist, had \"referred to Lionel Stander as a perfect example of how a Communist should not act in Hollywood.\" Stander was again [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklist]]ed from films, though he played on TV, radio, and in the theater.\n\nIn March 1951, actor [[Larry Parks]], after pleading with HUAC investigators not to force him to \"crawl through the mud\" as an informer, named several people as Communists in a \"closed-door session\", which made the newspapers two days later. He testified that he knew Stander, but did not recall attending any CP meetings with him.\n\nAt a HUAC hearing in April 1951, actor [[Marc Lawrence]] named Stander as a member of his Hollywood Communist \"cell\", along with screenwriter [[Lester Cole]] and screenwriter [[Gordon Kahn]]. Lawrence testified that Stander \"was the guy who introduced me to the party line\", and that Stander said that by joining the CP, he would \"get to know the dames more\" \u2014 which Lawrence, who did not enjoy film-star looks, thought a good idea. Upon hearing of this, Stander shot off a telegram to HUAC chair John S. Wood, calling Lawrence's testimony that he was a Communist \"ridiculous\" and asking to appear before the Committee, so he could swear to that under oath. The telegram concluded: \"I respectfully request an opportunity to appear before you at your earliest possible convenience. Be assured of my cooperation.\" Two days later, Stander sued Lawrence for $500,000 for slander. Lawrence left the country (\"fled\", according to Stander) for Europe.\n\nAfter that, Stander was blacklisted from TV and radio. He continued to act in theater roles, and played Ludlow Lowell in the 1952-53 revival of ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' on Broadway and on tour.\n\n===Blacklisting===\nTwo years passed before Stander was issued the requested subpoena. Finally, in May 1953, he testified at a HUAC hearing in New York, where he made front-page headlines nationwide by being uproariously uncooperative, memorialized in the [[Eric Bentley]] play, ''Are You Now or Have You Ever Been''. The ''New York Times'' headline was \"Stander Lectures House Red Inquiry.\" In a dig at bandleader [[Artie Shaw]], who had tearfully claimed in a Committee hearing that he had been \"duped\" by the Communist Party, Stander testified, <blockquote>\n\"I am not a dupe, or a dope, or a moe, or a schmoe...I was absolutely conscious of what I was doing, and I am not ashamed of anything I said in public or private.\"\n</blockquote> An excerpt from that statement was engraved in stone for \"The First Amendment Blacklist Memorial\" by Jenny Holzer at the [[University of Southern California]].\n\nOther notable statements during Stander's 1953 HUAC testimony:\n<blockquote>\n* \"[Testifying before HUAC] is like the Spanish Inquisition. You may not be burned, but you can't help coming away a little singed.\"\n* \"I don't know about the overthrow of the government. This committee has been investigating 15 years so far, and hasn't found one act of violence.\"\n* \"I know of a group of fanatics who are desperately trying to undermine the Constitution of the United States by depriving artists and others of life, liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness without due process of law ... I can tell names and cite instances and I am one of the first victims of it. And if you are interested in that and also a group of ex-fascists and America-Firsters and anti-Semites, people who hate everybody including Negroes, minority groups and most likely themselves ... and these people are engaged in a conspiracy outside all the legal processes to undermine the very fundamental American concepts upon which our entire system of democracy exists.\"<ref name=\"belton\">Belton, John. ''A Theory of Justice''. 4th Edition. McGraw-Hill, 2013, p. 309f.</ref>\n* \"...I don't want to be responsible for a whole stable of informers, stool pigeons, and psychopaths and ex-political heretics, who come in here beating their breast and say, 'I am awfully sorry; I didn't know what I was doing. Please--I want absolution; get me back into pictures.'\"\n* \"My estimation of this committee is that this committee arrogates judicial and punitive powers which it does not possess.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nStander was blacklisted from the late 1940s until 1965; perhaps the longest period.<ref name=\"belton\" />\n\n===Career in independent films in Europe===\nAfter that, Stander's acting career went into a free fall. He worked as a stockbroker on [[Wall Street]], a journeyman stage actor, a corporate spokesman\u2014even a [[New Orleans]] [[Mardi Gras]] king. He didn't return to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] until 1961 (and then only briefly in a flop) and to film in 1963, in the low-budget ''The Moving Finger'' (although he did\nprovide, uncredited, the voice-over narration for the 1961 ''noir'' thriller ''[[Blast of Silence]]''.)\n\nLife improved for Stander when he moved to London in 1964 to act in [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[Saint Joan of the Stockyards]]'', directed by [[Tony Richardson]], for whom he'd acted on Broadway, along with [[Christopher Plummer]], in a 1963 production of Brecht's ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]''. In 1965, he was featured in the film ''[[Promise Her Anything]]''. That same year Richardson cast him in the [[black comedy]] about the funeral industry, ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]'', based on [[The Loved One|the novel]] by [[Evelyn Waugh]], with an all-star cast including [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Robert Morse]], [[Liberace]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and many others. In 1966, [[Roman Polanski]] cast Stander in his only starring role, as the thug Dickie in ''[[Cul-de-sac (1966 film)|Cul-de-sac]]'', opposite [[Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac]] and [[Donald Pleasence]].\n\nStander stayed in Europe and eventually settled in Rome, where he appeared in many [[spaghetti Western]]s, most notably playing a bartender named Max in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]].'' He played the role of the villainous mob boss in [[Fernando Di Leo]]'s 1972 [[poliziottescho]] thriller ''[[Caliber 9]]''. In Rome he connected with [[Robert Wagner]], who cast him in an episode of ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' that was shot there. Stander's few English-language films in the 1970s include ''[[The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight (film)|The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight]]'' with [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Jerry Orbach]], [[Steven Spielberg|Steven Spielberg's]] ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', and [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]'', which also starred De Niro and [[Liza Minnelli]].\n\nStander played a supporting role in the TV film ''Revenge Is My Destiny'' with [[Chris Robinson (actor)|Chris Robinson]]. He played a lounge comic modeled after the real-life Las Vegas comic [[Joe E. Lewis]], who used to begin his act by announcing \"Post Time\" as he sipped his ever-present drink.\n\n===''Hart to Hart'' and other roles===\nAfter 15 years abroad, Stander moved back to the U.S. for the role he is now most famous for: Max, the loyal butler, cook, and chauffeur to the wealthy, amateur detectives played by [[Robert Wagner]] and [[Stefanie Powers]] on the 1979\u20131984 television series ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' (and a subsequent series of ''Hart to Hart'' made-for-television films). In 1982, Stander won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film]].\n\nIn 1986, he became the voice of [[Prowl (Transformers)|Kup]] in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. In 1991 he was a guest star in the television series ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]'', playing Uncle Pat in the episode \"Toby or Not Toby\". His final theatrical film role was as a dying hospital patient in ''[[The Last Good Time]]'' (1994), with [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] and [[Olivia d'Abo]], directed by [[Bob Balaban]].\n\n==Personal life==\nStander was married six times, the first time in 1932 and the last in 1972. All but the last marriage ended in divorce. He fathered six daughters (one wife had no children, one had twins).\n\nStander died of lung cancer in Los Angeles, California, in 1994 at age 86. He was buried in [[Glendale, California|Glendale's]] [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/4085|title=Lionel Stander (1908 - 1994) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=www.findagrave.com|access-date=2016-06-20}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{{Div col}}\n*''[[In the Dough]]'' (1933, Short) as Toots (uncredited)\n*''[[The Scoundrel (1935 film)|The Scoundrel]]'' (1935) as Rothenstien\n*''[[Hooray for Love (film)|Hooray for Love]]'' (1935) as Chowsky\n*''[[We're in the Money (film)|We're in the Money]]'' (1935) as Leonidus Giovanni 'Butch' Gonzola\n*''[[Page Miss Glory (1935 film)|Page Miss Glory]]'' (1935) as Nick Papadopolis\n*''[[The Gay Deception]]'' (1935) as Gettel\n*''[[I Live My Life]]'' (1935) as Yaffitz, Bridge Player\n*''[[If You Could Only Cook]]'' (1935) as Flash\n*''[[Soak the Rich]]'' (1936) as Muglia (kidnapper)\n*''[[The Milky Way (1936 film)|The Milky Way]]'' (1936) as Spider Schultz\n*''[[The Music Goes 'Round]]'' (1936) as O'Casey\n*''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) as Cornelius Cobb\n*''[[Meet Nero Wolfe]]'' (1936) as Archie Goodwin\n*''[[They Met in a Taxi]]'' (1936) as Fingers Garrison\n*''[[More Than a Secretary]]'' (1936) as Ernest\n*''[[I Loved a Soldier]]'' (1936, unfinished)\n*''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937) as Matt Libby\n*''[[The League of Frightened Men (1937 film)|The League of Frightened Men]]'' (1937) as Archie Goodwin\n*''[[The Last Gangster]]'' (1937) as 'Curly'\n*''[[No Time to Marry]]'' (1938) as Al Vogel\n*''[[Professor Beware]]'' (1938) as Jerry\n*''[[The Crowd Roars (1938 film)|The Crowd Roars]]'' (1938) as 'Happy' Lane\n*''[[The Ice Follies of 1939]]'' (1939) as Mort Hodges\n*''[[What a Life (film)|What a Life]]'' (1939) as Ferguson\n*''[[The Bride Wore Crutches]]'' (1940) as 'Flannel-Mouth' Moroni\n*''[[Hit Parade of 1941]]'' (1940) (uncredited)\n*''[[Hangmen Also Die!]]'' (1943) as Banya\n*''[[Tahiti Honey]]'' (1943) as Pinkie\n*''[[Guadalcanal Diary (film)|Guadalcanal Diary]]'' (1943) as Sgt.

E. Cummings]], at the [[Provincetown Playhouse]]. He claimed that he got the roles because one of them required shooting [[craps]], which he did well, and a friend in the company volunteered him. He appeared in a series of short-lived plays through the early 1930s, including ''The House Beautiful'', which [[Dorothy Parker]] famously derided as \"the play lousy\".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Early film roles===\nIn 1932, Stander landed his first credited film role in the [[Warner Bros.|Warner]]-[[Vitaphone]] short feature ''[[In the Dough]]'' (1932), with [[Fatty Arbuckle]] and [[Shemp Howard]]. He made several other shorts, the last being ''The Old Grey Mayor'' (1935) with [[Bob Hope]] in 1935. That same year, he was cast in a feature, [[Ben Hecht]]'s ''[[The Scoundrel (1935 film)|The Scoundrel]]'' (1935), with [[No\u00ebl Coward]]. He moved to [[Hollywood]] and signed a contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]. Stander was in a string of films over the next three years, appearing most notably in [[Frank Capra|Frank Capra's]] ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) with [[Gary Cooper]], ''[[Meet Nero Wolfe]]'' (1936) playing [[Archie Goodwin (character)|Archie Goodwin]], ''[[The League of Frightened Men (1937 film)|The League of Frightened Men]]'' (1937), and ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' (1937) with [[Janet Gaynor]] and [[Fredric March]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Radio roles===\nStander's distinctive rumbling voice, tough-guy demeanor, and talent with accents made him a popular radio actor. In the 1930s and 1940s, he was on ''The Eddie Cantor Show'', [[Bing Crosby]]'s [[Kraft Music Hall|KMH show]], the ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'' production of ''[[A Star Is Born (1937 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', ''[[Fred Allen|The Fred Allen Show]]'',<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=K7N3EkU2lIMC&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=Fred+Allen+Lionel+stander&source=bl&ots=g9HMPWBq5Y&sig=Q9k2KdygRP62CEJsjG-0hscd4MI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tf2tU8y3Aq3U4QSWwYDwBQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Fred%20Allen%20Lionel%20stander&f=false Fred Allen's Radio Comedy]</ref> the ''[[Mayor of the Town (radio program)|Mayor of the Town]]'' series with [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Agnes Moorehead]], ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' on [[NBC]], ''[[Stage Door Canteen]]'' on [[CBS]], the ''Lincoln Highway Radio Show'' on NBC, and ''[[The Jack Paar Show]]'', among others.\n\nIn 1941, he starred in a short-lived radio show called ''The Life of Riley'' on CBS, no relation to the radio, film, and television character later made famous by [[William Bendix]]. Stander played the role of Spider Schultz in both [[Harold Lloyd]]'s film ''[[The Milky Way (1936 film)|The Milky Way]]'' (1936) and its remake ten years later, ''[[The Kid from Brooklyn]]'' (1946), starring [[Danny Kaye]]. He was a regular on Danny Kaye's zany comedy-variety [[radio show]] on CBS (1946&ndash;1947), playing himself as \"just the elevator operator\" amidst the antics of Kaye, future ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' star [[Eve Arden]], and bandleader [[Harry James]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nAlso during the 1940s, he played several characters on ''[[Woody Woodpecker|The Woody Woodpecker]]'' and ''[[Andy Panda]]'' animated theatrical shorts, produced by [[Walter Lantz]]. For ''Woody Woodpecker'', he provided the voice of [[Buzz Buzzard]], but was blacklisted from the Lantz studio in 1951 and was replaced by [[Dal McKennon]].\n\n===Activism===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lionel Stander in MORE THAN A SECRETARY.JPG|thumb|Lionel Stander in ''More Than a Secretary'' (1936)|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 25 April 2008}}]] -->Strongly of communist ideology and pro-labor, Stander espoused a variety of social and political causes, and was a founding member of the [[Screen Actors Guild]]. At a SAG meeting held during a 1937 studio technicians' strike, he told the assemblage of 2000 members: \"With the eyes of the whole world on this meeting, will it not give the Guild a black eye if its members continue to cross picket lines?\" (The ''NYT'' reported: \"Cheers mingled with boos greeted the question.\")  Stander also supported the Conference of Studio Unions in its fight against the Mob-influenced International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees ([[IATSE]]). Also in 1937, Ivan F. Cox, a deposed officer of the San Francisco longshoremen's union, sued Stander and a host of others, including union leader [[Harry Bridges]], actors [[Fredric March]], [[Franchot Tone]], [[Mary Astor]], [[James Cagney]], [[Jean Muir (actress)|Jean Muir]], and director [[William Dieterle]]. The charge, according to ''Time'' magazine, was \"conspiring to propagate Communism on the Pacific Coast, causing Mr. Cox to lose his job\".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nIn 1938, Columbia Pictures head [[Harry Cohn]] allegedly called Stander \"a Red son of a bitch\" and threatened a US$100,000 fine against any studio that renewed his contract. Despite critical acclaim for his performances, Stander's film work dropped off drastically. After appearing in 15 films in 1935 and 1936, he was in only six in 1937 and 1938. This was followed by just six films from 1939 through 1943, none made by major studios, the most notable being ''[[Guadalcanal Diary (film)|Guadalcanal Diary]]'' (1943).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n===Stander and HUAC===\n{{original research|date=October 2017}}\nStander was among the first group of Hollywood actors to be [[subpoena]]ed before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) in 1940 for supposed Communist activities. At a grand jury hearing in Los Angeles in August 1940\u2014the transcript of which was shortly released to the press\u2014[[John R. Leech]], the self-described former \"chief functionary\" of the Communist Party in Los Angeles, named Stander as a CP member, along with more than 15 other Hollywood notables, including [[Franchot Tone]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Cagney]], [[Clifford Odets]] and [[Budd Schulberg]]. Stander subsequently forced himself into the grand jury hearing, and the district attorney cleared him of the allegations.\n\nStander appeared in no films between 1944 and 1945. Then, with HUAC's attentions focused elsewhere due to World War II, he played in a number of mostly second-rate pictures from independent studios through the late 1940s. These include Ben Hecht's ''[[Specter of the Rose]]'' (1946); the [[Preston Sturges]] comedy ''[[The Sin of Harold Diddlebock]]'' (1947) with [[Harold Lloyd]]; and ''[[Trouble Makers (1948 film)|Trouble Makers]]'' (1948) with [[The Bowery Boys]]. One classic emerged from this period of his career, the Preston Sturges comedy ''[[Unfaithfully Yours (1948 film)|Unfaithfully Yours]]'' (1948) with [[Rex Harrison]].\n\nIn 1947, HUAC turned its attention once again to Hollywood. That October, Howard Rushmore, who had belonged to the CPUSA in the 1930s and written film reviews for the ''[[Daily Worker]]'', testified that writer [[John Howard Lawson]], whom he named as a Communist, had \"referred to Lionel Stander as a perfect example of how a Communist should not act in Hollywood.\" Stander was again [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklist]]ed from films, though he played on TV, radio, and in the theater.\n\nIn March 1951, actor [[Larry Parks]], after pleading with HUAC investigators not to force him to \"crawl through the mud\" as an informer, named several people as Communists in a \"closed-door session\", which made the newspapers two days later. He testified that he knew Stander, but did not recall attending any CP meetings with him.\n\nAt a HUAC hearing in April 1951, actor [[Marc Lawrence]] named Stander as a member of his Hollywood Communist \"cell\", along with screenwriter [[Lester Cole]] and screenwriter [[Gordon Kahn]]. Lawrence testified that Stander \"was the guy who introduced me to the party line\", and that Stander said that by joining the CP, he would \"get to know the dames more\" \u2014 which Lawrence, who did not enjoy film-star looks, thought a good idea. Upon hearing of this, Stander shot off a telegram to HUAC chair John S. Wood, calling Lawrence's testimony that he was a Communist \"ridiculous\" and asking to appear before the Committee, so he could swear to that under oath. The telegram concluded: \"I respectfully request an opportunity to appear before you at your earliest possible convenience. Be assured of my cooperation.\" Two days later, Stander sued Lawrence for $500,000 for slander. Lawrence left the country (\"fled\", according to Stander) for Europe.\n\nAfter that, Stander was blacklisted from TV and radio. He continued to act in theater roles, and played Ludlow Lowell in the 1952-53 revival of ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' on Broadway and on tour.\n\n===Blacklisting===\nTwo years passed before Stander was issued the requested subpoena. Finally, in May 1953, he testified at a HUAC hearing in New York, where he made front-page headlines nationwide by being uproariously uncooperative, memorialized in the [[Eric Bentley]] play, ''Are You Now or Have You Ever Been''. The ''New York Times'' headline was \"Stander Lectures House Red Inquiry.\" In a dig at bandleader [[Artie Shaw]], who had tearfully claimed in a Committee hearing that he had been \"duped\" by the Communist Party, Stander testified, <blockquote>\n\"I am not a dupe, or a dope, or a moe, or a schmoe...I was absolutely conscious of what I was doing, and I am not ashamed of anything I said in public or private.\"\n</blockquote> An excerpt from that statement was engraved in stone for \"The First Amendment Blacklist Memorial\" by Jenny Holzer at the [[University of Southern California]].\n\nOther notable statements during Stander's 1953 HUAC testimony:\n<blockquote>\n* \"[Testifying before HUAC] is like the Spanish Inquisition. You may not be burned, but you can't help coming away a little singed.\"\n* \"I don't know about the overthrow of the government. This committee has been investigating 15 years so far, and hasn't found one act of violence.\"\n* \"I know of a group of fanatics who are desperately trying to undermine the Constitution of the United States by depriving artists and others of life, liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness without due process of law ... I can tell names and cite instances and I am one of the first victims of it. And if you are interested in that and also a group of ex-fascists and America-Firsters and anti-Semites, people who hate everybody including Negroes, minority groups and most likely themselves ... and these people are engaged in a conspiracy outside all the legal processes to undermine the very fundamental American concepts upon which our entire system of democracy exists.\"<ref name=\"belton\">Belton, John. ''A Theory of Justice''. 4th Edition. McGraw-Hill, 2013, p. 309f.</ref>\n* \"...I don't want to be responsible for a whole stable of informers, stool pigeons, and psychopaths and ex-political heretics, who come in here beating their breast and say, 'I am awfully sorry; I didn't know what I was doing. Please--I want absolution; get me back into pictures.'\"\n* \"My estimation of this committee is that this committee arrogates judicial and punitive powers which it does not possess.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nStander was blacklisted from the late 1940s until 1965; perhaps the longest period.<ref name=\"belton\" />\n\n===Career in independent films in Europe===\nAfter that, Stander's acting career went into a free fall. He worked as a stockbroker on [[Wall Street]], a journeyman stage actor, a corporate spokesman\u2014even a [[New Orleans]] [[Mardi Gras]] king. He didn't return to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] until 1961 (and then only briefly in a flop) and to film in 1963, in the low-budget ''The Moving Finger'' (although he did\nprovide, uncredited, the voice-over narration for the 1961 ''noir'' thriller ''[[Blast of Silence]]''.)\n\nLife improved for Stander when he moved to London in 1964 to act in [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[Saint Joan of the Stockyards]]'', directed by [[Tony Richardson]], for whom he'd acted on Broadway, along with [[Christopher Plummer]], in a 1963 production of Brecht's ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]''. In 1965, he was featured in the film ''[[Promise Her Anything]]''. That same year Richardson cast him in the [[black comedy]] about the funeral industry, ''[[The Loved One (film)|The Loved One]]'', based on [[The Loved One|the novel]] by [[Evelyn Waugh]], with an all-star cast including [[Jonathan Winters]], [[Robert Morse]], [[Liberace]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and many others. In 1966, [[Roman Polanski]] cast Stander in his only starring role, as the thug Dickie in ''[[Cul-de-sac (1966 film)|Cul-de-sac]]'', opposite [[Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac]] and [[Donald Pleasence]].\n\nStander stayed in Europe and eventually settled in Rome, where he appeared in many [[spaghetti Western]]s, most notably playing a bartender named Max in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]].'' He played the role of the villainous mob boss in [[Fernando Di Leo]]'s 1972 [[poliziottescho]] thriller ''[[Caliber 9]]''. In Rome he connected with [[Robert Wagner]], who cast him in an episode of ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' that was shot there. Stander's few English-language films in the 1970s include ''[[The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight (film)|The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight]]'' with [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Jerry Orbach]], [[Steven Spielberg|Steven Spielberg's]] ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', and [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[New York, New York (1977 film)|New York, New York]]'', which also starred De Niro and [[Liza Minnelli]].\n\nStander played a supporting role in the TV film ''Revenge Is My Destiny'' with [[Chris Robinson (actor)|Chris Robinson]]. He played a lounge comic modeled after the real-life Las Vegas comic [[Joe E. Lewis]], who used to begin his act by announcing \"Post Time\" as he sipped his ever-present drink.\n\n===''Hart to Hart'' and other roles===\nAfter 15 years abroad, Stander moved back to the U.S. for the role he is now most famous for: Max, the loyal butler, cook, and chauffeur to the wealthy, amateur detectives played by [[Robert Wagner]] and [[Stefanie Powers]] on the 1979\u20131984 television series ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' (and a subsequent series of ''Hart to Hart'' made-for-television films). In 1982, Stander won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film]].\n\nIn 1986, he became the voice of [[Prowl (Transformers)|Kup]] in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. In 1991 he was a guest star in the television series ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]'', playing Uncle Pat in the episode \"Toby or Not Toby\".

South of that, the [[Khanates of the Caucasus|Khanates of Dagestan]] were nominal vassals of Iran. The ultimate cause of the war was Russia's desire to expand to the southeast and the temporary weakness of Iran. At the start of the war, [[Siege of Isfahan|the Iranian capital was under siege]].

The mountaineers fought valiantly, but could not withstand the disciplined infantry. Utemish was burned and all the prisoners hanged in revenge for the murder of the envoys. On learning of this, the Khan of Derbent offered Peter the keys to the city in August 23. Derbent is at a narrow point on the coastal plain and has long been considered the northern gateway to Iran. While in Derbent, he learned that the flotilla had been caught in a storm and most of the supplies lost. Since there was no possibility of resupply this late in the season, he left a strong garrison at Derbent, marched back to the Terek River, took ship to Astrakhan and, on December 13, made a triumphal entry into Moscow.\n\n===Phase Two (1722/23)===\n{{unref|section|date=June 2019}}\n[[Vakhtang VI of Kartli|Vakhtang VI]] of [[Kartli]] (central Georgia) was a vassal of Iran and had been their captive for seven years. Given the weakness of Iran, he made an arrangement with Russia. In September 1722, he advanced on [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]. When the Russians did not join him, he returned to Tbilisi in November. This provocation of Iran led to a disastrous invasion of his country.\n\nBefore leaving Astrakhan, Peter, on 6 November, sent Colonel Shipov and two battalions south to occupy the Iranian city of [[Rasht]] at the southwest corner of the Caspian. The locals wanted help against the Afghans but quickly changed their minds. 15000 men were gathered, [[Tahmasp II|Shah Tamasp]] ordered the Russians out (February) and towards the end of March the Russians defeated the Iranians, [[Capture of Rasht|and had decisively taken the Caspian Sea town]].\n\nAfter a long siege on 26 June 1723 General Matyushkin took the Iranian town of [[Baku]]  and soon [[Shirvan]] to the west and then the three Iranian provinces on the south coast of the Caspian Sea. On September 12, the Russians and Iranians made a treaty in which the Russians would drive out the Afghans and restore Shah Tahmasp to the throne in return for the cession of Derbent, Baku and the three south coast provinces. Next year, Prince Meshchersky went to Iran but was unable to secure ratification and was almost killed.\n\nThe war was formally concluded by the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1723)|1723 Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], which recognized the Russian annexation of the west and south coasts of the Caspian. By the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)|1724 Treaty of Constantinople]], Russia recognized Turkish control of nearly everything west of what they had captured, thereby partitioning Transcaucasia between the two powers. The Russians lost many soldiers to disease. At the same time, [[Nader Shah]] restored Iranian power. In 1732, through the [[Treaty of Resht]], Russia withdrew to approximately the current Iranian border. In 1735, as a result of the [[Treaty of Ganja]], Russia withdrew to its former border along the [[Terek River]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe war was a costly war for both sides in different measures. Iran had lost swaths of its territories, while Russia had suffered large human losses. The campaign proved costly; of the 61,039 men who took part, 36,663 did not return.<ref name=\"History of Iran\" /> Grave damage was inflicted by the Russians on the occupied areas.<ref name=\"History of Iran\">{{cite book |first1=William Bayne |last1=Fisher |first2=P. |last2=Avery |first3=G.

There, he learned that some of his cavalry had been defeated by Kumyks and  Chechens at Enderey \u2014 the first time the two peoples had fought. Peter responded with a punitive expedition using Kalmukh troops. He went south and camped at what later became [[Makhachkala|Petrovsk]]. On August 12, he made a state entry into [[Tarki]], the capital of the [[Shamkhalate of Tarki]], where the ruler received him as a friend. Next day, he headed south to [[Derbent]], the flotilla following coastwise. He sent envoys to the next major ruler, the Sultan of Utemish.

The mountaineers fought valiantly, but could not withstand the disciplined infantry. Utemish was burned and all the prisoners hanged in revenge for the murder of the envoys. On learning of this, the Khan of Derbent offered Peter the keys to the city in August 23. Derbent is at a narrow point on the coastal plain and has long been considered the northern gateway to Iran. While in Derbent, he learned that the flotilla had been caught in a storm and most of the supplies lost. Since there was no possibility of resupply this late in the season, he left a strong garrison at Derbent, marched back to the Terek River, took ship to Astrakhan and, on December 13, made a triumphal entry into Moscow.\n\n===Phase Two (1722/23)===\n{{unref|section|date=June 2019}}\n[[Vakhtang VI of Kartli|Vakhtang VI]] of [[Kartli]] (central Georgia) was a vassal of Iran and had been their captive for seven years. Given the weakness of Iran, he made an arrangement with Russia. In September 1722, he advanced on [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]]. When the Russians did not join him, he returned to Tbilisi in November. This provocation of Iran led to a disastrous invasion of his country.\n\nBefore leaving Astrakhan, Peter, on 6 November, sent Colonel Shipov and two battalions south to occupy the Iranian city of [[Rasht]] at the southwest corner of the Caspian. The locals wanted help against the Afghans but quickly changed their minds. 15000 men were gathered, [[Tahmasp II|Shah Tamasp]] ordered the Russians out (February) and towards the end of March the Russians defeated the Iranians, [[Capture of Rasht|and had decisively taken the Caspian Sea town]].\n\nAfter a long siege on 26 June 1723 General Matyushkin took the Iranian town of [[Baku]]  and soon [[Shirvan]] to the west and then the three Iranian provinces on the south coast of the Caspian Sea. On September 12, the Russians and Iranians made a treaty in which the Russians would drive out the Afghans and restore Shah Tahmasp to the throne in return for the cession of Derbent, Baku and the three south coast provinces. Next year, Prince Meshchersky went to Iran but was unable to secure ratification and was almost killed.\n\nThe war was formally concluded by the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1723)|1723 Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], which recognized the Russian annexation of the west and south coasts of the Caspian. By the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)|1724 Treaty of Constantinople]], Russia recognized Turkish control of nearly everything west of what they had captured, thereby partitioning Transcaucasia between the two powers. The Russians lost many soldiers to disease. At the same time, [[Nader Shah]] restored Iranian power. In 1732, through the [[Treaty of Resht]], Russia withdrew to approximately the current Iranian border. In 1735, as a result of the [[Treaty of Ganja]], Russia withdrew to its former border along the [[Terek River]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe war was a costly war for both sides in different measures. Iran had lost swaths of its territories, while Russia had suffered large human losses. The campaign proved costly; of the 61,039 men who took part, 36,663 did not return.<ref name=\"History of Iran\" /> Grave damage was inflicted by the Russians on the occupied areas.<ref name=\"History of Iran\">{{cite book |first1=William Bayne |last1=Fisher |first2=P. |last2=Avery |first3=G.

They are in the same vehicle class as the discontinued [[Ford E series]] and [[Dodge Ram van]].\n\nThe term ''Chevrolet van'' also refers to the entire series of vans sold by Chevrolet.  The first '''Chevrolet van''' was released in 1961 on the Corvair platform, and the latest Chevrolet van in production is the [[Chevrolet Express]].\n\nThe G20 and its counterparts replaced the original [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Greenbrier Van which was manufactured until 1965. First fielded in the mid-1960s, the model line evolved until it was replaced in 1996 by the [[Chevrolet Express]].  1964-70 G20s came with six-lug wheels (6 lugs - 5.5\" (139.6&nbsp;mm) [[wikt:bolt circle|bolt circle]]), while the 1971\u20131995 generation came with the 5 lug - 5\" (127&nbsp;mm) bolt circle.\n\nG20s were fitted with the ball joints from the Chevrolet/GMC \u00be- and 1-ton pickups although using the \u00bd ton pickup's brake rotors.\n\nA light duty version, the G10, was produced alongside the G20\u2014the early versions used the Chevrolet passenger car wheels (5 lugs - 4.75\" (120.7&nbsp;mm) bolt circle) until 1975 (G10s manufactured prior to the 1976 model year had the smaller bolt pattern, common with the short wheelbase vans), yet can still handle LT tire sizes for better handling and stability. The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much has been done in the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.\n\nThe G20's low cost of upkeep, size, and options have made this van popular with all different kinds of trades, from plumbers to caterers.\n\n== First generation (1964\u20131966)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=OldChevyVan.jpg\n|name= First generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1964\u20131966\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Compact van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|{{convert|153|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#194|{{convert|194|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n\nThe first [[General Motors]] van was the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used a [[flat-6]] [[Opposed piston engine|opposed]] [[rear engine]] with [[Air-cooled engine|air cooling]], inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen bus]].  Production of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] ended during the 1965 model year.\n\n''First-generation Chevyvan'' refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966.  [[General Motors]] saw a market for a [[compact van]] based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]. The 1964 Chevyvan had a cab forward design with the [[engine]] placed in a \"doghouse\" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a \"[[cab over]]\" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the [[Chevy II]], a more conventional [[compact car]] than [[Chevrolet Corvair]].    This model was also sold by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as \"Handi-Van\".  The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90&nbsp;hp 153-cubic-inch [[straight-4]] or [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]].  A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass.  The first 1964 Chevyvan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes.  Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory.   In 1965, Chevy added \"Sportvan\", which featured windows actually integrated into the body.  GMC marketed their window van as \"Handi-Bus\". Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.\n\n===Updates===\n\n====1964====\nThe original \"classic\" flat windshield van. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) 153 cu in (2.51 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment with optional 120&nbsp;hp (89&nbsp;kW) 194 cu in (3.18 L) [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]] available.  The straightforward construction and a boxy design was ideal for economically hauling cargo, tools and equipment around town.  The base cargo model was the Chevyvan, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Even the heater and right front passenger seat were optional.\nThe Warner 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard with column shift.  A 2-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] was available as an option.\n\n====1965====\nFor 1965, the van remained largely unchanged.  The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling.  Seat belts were added.\nThe exciting news for the 1965 model year was the introduction of the Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus.  Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body.  A retractable rear courtesy step for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.\nThe 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder\n\n====1966====\nThis was the last year of the flat glass front end on the Chevy Vans.  Changes for 1966 include the addition of back-up lights, the side Chevyvan emblems were moved forward and now mounted on the front doors, and the antennae location was moved from the right side to the left side.  The base model \"Sportvan\" now had two additional trim packages available: Sportvan Custom and Sportvan Deluxe.  These featured available upgrades such as chrome bumpers, two tone paint, rear passenger seats, interior paneling, padded dash, chrome horn ring.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|2nd|second}}Second generation (1967\u20131970)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=1968 Sportvan Custom 108.jpg\n|name= Second generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1967\u20131970\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#283|{{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>LWB: {{convert|2743|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn 1967, Chevy Van received a major facelift, including moving the headlights down to a new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield.  The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with the addition of an optional larger cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front  which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and \"conventional\" air conditioning (with dash vents & controls)  were never available on the second-generation van.\n\n===1967===\nThe \"second-generation\" Chevy Van began with the 1967 model, with a whole new look to the van and offering a longer 108\" wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time.  GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield.  1967 was the only early 2nd generation  that did not have side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase {{convert|90|in|mm|0}} or the new optional long wheelbase {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} with 5 on 4&3/4\" lug bolt pattern.  Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van.  The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern.  The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.\nFor 1967, the 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155&nbsp;hp (116&nbsp;kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175&nbsp;hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, [[V8 engine|V8]]. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir [[master cylinder]].\n\n===1968===\nThis was the first year that Chevy vans had side-marker lights, mandated by federal government regulations. The front lights were located towards the front in the middle of the front doors, while the rear marker lights were located about a foot inward of the very back edge just below the vertical middle of the van.\n\nThe optional V-8 engine was upgraded from the 283 2-barrel (175&nbsp;HP) to the larger, more powerful 307 2-barrel V8 (200&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 300 lbs-ft torque at 2400 RPM).\n\nA column shift 4-speed transmission (Borg-Warner T10) was now available as an option, and you could get power brakes (option # J70) on the G20 3/4 tons vans.\n\n===1969===\nFor the 1969 model year, the 3-speed TH-350 [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option.\n\n\"Body-integrated\" air conditioning was an offered on the Sportvan models. This was not your typical AC setup with dash vents and controls, but rather a roof-mounted unit with a single blower duct that had adjustable louvers to direct air flow. The AC unit was independent from the cabin heater. It was operated by a single knob on a roof control panel that turned on the AC and allowed you to select the fan speed. With no actual temperature control, fan speed was the only way to adjust for desired comfort level.\n\nUp front, the Chevrolet bowtie emblem changed in color from red to blue this year.\n\n===1970===\n1970 was the last year of the square styling, front drum brakes, and I-beam front axle.  The 250 CID 6-cylinder (155Hp at 4200 rpm) was now standard equipment. In addition to the 307-2-barrel V-8, a 350-4-barrel (255&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 355 lbs-ft torque at 3000 rpm) V-8 engine may have been available as an option for the first time in 1970. It's not clear whether the 350 engine was available, since it's referenced in the owner's manual, but not mentioned in the dealer brochures. The 3-speed automatic and manual 4-speed column shift continued to be available as transmission options.\n\nAir conditioning may not have been available in 1970. It's not listed as an option in a detailed 12-page brochure, and unlike 1969, there is no mention of it in the owner's manual.\n\n== Third generation (1971\u20131995) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Chevrolet Beauville -- 01-17-2011.jpg\n| name = Third generation\n| aka = Chevrolet Beauville<br />Chevrolet Bonaventure<br />Chevrolet G series<br />[[Chevrolet Nomad]]<br />Chevrolet Sport Van<br />GMC Rally Wagon<br />GMC Vandura<br />Chevrolet Bonanza\n| production = 1971&ndash;1995\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = Full-size [[van]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[van]]<br />3+1 door [[wagon]]<br />4-door [[van]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|125|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|146|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| length = {{convert|178.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|202.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|79.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|79.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|81.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)\n| engine = [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|4.1L]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|4.3L]] [[V6]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|5.0L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|5.7L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#L29|7.4L]] V8<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2 L|6.2L diesel V8]] (1982\u201393)<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.5 L|6.5L diesel V8]] (1994\u201395)\n| layout = [[Car layout#Front-engine, rear-wheel_drive|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed automatic<br />3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual\n| assembly = [[Lordstown, Ohio]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada\n| related = [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n}}\n[[File:GMC Vandura Campwagon.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Vandura Campwagon]]\n[[File:Chevrolet Conversion Van (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Conversion Van]]\nIn 1971, Chevy Van received a major redesign, moving the engine forward of the driver with a short front clip and hood. Its UK-built counterpart, the [[Bedford CF]] (introduced in 1970), had a similar design and look, but with different specifications. The van was constructed of a solid frame and thicker floor pan steel. GM also employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]]. Suspension and steering parts came from the [[Chevrolet C/K]]. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name, while the Chevrolet equivalent vans were now given a \"G\" designation (G10, G20, and G30).\n\nFor the 1996 model year, the Chevrolet and GMC vans were replaced with the next-generation [[Chevrolet Express]] and GMC Savana with more aerodynamic styling. These vans were built on a stronger truck frame versus the previous generation's unibody construction. A left-side door was made available for the passenger van market.\n\n=== Engines ===\nThe third generation GM van was fitted with a variety of engines over its lifetime. A 4.1L (250 CID) straight six was the base engine, this was replaced by the 4.3L V6 in 1985. The 4.3L initially used a four-barrel carburetor; this was updated to TBI fuel injection in 1987. 5.0L and 5.7L small block V8s were the mainstay engines, these were also updated to fuel injection in 1987. A 7.4-liter V8 ({{Convert|230-255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm) was added in 1990, exclusive to the G30. The transmission choices were a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, or 4-speed automatic, depending on the model year. Chevrolet also offered, in 1982\u20131995, the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]].\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 1971 ====\nAll new bodystyle was introduced this year, which continued until the end of the 1995 model year. The Vandura and sister Chevy Van replaced the earlier flat front end model. The GMCs were introduced in April 1970; interior components such as the steering column and steering wheel were sourced from the [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickups. The short wheelbase vans measured {{convert|110|in|mm|0}}, while the long wheelbase was {{convert|125|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Clear blinker housings were used on early models, along with blue grille ornaments Chevrolet models.\n\n==== 1973 ====\nFor 1973, the dashboard was redesigned, steering wheel and side fender badges became similar to that used on the new for 1973 pickups and the Chevrolet bowtie grille emblem was changed from blue to yellow. In these 73-77 Chevy Van years you could order a custom van of your dreams, complete with shag carpet and side pipe exhaust from the comfort of the Chevrolet dealership, through a company called \"Van-Tastic\" owned by Hop Cap Inc. in Bremen, Indiana. During the same period, GMC offered cutaway versions called the MagnaVan, while Chevrolet offered a similar version called the \"Hi-Cube Van.\" In 1975 the Chevy G20 series had a Surveyor line of class B motorhomes offered by Futura. The Surveyor came equipped with a bathroom, refrigerator, stove/oven, hot/cold sink and sleeping for four. The Surveyor is almost identical to the Open Road line of class B coaches offered by Chevrolet but the production numbers are significantly fewer.\n\n==== 1978 ====\n[[File:78-82 Chevrolet Van.jpg|thumb|left|1980\u20131982 Chevrolet Van]]\nThe front sheet metal was updated. Changes include a new, built-out plastic grille with integrated blinkers (grille assembly sourced from the C/K truck), different fenders, round headlamps on lower-end models and square headlamps on higher-end models. The dashboard was redesigned and would remain mostly unchanged until the end of production in 1995. Front and rear bumpers were enlarged. Chrome grille required square headlamps.\n\n=== 1979 === <ref>CGL1590107240</ref>\nThere is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 Model G 10 Chevrolet Panel Van Veh. WT. 01800 Reg. Gross WT. 02500\n\n==== 1980-1983 ====\nAll 1980 vans were given new rear-view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. Some models got electronic spark control.\n[[File:Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville]]\nChevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome side marker lights and trim around the tail lamps. Also, the only G-series vans that had chrome grille and round headlamps from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option. For 1982, the locking steering column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the steering column.\n\nAfter 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated to the floor and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.\n[[File:Long Beach Comic Expo 2012 - A-Team van (7186650356).jpg|thumb|Custom 1983 [[The A-Team|A-Team]] van]]\nThe 6.2-litre Diesel was first available and four headlamps, stacked in pairs, were introduced, along with a revised grille. Base models continued with two headlamps. All van models now had rectangular headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission, because the steering column was retilted to be similar to the C/K trucks and all manual transmission levers wee now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive was introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission was introduced. This version was made famous by the American television series ''[[The A-Team]]''.\n\n==== 1984-1989 ====\nNew swing-out side doors were introduced to go with the standard sliding side door. The doors were a 60/40 split. It was the final year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options. For 1985, the taillight and side marker lenses were redesigned. New grille treatment similar to the pickups. Front doors were redesigned with raised body line. For 1986 and 1987, most engines were fuel-injected and a 4.3-liter [[V6]] replaced the old 4.1-liter [[Straight-6|inline six]] 115&nbsp;hp. A 6.2-litre Diesel engine was available in 165&nbsp;hp. A carbureted 5.7-liter 152&nbsp;hp [[V8 engine]] (option LE9) was also available in the 49-state version, with fuel injection for California-emission vehicles only. In 1989, a TBI 454 C.I. G30 was introduced.\n\n==== 1990 ====\nUnlike the [[Dodge Ram Wagon]] and [[Ford Econoline]] vans, which had a welded-on body extension, a {{convert|146|in|mm|0|adj=on}} extended wheelbase<ref>{{Cite web|title=1990 Chevy Van/Vandura|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/G-Van/1990-Chevrolet-G-Van.pdf|website=www.gmheritagecenter.com|publisher=GM Heritage Center|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC crew cab truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.\n\n==== 1992-1995 ====\n[[File:GMC-Vandura-Rally.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Vandura Rally]]\nIn 1992, there was a facelift using the front grille from the former Chevrolet/GMC R/V-series pickups and [[SUV]]s ([[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], Crew Cab/Dually), previously phased out of production in 1991.\nG30 models getting the 4L80E transmission as standard. The 4L80E/4L60E [[automatic transmission]] was introduced, replacing the TH400/TH700R4. Brake-shift interlock became a standard, new-for-1993 feature, which required the brake pedal to be depressed in order to shift from park. A 4-wheel antilock brake system was also a standard, new-for-1993 feature. For 1994, a driver's side airbag and center high mount stop lamp were made standard, as well as CFC-free refrigerant in models equipped with air conditioning. For 1995, a new longer nose and four-headlamp design was introduced (similar to the C/K of the same era), which became a very popular school bus conversion. The engine was also revised, with the 4.3L V6, now labeled the \"Vortec\". Engine sizes remained about the same (4.3L, 5.7L, 7.4L, and a 6.5L normally-aspirated Diesel). Several versions of the van were available for purchase depending on the buyer's needs. The base trim was essentially a stripped down model, with no frills, a very limited interior, and no rear seats. The \"Sportvan\" had all the features of a full conversion van, but lacked rear seats and a fiberglass roof extension. Finally, the \"Conversion\" models were sent from the factory bare-bones, to have the interior and exterior upgrades added by third-party companies such as \"Mark III, Tiara, Coach, Starcraft, etc.\"\n\n==Concept vehicles==\nIn 1966, General Motors developed the [[concept vehicle]] Electrovan, based on the GMC Handi-Van.  The vehicle used a [[Union Carbide]] cryogenic [[fuel cell]] to power a 115-horsepower electric motor.  It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/business/private-sector-an-electrovan-not-an-edsel.html?scp=1&sq=An%20Electrovan,%20Not%20an%20Edsel |title=Private Sector; An Electrovan, Not an Edsel |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Hall, Douglas Kent (1977).

They are in the same vehicle class as the discontinued [[Ford E series]] and [[Dodge Ram van]].\n\nThe term ''Chevrolet van'' also refers to the entire series of vans sold by Chevrolet.  The first '''Chevrolet van''' was released in 1961 on the Corvair platform, and the latest Chevrolet van in production is the [[Chevrolet Express]].\n\nThe G20 and its counterparts replaced the original [[Chevrolet Corvair]] Greenbrier Van which was manufactured until 1965. First fielded in the mid-1960s, the model line evolved until it was replaced in 1996 by the [[Chevrolet Express]].  1964-70 G20s came with six-lug wheels (6 lugs - 5.5\" (139.6&nbsp;mm) [[wikt:bolt circle|bolt circle]]), while the 1971\u20131995 generation came with the 5 lug - 5\" (127&nbsp;mm) bolt circle.\n\nG20s were fitted with the ball joints from the Chevrolet/GMC \u00be- and 1-ton pickups although using the \u00bd ton pickup's brake rotors.\n\nA light duty version, the G10, was produced alongside the G20\u2014the early versions used the Chevrolet passenger car wheels (5 lugs - 4.75\" (120.7&nbsp;mm) bolt circle) until 1975 (G10s manufactured prior to the 1976 model year had the smaller bolt pattern, common with the short wheelbase vans), yet can still handle LT tire sizes for better handling and stability. The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much has been done in the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.\n\nThe G20's low cost of upkeep, size, and options have made this van popular with all different kinds of trades, from plumbers to caterers.\n\n== First generation (1964\u20131966)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=OldChevyVan.jpg\n|name= First generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1964\u20131966\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Compact van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet 153 4-cylinder engine|{{convert|153|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#194|{{convert|194|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}}}\n\nThe first [[General Motors]] van was the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]-based [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, or Corvan introduced for 1961, which used a [[flat-6]] [[Opposed piston engine|opposed]] [[rear engine]] with [[Air-cooled engine|air cooling]], inspired by the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen bus]].  Production of the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] ended during the 1965 model year.\n\n''First-generation Chevyvan'' refers to the first G-10 half-ton production years 1964 through 1966.  [[General Motors]] saw a market for a [[compact van]] based on a modified passenger car platform to compete with the already successful [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]] and [[Dodge A100]]. The 1964 Chevyvan had a cab forward design with the [[engine]] placed in a \"doghouse\" between and behind the front seats. The implementation of situating the driver on top of the front axle with the engine near the front wheels is called internationally a \"[[cab over]]\" vehicle. Engines and brakes were sourced from the [[Chevy II]], a more conventional [[compact car]] than [[Chevrolet Corvair]].    This model was also sold by [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] as \"Handi-Van\".  The 1st Gen vans were available in only the short 90-inch wheelbase and were only sold with the standard 90&nbsp;hp 153-cubic-inch [[straight-4]] or [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]].  A first gen is quickly identified by its single piece flat windshield glass.  The first 1964 Chevyvan was originally marketed and sold as a panel van for purely utilitarian purposes.  Windows were available as an option, but were simply cut into the sides from the factory.   In 1965, Chevy added \"Sportvan\", which featured windows actually integrated into the body.  GMC marketed their window van as \"Handi-Bus\". Air conditioning, power steering and power brakes were not available in the 1st generation vans.\n\n===Updates===\n\n====1964====\nThe original \"classic\" flat windshield van. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) 153 cu in (2.51 L) four-cylinder engine was standard equipment with optional 120&nbsp;hp (89&nbsp;kW) 194 cu in (3.18 L) [[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine]] available.  The straightforward construction and a boxy design was ideal for economically hauling cargo, tools and equipment around town.  The base cargo model was the Chevyvan, available with or without windows and side cargo doors. Even the heater and right front passenger seat were optional.\nThe Warner 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard with column shift.  A 2-speed [[Powerglide]] [[automatic transmission]] was available as an option.\n\n====1965====\nFor 1965, the van remained largely unchanged.  The grille openings were widened, and received one additional slot just above the bumper to increase cooling.  Seat belts were added.\nThe exciting news for the 1965 model year was the introduction of the Chevy Sportvan and GMC Handi-Bus.  Sportvan was a passenger friendly van with windows molded into the van body.  A retractable rear courtesy step for the passenger side doors was used on the Sportvan.\nThe 194 6-cylinder engine was now standard equipment, with an available 'Hi-Torque' 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder\n\n====1966====\nThis was the last year of the flat glass front end on the Chevy Vans.  Changes for 1966 include the addition of back-up lights, the side Chevyvan emblems were moved forward and now mounted on the front doors, and the antennae location was moved from the right side to the left side.  The base model \"Sportvan\" now had two additional trim packages available: Sportvan Custom and Sportvan Deluxe.  These featured available upgrades such as chrome bumpers, two tone paint, rear passenger seats, interior paneling, padded dash, chrome horn ring.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=={{anchor|2nd|second}}Second generation (1967\u20131970)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=1968 Sportvan Custom 108.jpg\n|name= Second generation\n|aka=Chevrolet Sportvan<br>GMC Handi-Van<br>GMC Handi-Bus\n|production=1967\u20131970\n|assembly=[[Pontiac, Michigan]], U.S.\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|class=[[Van]]\n|body_style=3+1 door [[van]]\n|layout=[[FMR layout]]\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#230|{{convert|230|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#283|{{convert|283|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|wheelbase=SWB: {{convert|2286|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br>LWB: {{convert|2743|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn 1967, Chevy Van received a major facelift, including moving the headlights down to a new redesigned grille, larger, rectangular tail lights and a curved windshield.  The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was lengthened, widened and slightly relocated in order to fit an optional [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with the addition of an optional larger cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front  which included a low-profile tunnel allowing more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen vans were available in either the 90-inch or the longer 108-inch wheelbase. Power steering and \"conventional\" air conditioning (with dash vents & controls)  were never available on the second-generation van.\n\n===1967===\nThe \"second-generation\" Chevy Van began with the 1967 model, with a whole new look to the van and offering a longer 108\" wheelbase and V8 power to buyers for the first time.  GM designers moved the headlights down to a new grille, added longer, rectangular tail lights and a rounded glass windshield.  1967 was the only early 2nd generation  that did not have side marker lights. The forward control cab design was retained, but the doghouse was widened and lengthened in order to fit the optional [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine]].  Engine cooling was improved with redesigned doghouse, the addition of a larger optional cross-flow type radiator and a redesigned front floor tunnel more fresh air to the radiator. The 2nd gen G-10 vans were available in the original short wheelbase {{convert|90|in|mm|0}} or the new optional long wheelbase {{convert|108|in|mm|0|adj=on}} with 5 on 4&3/4\" lug bolt pattern.  Another feature in 1967 was the availability of a new G-20 heavy duty 3/4 ton van.  The G-20 featured heavier suspension, a 12 bolt rear axle and increased hauling capability with a 6 lug bolt pattern.  The G-20 model was available only on the 108 long wheelbase.\nFor 1967, the 140&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) 230 cu in (3.8 L) six-cylinder was now standard, with the optional 155&nbsp;hp (116&nbsp;kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) six-cylinder or the 175&nbsp;hp, 283 cu in (4.64 L) 2-barrel, [[V8 engine|V8]]. Brakes were now upgraded to a safer split system including a dual reservoir [[master cylinder]].\n\n===1968===\nThis was the first year that Chevy vans had side-marker lights, mandated by federal government regulations. The front lights were located towards the front in the middle of the front doors, while the rear marker lights were located about a foot inward of the very back edge just below the vertical middle of the van.\n\nThe optional V-8 engine was upgraded from the 283 2-barrel (175&nbsp;HP) to the larger, more powerful 307 2-barrel V8 (200&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 300 lbs-ft torque at 2400 RPM).\n\nA column shift 4-speed transmission (Borg-Warner T10) was now available as an option, and you could get power brakes (option # J70) on the G20 3/4 tons vans.\n\n===1969===\nFor the 1969 model year, the 3-speed TH-350 [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[automatic transmission]] was an option.\n\n\"Body-integrated\" air conditioning was an offered on the Sportvan models. This was not your typical AC setup with dash vents and controls, but rather a roof-mounted unit with a single blower duct that had adjustable louvers to direct air flow. The AC unit was independent from the cabin heater. It was operated by a single knob on a roof control panel that turned on the AC and allowed you to select the fan speed. With no actual temperature control, fan speed was the only way to adjust for desired comfort level.\n\nUp front, the Chevrolet bowtie emblem changed in color from red to blue this year.\n\n===1970===\n1970 was the last year of the square styling, front drum brakes, and I-beam front axle.  The 250 CID 6-cylinder (155Hp at 4200 rpm) was now standard equipment. In addition to the 307-2-barrel V-8, a 350-4-barrel (255&nbsp;HP at 4600 rpm, 355 lbs-ft torque at 3000 rpm) V-8 engine may have been available as an option for the first time in 1970. It's not clear whether the 350 engine was available, since it's referenced in the owner's manual, but not mentioned in the dealer brochures. The 3-speed automatic and manual 4-speed column shift continued to be available as transmission options.\n\nAir conditioning may not have been available in 1970. It's not listed as an option in a detailed 12-page brochure, and unlike 1969, there is no mention of it in the owner's manual.\n\n== Third generation (1971\u20131995) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = Chevrolet Beauville -- 01-17-2011.jpg\n| name = Third generation\n| aka = Chevrolet Beauville<br />Chevrolet Bonaventure<br />Chevrolet G series<br />[[Chevrolet Nomad]]<br />Chevrolet Sport Van<br />GMC Rally Wagon<br />GMC Vandura<br />Chevrolet Bonanza\n| production = 1971&ndash;1995\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| class = Full-size [[van]]\n| body_style = 3-door [[van]]<br />3+1 door [[wagon]]<br />4-door [[van]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|125|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|146|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| length = {{convert|178.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|202.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|223.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (EWB)\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|79.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|79.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)<br />{{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (SWB)<br />{{convert|81.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (LWB)\n| engine = [[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|4.1L]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />[[General Motors 90\u00b0 V6 engine#LB1 and LB4|4.3L]] [[V6]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|5.0L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|5.7L]] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br />[[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#L29|7.4L]] V8<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2 L|6.2L diesel V8]] (1982\u201393)<br />[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.5 L|6.5L diesel V8]] (1994\u201395)\n| layout = [[Car layout#Front-engine, rear-wheel_drive|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed automatic<br />3-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed manual\n| assembly = [[Lordstown, Ohio]], United States<br />[[Flint, Michigan]], United States<br />[[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]], Canada\n| related = [[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n}}\n[[File:GMC Vandura Campwagon.jpg|thumb|left|GMC Vandura Campwagon]]\n[[File:Chevrolet Conversion Van (Auto classique Laval '11).JPG|thumb|left|Chevrolet Conversion Van]]\nIn 1971, Chevy Van received a major redesign, moving the engine forward of the driver with a short front clip and hood. Its UK-built counterpart, the [[Bedford CF]] (introduced in 1970), had a similar design and look, but with different specifications. The van was constructed of a solid frame and thicker floor pan steel. GM also employed stronger truck style hubs and brakes with dual A-arm independent front suspension. The major restyle followed the engine-forward design of the competing 1968 [[Ford E series|Ford Econoline]]. Suspension and steering parts came from the [[Chevrolet C/K]]. GMC now marketed their vans under the VanDura name, while the Chevrolet equivalent vans were now given a \"G\" designation (G10, G20, and G30).\n\nFor the 1996 model year, the Chevrolet and GMC vans were replaced with the next-generation [[Chevrolet Express]] and GMC Savana with more aerodynamic styling. These vans were built on a stronger truck frame versus the previous generation's unibody construction. A left-side door was made available for the passenger van market.\n\n=== Engines ===\nThe third generation GM van was fitted with a variety of engines over its lifetime. A 4.1L (250 CID) straight six was the base engine, this was replaced by the 4.3L V6 in 1985. The 4.3L initially used a four-barrel carburetor; this was updated to TBI fuel injection in 1987. 5.0L and 5.7L small block V8s were the mainstay engines, these were also updated to fuel injection in 1987. A 7.4-liter V8 ({{Convert|230-255|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|385|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3600 rpm) was added in 1990, exclusive to the G30. The transmission choices were a three-speed manual, three-speed automatic, four-speed manual, or 4-speed automatic, depending on the model year. Chevrolet also offered, in 1982\u20131995, the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine]].\n\n=== Updates ===\n==== 1971 ====\nAll new bodystyle was introduced this year, which continued until the end of the 1995 model year. The Vandura and sister Chevy Van replaced the earlier flat front end model. The GMCs were introduced in April 1970; interior components such as the steering column and steering wheel were sourced from the [[Chevrolet C/K]] pickups. The short wheelbase vans measured {{convert|110|in|mm|0}}, while the long wheelbase was {{convert|125|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheelbase. Clear blinker housings were used on early models, along with blue grille ornaments Chevrolet models.\n\n==== 1973 ====\nFor 1973, the dashboard was redesigned, steering wheel and side fender badges became similar to that used on the new for 1973 pickups and the Chevrolet bowtie grille emblem was changed from blue to yellow. In these 73-77 Chevy Van years you could order a custom van of your dreams, complete with shag carpet and side pipe exhaust from the comfort of the Chevrolet dealership, through a company called \"Van-Tastic\" owned by Hop Cap Inc. in Bremen, Indiana. During the same period, GMC offered cutaway versions called the MagnaVan, while Chevrolet offered a similar version called the \"Hi-Cube Van.\" In 1975 the Chevy G20 series had a Surveyor line of class B motorhomes offered by Futura. The Surveyor came equipped with a bathroom, refrigerator, stove/oven, hot/cold sink and sleeping for four. The Surveyor is almost identical to the Open Road line of class B coaches offered by Chevrolet but the production numbers are significantly fewer.\n\n==== 1978 ====\n[[File:78-82 Chevrolet Van.jpg|thumb|left|1980\u20131982 Chevrolet Van]]\nThe front sheet metal was updated. Changes include a new, built-out plastic grille with integrated blinkers (grille assembly sourced from the C/K truck), different fenders, round headlamps on lower-end models and square headlamps on higher-end models. The dashboard was redesigned and would remain mostly unchanged until the end of production in 1995. Front and rear bumpers were enlarged. Chrome grille required square headlamps.\n\n1979 Chevrolet Panel Van \nThere is a Concept Pre-production Built in 1979 Model G 10 Veh. WT. 01800 Reg. Gross WT. 02500\n\n==== 1980-1983 ====\nAll 1980 vans were given new rear-view mirrors on the driver and passenger doors. Some models got electronic spark control.\n[[File:Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Chevrolet Sportvan Beauville]]\nChevrolet offers Bonaventure trim for 1981 and 82 with chrome bumpers, chrome side marker lights and trim around the tail lamps. Also, the only G-series vans that had chrome grille and round headlamps from the factory. Any other G van with a chrome grille from 1978-1982 required the rectangular headlamp option. For 1982, the locking steering column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and wiper switch were relocated to the steering column.\n\nAfter 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated to the floor and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.\n[[File:Long Beach Comic Expo 2012 - A-Team van (7186650356).jpg|thumb|Custom 1983 [[The A-Team|A-Team]] van]]\nThe 6.2-litre Diesel was first available and four headlamps, stacked in pairs, were introduced, along with a revised grille. Base models continued with two headlamps. All van models now had rectangular headlamps. From this model year on, tilt steering was available with a manual transmission, because the steering column was retilted to be similar to the C/K trucks and all manual transmission levers wee now on the floor. New steering wheels were introduced as well to be similar to the Monte Carlo/Malibu. Automatic overdrive was introduced. 4-speed manual 117M transmission was introduced. This version was made famous by the American television series ''[[The A-Team]]''.\n\n==== 1984-1989 ====\nNew swing-out side doors were introduced to go with the standard sliding side door. The doors were a 60/40 split. It was the final year for chrome trim side marker lamps and chrome trim around tail lamps options. For 1985, the taillight and side marker lenses were redesigned. New grille treatment similar to the pickups. Front doors were redesigned with raised body line. For 1986 and 1987, most engines were fuel-injected and a 4.3-liter [[V6]] replaced the old 4.1-liter [[Straight-6|inline six]] 115&nbsp;hp. A 6.2-litre Diesel engine was available in 165&nbsp;hp. A carbureted 5.7-liter 152&nbsp;hp [[V8 engine]] (option LE9) was also available in the 49-state version, with fuel injection for California-emission vehicles only. In 1989, a TBI 454 C.I. G30 was introduced.\n\n==== 1990 ====\nUnlike the [[Dodge Ram Wagon]] and [[Ford Econoline]] vans, which had a welded-on body extension, a {{convert|146|in|mm|0|adj=on}} extended wheelbase<ref>{{Cite web|title=1990 Chevy Van/Vandura|url=https://www.gmheritagecenter.com/docs/gm-heritage-archive/vehicle-information-kits/G-Van/1990-Chevrolet-G-Van.pdf|website=www.gmheritagecenter.com|publisher=GM Heritage Center|access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> was introduced (about the same length as a Chevrolet/GMC crew cab truck). This was done to accommodate an extra bench seat, finally giving GM a 15-passenger van. GM was the last American automaker to produce such a van, with Dodge introducing the genre in 1971 and Ford joining them in 1978.\n\n==== 1992-1995 ====\n[[File:GMC-Vandura-Rally.jpg|thumb|right|GMC Vandura Rally]]\nIn 1992, there was a facelift using the front grille from the former Chevrolet/GMC R/V-series pickups and [[SUV]]s ([[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Blazer]], [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban]], Crew Cab/Dually), previously phased out of production in 1991.\nG30 models getting the 4L80E transmission as standard. The 4L80E/4L60E [[automatic transmission]] was introduced, replacing the TH400/TH700R4. Brake-shift interlock became a standard, new-for-1993 feature, which required the brake pedal to be depressed in order to shift from park. A 4-wheel antilock brake system was also a standard, new-for-1993 feature. For 1994, a driver's side airbag and center high mount stop lamp were made standard, as well as CFC-free refrigerant in models equipped with air conditioning. For 1995, a new longer nose and four-headlamp design was introduced (similar to the C/K of the same era), which became a very popular school bus conversion. The engine was also revised, with the 4.3L V6, now labeled the \"Vortec\". Engine sizes remained about the same (4.3L, 5.7L, 7.4L, and a 6.5L normally-aspirated Diesel). Several versions of the van were available for purchase depending on the buyer's needs. The base trim was essentially a stripped down model, with no frills, a very limited interior, and no rear seats. The \"Sportvan\" had all the features of a full conversion van, but lacked rear seats and a fiberglass roof extension. Finally, the \"Conversion\" models were sent from the factory bare-bones, to have the interior and exterior upgrades added by third-party companies such as \"Mark III, Tiara, Coach, Starcraft, etc.\"\n\n==Concept vehicles==\nIn 1966, General Motors developed the [[concept vehicle]] Electrovan, based on the GMC Handi-Van.  The vehicle used a [[Union Carbide]] cryogenic [[fuel cell]] to power a 115-horsepower electric motor.  It never went into production due to cost issues and safety concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/17/business/private-sector-an-electrovan-not-an-edsel.html?scp=1&sq=An%20Electrovan,%20Not%20an%20Edsel |title=Private Sector; An Electrovan, Not an Edsel |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-11-17 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Hall, Douglas Kent (1977).

Which is arguably the best level in the game. In the level, the player controls Joseph Allen, an undercover [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent who participates in a [[mass shooting]] at a [[Moscow]] airport to gain the trust of a Russian [[terrorist]] group. The leader of the terrorists, Vladimir Makarov, tells his co-conspirators, \"Remember, no Russian\", implying that speaking Russian would reveal their ethnic origins and affiliation to the Russian ultranationalists. At the end of the level, Makarov kills Allen and reveals that he intended for Russian officials to find Allen's body and believe that the attack was instigated by the United States.\n\nThe level itself is preceded by a warning that the level contains \"disturbing content which may offend some players\". It also instructs that the level is entirely optional.\n\nGame designer [[Mohammad Alavi (game developer)|Mohammad Alavi]] was heavily involved in the level's development. Alavi wanted the level to explain why Russia would invade the United States, and create an emotional connection<!--bond?--> between the player and Makarov. Much of the level's development was spent designing the massacre portion, which Alavi did not want to feel too contrived or traumatic. ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2''{{'s}} developer [[Infinity Ward]] and publisher [[Activision]] were both supportive of the level's inclusion, though several [[game testing|game testers]] expressed disapproval and one refused to play the level at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/from-all-ghillied-up-to-no-russian-the-making-of-call-of-dutys-most-famous-levels/2/|title=From All Ghillied Up to No Russian, the making of Call of Duty's most famous levels|last=Evans-Thirlwell|first=Edwin|date=2016-07-13|website=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future Plc]]|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the release of ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'', gameplay footage from \"No Russian\" was leaked on the Internet. This early footage divided opinions among video game journalists, although most decided to wait until they could play the level to judge its quality. After the game's release, \"No Russian\" sparked significant controversy for letting players partake in a terrorist attack. Journalists described the level's plot as illogical and derided the ability to skip the level. Due to the level's graphic content, ''Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2'' was subject to censorship in international versions of the game. \"No Russian\" was removed entirely from Russian versions.
