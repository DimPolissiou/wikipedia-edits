In October he sojourned for six days and nights in the Bonaventure cemetery, sleeping upon graves overnight, this being the safest and cheapest accommodation that he could find while he waited for money to be expressed from home. He found the cemetery even then breathtakingly beautiful and inspiring and wrote a lengthy chapter upon it, \"Camping in the Tombs.\"\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Part of the grounds was cultivated and planted with live-oak (''[[Quercus virginiana]]''), about a hundred years ago, by a wealthy gentleman who had his country residence here But much the greater part is undisturbed. Even those spots which are disordered by art, Nature is ever at work to reclaim, and to make them look as if the foot of man had never known them. Only a small plot of ground is occupied with graves and the old mansion is in ruins.\n\nThe most conspicuous glory of Bonaventure is its noble avenue of live-oaks. They are the most magnificent planted trees I have ever seen, about fifty feet high and perhaps three or four feet in diameter, with broad spreading leafy heads. The main branches reach out horizontally until they come together over the driveway, embowering it throughout its entire length, while each branch is adorned like a garden with ferns, flowers, grasses, and dwarf palmettos.\n\nBut of all the plants of these curious tree-gardens the most striking and characteristic is the so-called Long Moss ([[Spanish moss|''Tillandsia usneoides'']]). It drapes all the branches from top to bottom, hanging in long silvery-gray skeins, reaching a length of not less than eight or ten feet, and when slowly waving in the wind they produce a solemn funereal effect singularly impressive.\n\nThere are also thousands of smaller trees and clustered bushes, covered almost from sight in the glorious brightness of their own light. The place is half surrounded by the salt marshes and islands of the river, their reeds and sedges making a delightful fringe. Many bald eagles roost among the trees along the side of the marsh. Their screams are heard every morning, joined with the noise of crows and the songs of countless warblers, hidden deep in their dwellings of leafy bowers. Large flocks of butterflies, flies, all kinds of happy insects, seem to be in a perfect fever of joy and sportive gladness. The whole place seems like a center of life. The dead do not reign there alone.\n\nBonaventure to me is one of the most impressive assemblages of animal and plant creatures I ever met. I was fresh from the Western prairies, the garden-like openings of Wisconsin, the beech and maple and oak woods of Indiana and Kentucky, the dark mysterious Savannah cypress forests; but never since I was allowed to walk the woods have I found so impressive a company of trees as the [[Tillandsia|tillandsia-draped]] oaks of Bonaventure.\n\nI gazed awe-stricken as one new-arrived from another world. Bonaventure is called a graveyard, a town of the dead, but the few graves are powerless in such a depth of life. The rippling of living waters, the song of birds, the joyous confidence of flowers, the calm, undisturbable grandeur of the oaks, mark this place of graves as one of the Lord\u2019s most favored abodes of life and light.\"<br>\n- [[wikisource:A Thousand-Mile Walk To The Gulf/Chapter 4|\"Camping in the Tombs,\" from ''A Thousand Mile Walk'']]\n</blockquote><gallery mode=\"packed-hover\">\nFile:Bonaventure cemetery - theus7351.JPG|Theus tomb\nFile:Bonaventure cemetery - baldwin 7356.JPG|Baldwin tomb\nFile:BoneventureCemetry21.jpg|\"Gracie\"\nFile:BoneventureCemetry28.jpg|Lawton grave\nFile:GenRHAnderson.jpg|R H Anderson\nFile:AndersonFamilyGravesite.jpg|Anderson Family Gravesite\nFile:SpanAmWarVets.jpg|Spanish-American War Veterans\nFile:Bonaventure Cemetery, Savannah, GA, US (22).jpg|Statue\n</gallery>\n\n==Operations==\nCitizens of Savannah and others may purchase interment rights in Bonaventure.<ref name=\"CityNotes\" />\n\nThe cemetery is open to the public daily from 8:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. There is no admission fee.<ref name=\"CityNotes\" />\n\nAdjacent to Bonaventure Cemetery is the privately owned and newer Forest Lawn Cemetery and Columbarium.\n\n==Department of Cemeteries==\nThe main office of the City of Savannah's Department of Cemeteries is located on the Bonaventure Cemetery grounds in the Bonaventure Administrative Building at the entrance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.savannahga.gov/cityweb/cemeteriesweb.nsf|title=Cemeteries Department Home Page}}</ref>\n\n==Bonaventure Historical Society==\nThe cemetery became the subject of a non-profit group, the Bonaventure Historical Society, in May 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonaventurehistorical.org|title=Bonaventure Historical Society}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&p_theme=at&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADA4BCE62CE3AA&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Group enjoys working to keep up grounds of old Savannah cemetery |date=November 2, 1999 |work=The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution |page=B4|accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB864755364102681500?mod=googlewsj|title=Good and Evil and Cookies Help Savannah Charities |last=Greene|first=Kelly|work=The Wall Street Journal|date= May 28, 1997|accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref> The group has compiled an index of the burials at the cemetery.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MT&s_site=macon&p_multi=MT&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB76C7F5BC3031F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=New index helps preserve data from Savannah graveyard|date=August 26, 2000|work=Macon Telegraph|page=2 B |accessdate=2009-10-31}}</ref>\n\n==The Bird Girl==\nThe cover photograph for the best-selling book ''[[Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil]]'', taken by [[Jack Leigh]], featured an evocative sculpture of a young girl, the so-called ''[[Bird Girl]]'', that had been in the cemetery, essentially unnoticed, for over 50 years.

It is operated by Wellington suburban operator [[Transdev Wellington|Transdev]] (with [[KiwiRail]] sub-contracted to operate the locomotives) under contract from the Greater Wellington Regional Council. It is a [[diesel locomotive|diesel]]-hauled carriage service, introduced by the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] in 1964 after passenger demand between Masterton to Wellington exceeded the capacity of the diesel railcars then used.\n\nThe {{convert|91|km|adj=on}} service operates five times daily in each direction Monday to Friday, three peak and two off-peak, with an additional service each way on Friday nights and two services each way on weekends and public holidays. It stops at all stations from Masterton to [[Upper Hutt Railway Station|Upper Hutt]], then runs express along the [[Hutt Valley Line]] to Wellington, stopping only at [[Waterloo Interchange (Hutt Central) Railway Station|Waterloo]] and [[Petone Railway Station|Petone]] stations.\n\nWhile all other regional passenger trains in New Zealand have been withdrawn (apart from the [[Capital Connection]] commuter service to [[Palmerston North]]), the Wairarapa Connection service continues due to the Wairarapa's proximity to Wellington and the advantage of the 8.8&nbsp;km [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] through the [[Rimutaka Ranges]] compared to the narrow and winding Rimutaka Hill Road over them. In the year to 30 June 2013, the service's ridership was 705,000, down slightly from 719,000 in the 2011/12-year.<ref name=\"patronage\" />\n\n==History==\nBefore the Wairarapa Connection, [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88 seater railcar]]s were used between Masterton and Wellington. They had replaced the [[steam locomotive|steam]]-hauled [[mixed train]]s and [[NZR RM class (Wairarapa)|Wairarapa class]] [[railcar]]s in 1955, when the [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] opened and the line became the first fully dieselised line in New Zealand. The [[Wairarapa Mail]] carriage train ran between Wellington and Woodville until 1948.\n\nIn 1964, the demand between Masterton and Wellington was exceeding the capacity of the 88-seater railcars, with a capacity of 176 with two railcars. The solution was to introduce a diesel-hauled carriage service.\n\n===Carriage history===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\nIn 1964 six [[NZR 56-foot carriage|56-foot carriages]]s from the [[South Island]] were transferred north and fitted with Webasto kerosene-burning heaters for the service. They seated 336 passengers on two-person bench-type [[Scarrett]] seats: class A passenger cars seated 56 and AL car-vans (with luggage compartment) seated 47.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|date=Autumn 1964|issn=0028-8624|number=99|volume=21 No. 1|title=Train replaces Railcar|page=25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976 three more As and an AL were added, later joined by another A and AL, all overhauled. They were fitted with fluorescent strip lighting similar to [[Northerner (train)|Northerner]] and [[Endeavour (train)|Endeavour]] cars, and painted in a new, brighter shade of red, with white roofs as opposed to the standard silver oxide.\n\nIn the early 1980s, with the refurbishment of the Picton and Greymouth services and the decision to use the former Endeavour carriages on new Gisborne-Wellington services, former [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] railcars painted a distinctive green and nicknamed [[NZR RM class (88 seater)#Grassgrubs|\"Grass Grubs\"]], were introduced to the Wairarapa service. However, the underframes were not designed to be towed in the long term and they deteriorated rapidly, bringing about their demise by 1985. \n\nThe introduction of the [[New Zealand EM class electric multiple unit|EM class \"Ganz-Mavag\"]] [[electric multiple unit]]s to the Wellington suburban system meant eleven 56-foot carriages became available, and the cancellation of the unnamed daylight successor to the [[New Plymouth Night Express]] that ran between [[New Plymouth]] and [[Taumaranui]] freed more. A wooden 50-foot Z bogie box wagon was refitted with bogies that enabled it to run at passenger-train speed and was painted the same shade of bright red as the cars it accompanied. In the style of the new Fastrak and Northtrak express parcels logos that emphasised the new approach and priority of parcels traffic, the wagon had a logo known as Waitrak, as it was dedicated to Wairarapa services.\n\nIn 1989, with the introduction of the [[Bay Express]] between Wellington and Napier, the three remaining [[Endeavour (train)|Endeavour]] cars, of which two were ALs, became redundant, so the 54-seat A car and one 46-seat AL were assigned to Wairarapa services. With the streamlining of Greymouth expresses into one out-and-back operation, one Picton car became surplus to requirements and joined the Masterton fleet.\n\nIn 1993, after the successful re-introduction and rebranding of the Capital Connection service, a similar refurbishment and rebranding program was initiated for the sixteen Wairarapa carriages, though only 12 were actually overhauled. This program lasted four years, until 1997. Six A cars and three of four ALs were thoroughly overhauled and refurbished with a new-style seats. These vehicles were fitted with cloth on the interior walls to reduce noise and were fully carpeted. A cars seated 59, as one toilet from each car was removed to increase [[seating capacity]], while ALs seated 46. The other two A cars and the remaining AL were overhauled but retained their Scarrett seats, reupholstered with cloth material.\n\nThe overhauls saw the introduction of the new [[InterCity Rail]] blue livery, with a 220-mm white stripe and 100-mm green band inside it running the length of each car, with \"Cityrail\" emblazoned on both ends of each car. In 1995, as an interim measure leading up to the phasing in of the new all-over Cato blue livery of the new [[Tranz Rail]] corporate image, a light blue 350-mm full-length stripe was introduced, and a new name for Cityrail, [[Tranz Metro]]. From the beginning of the refurbishment of the seventh car, the new Cato blue livery was applied, along with the Tranz Metro logo.\n\nIn 1995 two of the four ALs were equipped with generators similar to those installed in power-baggage vans used by long-distance passenger trains, making them power-luggage vans.  In 2002 one car was refurbished for the Wairarapa but retained original seating, albeit reupholstered.  In 2003 the other car was rebuilt and refurbished for use as a \"small window\" air-conditioned car for the NIMT passenger trains. A third car was stripped to the underframe but retained its compartment-dividing walls for profile purposes, while the fourth was scrapped.\n\nFrom 1999 onward, due to age and related deterioration, gradual withdrawal from service of older carriages occurred, and cars from long-distance [[Tranz Scenic]] services were used on the interim. These included two former Auckland charter cars that were refurbished in 1993. These two cars were then permanently allocated to the Wairarapa.\n\nA former 1988 Southerner car turned NIMT no-frills car, later fitted with air-conditioning, was then permanently allocated to the Wairarapa. The sole remaining former single-lavatory first-class car, which served in the 1970 Southerner, 1988 Northerner and, as a \"Backpackers\" car, the [[TranzCoastal]] Express in 1996, was also working the service in 2003. While on the TranzCoastal it was fitted with air-conditioning. This is not the first time this carriage has worked the Wairarapa services: in 1995, while assigned to the NIMT and sporting the InterCity blue with white stripe and green band, it ran on the Wairarapa Connection for a time with the first car-van to receive a generator.\n\nIn 2006 [[Hillside Engineering]] won the contract from the Greater Wellington Regional Council to rebuild 18 [[New Zealand British Rail Mark 2 carriage|British Rail Mark 2]] carriages to replace the fleet. They are classified SW for cars with passenger saloon only, SWS with servery and SWG with luggage compartment and generator for power supply. The S stands for \"Scenic Series\" and \"W\" for \"Wairarapa\", to distinguish them from their Capital Connection counterparts, classified S.\n\nOn 11 May 2007 the first four cars entered service, with three more introduced on 18 June 2007 making up a 7-car consist.  The remaining 11 cars entered service incrementally by the end of 2007.\n\nThe inaugural run of the first four cars was on 14 May 2007, being met by the Minister of Transport, [[Annette King]], on arrival on Platform 9 at [[Wellington railway station|Wellington]] at 9.20&nbsp;am.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/assets/importedpdfs/4684_YearinReview2007_s9473.pdf |title=Year in Review 2007|publisher=[[Greater Wellington Regional Council]]|date=2007|accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> It departed [[Masterton Railway Station|Masterton]] at 7.30&nbsp;am, and called at [[Carterton railway station|Carterton]] at 7.48&nbsp;am, [[Featherston Railway Station|Featherston]] at 8.09&nbsp;am and [[Upper Hutt Railway Station|Upper Hutt]] at 8.32&nbsp;am\n\nThe first run in service was on Thursday 18 May on train 1602, departing [[Wellington railway station|Wellington]] at 8.25&nbsp;am\n\nIn early 2007 the longest Wairarapa Connection consist (seven cars and van), which formed the weekdays 6.30&nbsp;am from Masterton and 4.33&nbsp;pm from Wellington had five cars replaced by ones from the now-disbanded charter fleet so that their Korean bogies can be overhauled and placed under five of the new SW cars. The charter cars run on old NZR [[Timken Company|Timken]] bogies limited to 80&nbsp;km/h, not the 100&nbsp;km/h standard carriage train speed.\n\n==Rolling stock==\n[[File:New Zealand BR Mk2 carriage SW5658 interior.JPG|thumb|right|The interior of Wairarapa Connection carriage SW5658]]\nThe Wairarapa Connection is the only diesel-hauled service operated by Metlink, hauled by [[diesel locomotive|diesel-electric locomotive]]s from KiwiRail's fleet.

Eighteen carriages are used \u2013 twelve SW with 64 seats; three SWS with 37 seats, wheelchair hoist and disabled toilet; and three SWG with 37 seats, luggage compartment and generator. The carriages are formed into three sets of between three and eight carriages, consisting of (from the Masterton end of train) an SWG, an SW, an SWS, and then the remaining SW carriages. Because of the short platforms at Renall Street, Solway, Matarawa and Maymorn stations, [[selective door operation]] is employed and passengers are asked to alight from the three northernmost (Masterton-end) carriages.\n\nIn July 2013, the six SE class BR MkII carriages, which had been used as a temporary measure with top-and-tailed [[NZR EA class|EO class]] electric locomotives in Wellington for two years until the arrival of the new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|\"Matangi\" FP/FT class EMUs]], were introduced on the Wairarapa Connection. They made up a fourth set of carriages, increasing capacity and allowing more flexibility, but were criticised by for their smaller seat pitch, poor lighting, and lack of tray tables and power outlets.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/wairarapa-news/8984493/Lack-of-leg-space-frustrates-commuters |title= Lack of leg space frustrates commuters |first= Piers |last= Fuller |publisher= Wairarapa News (via Stuff.co.nz) |date= 31 July 2013 |accessdate= 2 August 2013}}</ref> The pitch issues were rectified over the 2013 Christmas period by removing a row of seats and adjusting the location of the remainder, and additional tables fitted. The SE set operates as a 'standalone' consist, since the SE and SW carriages have slightly different electrical systems and cannot be mixed. As of June 2019 this issue has been fixed.\n\n{{As of|June 2019}}, there are three consists: an 9-carriage train consisting of 6 SE carriages and 3 SW carriages, a 6-carriage SW consist and another 6-carriage SW consist, plus a spare 4-car SW consist. The 9-carriage SW and SE consist operates two services: 1603 (the 06:20 ex-Masterton) and 1606 (the 16:25 ex-Wellington). The two 6-carriage consists alternate daily, one set operating 1605 (the 06:47 ex-Masterton) and 1608 (the 17:30 ex-Wellington) while the other operates the remaining six services.\n\nThere is also a luggage and generator carriage, [[NZR FM guards van|AG]]222, used to supplement or replace the SWG or SEG carriages. If the SWG/SEG carriage is replaced, an extra SW/SE carriage is added, making the consist AG\u2013SW\u2013SW\u2013SWS\u2013SW...\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Class\n! BR type\n!

Most have occurred at [[level crossing]]s, where road vehicles have passed warning signs or signals and have been hit by the train. There are 28 public level crossings between Rimutaka tunnel and Masterton, of which three are controlled by alarms and barrier arms, 19 by alarms only, and six by signs only. Between Wellington and the Rimutaka tunnel there are four, all controlled by alarms and barrier arms.\n\nOn 17 October 1997, the mid-morning service to Wellington broke down 2.5&nbsp;km into the Rimutaka Tunnel from the Featherston portal after an electrical fault in locomotive DC 4951's control gear. The Rimutaka Tunnel is a radio dead-spot, and the train driver and guard found the Train Control telephones on the tunnel wall to be dead. Shortly afterwards, the tunnel alarm sounded at Upper Hutt signal box indicating the train had been in the tunnel for more than 15 minutes, and a full-scale emergency response was activated. The train was removed from the tunnel two hours later by a relief locomotive from the Featherston end after a haphazard response on both sides of the tunnel. There were no injuries, although some elderly passengers required medical treatment due to the distress of the event. After the incident, changes were made to the Train Control telephones so they would self-test and track occupancy rules were modified to allow trains to coast out of the tunnel (which has a gradient of 0.25% to 0.55%) if they became disabled. Emergency services on either side of the tunnel now carry out training exercises every 2\u20133 years in preparation for such a situation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Report 97-112: Passenger train 1605, disabled, Rimutaka Tunnel, 17 October 1997 |publisher= [[Transport Accident Investigation Commission]] |accessdate= 13 April 2013 |url= http://www.taic.org.nz/ReportsandSafetyRecs/RailReports/tabid/85/ctl/Detail/mid/483/InvNumber/1997-112/Page/11/language/en-US/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 July 2009, the 17:33 service to Masterton hit a mudslide blocking the line just north of Maoribank tunnel near Maymorn. The locomotive, DCP4818, and the first carriage, SWG3422, [[derailment|derailed]]. Only minor injuries were reported, but the slip and the derailed rolling stock blocked the line, preventing services operating until Sunday evening.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rail/news/article.cfm?c_id=296&objectid=10586354 |title=Rimutaka rail line shut \u2013 NZ Herald |date= 24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/kiwirail-working-reopen-track-2870568 |title= KiwiRail working to re-open track \u2013 tvnz.co.nz |date= 25 July 2009}}</ref> The accident highlighted a flaw in the design of the pneumatically-operated interior doors in the SW carriages, which stuck in position when the compressed air supply was lost as a result of the locomotive being shut down. Three people were needed to open them by hand, sparking concerns that the carriages could not be evacuated quickly in the event of a fire. The doors were modified so they would open automatically if the compressed air supply is lost.<ref>{{cite web |title= Report 09-103: Passenger Train 1608, collision with slip and derailment, Tunnel 1, Wairarapa Line, Maymorn, 23 July 2009 |publisher= [[Transport Accident Investigation Commission]] |date= September 2010 |accessdate= 15 August 2011 |url= http://www.taic.org.nz/ReportsandSafetyRecs/RailReports/tabid/85/ctl/Detail/mid/483/InvNumber/2009-103/Page/0/language/en-US/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tranz Scenic]]\n* [[Wellington railway station]]\n* [[Tranz Metro]]\n* [[Wairarapa Line]]\n\n== Further reading== \n*{{cite book |last= Bowden |first= David |title= Great Railway Journeys in Australia and New Zealand  |accessdate=  |edition=  |origyear=  |year=  |publisher= John Beaufoy Publishing |location= Oxford, England  |isbn= 978-1-909612-94-5 |oclc= |page= |pages= 134-137 }} \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/Gov12_12Rail-fig-Gov12_12Rail047a.html A photo of a Wairarapa railcar approaching Wellington, alongside Wellington Harbour c1938]\n* {{cite press release |title= Inaugural train journey marks arrival of first new Wairarapa carriages in 60 years |publisher= Greater Wellington Regional Council |date= 11 May 2007 |url= http://www.gw.govt.nz/story22171.cfm?

It is operated by Wellington suburban operator [[Transdev Wellington|Transdev]] (with [[KiwiRail]] sub-contracted to operate the locomotives) under contract from the Greater Wellington Regional Council. It is a [[diesel locomotive|diesel]]-hauled carriage service, introduced by the [[New Zealand Railways Department]] in 1964 after passenger demand between Masterton to Wellington exceeded the capacity of the diesel railcars then used.\n\nThe {{convert|91|km|adj=on}} service operates five times daily in each direction Monday to Friday, three peak and two off-peak, with an additional service each way on Friday nights and two services each way on weekends and public holidays. It stops at all stations from Masterton to [[Upper Hutt Railway Station|Upper Hutt]], then runs express along the [[Hutt Valley Line]] to Wellington, stopping only at [[Waterloo Interchange (Hutt Central) Railway Station|Waterloo]] and [[Petone Railway Station|Petone]] stations.\n\nWhile all other regional passenger trains in New Zealand have been withdrawn (apart from the [[Capital Connection]] commuter service to [[Palmerston North]]), the Wairarapa Connection service continues due to the Wairarapa's proximity to Wellington and the advantage of the 8.8&nbsp;km [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] through the [[Rimutaka Ranges]] compared to the narrow and winding Rimutaka Hill Road over them. In the year to 30 June 2013, the service's ridership was 705,000, down slightly from 719,000 in the 2011/12-year.<ref name=\"patronage\" />\n\n==History==\nBefore the Wairarapa Connection, [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88 seater railcar]]s were used between Masterton and Wellington. They had replaced the [[steam locomotive|steam]]-hauled [[mixed train]]s and [[NZR RM class (Wairarapa)|Wairarapa class]] [[railcar]]s in 1955, when the [[Rimutaka Tunnel]] opened and the line became the first fully dieselised line in New Zealand. The [[Wairarapa Mail]] carriage train ran between Wellington and Woodville until 1948.\n\nIn 1964, the demand between Masterton and Wellington was exceeding the capacity of the 88-seater railcars, with a capacity of 176 with two railcars. The solution was to introduce a diesel-hauled carriage service.\n\n===Carriage history===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}\nIn 1964 six [[NZR 56-foot carriage|56-foot carriages]]s from the [[South Island]] were transferred north and fitted with Webasto kerosene-burning heaters for the service. They seated 336 passengers on two-person bench-type [[Scarrett]] seats: class A passenger cars seated 56 and AL car-vans (with luggage compartment) seated 47.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|date=Autumn 1964|issn=0028-8624|number=99|volume=21 No. 1|title=Train replaces Railcar|page=25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976 three more As and an AL were added, later joined by another A and AL, all overhauled. They were fitted with fluorescent strip lighting similar to [[Northerner (train)|Northerner]] and [[Endeavour (train)|Endeavour]] cars, and painted in a new, brighter shade of red, with white roofs as opposed to the standard silver oxide.\n\nIn the early 1980s, with the refurbishment of the Picton and Greymouth services and the decision to use the former Endeavour carriages on new Gisborne-Wellington services, former [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] railcars painted a distinctive green and nicknamed [[NZR RM class (88 seater)#Grassgrubs|\"Grass Grubs\"]], were introduced to the Wairarapa service. However, the underframes were not designed to be towed in the long term and they deteriorated rapidly, bringing about their demise by 1985. \n\nThe introduction of the [[New Zealand EM class electric multiple unit|EM class \"Ganz-Mavag\"]] [[electric multiple unit]]s to the Wellington suburban system meant eleven 56-foot carriages became available, and the cancellation of the unnamed daylight successor to the [[New Plymouth Night Express]] that ran between [[New Plymouth]] and [[Taumaranui]] freed more. A wooden 50-foot Z bogie box wagon was refitted with bogies that enabled it to run at passenger-train speed and was painted the same shade of bright red as the cars it accompanied. In the style of the new Fastrak and Northtrak express parcels logos that emphasised the new approach and priority of parcels traffic, the wagon had a logo known as Waitrak, as it was dedicated to Wairarapa services.\n\nIn 1989, with the introduction of the [[Bay Express]] between Wellington and Napier, the three remaining [[Endeavour (train)|Endeavour]] cars, of which two were ALs, became redundant, so the 54-seat A car and one 46-seat AL were assigned to Wairarapa services. With the streamlining of Greymouth expresses into one out-and-back operation, one Picton car became surplus to requirements and joined the Masterton fleet.\n\nIn 1993, after the successful re-introduction and rebranding of the Capital Connection service, a similar refurbishment and rebranding program was initiated for the sixteen Wairarapa carriages, though only 12 were actually overhauled. This program lasted four years, until 1997. Six A cars and three of four ALs were thoroughly overhauled and refurbished with a new-style seats. These vehicles were fitted with cloth on the interior walls to reduce noise and were fully carpeted. A cars seated 59, as one toilet from each car was removed to increase [[seating capacity]], while ALs seated 46. The other two A cars and the remaining AL were overhauled but retained their Scarrett seats, reupholstered with cloth material.\n\nThe overhauls saw the introduction of the new [[InterCity Rail]] blue livery, with a 220-mm white stripe and 100-mm green band inside it running the length of each car, with \"Cityrail\" emblazoned on both ends of each car. In 1995, as an interim measure leading up to the phasing in of the new all-over Cato blue livery of the new [[Tranz Rail]] corporate image, a light blue 350-mm full-length stripe was introduced, and a new name for Cityrail, [[Tranz Metro]]. From the beginning of the refurbishment of the seventh car, the new Cato blue livery was applied, along with the Tranz Metro logo.\n\nIn 1995 two of the four ALs were equipped with generators similar to those installed in power-baggage vans used by long-distance passenger trains, making them power-luggage vans.  In 2002 one car was refurbished for the Wairarapa but retained original seating, albeit reupholstered.  In 2003 the other car was rebuilt and refurbished for use as a \"small window\" air-conditioned car for the NIMT passenger trains. A third car was stripped to the underframe but retained its compartment-dividing walls for profile purposes, while the fourth was scrapped.\n\nFrom 1999 onward, due to age and related deterioration, gradual withdrawal from service of older carriages occurred, and cars from long-distance [[Tranz Scenic]] services were used on the interim. These included two former Auckland charter cars that were refurbished in 1993. These two cars were then permanently allocated to the Wairarapa.\n\nA former 1988 Southerner car turned NIMT no-frills car, later fitted with air-conditioning, was then permanently allocated to the Wairarapa. The sole remaining former single-lavatory first-class car, which served in the 1970 Southerner, 1988 Northerner and, as a \"Backpackers\" car, the [[TranzCoastal]] Express in 1996, was also working the service in 2003. While on the TranzCoastal it was fitted with air-conditioning. This is not the first time this carriage has worked the Wairarapa services: in 1995, while assigned to the NIMT and sporting the InterCity blue with white stripe and green band, it ran on the Wairarapa Connection for a time with the first car-van to receive a generator.\n\nIn 2006 [[Hillside Engineering]] won the contract from the Greater Wellington Regional Council to rebuild 18 [[New Zealand British Rail Mark 2 carriage|British Rail Mark 2]] carriages to replace the fleet. They are classified SW for cars with passenger saloon only, SWS with servery and SWG with luggage compartment and generator for power supply. The S stands for \"Scenic Series\" and \"W\" for \"Wairarapa\", to distinguish them from their Capital Connection counterparts, classified S.\n\nOn 11 May 2007 the first four cars entered service, with three more introduced on 18 June 2007 making up a 7-car consist.  The remaining 11 cars entered service incrementally by the end of 2007.\n\nThe inaugural run of the first four cars was on 14 May 2007, being met by the Minister of Transport, [[Annette King]], on arrival on Platform 9 at [[Wellington railway station|Wellington]] at 9.20&nbsp;am.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/assets/importedpdfs/4684_YearinReview2007_s9473.pdf |title=Year in Review 2007|publisher=[[Greater Wellington Regional Council]]|date=2007|accessdate=26 February 2020}}</ref> It departed [[Masterton Railway Station|Masterton]] at 7.30&nbsp;am, and called at [[Carterton Railway Station|Carterton]] at 7.48&nbsp;am, [[Featherston Railway Station|Featherston]] at 8.09&nbsp;am and [[Upper Hutt Railway Station|Upper Hutt]] at 8.32&nbsp;am\n\nThe first run in service was on Thursday 18 May on train 1602, departing [[Wellington railway station|Wellington]] at 8.25&nbsp;am\n\nIn early 2007 the longest Wairarapa Connection consist (seven cars and van), which formed the weekdays 6.30&nbsp;am from Masterton and 4.33&nbsp;pm from Wellington had five cars replaced by ones from the now-disbanded charter fleet so that their Korean bogies can be overhauled and placed under five of the new SW cars. The charter cars run on old NZR [[Timken Company|Timken]] bogies limited to 80&nbsp;km/h, not the 100&nbsp;km/h standard carriage train speed.\n\n==Rolling stock==\n[[File:New Zealand BR Mk2 carriage SW5658 interior.JPG|thumb|right|The interior of Wairarapa Connection carriage SW5658]]\nThe Wairarapa Connection is the only diesel-hauled service operated by Metlink, hauled by [[diesel locomotive|diesel-electric locomotive]]s from KiwiRail's fleet.

Eighteen carriages are used \u2013 twelve SW with 64 seats; three SWS with 37 seats, wheelchair hoist and disabled toilet; and three SWG with 37 seats, luggage compartment and generator. The carriages are formed into three sets of between three and eight carriages, consisting of (from the Masterton end of train) an SWG, an SW, an SWS, and then the remaining SW carriages. Because of the short platforms at Renall Street, Solway, Matarawa and Maymorn stations, [[selective door operation]] is employed and passengers are asked to alight from the three northernmost (Masterton-end) carriages.\n\nIn July 2013, the six SE class BR MkII carriages, which had been used as a temporary measure with top-and-tailed [[NZR EA class|EO class]] electric locomotives in Wellington for two years until the arrival of the new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|\"Matangi\" FP/FT class EMUs]], were introduced on the Wairarapa Connection. They made up a fourth set of carriages, increasing capacity and allowing more flexibility, but were criticised by for their smaller seat pitch, poor lighting, and lack of tray tables and power outlets.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/news/local-papers/wairarapa-news/8984493/Lack-of-leg-space-frustrates-commuters |title= Lack of leg space frustrates commuters |first= Piers |last= Fuller |publisher= Wairarapa News (via Stuff.co.nz) |date= 31 July 2013 |accessdate= 2 August 2013}}</ref> The pitch issues were rectified over the 2013 Christmas period by removing a row of seats and adjusting the location of the remainder, and additional tables fitted. The SE set operates as a 'standalone' consist, since the SE and SW carriages have slightly different electrical systems and cannot be mixed. As of June 2019 this issue has been fixed.\n\n{{As of|June 2019}}, there are three consists: an 9-carriage train consisting of 6 SE carriages and 3 SW carriages, a 6-carriage SW consist and another 6-carriage SW consist, plus a spare 4-car SW consist. The 9-carriage SW and SE consist operates two services: 1603 (the 06:20 ex-Masterton) and 1606 (the 16:25 ex-Wellington). The two 6-carriage consists alternate daily, one set operating 1605 (the 06:47 ex-Masterton) and 1608 (the 17:30 ex-Wellington) while the other operates the remaining six services.\n\nThere is also a luggage and generator carriage, [[NZR FM guards van|AG]]222, used to supplement or replace the SWG or SEG carriages. If the SWG/SEG carriage is replaced, an extra SW/SE carriage is added, making the consist AG\u2013SW\u2013SW\u2013SWS\u2013SW...\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Class\n! BR type\n!

Most have occurred at [[level crossing]]s, where road vehicles have passed warning signs or signals and have been hit by the train. There are 28 public level crossings between Rimutaka tunnel and Masterton, of which three are controlled by alarms and barrier arms, 19 by alarms only, and six by signs only. Between Wellington and the Rimutaka tunnel there are four, all controlled by alarms and barrier arms.\n\nOn 17 October 1997, the mid-morning service to Wellington broke down 2.5&nbsp;km into the Rimutaka Tunnel from the Featherston portal after an electrical fault in locomotive DC 4951's control gear. The Rimutaka Tunnel is a radio dead-spot, and the train driver and guard found the Train Control telephones on the tunnel wall to be dead. Shortly afterwards, the tunnel alarm sounded at Upper Hutt signal box indicating the train had been in the tunnel for more than 15 minutes, and a full-scale emergency response was activated. The train was removed from the tunnel two hours later by a relief locomotive from the Featherston end after a haphazard response on both sides of the tunnel. There were no injuries, although some elderly passengers required medical treatment due to the distress of the event. After the incident, changes were made to the Train Control telephones so they would self-test and track occupancy rules were modified to allow trains to coast out of the tunnel (which has a gradient of 0.25% to 0.55%) if they became disabled. Emergency services on either side of the tunnel now carry out training exercises every 2\u20133 years in preparation for such a situation.<ref>{{cite web |title= Report 97-112: Passenger train 1605, disabled, Rimutaka Tunnel, 17 October 1997 |publisher= [[Transport Accident Investigation Commission]] |accessdate= 13 April 2013 |url= http://www.taic.org.nz/ReportsandSafetyRecs/RailReports/tabid/85/ctl/Detail/mid/483/InvNumber/1997-112/Page/11/language/en-US/Default.aspx}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 July 2009, the 17:33 service to Masterton hit a mudslide blocking the line just north of Maoribank tunnel near Maymorn. The locomotive, DCP4818, and the first carriage, SWG3422, [[derailment|derailed]].

Three people were needed to open them by hand, sparking concerns that the carriages could not be evacuated quickly in the event of a fire.

But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.\n:26 \u00b6 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: ''[then]'' came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace ''[be]'' unto you.\n:27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust ''[it]'' into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.\n:28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.\n:29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed ''[are]'' they that have not seen, and ''[yet]'' have believed.\n\nCommentators have noted that John avoids saying whether Thomas actually did \"thrust\" his hand in.{{sfn|Most|2009|pp= 79-80}} Before the [[Protestant Reformation]] the usual belief, reflected in artistic depictions, was that he had done so, which most Catholic writers continued to believe, while Protestant writers often thought that he had not.{{sfn|Salisbury|2006|p= 95}}\n\nRegardless of the question of whether Thomas had felt as well as \"seen\" the physical evidence of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], the Catholic interpretation was that, although Jesus asserts the superiority of those who have faith without physical evidence, he was nonetheless willing to show Thomas his wound, and let him feel it. This was used by theologians as biblical encouragement for the use of physical experiences such as [[pilgrimage]]s, veneration of [[relic]]s and ritual in reinforcing Christian beliefs.{{sfn|Schiller|1972|p= 188}}{{sfn|Vikan|1982|pp=24-25}}\n\nProtestant theologians emphasized Jesus' statement of the superiority of \"faith alone\" (see ''[[sola fide]]''), although the evangelical-leaning [[Anglican]] [[Thomas Hartwell Horne]], in his widely read ''Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures'' (first published in 1818) treated Thomas's incredulity, which he extended somewhat to the other apostles, approvingly, as evidence both of the veracity of the gospels, as a \"forger\" would be unlikely to have invented it, and of their proper suspicion of the seemingly impossible, demonstrating their reliability as witnesses.{{sfn|Horne|1836|pp=111-112}} In the early church, [[Gnostic]] authors were very insistent that Thomas did not actually examine Jesus, and elaborated on this in [[apocrypha]]l accounts,{{what|Such as?|date=April 2017}} perhaps tending to push their non-Gnostic opponents in the other direction.{{sfn|Most|2009|pp=|loc=Ch. 2}}\n\nThe theological interpretation of the episode has concentrated on it as a demonstration of the reality of the resurrection, but as early as the writings of the 4th- and 5th-century saints [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Cyril of Alexandria]] it had been given a [[eucharistic]] interpretation, seen as an [[allegory]] of the sacrament of the Eucharist, what remained a recurring theme in commentary.{{sfn|Butterfield|1992|p= 232 and notes}}{{sfn|Jacks |Caferro|2001|p=159}}\n==Art==\n[[File:Trier 10 Jh Diptychon Moses Thomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] ivory [[diptych]]]]\n\nIn art this subject, formally termed '''The Incredulity of Saint Thomas''', has been common since at least the early 6th century, when it appears in the [[mosaic]]s at [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] in [[Ravenna]],<ref>{{harvnb|Soper|1938|p= 188}} listing several other early occurrences</ref> and on the [[Monza ampullae]].<ref>Monza no. 9, Bobbio no. 10, see {{harvnb|Leroy|1959|p= 322}} and  {{harvnb|Milburn|1988|p= 264}}</ref>  In those depictions, as later in the [[Baroque]], the subject, normally depicted at the moment Thomas puts his fingers into Jesus' side, was used to emphasize the importance of physical experiences and evidences for the believer, as described above.{{sfn|Vikan|1982|pp=24-25}}  The Ravenna mosaic introduces the motif of Jesus raising his hand high to reveal the wound in his side;<ref>{{harvnb|Gurewich|1957|p= 358}} but the same detail is seen in the early 5th-century ivory box with scenes of the passion in the [[British Museum]]</ref> his pose often, but not always, is such that the wounds on his hands can also be seen, and often those on his feet as well. \n  \nThe scene was used in a number of contexts in [[medieval art]], including Byzantine icons. Where there was room all the apostles were often shown, and sometimes Thomas' acceptance of the Resurrection is shown, with Thomas kneeling and Jesus blessing him.  This iconography leaves it unclear whether the moment shown follows an examination or not, but probably suggests that it does not, especially in Protestant art.  From the late Middle Ages onwards a number of variations of the poses of the two figures occur (see gallery). The typical \"touching\" representation formed one of a number of scenes sometimes placed around a central ''[[Crucifixion in the arts|Crucifixion of Jesus]]'', and is one of the scenes shown on the Irish [[Muiredach's High Cross]], and the subject of a large relief in the famous [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] sculpted [[cloister]] at the [[Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos]].{{sfn|Schiller|1972|pp=102, 116}}  In works showing pairs of [[typology (theology)|typologically related]] scenes from the Old and [[New Testament]]s it could be paired with ''[[Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]]'',{{sfn|Schiller|1972|p= 130}} but in a 10th-century [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] ivory [[diptych]] it is paired with ''[[Moses]] receiving the Law'', comparing both the two Biblical Testaments and the support for the faith from both textual \"sacred writ\" and physical evidences.\n[[File:Augustinermuseum Rattenberg 018.JPG|thumb|Ostentatio vulnerum]]\nIn the later Middle Ages Jesus with one side of his robe pulled back, displaying the wound in his side and his other four wounds (called the ''ostentatio vulnerum''), was taken from images with Thomas and turned into a pose adopted by Jesus alone, who often places his own fingers into the wound in his side.  This form became a common feature of single iconic figures of Jesus and subjects such as the ''[[Last Judgement]]'' (where [[Bamberg Cathedral]] has an early example of about 1235), ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'', the ''[[Man of Sorrows]]'' and Christ with the ''[[Arma Christi]]'', and was used to emphasize Christ's suffering as well as the fact of his Resurrection.{{sfn|Schiller|1972|pp=188-189, 202}}\n\nIn the Renaissance the famous sculpted pair of ''[[Christ and St. Thomas (Verrocchio)|Christ and St. Thomas]]'' by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]] (1467\u20131483) for the [[Orsanmichele]] in [[Florence]] is the best known representation; the subject is rare in free-standing sculpture.{{sfn|Pickard|1916|p= 413}} This [[guild]] church also housed commercial tribunals, and the presentation of physical evidence gave the subject a particular relevance to courts and justice, and it appeared on many other buildings in [[Tuscany]] with judicial functions.  The [[Medici family]], heavily involved in the commission, also had a particular association with St Thomas, <ref>{{harvnb|Butterfield|1992|pp= 228-229}} on Medici involvement in the commission, {{harvnb|Butterfield|1992|pp=230-232}} on justice and Medici patronage of Thomas; for justice also see {{harvnb|Jacks |Caferro|2001|pp=160-161}}</ref> though the [[The Incredulity of Saint Thomas (Salviati)|painting by Salviati]] seems to reflect anti-Medici feeling in the 1540s.  \n\nThe subject enjoyed a revival in popularity in [[Counter-Reformation art]] as an assertion of Catholic doctrine against Protestant rejection of the Catholic practices which the episode was held to support, and Protestant belief in \"faith alone\".

But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.\n:26 \u00b6 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: ''[then]'' came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace ''[be]'' unto you.\n:27 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust ''[it]'' into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.\n:28 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.\n:29 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed ''[are]'' they that have not seen, and ''[yet]'' have believed.\n\nCommentators have noted that John avoids saying whether Thomas actually did \"thrust\" his hand in.{{sfn|Most|2009|pp= 79-80}} Before the [[Protestant Reformation]] the usual belief, reflected in artistic depictions, was that he had done so, which most Catholic writers continued to believe, while Protestant writers often thought that he had not.{{sfn|Salisbury|2006|p= 95}}\n\nRegardless of the question of whether Thomas had felt as well as \"seen\" the physical evidence of the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], the Catholic interpretation was that, although Jesus asserts the superiority of those who have faith without physical evidence, he was nonetheless willing to show Thomas his wound, and let him feel it. This was used by theologians as biblical encouragement for the use of physical experiences such as [[pilgrimage]]s, veneration of [[relic]]s and ritual in reinforcing Christian beliefs.{{sfn|Schiller|1972|p= 188}}{{sfn|Vikan|1982|pp=24-25}}\n\nProtestant theologians emphasized Jesus' statement of the superiority of \"faith alone\" (see ''[[sola fide]]''), although the evangelical-leaning [[Anglican]] [[Thomas Hartwell Horne]], in his widely read ''Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures'' (first published in 1818) treated Thomas's incredulity, which he extended somewhat to the other apostles, approvingly, as evidence both of the veracity of the gospels, as a \"forger\" would be unlikely to have invented it, and of their proper suspicion of the seemingly impossible, demonstrating their reliability as witnesses.{{sfn|Horne|1836|pp=111-112}} In the early church, [[Gnostic]] authors were very insistent that Thomas did not actually examine Jesus, and elaborated on this in [[apocrypha]]l accounts,{{what|Such as?|date=April 2017}} perhaps tending to push their non-Gnostic opponents in the other direction.{{sfn|Most|2009|pp=|loc=Ch. 2}}\n\nThe theological interpretation of the episode has concentrated on it as a demonstration of the reality of the resurrection, but as early as the writings of the 4th- and 5th-century saints [[John Chrysostom]] and [[Cyril of Alexandria]] it had been given a [[eucharistic]] interpretation, seen as an [[allegory]] of the sacrament of the Eucharist, what remained a recurring theme in commentary.{{sfn|Butterfield|1992|p= 232 and notes}}{{sfn|Jacks |Caferro|2001|p=159}}\n==Art==\n[[File:Trier 10 Jh Diptychon Moses Thomas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] ivory [[diptych]]]]\n\nIn art this subject, formally termed '''The Incredulity of Saint Thomas''', has been common since at least the early 6th century, when it appears in the [[mosaic]]s at [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] in [[Ravenna]],<ref>{{harvnb|Soper|1938|p= 188}} listing several other early occurrences</ref> and on the [[Monza ampullae]].<ref>Monza no. 9, Bobbio no. 10, see {{harvnb|Leroy|1959|p= 322}} and  {{harvnb|Milburn|1988|p= 264}}</ref>  In those depictions, as later in the [[Baroque]], the subject, normally depicted at the moment Thomas puts his fingers into Jesus' side, was used to emphasize the importance of physical experiences and evidences for the believer, as described above.{{sfn|Vikan|1982|pp=24-25}}  The Ravenna mosaic introduces the motif of Jesus raising his hand high to reveal the wound in his side;<ref>{{harvnb|Gurewich|1957|p= 358}} but the same detail is seen in the early 5th-century ivory box with scenes of the passion in the [[British Museum]]</ref> his pose often, but not always, is such that the wounds on his hands can also be seen, and often those on his feet as well. \n  \nThe scene was used in a number of contexts in [[medieval art]], including Byzantine icons. Where there was room all the apostles were often shown, and sometimes Thomas' acceptance of the Resurrection is shown, with Thomas kneeling and Jesus blessing him.  This iconography leaves it unclear whether the moment shown follows an examination or not, but probably suggests that it does not, especially in Protestant art.  From the late Middle Ages onwards a number of variations of the poses of the two figures occur (see gallery). The typical \"touching\" representation formed one of a number of scenes sometimes placed around a central ''[[Crucifixion in the arts|Crucifixion of Jesus]]'', and is one of the scenes shown on the Irish [[Muiredach's High Cross]], and the subject of a large relief in the famous [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] sculpted [[cloister]] at the [[Abbey of Santo Domingo de Silos]].{{sfn|Schiller|1972|pp=102, 116}}  In works showing pairs of [[typology (theology)|typologically related]] scenes from the Old and [[New Testament]]s it could be paired with ''[[Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]]'',{{sfn|Schiller|1972|p= 130}} but in a 10th-century [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] ivory [[diptych]] it is paired with ''[[Moses]] receiving the Law'', comparing both the two Biblical Testaments and the support for the faith from both textual \"sacred writ\" and physical evidences.\n[[File:Augustinermuseum Rattenberg 018.JPG|thumb|Ostentatio vulnerum]]\nIn the later Middle Ages Jesus with one side of his robe pulled back, displaying the wound in his side and his other four wounds (called the ''ostentatio vulnerum''), was taken from images with Thomas and turned into a pose adopted by Jesus alone, who often places his own fingers into the wound in his side.  This form became a common feature of single iconic figures of Jesus and subjects such as the ''[[Last Judgement]]'' (where [[Bamberg Cathedral]] has an early example of about 1235), ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'', the ''[[Man of Sorrows]]'' and Christ with the ''[[Arma Christi]]'', and was used to emphasize Christ's suffering as well as the fact of his Resurrection.{{sfn|Schiller|1972|pp=188-189, 202}}\n\nIn the Renaissance the famous sculpted pair of ''[[Christ and St. Thomas (Verrocchio)|Christ and St. Thomas]]'' by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]] (1467\u20131483) for the [[Orsanmichele]] in [[Florence]] is the best known representation; the subject is rare in free-standing sculpture.{{sfn|Pickard|1916|p= 413}} This [[guild]] church also housed commercial tribunals, and the presentation of physical evidence gave the subject a particular relevance to courts and justice, and it appeared on many other buildings in [[Tuscany]] with judicial functions.  The [[Medici family]], heavily involved in the commission, also had a particular association with St Thomas, <ref>{{harvnb|Butterfield|1992|pp= 228-229}} on Medici involvement in the commission, {{harvnb|Butterfield|1992|pp=230-232}} on justice and Medici patronage of Thomas; for justice also see {{harvnb|Jacks |Caferro|2001|pp=160-161}}</ref> though the [[The Incredulity of Saint Thomas (Salviati)|painting by Salviati]] seems to reflect anti-Medici feeling in the 1540s.  \n\nThe subject enjoyed a revival in popularity in [[Counter-Reformation art]] as an assertion of Catholic doctrine against Protestant rejection of the Catholic practices which the episode was held to support, and Protestant belief in \"faith alone\".  In the Catholic interpretation, although Jesus asserts the superiority of those who have faith without physical evidence, he was nonetheless willing to show Thomas his wound, and let him feel it.  ''[[The Incredulity of Saint Thomas (Caravaggio)|The Incredulity of Saint Thomas]]'' by [[Caravaggio]] (c. 1601\u20131602) is now the most famous depiction (unusually showing Thomas to the viewer's right of Jesus), but there are many others, especially by the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], painting in a Protestant environment{{sfn|van Eck|1993|pp=224-228}}, such as the Flemish Caravaggist [[Matthias Stom]], whose two versions of the subject are now in [[The Incredulity of Saint Thomas (Stom)|Madrid]] and Bergamo.

{"title_page": "Early modern period", "text_new": "{{short description|Period between about 1500 and 1800 CE}}\n{{Human history|222}}\n\nThe '''early modern period''' of [[modern history]] follows the [[late Middle Ages]] of the [[post-classical era]]. Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the [[timeline|timeframe]] spans the period after the late portion of the [[post-classical age]] (c. 1500), known as the [[Middle Ages]], through the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]] (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Ottoman conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, the [[Renaissance]] period in Europe and [[Timurid Renaissance|Timurid Central Asia]], the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Age of Discovery]] (especially the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] beginning in 1492 but also with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Vasco da Gama#First voyage|discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498) and ending around the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.\n\nHistorians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character.<ref>Jan De Vries,  \"The limits of globalization in the early modern world\". ''Economic History Review'' (2010) 63#3 pp: 710\u2013733.</ref> New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the period. This process began in the medieval North Italian [[city-states]], particularly [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], and [[Milan]] in the west, and in India's [[Bengal Sultanate|Bengal]] in the east. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. \n\nIn the Americas, Pre-Columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization, including the Aztec Empire and alliance, the [[History of the Incas|Inca civilization]], the [[Maya civilization]] and  its cities, and the [[Muisca Confederation|Chibcha]]. The [[European colonization of the Americas]] began during the early modern period, as did the establishment of European trading hubs in Asia and Africa, which contributed to the [[History of Christianity#Catholic missions|spread of Christianity]] around the world. The rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe, in particular the [[Columbian Exchange]] that linked the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]], greatly altered the human environment. Notably, the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the [[Genocide of indigenous peoples#Native American Genocide|genocide of Native American peoples]] began during this period. <ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=American Colonies|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-200210-0|url=https://archive.org/details/americancolonies00tayl}}</ref> Turkey colonized Southeastern Europe, and parts of the West Asia and North Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434996/Ottoman-Empire |title=Ottoman Empire |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-02-11}}</ref> Russia [[Russian conquest of Siberia|reached the Pacific coast]] in 1647 and consolidated its control over the [[Russian Far East]] in the 19th century.\n\nIn the [[Islamic world]], after the fall of the [[Timurid Renaissance]], powers such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Suri Empire|Suri]], [[Safavid]], and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires grew in strength (three of which are known as [[gunpowder empires]] for the military technology that enabled them). Particularly in the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Mughal architecture]], [[Indo-Persian culture|culture]], and [[Mughal painting|art]] reached their zenith, while the empire itself is believed to have had the world's largest economy, bigger than the entirety of [[Western Europe]] and worth 25% of global GDP,<ref>[[Angus Maddison|Maddison, Angus]] (2003): ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rHJGz3HiJbcC&pg=PA259 Development Centre Studies The World Economy Historical Statistics: Historical Statistics]'', [[OECD Publishing]], {{ISBN|9264104143}}, pages 259\u2013261</ref> signalling the period of [[proto-industrialization]].<ref name=\"voss\">{{cite book|title=The Ashgate Companion to the History of Textile Workers, 1650\u20132000|author1=Lex Heerma van Voss |author2=Els Hiemstra-Kuperus |author3=Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk |chapter=The Long Globalization and Textile Producers in India|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2010|page=255|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f95ljbhfjxIC&pg=PA255}}</ref>\n\nVarious Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian sphere. In Japan, the [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period. In Korea, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] to the enthronement of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]. By the 16th century, Asian economies under the [[Ming dynasty]] and [[Mughal Bengal]] were stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the [[Nanban trade]] after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]].\n\nThe early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. [[Feudalism]] declined in Europe, and Christians and Christendom saw the end of the [[Crusades]] and of religious unity under the Roman Catholic Church. The old order was destabilized by the [[Protestant Reformation]], which caused a backlash that expanded the [[Inquisition]] and sparked the disastrous [[European wars of religion|European Wars of Religion]], which included the especially bloody [[Thirty Years' War]] and ended with the establishment of the modern international system in the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Along with the [[European colonization of the Americas]], this period also contained the [[Commercial Revolution]] and the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].\n\nOther notable trends of the early modern period include the development of [[Science|experimental science]], increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic politics, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, and the emergence of [[nation state]]s. Historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the [[French Revolution]] of the 1790s began the \"late modern\" period.<ref>[[Christopher Bayly|Christopher Alan Bayly]], ''The birth of the modern world, 1780\u20131914: global connections and comparisons'' (2004).</ref>\n\nThe Indian Empires and civilizations of Southeast Asia, mainly the major trading nation known as the [[Bengal Sultanate]], were a vital link in the spice trade. The [[Mughal Empire]] was founded by the descendants of [[Tamerlane]] and its [[Mughal architecture|architecture]] has impressed the world. The archipelagic empires, the Sultanate of Malacca and later the Sultanate of Johor, controlled the southern areas.\n\n== Early modern timeline ==\n{{main|Timeline of early modern

However, by the end of the Early Modern Period, China, Korea and Japan were mostly closed and disinterested to Europeans, even while trading relationships grew in port cities such as [[Guangzhou]] and [[Dejima]]. \n=== Chinese dynasties ===\n[[File:Cishou Temple Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pagoda of Cishou Temple|Cishou Temple Pagoda]], built in 1576: the Chinese believed that building pagodas on certain sites according to [[Feng shui|geomantic principles]] brought about auspicious events; merchant-funding for such projects was needed by the late Ming period.]]\nAround the beginning of the [[Han Chinese|ethnically Han]] [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), China was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. However, Europe soon caught up to China's scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them.<ref>Needham, J. (1956). Mathematics and science in china and the west. ''Science and Society, 20'', 320. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/1296937594</ref> Many scholars have speculated about the reason behind China's lag in advancement. A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China's urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe's and China's inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China's Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists to break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei.<ref>Bala, Arun.

Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however,  relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.\n\nIn the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China's global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. However, in the 14th century, China's paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed.<ref>Flynn, D. O., & Giraldez, A.

The Qing ruled from 1644 to 1912, with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917. During its reign, the Qing dynasty adopted many of the outward features of [[Chinese culture]] in establishing its rule, but did not necessarily \"assimilate\", instead adopting a more universalist style of governance.<ref>Crossley, P.

The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of [[China proper]]. Schoppa, the editor of ''The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History'' argues, <blockquote>\"A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'.

Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] as the 15th, and ultimately final, sh\u014dgun of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and it lasts until the coming to power of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.<ref>''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' (First edition, 1983), section \"Azuchi-Momoyama History (1568\u20131600)\" by George Elison, in the entry for \"history of Japan\".</ref> Tokugawa received the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, establishing the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].\n\nThe [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a [[feudal]]ist regime of Japan established by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and ruled by the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa clan]]. The period gets its name from the capital city, [[Edo]], now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from [[Edo Castle]] from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the late [[Edo period]] (often called the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]]).\n\nSociety in the Japanese \"[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]\" ([[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the [[warrior]]-caste of [[samurai]], with the [[farmer]]s, [[artisans]], and [[merchant|traders]] ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy.<ref name=\"HCAotW\">{{Citation|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=175|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908\u20131984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-681-50288-8|oclc=56350180}}</ref> Literacy among the Japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolation.<ref name=\"HCAotW\" />\n\nIn some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimy\u014ds'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimy\u014ds'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. [[Taxes]] on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for [[inflation]] or other changes in [[monetary]] value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.\n\n=== Korean dynasty ===\nIn 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392\u20131910) with a largely bloodless coup.

Japan failed both times due to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], Korea's revered naval genius, who lead the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called [[turtle ship]]s. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi's navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan's second invasion.<ref name=\":1\" /> During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by Manchurians, who would later take over China as the Qing Dynasty. In 1637, King [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubines to the Qing Prince [[Dorgon]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&pg=PA892|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic E.|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048041|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. However, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and Korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home.

During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.\n\n=== British and Dutch colonization ===\n\nThe development of [[New Imperialism]] saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers.

Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers.

This was perhaps the golden age of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent [[Persia]]n Shi'a [[Safavid Empire]] to the east.\n\n=== North and Northeast Africa ===\nIn the [[Saracen]] sphere, the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of [[Algeria]], Tunisia, and [[Tripolitania|Tripoli]] (between 1519 and 1551), [[Morocco]] remaining an independent Arabized [[Berber state]] under the [[Sharifan dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|The Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states circa 1500.]]\n\nIn the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old [[Axum]]ite royal house, the Solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, [[Shewa]] and the rest of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] were [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquered]] by the forces of [[Ahmed Gurey]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the [[Oromo migrations|Oromo]] ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.\n\nThe [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. The [[Geledi Sultanate]], established by [[Ibrahim Adeer]], was a notable successor of the Ajuran Sultanate. The [[Sultanate]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated Geledi power during the [[Bardera]] wars, and [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman]]i Empire to pay [[tribute]]. The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]ate in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central [[Somalia]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. Along with the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ruled by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]], the Majeerteen Sultanate was eventually annexed into [[Italian Somaliland]] in the early 20th century, following the military Campaign of the Sultanates.\n\n=== Safavids ===\n{{Main|Safavid Empire}}\nThe [[Safavid Empire]] was a great Shia [[Persianate society|Persianate empire]] after the Islamic conquest of Persia and established of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the [[Sassanids]] to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.\n\nWhat fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar.

In [[England]] the modern period is often dated to the start of the [[Tudor period]] with the victory of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] over [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth]] in 1485.<ref>Helen Miller, Aubrey Newman.

However, \"Renaissance\" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe\u2014especially central and northern [[Italy]]\u2014and it spans the transition from late [[medieval]] civilization to the opening of the early modern period. In the visual arts and architecture, the term \"early modern\" is not a common designation as the Renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. Only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. European music of the period is generally divided between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Similarly, philosophy is divided between [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. In other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as [[gunpowder warfare|warfare]] and [[History of science|science]].\n\n=== Gunpowder and firearms ===\nWhen gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use and European countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms.<ref name=\":0\" /> The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.\n\n=== European kingdoms and movements ===\nIn the early modern period, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a union of territories in Central Europe under a [[Holy Roman Emperor]] the first of which was [[Otto I]]. The last was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who [[abdication|abdicated]] and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic [[era]], but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform.\n\n==== Notable individuals ====\n[[File:Press -Bettman.jpg|thumb|left|Gutenberg reviewing a press proof (a colored engraving created probably in the 19th century)]]\n\n[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited as the first European to use [[movable type]] [[printing]], around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical [[printing press]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] formulated a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] (1543), which displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe.<ref>A Greek mathematician, [[Aristarchus of Samos]], had already discussed heliocentric hypotheses as early as the third century BCE. However, there is little evidence that he ever developed his ideas beyond a very basic outline [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|(Dreyer, 1953]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/134/mode/2up pp.135\u201348]; [[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton, 2004, p. 39)]].</ref> His book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'') began modern [[astronomy]] and sparked the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Another notable individual was [[Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern [[political science]]. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, [[The Prince]], a work of [[Political realism|realist]] [[political theory]].\n\nAmong the notable royalty of the time, [[Charles the Bold]], known as ''Charles the Bold (or Rash)'' to his enemies,<ref>The title was derived from his savage behavior against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471: frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning over two thousand towns, villages and castles on his way\u2014Taylor, Aline S. ''Isabel of Burgundy''. Lanham, Md: Madison Books, c2001, pp. 212\u2013213</ref> he was the last [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit\u2014a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. The Habsburg Emperor secured the match for his son, the future [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, [[Archduke of Austria]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the [[Burgundian Inheritance]].\n\n[[File:Hanging houses in Cuenca Spain.jpg|thumb|15th century Hanging Houses in [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Spain]] from the [[Early Renaissance]], and the Early modern period.]]\n\n[[Claude de Lorraine]] was the first [[Duke of Guise]], from 1528 to his death. Claude distinguished himself at the [[battle of Marignano]] (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. In 1521, he fought at [[Fuenterrabia]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. In 1523 he became governor of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], after defeating at [[Neufch\u00e2teau, Vosges|Neufch\u00e2teau]] the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] troops who had invaded this province. In 1525 he destroyed the [[Anabaptist]] [[German Peasants' War|peasant army]], which was overrunning [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], at [[Lupstein]], near [[Saverne]] (Zabern). On the return of Francis I from captivity in 1528, Claude was made Duke of Guise in the [[peerage of France]], though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of France. The Guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of Lorraine and descendants of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|house of Anjou]], claimed precedence of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princes of [[Prince of Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]] and [[Prince of Conti|Conti]].\n\nThe [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|3rd Duke of Alba]] was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the \"Iron Duke\" by the Protestants of the [[Low Countries]] because of his harsh rule and cruelty. Tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in [[Flanders]] became part of Dutch and English folklore, forming a central component of the [[Spanish Black Legend]].\n\nIn England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the [[King of England]] and a significant figure in the history of the [[English monarchy]]. Although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England,<ref>''See [[William Tyndale|''Martyrdom of William Tyndale''.]]''</ref> a movement having some roots with [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. These struggles ultimately led to the separation of the [[Church of England]] from papal authority, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and establishing himself as the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. Though Henry reportedly became a Protestant on his death-bed{{CN|date=March 2020}}, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal support for the [[English Reformation]] began with his heirs, the devout [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the renowned [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], whilst daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and [[Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]]. He is also noted for his [[Wives of Henry VIII|six wives]], two of whom were [[Decapitation|beheaded]].\n\n=== Christians and Christendom ===\n[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach - Mass in B minor - Agnus Dei.ogg|right|thumb|Johann Sebastian Bach \u2013 Mass in B minor \u2013 Agnus Dei, From 1724]]\n{{Main|History of Christianity|Christendom}}\n\nChristianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the [[Counter Reformation]].\n\n==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====\n[[File:Battle of Vienna 1683 11.PNG|thumb|Battle of Vienna, 12 September 1683]]\n\nThe [[Hussite Wars|Hussite Crusades]] involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia|Bohemia]] ending ultimately with the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. Also known as the Hussite Wars, they were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The [[Taborite]] faction of the [[Hussite]] warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In totality, the Hussite Crusades were inconclusive.\n\nThe last crusade, the ''Crusade of 1456'', was organized to counter the expanding Ottoman Empire and lift the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], and was led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]. The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmet II to lift the siege and retreat. The siege of Belgrade has been characterized as having \"decided the fate of [[Christendom]]\".<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html Pope Calixtus III account from 1456 to the Burgundian bishop talking about the savior of Christianity at Belgrade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413030956/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html |date=2009-04-13 }}</ref> The [[noon bell]] ordered by [[Pope Callixtus III]] commemorates the victory throughout the [[Christian world]] to this day.\n\nNearly a hundred years later, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] officially ended the idea that all Christians could be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (\"whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion\") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], i.e. the \"One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church\" of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.\n\n==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====\n{{Main|Spanish Inquisition|Protestant Reformation|Inquisition|Catholic Reformation}}\n\nThe modern [[Inquisition]] refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting [[Christian heresy|heretics]] (or other offenders against [[canon law]]) within the Catholic Church. In the modern era, the first manifestation was the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1478 to 1834.<ref name=\"fordhaminquisition\">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inquisition1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Inquisition \u2013 Introduction]</ref> The Inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],<ref>this also includes [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic (Maleficium)]].</ref> [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well for [[censorship]] of printed literature. Because of its objective\u2014combating heresy\u2014the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could still try non-Christians for blasphemy (most of the [[witch trials]] went through secular courts).\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the ''[[Corpus Christianum]]''. [[Martin Luther]] challenged the Catholic Church with his [[Ninety-five Theses]], generally accepted as the beginning of the Reformation, a Christian reform movement in Europe, though precursors such as [[Jan Hus]] predate him. The Protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], an independent hereditary [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]] established a [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|university at Wittenberg]] in 1502. The [[Augustinian monk]] Martin Luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. At the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of Wittenberg.\n\nOn 31 October 1517, Luther posted his ''Ninety-five Theses'' on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]], which served as a notice board for university-related announcements.<ref name=\"Simon-120-121\">{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=[https://archive.org/details/makingprogressth0000unse/page/120 120\u2013121] |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=978-0-662-27820-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/makingprogressth0000unse/page/120 }}</ref> These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope. The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling [[indulgence]]s (especially by [[Johann Tetzel]]) and the Church's policy on [[purgatory]]. The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. Religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches. The most important [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to emerge directly from the Reformation were the [[Lutheran]]s, and the [[Reformed]]/[[Calvinist]]s/[[Presbyterian]]s. The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. In England, where it gave rise to [[Anglicanism]], the period became known as the [[English Reformation]]. Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.\n\nThe [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, presided by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], declared Martin Luther a heretic and an outlaw (although Charles V  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting Luther). As a result of Charles V's distractions in East Europe and in Spain, he agreed through the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 to allow German princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the Edict of Worms or not, for the time being. After returning to the empire, Charles V attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530 to order all Protestants in the empire to revert to Catholicism. In response, the Protestant territories in and around Germany formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] to fight against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Charles V left again to handle the advance of the Ottoman Turks. He returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the Schmalkaldic League and to issue an imperial law requiring all Protestants to return to Catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to Protestant practices). Warfare ended when Charles V relented in the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552) and in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.\n\nOf the late Inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:<ref name=\"fordhaminquisition\" />\n# the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536\u20131821)\n# the [[Roman Inquisition]] (1542 \u2013 c.1860)\nThis Portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous Spanish Inquisition. The Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of Europe, including [[Avignon]].\n\nThe [[Catholic Reformation]] began in 1545 when the [[Council of Trent]] was called in reaction to the ''Protestant Rebellion''. The idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the [[Catholic clergy|clergy of the Church]], while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church and its position as the sole true [[Church of Christ]] on Earth. The effort sought to prevent further damage to the Church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed [[Protestant denomination]]s.\n\n==== Tsardom of Russia ====\n{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}\n\nIn development of the [[Third Rome]] ideas, the Grand Duke [[Ivan IV]] (the \"Awesome\"<ref>Frank D. McConnell. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rqhZAAAAMAAJ&q=%22ivan+the+awesome%22 Storytelling and Mythmaking: Images from Film and Literature.] [[Oxford University Press]], 1979.  {{ISBN|0-19-502572-5}}; Quote from page 78: \"But Ivan IV, Ivan the Terrible, or as the Russian has it, ''Ivan Groznyi'', \"Ivan the Magnificent\" or \"Ivan the Awesome,\" is precisely a man who has become a legend\"</ref> or \"the Terrible\") was officially crowned the first [[Tsar]] (\"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]\") of Russia in 1547. The Tsar promulgated a new code of laws ([[Sudebnik of 1550]]), established the first Russian feudal representative body ([[Zemsky Sobor]]) and introduced local self-management into the rural regions.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Solovyov, S.|title=History of Russia from the Earliest Times|publisher=AST|year=2001|pages=562\u2013604|volume=6|isbn=978-5-17-002142-0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Skrynnikov, R.|title=Ivan the Terrible|publisher=Academic Intl Pr|year=1981|page=[https://archive.org/details/ivanterrible0000skry/page/219 219]|isbn=978-0-87569-039-1|url=https://archive.org/details/ivanterrible0000skry/page/219}}</ref> During his long reign, Ivan IV nearly doubled the already large Russian territory by annexing the three Tatar khanates (parts of disintegrated [[Golden Horde]]): [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]] along the Volga River, and [[Sibirean Khanate]] in South Western Siberia. Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].\n\nRussia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. The native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian/Ruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe]] and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.\n[[File:Repin Cossacks.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cossacks]] became the backbone of the early Russian Army.]]\nIn 1648, the peasants of [[Ukraine]] joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the river [[Dnieper]], leaving the western part (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) under Polish rule and eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian. Later, in 1670\u201371 the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[fur]]s and [[ivory]]. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian river routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].\n\n=== Discovery and trade ===\n[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), the oldest surviving Portuguese nautical chart showing the results of the explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India, [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Central America, [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Newfoundland and [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] to Brazil. The meridian of [[Tordesillas]], separating the Portuguese and Spanish halves of the world is also depicted]]\nThe [[Age of Discovery]] was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. This factor in the early European modern period was a [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character; the 'discovery' of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.\n\nThe search for new routes was based on the fact that the [[Silk Road]] was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was an impediment to European commercial interests, and other Eastern trade routes were not available to the Europeans due to Muslim control. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to European survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbors. The northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its ''[[maritime history]]'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. In the [[maritime history of Europe]], the carrack and caravel both incorporated the [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more maneuverable. By translating the Arab versions of lost [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|ancient Greek geographical works]] into Latin, European navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of Africa and Asia.\n\n==== Mercantile capitalism ====\n{{Main|Mercantilism|Merchant capitalism}}\n\n[[Mercantilism]] was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). This led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. Internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many European wars of the period and fueled European imperialism. Belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of Adam Smith and the other classical economists won out.\n\nThe [[Commercial Revolution]] was a period of economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. European nations, through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.\n\n===== Trade and the New Economy =====\nIn the [[Old World]], the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and [[spice]]s. Western Europeans used the [[compass]], new [[sailing ship]] technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable [[trade route]] to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.\n{|align=\"center\" class=\"toccolours\"\n! style=\"background:#f8eaba;\"| mDesired trading goods\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Native gold nuggets.jpg|Gold fueled European exploration of the Americas. Explorers reported [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in [[Central America]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]] were to have had large amounts.\nFile:SilverUSGOV.jpg|Silver, valued as a [[precious metal]], has been used to make expensive [[decorative arts|ornaments]], fine [[jewelry]], high-value [[tableware]] and utensils ([[Silver (household)|silverware]]), and [[currency coin]]s.\nFile:Indianspicesherbs.jpg|Spices were among the most luxurious products, the most common being [[black pepper]], [[cinnamon]] (and the cheaper alternative [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]]), [[cumin]], [[nutmeg]], [[ginger]] and [[clove]]s.\n</gallery>\n|-\n|}\nIn terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the [[carrack]] and [[caravel]] designs in [[Portugal]]. These vessels evolved from [[post-classical age|medieval]] European designs from the North Sea and both the Christian and Islamic Mediterranean. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or [[North Sea]] and sail safely on the open [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].\n\nWhen the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.\n\n===== Piracy's Golden Age =====\n{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}\n\nThe [[Golden Age of Piracy]] is a designation given to one or more outbursts of [[piracy]] in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The [[Golden Age of Piracy#The buccaneering period, c. 1650\u20131680|buccaneering period]] covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the [[Pirate Round]] was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-Spanish Succession period extending into the early 18th century, when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, the West African coast, and the Indian Ocean.\n\n==== European states and politics ====\nThe 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.  Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term \"[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]\".<ref>BBC Science & Nature, ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)</ref><ref>BBC History, ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Baroque]] period the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Central Europe decimated the population by up to 20%. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]], consisting of the [[Peace treaty|treaties]] of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], signed on May 15 and October 24, respectively, ended several wars in Europe and established the beginning of [[sovereign state]]s. The treaties involved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ([[Habsburg]]), the Kingdoms of Spain, France and [[Sweden]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and their respective allies among the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] and the [[Free Imperial City|Republican Imperial States]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] congress.  Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed in 1659, ended the [[war]] between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.\n\n===== Absolutism =====\nThe [[Age of Absolutism]] describes the [[monarch]]ical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, [[legislature]]s, or [[social elite]]s of the [[European monarch]]s during the transition from [[feudalism]] to capitalism. Monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. Nations that adopted Absolutism include France, Prussia, and Russia. Nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. Absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of [[Political power|state power]], unification of the [[state law]]s, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of [[nobility]].\n\n===== French power =====\nFor much of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], who was known as the ''Sun King'' (French: ''le Roi Soleil''), France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major [[war]]s\u2014the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]\u2014and two minor conflicts\u2014the [[War of Devolution]], and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Louis ruled according to the [[Divine Right of Kings]], the theory that the King was crowned by God and accountable to him alone. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessor to create a [[Centralized government|centralized state]], governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] that persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the [[Fronde]], and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]].\n\nMen who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Vauban]]. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despr\u00e9aux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Claude Perrault]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre|Le N\u00f4tre]].\n\n===== Early English revolutions =====\nBefore the Age of Revolution, the [[English Civil War]] was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent. The [[English Restoration]], or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 establishes modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in England.\n\n===== International balance of power =====\nThe [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several European powers combined to stop a possible unification of the Kingdoms of Spain and France under a single Bourbon monarch, upsetting the European [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. It was fought mostly in Europe, but it included [[Queen Anne's War]] in North America.  The war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|duc de Villars]], the Jacobite [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed|Duke of Berwick]], the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]].\n\nThe [[Peace of Utrecht]] established after a series of individual [[peace treaty|peace treaties]] signed in the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and [[Philip V of Spain]] on the one hand, and representatives of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] on the other. The treaty enregistered the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and preserved the European system based on the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].<ref>R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.</ref> The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] marked the change from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval supremacy.\n\n== Sub-Saharan Africa ==\n{{further|Dahomey|Aro Confederacy|Ashanti Empire|History of South Africa (1652\u20131815)|Atlantic Slave Trade}}\n\nThe [[Songhai Empire]] took control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] at the beginning of the modern era. It seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenn\u00e9|Jenne]] in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to [[Gao]].<ref name=\"multiple\">Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge 1988</ref>\n\nAround the beginning of the modern era, the [[Benin Kingdom]] was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of West Africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. Benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. By the late 15th century Benin was in contact with [[Portugal]]. At its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the western [[Igbo people|Igbo]].\n\n== New World and Americas ==\n{{Main|European colonization of the Americas|History of colonialism|New World}}\n[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', showing the [[Committee of Five]] in charge of drafting the Declaration in 1776 as it presents its work to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.75|World Colonization of 1492 (Early Modern World), 1550, 1660, 1754 (Age of Enlightenment), 1822 (Industrial revolution), 1885 (European Hegemony), 1914 (World War I era), 1938 (World War II era), 1959 (Cold War era) and 1974, 2008 (Recent history).]]\nThe term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas, Australia and the [[Philippines]].\n\n=== Exploration and conquest of the Americas ===\n\n{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n[[Christopher Columbus]] came to the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north\u2013south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa). The division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which followed the papal decree.)\n\n=== Colonial Latin America ===\n{{See also|New Spain|Spanish empire|Colonial Brazil}}\n\nWhat is now called [[Latin America]], a designation first used in the late 19th century,<ref>Jos\u00e9 C. Moya, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin America''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011</ref> was claimed by Spain and Portugal. The Western Hemisphere, the [[New World]],<ref>There is no known human evolution in the Western Hemisphere so all humans came on foot or boat to the vast new area.</ref> was divided between the two Iberian powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called \"Ibero-America.\" Spain called its overseas empire there \"The Indies,\" with Portugal calling its territory in South America [[Brazil]], after the dyewood found there. Spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, \"Indians,\" who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. Both [[New Spain]] (colonial Mexico) and [[Peru]] fit those criteria and the Spanish crown established [[viceroyalties]] to rule those two large areas. As Spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the Spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during [[Bourbon reforms|administrative reforms]] Rio de la Plata (southeastern South America) and New Granada (northern South America).\n\nInitially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in [[sugarcane]].  Black African slave labour from Portugal's West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized some Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.<ref>[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983.</ref>\n=== Colonial North America ===\n{{See also|New Spain|New France|New Netherland|Colonial history of the United States|Canada under British rule}}\n\nNorth America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in [[New Spain]] or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called [[New Netherland]] (now [[New York State]].). France colonized what is now [[Eastern Canada]], founding [[Quebec City]] in 1608. France's loss in the [[Seven Years' War]] resulted in the transfer of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]], in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.\n\n==Atlantic World==\n{{see also|Atlantic history}}\n[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Waldseem\u00fcller map]] with joint sheets, 1507]]\nA recent development in early modern history is the creation of [[Atlantic World]] as a category. The term generally encompasses western Europe, West Africa, North and South and America and the Caribbean islands. It seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.\n\n== Religion, science, philosophy, and education ==\n{{further|History of religion|History of philosophy}}\n\n=== Eastern philosophies ===\nConcerning the [[history of Philosophy|development of Eastern philosophies]], much of [[Eastern philosophy]] had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. The various [[philosophy|philosophies]] include [[Indian philosophy]],<ref>Of note in modern Indian philosophy are the philosophers who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy, such as [[Swami Vivekananda]].</ref> [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]].\n\n=== Muslim world ===\nThe [[Islamic Golden Age]] reached its peak in the [[High Middle Ages]], stopped short by the [[Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century. The re-establishment of three major Muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires) gave rise to a Muslim cultural revival.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} The [[Safavids]] [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|established]] [[Twelver Shi'a Islam]] as Iran's official religion, thus giving [[Iran]] a separate identity from its [[Sunni]] neighbors.\n\n=== Protestant Reformation ===\n{{Main|Protestant theology}}\n\nThe early modern period was initiated by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the collapse of the unity of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Church]].\nThe theology of [[Calvinism]] in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of [[capitalism]] (''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'').\n\n=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===\n{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}\nThe Counter-Reformation was a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revival in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.\n\nSuch reforms included the foundation of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with [[Christ]], including the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. It also involved political activities that included the [[Roman Inquisition]].\n\nNew religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Ursulines]], [[Theatines]], [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Barnabites]], and especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.\n\n=== Scientific Revolution ===\n[[File:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|thumb|right|147x147px|Model for the Three Superior Planets and Venus from [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum''.]]\n\nThe [[Great Divergence]] in scientific discovery, technological innovation, and economic development began in the early modern period as the pace of change in Western countries increased significantly compared to the rest of the world.\n\nDuring the [[Scientific Revolution]] of the 16th and 17 century, [[empiricism]] and [[modern science]] replaced older methods of studying nature \u2013 European research methods that mainly involved reading texts by ancient writers. In ancient times, [[natural philosopher]]s made observations of nature and came up with explanations, but never conducted [[experiment]]s to test those explanations, because creating an artificial situation was considered an invalid way to discover the rules of nature. The [[scientific method]] of testing hypotheses was first recorded in the 10th century by [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen), inspiring [[Roger Bacon]] to begin experimenting in 13th century Europe. By the time of the Revolution, these methods resulted in accumulation of knowledge that overturned ideas inherited from Ancient Greece (primarily [[Aristotelian physics]], which includes the modern domains of physics, chemistry, biology) through the Middle Ages and Islamic scholars. Major changes of the Scientific Revolution and the 18th century included:\n* The ancient [[geocentric model]] of the solar system (the planets circle the Earth) was replaced by the [[heliocentric model]] (Earth and other planets circle the Sun). Known as the [[Copernican Revolution]], the 1543 publication of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'', which was influenced by [[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-Urdi]] and was based on detailed astronomical observations) is often used to mark the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. Heliocentrism was resisted by the Catholic Church because it contradicted the Bible; the Catholic [[Inquisition]] imprisoned [[Galileo Galilei]] (sometimes called the \"father of modern science\" for his many empirical discoveries) for promoting this theory.\n* Armed with detailed observations from [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] found the idea that the planets moved in ellipses rather than on perfect [[celestial spheres]], publishing [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]. The commonly held idea that the [[fixed stars]] are mounted on a large sphere was replaced by the idea that they are distant suns. [[Astrology and astronomy]] began to separate into different disciplines, with only [[astronomy]] using scientific methods. [[Telescope]] technology improved tremendously as did the [[History of optics|study of optics]].\n* [[Aristotelian_physics#Natural_motion|Aristotle's laws of motion]] were demonstrated to be incorrect, and were replaced by [[Newton's laws of motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. The 1687 publication of [[Isaac Newton]]'s 1687 ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' is often used to mark the end of the Scientific Revolution.\n* A revival of [[atomism]] (denied by Aristotle) and [[corpuscularianism]] began to undermine the [[classical elements]]. Both 8th century Islamic experimenter [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] and 17th century Christian experimenter [[Robert Boyle]] have been described as the founders of modern [[chemistry]], both worked as [[alchemist]]s before the fields were clearly separated. Boyle argued for corpuscularism in the 1661 book ''[[The Sceptical Chymist]]'', and discovered [[Boyle's Law]] of gases. [[Phlogiston theory]] was refuted by empirical discovery of [[conservation of mass]], among other discoveries bring the [[chemical revolution]]. The discovery of modern chemical elements would not begin until the 19th century in the late modern period, followed by experimental confirmation of atoms.\n* Finally overcoming the difficulties human corpses to perform dissections, the anatomical descriptions of the 2nd century [[Galen]] were updated by the 1543 publication of ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' by [[Andreas Vesalius]], considered a foundational text of [[modern medicine]] and [[History of anatomy#Early modern anatomy|early modern anatomy]]. The 1628 work ''[[De Motu Cordis]]'' by [[William Harvey]] was a major advance in the understanding of the [[circulatory system]].\n* The field of [[microbiology]] began with the invention of the [[microscope]] and the first observations of microorganisms, famously by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in the 1670s and probably also by [[Athanasius Kircher]] in the 1640s. Though microorganisms were (correctly) proposed as the cause of infectious diseases as soon as they were discovered, this theory was generally dismissed. Though scientific investigation undermined [[humorism]] in medicine, [[miasma theory]] remained dominant throughout the early modern period. The [[germ theory of disease]] was not widely accepted until the 1880s, in the late modern period.\n* Modern scientific [[dentistry]] was founded by [[Pierre Fauchard]].\n* The [[smallpox vaccine]] was invented in the 1770s and popularized by [[Edward Jenner]] in the 1790s, though it was unclear at the time how it worked.\n* [[Carl Linnaeus]] published the first modern [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] in 1735, replacing Aristotle's [[Great Chain of Being]]. [[Binomial nomenclature]] was used in publications by [[Gaspard Bauhin]] as early as 1622, and by Linnaeus in 1753.\n* The ancient theory of [[spontaneous generation]] remained dominant throughout the early modern period, but the [[history of evolutionary thought]] includes some who questioned the strictest form of this dogma. The idea of partial [[common descent]] was famously promoted by [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]]. [[Evolution]] was not fully articulated and accepted until the 19th century.\n* Modern [[geology]] began to take shape mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Early on, [[Nicolas Steno]] proposed the [[law of superposition]] in 1669, and various writers in the [[history of geology]] began to question the notion derived from the Christian Bible that the Earth was only about 6,000 years old and relatively unchanged over time. Steno and [[James Hutton]] are often considered founders of the modern field. The study of [[fossil]]s and rock types became systematic.\n* Early developments in the [[history of electromagnetism]] during this era include gradual teasing out of the relationships between [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[lightning]]; development of the [[electrostatic generator]] and [[Leyden jar]] for storage; and the discoveries of [[ferromagnetism]], \"electrics\" and \"non-electrics\" ([[Electrical conductor|conductors]] and [[Electrical insulator|insulators]]). The now-obsolete [[fluid theory of electricity]] was developed to explain electrical phenomena in terms of \"vitreous\" and \"resinous\" fluids (later recognized as positive and negative electrical charges). [[Electrochemistry]] was born with the discovery of [[voltaic electricity]] (which would provide a power source for later experimentation) and [[pyroelectricity]]. Around 1784, [[Coulomb's law]] mathematically described the strength of electrical attraction. The discovery that electricity could cause muscles to contracted was termed \"[[Galvanic electricity]]\".\n\nIn the new [[social sciences]]:\n* [[Historical linguistics]] emerged in the late 18th century as a field after the discovery of the common origin what are now called [[Indo-European languages]] by [[philologist]] [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]]\n* The fields of [[anthropology]] and [[paleoanthropology]] emerged in the 18th century, but much of early modern anthropology is now considered [[scientific racism]].\n* The 1776 multi-book publication ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' by [[Adam Smith]] is considered the foundational text of [[classical economics]].\n\nScientific discovery would accelerate in the late modern period, and continues today.\n\n{{See also|History of science|Science in the Age of Enlightenment}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{main|Renaissance technology}}\nInventions of the early modern period included the [[Floating dock (impounded)|floating dock]], [[lifting tower]], [[newspaper]], [[grenade musket]], [[lightning rod]], [[bifocals]], and [[Franklin stove]]. Early attempts at building a practical [[electrical telegraph]] were hindered because [[static electricity]] was the only source available.\n\n=== Enlightenment and reason ===\n{{Main|17th-century philosophy}}\n[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice full.jpg|thumb|upright=1|\"If there is something you know, communicate it. If there is something you don't know, search for it.\" An engraving from the 1772 edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]''; [[Truth]] (center) is surrounded by light and unveiled by the figures to the right, [[Philosophy]] and [[Reason]]|alt=]]\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment]] is also called the Age of Reason because it marked a change from the medieval tradition of [[scholasticism]] based on Christian dogma and the often [[Renaissance magic|occultist]] approach of [[Renaissance philosophy]]. Instead, [[reason]] became the central source of knowledge, beginning the era of [[modern philosophy]], especially in [[Western philosophy]]. The period was typified in Europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]] and often [[politics]] and the [[physical sciences]] as well.\n\nEarly 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some consider it as the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. This era includes [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' [[Cogito, ergo sum|\"I think therefore I am\"]] (1637). The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularization]] in Europe, rising to notability in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1|title=Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysics \u2013 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].\n\n[[Roger Williams]] founded [[Providence Plantations]] in New England, based on the principle of [[separation of church and state]] after being exiled by [[Puritans]] in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. The Enlightenment began at Harvard in 1646.\nThe first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of [[gravity]] by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643\u20131727). Newton, Spinoza, [[John Locke]] (1632\u20131704) and [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647\u20131706) were philosophers sparking the ideas for the furthering of the Enlightenment.\n\nFrench [[French art salons and academies|salon]] culture culminated in the Enlightenment's most influential publication, the great ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' (1751\u20131772), edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713\u20131784) with contributions by hundreds of leading [[philosophes]] (intellectuals) such as [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) and [[Montesquieu]] (1689\u20131755). The [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] shook up the [[French Academy]] in the 1690s, elevating new discoveries over Greek and Roman wisdom. The French Enlightenment was received in Germany, notably fostered by [[Frederick the Great]], the [[king of Prussia]], and gave rise to a flowering of [[German philosophy]], represented foremost by [[Immanuel Kant]].\n\nThe French and German developments were further influential in [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish]], [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish]] philosophy.\n\nThe Enlightenment flourished until about 1790\u20131800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to [[Romanticism]]'s emphasis on emotion and a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] gained force.\n{{further|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|Philosophical skepticism}}\n\n=== Humanism ===\n{{Main|Humanism}}\n{{further|Erasmus}}\nWith the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian [[Renaissance Humanism]] spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nDeveloping during the Enlightenment era, [[Renaissance humanism]] as an intellectual movement spread across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). The term ''umanista'' comes from the latter part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'', a novel curriculum that was competing with the ''[[quadrivium]]'' and [[scholastic logic]].<ref>[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113\u2013114, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (1990).</ref>\n\nIn France, pre-eminent Humanist [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]] (1467\u20131540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian ''umanisti''), Bud\u00e9 was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and helping to found the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France|Coll\u00e8ge des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Coll\u00e8ge de France). Meanwhile, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], the sister of Francis I, herself a poet, novelist and religious mystic,<ref>She was the author of ''Miroir de l'ame pecheresse'' (''The Mirror of a Sinful Soul''), published after her death, among other devotional poetry.

Near the end of the early modern period were the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 marked the end of this period of political upheaval and frequent war, with the rise of new concepts of nationalism and reorganization of military forces. 1815 is the latest year commonly reckoned as the end of the early modern period.\n\n==== The French Revolutions ====\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]'s ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830). The [[French Revolution]] inspired a wave of revolutions across Europe. [[Liberalism]] and [[Nationalism]] were popular ideas that challenged [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchies]] in the 19th century. |alt=]]\n{{Main|French Revolution}}\nToward the middle and latter stages of the Age of Revolution, the French political and social revolutions and radical change saw the French governmental structure transform. It was previously an [[absolute monarchy]] with feudal privileges for the [[aristocracy]] and Catholic clergy. It changed to forms based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles of citizenship and inalienable rights. The first revolution led to government by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], the second by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and the third by the [[French Directory|Directory]].\n\nThe changes were accompanied by violent turmoil, which included the trial and [[execution of Louis XVI]], vast bloodshed and repression during the [[Reign of Terror]], and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that can be traced to the Revolution include the [[Napoleonic Wars]], two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed at one point or another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.\n\n== See also ==\n; Economic concepts\n:[[Price revolution]], [[Proto-globalization]]\n\n; General concepts\n:[[Renaissance]], [[Early Modern English]], [[Early Modern warfare]], [[Periodization]], [[Atlantic history]], [[Timeline of early modern history]]\n\n; Political powers\n:[[Habsburg Spain]], [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Portuguese Empire]], [[Dutch Republic]], [[Early Modern Britain]], [[Early Modern France]], [[History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification|Early Modern Italy]], [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Russian Empire]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mughal Empire]], [[Safavid Empire]]\n\n*[[Cuisine in the early modern world]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Burke, Peter.

Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the [[timeline|timeframe]] spans the period after the late portion of the [[post-classical age]] (c. 1500), known as the [[Middle Ages]], through the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]] (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Ottoman conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, the [[Renaissance]] period in Europe and [[Timurid Renaissance|Timurid Central Asia]], the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Age of Discovery]] (especially the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] beginning in 1492 but also with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s [[Vasco da Gama#First voyage|discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498) and ending around the [[French Revolution]] in 1789.\n\nHistorians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character.<ref>Jan De Vries,  \"The limits of globalization in the early modern world\". ''Economic History Review'' (2010) 63#3 pp: 710\u2013733.</ref> New economies and institutions emerged, becoming more sophisticated and globally articulated over the course of the period. This process began in the medieval North Italian [[city-states]], particularly [[Genoa]], [[Venice]], and [[Milan]] in the west, and in India's [[Bengal Sultanate|Bengal]] in the east. The early modern period also included the rise of the dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. \n\nIn the Americas, Pre-Columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization, including the Aztec Empire and alliance, the [[History of the Incas|Inca civilization]], the [[Maya civilization]] and  its cities, and the [[Muisca Confederation|Chibcha]]. The [[European colonization of the Americas]] began during the early modern period, as did the establishment of European trading hubs in Asia and Africa, which contributed to the [[History of Christianity#Catholic missions|spread of Christianity]] around the world. The rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe, in particular the [[Columbian Exchange]] that linked the [[Old World]] and the [[New World]], greatly altered the human environment. Notably, the [[Atlantic slave trade]] and the [[Genocide of indigenous peoples#Native American Genocide|genocide of Native American peoples]] began during this period. <ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Alan|title=American Colonies|year=2001|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-200210-0|url=https://archive.org/details/americancolonies00tayl}}</ref> Turkey colonized Southeastern Europe, and parts of the West Asia and North Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/434996/Ottoman-Empire |title=Ottoman Empire |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-02-11}}</ref> Russia [[Russian conquest of Siberia|reached the Pacific coast]] in 1647 and consolidated its control over the [[Russian Far East]] in the 19th century.\n\nIn the [[Islamic world]], after the fall of the [[Timurid Renaissance]], powers such as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Suri Empire|Suri]], [[Safavid]], and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] empires grew in strength (three of which are known as [[gunpowder empires]] for the military technology that enabled them). Particularly in the [[Indian subcontinent]], [[Mughal architecture]], [[Indo-Persian culture|culture]], and [[Mughal painting|art]] reached their zenith, while the empire itself is believed to have had the world's largest economy, bigger than the entirety of [[Western Europe]] and worth 25% of global GDP,<ref>[[Angus Maddison|Maddison, Angus]] (2003): ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rHJGz3HiJbcC&pg=PA259 Development Centre Studies The World Economy Historical Statistics: Historical Statistics]'', [[OECD Publishing]], {{ISBN|9264104143}}, pages 259\u2013261</ref> signalling the period of [[proto-industrialization]].<ref name=\"voss\">{{cite book|title=The Ashgate Companion to the History of Textile Workers, 1650\u20132000|author1=Lex Heerma van Voss |author2=Els Hiemstra-Kuperus |author3=Elise van Nederveen Meerkerk |chapter=The Long Globalization and Textile Producers in India|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2010|page=255|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f95ljbhfjxIC&pg=PA255}}</ref>\n\nVarious Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian sphere. In Japan, the [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period. In Korea, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] to the enthronement of [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|King Gojong]]. By the 16th century, Asian economies under the [[Ming dynasty]] and [[Mughal Bengal]] were stimulated by trade with the Portuguese, the Spanish, and the Dutch, while Japan engaged in the [[Nanban trade]] after the arrival of the first European Portuguese during the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]].\n\nThe early modern trends in various regions of the world represented a shift away from medieval modes of organization, politically and economically. [[Feudalism]] declined in Europe, and Christians and Christendom saw the end of the [[Crusades]] and of religious unity under the Roman Catholic Church. The old order was destabilized by the [[Protestant Reformation]], which caused a backlash that expanded the [[Inquisition]] and sparked the disastrous [[European wars of religion|European Wars of Religion]], which included the especially bloody [[Thirty Years' War]] and ended with the establishment of the modern international system in the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Along with the [[European colonization of the Americas]], this period also contained the [[Commercial Revolution]] and the [[Golden Age of Piracy]].\n\nOther notable trends of the early modern period include the development of [[Science|experimental science]], increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], [[secular]]ized civic politics, accelerated travel due to improvements in mapping and ship design, and the emergence of [[nation state]]s. Historians typically date the end of the early modern period when the [[French Revolution]] of the 1790s began the \"late modern\" period.<ref>[[Christopher Bayly|Christopher Alan Bayly]], ''The birth of the modern world, 1780\u20131914: global connections and comparisons'' (2004).</ref>\n\nThe Indian Empires and civilizations of Southeast Asia, mainly the major trading nation known as the [[Bengal Sultanate]], were a vital link in the spice trade. The [[Mughal Empire]] was founded by the descendants of [[Tamerlane]] and its [[Mughal architecture|architecture]] has impressed the world. The archipelagic empires, the Sultanate of Malacca and later the Sultanate of Johor, controlled the southern areas.\n\n== Early modern timeline ==\n{{main|Timeline of early modern

This is usually conceived of as progress driven by deliberate human efforts to better their situation.\n\nAdvances in all areas of human activity\u2014[[politics]], [[industry]], [[society]], [[economics]], [[commerce]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[mechanization]], [[automation]], [[science]], [[medicine]], [[technology]], and [[culture]]\u2014appear to have transformed an ''Old World'' into the ''Modern'' or ''New World''.<ref name=\"GrosvenorModern\">''Contemporary history of the world'' by Edwin Augustus Grosvenor</ref><ref name=\"MicheletAndSimpson\">''A summary of modern history'' by Jules Michelet, Mary Charlotte Mair Simpson</ref> In each case, the identification of the old Revolutionary change can be used to demarcate the old and old-fashioned from the modern.<ref name=\"GrosvenorModern\" /><ref name=\"MicheletAndSimpson\" />\n\nPortions of the Modern world altered its relationship with the [[Bible|Biblical]] and [[Quran|Quranic]] [[value system]]s, revalued the [[monarchy|monarchical]] government system, and abolished the [[feudalism|feudal]] economic system, with new [[democracy|democratic]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas in the areas of [[politics]], [[science]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], and [[economics]].<ref name=\"GrosvenorModern\" /><ref name=\"MicheletAndSimpson\" />\n|}\nThis combination of epoch events totally changed thinking and thought in the early modern period, and so their dates serve as well as any to separate the old from the new modes.\n\nAs an [[Age of Revolution]]s dawned, beginning with those revolts in [[American Revolution|America]] and [[French Revolution|France]], political changes were then pushed forward in other countries partly as a result of upheavals of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and their impact on thought and thinking, from concepts from nationalism to organizing armies.<ref>Crawley, C.W.

However, by the end of the Early Modern Period, China, Korea and Japan were mostly closed and disinterested to Europeans, even while trading relationships grew in port cities such as [[Guangzhou]] and [[Dejima]]. \n=== Chinese dynasties ===\n[[File:Cishou Temple Pagoda.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pagoda of Cishou Temple|Cishou Temple Pagoda]], built in 1576: the Chinese believed that building pagodas on certain sites according to [[Feng shui|geomantic principles]] brought about auspicious events; merchant-funding for such projects was needed by the late Ming period.]]\nAround the beginning of the [[Han Chinese|ethnically Han]] [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), China was leading the world in mathematics as well as science. However, Europe soon caught up to China's scientific and mathematical achievements and surpassed them.<ref>Needham, J. (1956). Mathematics and science in china and the west. ''Science and Society, 20'', 320. Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/1296937594</ref> Many scholars have speculated about the reason behind China's lag in advancement. A historian named Colin Ronan claims that though there is no one specific answer, there must be a connection between China's urgency for new discoveries being weaker than Europe's and China's inability to capitalize on its early advantages. Ronan believes that China's Confucian bureaucracy and traditions led to China not having a scientific revolution, which led China to have fewer scientists to break the existing orthodoxies, like Galileo Galilei.<ref>Bala, Arun.

Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however,  relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.\n\nIn the 16th century the Ming dynasty flourished over maritime trade with the Portuguese, Spanish and Dutch Empires. The trade brought in a massive amount of silver, which China at the time needed desperately. Prior to China's global trade, its economy ran on a paper money. However, in the 14th century, China's paper money system suffered a crisis, and by the mid-15th century, crashed.<ref>Flynn, D. O., & Giraldez, A.

The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders, such as [[Li Zicheng]], to challenge Ming authority.\n\nThe Ming dynasty fell around 1644 to the [[Manchu people|ethnically Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]], which would be the last [[dynasties in Chinese history|dynasty of China]]. The Qing ruled from 1644 to 1912, with a brief, [[Manchu Restoration|abortive restoration]] in 1917. During its reign, the Qing dynasty adopted many of the outward features of [[Chinese culture]] in establishing its rule, but did not necessarily \"assimilate\", instead adopting a more universalist style of governance.<ref>Crossley, P. K. (1999). ''A Translucent Mirror: History and Identity in Qing Imperial Ideology'', 29-36.</ref>{{huh|date=October 2019}} The Manchus were formerly known as the [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]]. When Beijing was captured by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasant rebels in 1644, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] and seized control of [[Beijing]], which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of [[China proper]]. Schoppa, the editor of ''The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History'' argues, <blockquote>\"A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'.

Although a start date of 1573 is often given, in more broad terms, the period begins with [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s entry into Kyoto in 1568, when he led his army to the imperial capital in order to install [[Ashikaga Yoshiaki]] as the 15th, and ultimately final, sh\u014dgun of the [[Ashikaga shogunate]], and it lasts until the coming to power of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] after his victory over supporters of the Toyotomi clan at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600.<ref>''Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan'' (First edition, 1983), section \"Azuchi-Momoyama History (1568\u20131600)\" by George Elison, in the entry for \"history of Japan\".</ref> Tokugawa received the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603, establishing the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].\n\nThe [[Edo period]] from 1600 to 1868 characterized early modern Japan. The Tokugawa shogunate was a [[feudal]]ist regime of Japan established by [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] and ruled by the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'' of the [[Tokugawa clan]]. The period gets its name from the capital city, [[Edo]], now called Tokyo. The Tokugawa shogunate ruled from [[Edo Castle]] from 1603 until 1868, when it was abolished during the [[Meiji Restoration]] in the late [[Edo period]] (often called the [[Late Tokugawa shogunate]]).\n\nSociety in the Japanese \"[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]\" ([[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the [[warrior]]-caste of [[samurai]], with the [[farmer]]s, [[artisans]], and [[merchant|traders]] ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy.<ref name=\"HCAotW\">{{Citation|title=HarperCollins atlas of world history|date=2003|volume=|page=175|others=Barraclough, Geoffrey, 1908\u20131984., Stone, Norman., HarperCollins (Firm)|publisher=Borders Press in association with HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-681-50288-8|oclc=56350180}}</ref> Literacy among the Japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolation.<ref name=\"HCAotW\" />\n\nIn some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimy\u014ds'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimy\u014ds'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. [[Taxes]] on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for [[inflation]] or other changes in [[monetary]] value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.\n\n=== Korean dynasty ===\nIn 1392, General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]] established the [[Joseon]] dynasty (1392\u20131910) with a largely bloodless coup.

Japan failed both times due to Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], Korea's revered naval genius, who lead the Korean Navy using advanced metal clad ships called [[turtle ship]]s. Because the ships were armed with cannons, Admiral Yi's navy was able to demolish the Japanese invading fleets, destroying hundreds of ships in Japan's second invasion.<ref name=\":1\" /> During the 17th century, Korea was invaded again, this time by Manchurians, who would later take over China as the Qing Dynasty. In 1637, King [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] was forced to surrender to the Qing forces, and was ordered to send princesses as concubines to the Qing Prince [[Dorgon]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&pg=PA892|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic E.|date=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520048041|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter invasions from Manchuria, Joseon experienced nearly 200 years of peace. However, whatever power the kingdom recovered during its isolation further waned as the 18th century came to a close, and Korea was faced with internal strife, power struggles, international pressure and rebellions at home. The Joseon dynasty declined rapidly in the late 19th century.\n\n== Indian Empires ==\n[[File:Islamic Gunpowder Empires.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the [[Islamic Gunpowders]], the [[Mughal Empire]] being the orange one.]]\n\n===Regional empires===\n[[File:Shah Abbas the Great receiving the Mughal ambassador Khan\u2019Alam in 1618.jpg|thumb|The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ambassador Khan\u2019Alam in 1618 negotiating with [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas the Great]] of [[Safavid dynasty|Iran]]. ]]\nOn the [[Indian subcontinent]], the [[Lodi dynasty]] ruled over the [[Delhi Sultanate]] during its last phase.

During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.\n\n=== British and Dutch colonization ===\n\nThe development of [[New Imperialism]] saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers.

Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers.

This was perhaps the golden age of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The Ottomans expanded southwest into North Africa while battling with the re-emergent [[Persia]]n Shi'a [[Safavid Empire]] to the east.\n\n=== North and Northeast Africa ===\nIn the [[Saracen]] sphere, the Ottomans seized Egypt in 1517 and established the regencies of [[Algeria]], Tunisia, and [[Tripolitania|Tripoli]] (between 1519 and 1551), [[Morocco]] remaining an independent Arabized [[Berber state]] under the [[Sharifan dynasty]].\n\n[[File:Adal.PNG|thumb|left|The Territory of the [[Adal Sultanate]] and its vassal states circa 1500.]]\n\nIn the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], the [[Solomonic dynasty]] established itself in the 13th century. Claiming direct descent from the old [[Axum]]ite royal house, the Solomonic ruled the region well into modern history. In the 16th century, [[Shewa]] and the rest of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] were [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquered]] by the forces of [[Ahmed Gurey]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]] to the northwest. The conquest of the area by the [[Oromo migrations|Oromo]] ended in the contraction of both Adal and Abyssinia, changing regional dynamics for centuries to come.\n\nThe [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]], which was one of the largest and strongest empires in the [[Horn of Africa]], began to decline in the 17th century, and several powerful successor states came to prominence. The [[Geledi Sultanate]], established by [[Ibrahim Adeer]], was a notable successor of the Ajuran Sultanate. The [[Sultanate]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of [[Sultan]] [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]] (reigned 1798 to 1848), who successfully consolidated Geledi power during the [[Bardera]] wars, and [[Sultan]] [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman]]i Empire to pay [[tribute]]. The [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] was a [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Sultan]]ate in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northern and central [[Somalia]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network. Along with the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] ruled by Sultan [[Yusuf Ali Kenadid]], the Majeerteen Sultanate was eventually annexed into [[Italian Somaliland]] in the early 20th century, following the military Campaign of the Sultanates.\n\n=== Safavids ===\n{{Main|Safavid Empire}}\nThe [[Safavid Empire]] was a great Shia [[Persianate society|Persianate empire]] after the Islamic conquest of Persia and established of Islam, marking an important point in the history of Islam in the east. The Safavid dynasty was founded about 1501. From their base in Ardabil, the Safavids established control over all of Persia and reasserted the Iranian identity of the region, thus becoming the first native dynasty since the [[Sassanids]] to establish a unified Iranian state. Problematic for the Safavids was the powerful Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans, a Sunni dynasty, fought several campaigns against the Safavids.\n\nWhat fueled the growth of Safavid economy was its position between the burgeoning civilizations of Europe to its west and Islamic Central Asia to its east and north. The Silk Road, which led from Europe to East Asia, revived in the 16th century. Leaders also supported direct sea trade with Europe, particularly England and The Netherlands, which sought Persian carpet, silk, and textiles. Other exports were horses, goat hair, pearls, and an inedible bitter almond hadam-talka used as a spice in India. The main imports were spice, textiles (woolens from Europe, cotton from Gujarat), metals, coffee, and sugar. Despite their demise in 1722, the Safavids left their mark by establishing and spreading Shi'a Islam in major parts of the Caucasus and West Asia.\n\n=== Uzbeks and Afghan Pashtuns ===\n{{Main|Uzbeks|Pashtun people}}\nIn the 16th to early 18th centuries, [[Central Asia]] was under the rule of [[Uzbeks]], and the far eastern portions were ruled by the local [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]]. Between the 15th and 16th centuries, various nomadic tribes arrived from the steppes, including the [[Kipchak people|Kipchaks]], [[Naymans]], [[Kanglis]], [[Khongirad]], and [[Manguds]]. These groups were led by [[Muhammad Shaybani]], who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Uzbeks.\n\nThe lineage of the [[Afghan (name)|Afghan]] Pashtuns stretches back to the [[Hotaki]] dynasty.<ref name=\"US State Dept\">[http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html Afghanistan: History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113054241/http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/bgnotes/sa/afghanistan9407.html |date=2017-11-13 }}, ''U.S. Department of State'' (retrieved 10 October 2006).</ref> Following Muslim Arab and Turkic conquests, Pashtun ''[[Ghazw|ghazis]]'' (warriors for the faith) invaded and conquered much of northern India during the [[Lodhi dynasty]] and [[Suri dynasty]].

However, \"Renaissance\" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments that occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of Europe\u2014especially central and northern [[Italy]]\u2014and it spans the transition from late [[medieval]] civilization to the opening of the early modern period. In the visual arts and architecture, the term \"early modern\" is not a common designation as the Renaissance period is clearly distinct from what came later. Only in the study of literature is the early modern period a standard designation. European music of the period is generally divided between [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Similarly, philosophy is divided between [[Renaissance philosophy]] and [[the Enlightenment]]. In other fields, there is far more continuity through the period such as [[gunpowder warfare|warfare]] and [[History of science|science]].\n\n=== Gunpowder and firearms ===\nWhen gunpowder was introduced to Europe, it was immediately used almost exclusively in weapons and explosives for warfare. Though it was invented in China, gunpowder arrived in Europe already formulated for military use and European countries took advantage of it and were the first to create the classic firearms.<ref name=\":0\" /> The advances made in gunpowder and firearms was directly tied to the decline in the use of plate armor because of the inability of the armor to protect one from bullets.\n\n=== European kingdoms and movements ===\nIn the early modern period, the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was a union of territories in Central Europe under a [[Holy Roman Emperor]] the first of which was [[Otto I]]. The last was [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], who [[abdication|abdicated]] and dissolved the Empire in 1806 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Despite its name, for much of its history the Empire did not include Rome within its borders.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=renaissance&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}</ref> was a cultural movement that spanned roughly the 14th to the 17th century, beginning in Italy in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The term is also used more loosely to refer to the historic [[era]], but since the changes of the Renaissance were not uniform across Europe, this is a general use of the term. As a cultural movement, it encompassed a rebellion of learning based on [[Classical antiquity|classical]] sources, the development of linear [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in painting, and gradual but widespread [[History of education|educational]] reform.\n\n==== Notable individuals ====\n[[File:Press -Bettman.jpg|thumb|left|Gutenberg reviewing a press proof (a colored engraving created probably in the 19th century)]]\n\n[[Johannes Gutenberg]] is credited as the first European to use [[movable type]] [[printing]], around 1439, and as the global inventor of the mechanical [[printing press]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] formulated a comprehensive [[heliocentrism|heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] (1543), which displaced the [[Earth]] from the center of the universe.<ref>A Greek mathematician, [[Aristarchus of Samos]], had already discussed heliocentric hypotheses as early as the third century BCE. However, there is little evidence that he ever developed his ideas beyond a very basic outline [[#Reference-Dreyer-1953|(Dreyer, 1953]], [https://archive.org/stream/historyofplaneta00dreyuoft#page/134/mode/2up pp.135\u201348]; [[#Reference-Linton-2004|Linton, 2004, p. 39)]].</ref> His book, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres'') began modern [[astronomy]] and sparked the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Another notable individual was [[Machiavelli]], an Italian political philosopher, considered a founder of modern [[political science]]. Machiavelli is most famous for a short political treatise, [[The Prince]], a work of [[Political realism|realist]] [[political theory]].\n\nAmong the notable royalty of the time, [[Charles the Bold]], known as ''Charles the Bold (or Rash)'' to his enemies,<ref>The title was derived from his savage behavior against his enemies, and particularly from a war with France in late 1471: frustrated by the refusal of the French to engage in open battle, and angered by French attacks on his unprotected borders in Hainault and Flanders, Charles marched his army back from the Ile-de-France to Burgundian territory, burning over two thousand towns, villages and castles on his way\u2014Taylor, Aline S. ''Isabel of Burgundy''. Lanham, Md: Madison Books, c2001, pp. 212\u2013213</ref> he was the last [[House of Valois|Valois]] [[Duke of Burgundy]], and his early death was a pivotal, if under-recognized, moment in European history. Charles has often been regarded as the last representative of the feudal spirit\u2014a man who possessed no other quality than a blind bravery. Upon his death, Charles left an unmarried nineteen-year-old daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], as his heir. Her marriage would have enormous implications for the political balance of Europe. The Habsburg Emperor secured the match for his son, the future [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], with the aid of Mary's stepmother, Margaret. In 1477, the territory of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was annexed by France. In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, [[Archduke of Austria]], giving the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]] control of the remainder of the [[Burgundian Inheritance]].\n\n[[File:Hanging houses in Cuenca Spain.jpg|thumb|15th century Hanging Houses in [[Cuenca, Spain|Cuenca]], [[Spain]] from the [[Early Renaissance]], and the Early modern period.]]\n\n[[Claude de Lorraine]] was the first [[Duke of Guise]], from 1528 to his death. Claude distinguished himself at the [[battle of Marignano]] (1515), and was long in recovering from the twenty-two wounds he received in the battle. In 1521, he fought at [[Fuenterrabia]], and [[Louise of Savoy]] ascribed the capture of the place to his efforts. In 1523 he became governor of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], after defeating at [[Neufch\u00e2teau, Vosges|Neufch\u00e2teau]] the [[Holy Roman Empire|imperial]] troops who had invaded this province. In 1525 he destroyed the [[Anabaptist]] [[German Peasants' War|peasant army]], which was overrunning [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], at [[Lupstein]], near [[Saverne]] (Zabern). On the return of Francis I from captivity in 1528, Claude was made Duke of Guise in the [[peerage of France]], though up to this time only princes of the royal house had held the title of duke and peer of France. The Guises, as cadets of the sovereign house of Lorraine and descendants of the [[House of Valois-Anjou|house of Anjou]], claimed precedence of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] princes of [[Prince of Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]] and [[Prince of Conti|Conti]].\n\nThe [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|3rd Duke of Alba]] was a nobleman of importance in the early modern period, nicknamed the \"Iron Duke\" by the Protestants of the [[Low Countries]] because of his harsh rule and cruelty. Tales of atrocities committed during his military operations in [[Flanders]] became part of Dutch and English folklore, forming a central component of the [[Spanish Black Legend]].\n\nIn England, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was the [[King of England]] and a significant figure in the history of the [[English monarchy]]. Although in the greater part of his reign he brutally suppressed the influence of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in England,<ref>''See [[William Tyndale|''Martyrdom of William Tyndale''.]]''</ref> a movement having some roots with [[John Wycliffe]] in the 14th century, he is more popularly known for his political struggles with [[Roman Catholic Church|Rome]]. These struggles ultimately led to the separation of the [[Church of England]] from papal authority, the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], and establishing himself as the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]]. Though Henry reportedly became a Protestant on his death-bed{{CN|date=March 2020}}, he advocated Catholic ceremony and doctrine throughout his life. Royal support for the [[English Reformation]] began with his heirs, the devout [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] and the renowned [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], whilst daughter [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] temporarily reinstated papal authority over England. Henry also oversaw the legal union of England and [[Wales]] with the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]]. He is also noted for his [[Wives of Henry VIII|six wives]], two of whom were [[Decapitation|beheaded]].\n\n=== Christians and Christendom ===\n[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach - Mass in B minor - Agnus Dei.ogg|right|thumb|Johann Sebastian Bach \u2013 Mass in B minor \u2013 Agnus Dei, From 1724]]\n{{Main|History of Christianity|Christendom}}\n\nChristianity was challenged at the beginning of the modern period with the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 and later by various movements to reform the church (including Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Calvinist), followed by the [[Counter Reformation]].\n\n==== End of the Crusades and Unity ====\n[[File:Battle of Vienna 1683 11.PNG|thumb|Battle of Vienna, 12 September 1683]]\n\nThe [[Hussite Wars|Hussite Crusades]] involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of [[Jan Hus]] in [[Bohemia#Hussite Bohemia|Bohemia]] ending ultimately with the [[Battle of Grotniki]]. Also known as the Hussite Wars, they were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The [[Taborite]] faction of the [[Hussite]] warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armored knights helped effect the infantry revolution. In totality, the Hussite Crusades were inconclusive.\n\nThe last crusade, the ''Crusade of 1456'', was organized to counter the expanding Ottoman Empire and lift the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]], and was led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]. The siege eventually escalated into a major battle, during which Hunyadi led a sudden counterattack that overran the Turkish camp, ultimately compelling the wounded Sultan Mehmet II to lift the siege and retreat. The siege of Belgrade has been characterized as having \"decided the fate of [[Christendom]]\".<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html Pope Calixtus III account from 1456 to the Burgundian bishop talking about the savior of Christianity at Belgrade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413030956/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/bluedot/belgrade.html |date=2009-04-13 }}</ref> The [[noon bell]] ordered by [[Pope Callixtus III]] commemorates the victory throughout the [[Christian world]] to this day.\n\nNearly a hundred years later, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] officially ended the idea that all Christians could be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (\"whose the region is, [it shall have] his religion\") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established in [[international law]] with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian [[hegemony]], i.e. the \"One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church\" of the [[Nicene Creed]]. Each government determined the religion of their own state. Christians living in states where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will. With the Treaty of Westphalia, the [[European wars of religion|Wars of Religion]] came to an end, and in the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713 the concept of the [[national sovereignty|sovereign national state]] was born. The ''Corpus Christianum'' has since existed with the modern idea of a tolerant and diverse society consisting of many different communities.\n\n==== Inquisitions and Reformations ====\n{{Main|Spanish Inquisition|Protestant Reformation|Inquisition|Catholic Reformation}}\n\nThe modern [[Inquisition]] refers to any one of several institutions charged with trying and convicting [[Christian heresy|heretics]] (or other offenders against [[canon law]]) within the Catholic Church. In the modern era, the first manifestation was the [[Spanish Inquisition]] of 1478 to 1834.<ref name=\"fordhaminquisition\">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/inquisition1.html Medieval Sourcebook: Inquisition \u2013 Introduction]</ref> The Inquisition prosecuted individuals accused of a wide array of crimes related to heresy, including [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]],<ref>this also includes [[Maleficium (sorcery)|black magic (Maleficium)]].</ref> [[blasphemy]], [[Judaizing]] and [[witchcraft]], as well for [[censorship]] of printed literature. Because of its objective\u2014combating heresy\u2014the Inquisition had jurisdiction only over baptized members of the Church (which, however, encompassed the vast majority of the population in Catholic countries). Secular courts could still try non-Christians for blasphemy (most of the [[witch trials]] went through secular courts).\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation]] and rise of [[modernity]] in the early 16th century entailed the start of a series of changes in the ''[[Corpus Christianum]]''. [[Martin Luther]] challenged the Catholic Church with his [[Ninety-five Theses]], generally accepted as the beginning of the Reformation, a Christian reform movement in Europe, though precursors such as [[Jan Hus]] predate him. The Protestant movement of the 16th century occurred under the protection of the [[Electorate of Saxony]], an independent hereditary [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Elector [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]] established a [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|university at Wittenberg]] in 1502. The [[Augustinian monk]] Martin Luther became professor of philosophy there in 1508. At the same time, he became one of the preachers at the castle church of Wittenberg.\n\nOn 31 October 1517, Luther posted his ''Ninety-five Theses'' on the door of the [[All Saints' Church, Wittenberg|All Saints' Church]], which served as a notice board for university-related announcements.<ref name=\"Simon-120-121\">{{cite book |first=Edith |last=Simon |title=Great Ages of Man: The Reformation |pages=[https://archive.org/details/makingprogressth0000unse/page/120 120\u2013121] |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1966 |isbn=978-0-662-27820-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/makingprogressth0000unse/page/120 }}</ref> These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope. The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling [[indulgence]]s (especially by [[Johann Tetzel]]) and the Church's policy on [[purgatory]]. The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines. Religious disagreements between various leading figures led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches. The most important [[Christian denomination|denominations]] to emerge directly from the Reformation were the [[Lutheran]]s, and the [[Reformed]]/[[Calvinist]]s/[[Presbyterian]]s. The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries. In England, where it gave rise to [[Anglicanism]], the period became known as the [[English Reformation]]. Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements.\n\nThe [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521, presided by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], declared Martin Luther a heretic and an outlaw (although Charles V  was more preoccupied with maintaining his vast empire than with arresting Luther). As a result of Charles V's distractions in East Europe and in Spain, he agreed through the [[Diet of Speyer (1526)|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 to allow German princes to effectively decide themselves whether to enforce the Edict of Worms or not, for the time being. After returning to the empire, Charles V attended the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1530 to order all Protestants in the empire to revert to Catholicism. In response, the Protestant territories in and around Germany formed the [[Schmalkaldic League]] to fight against the Catholic Holy Roman Empire. Charles V left again to handle the advance of the Ottoman Turks. He returned in 1547 to launch a military campaign against the Schmalkaldic League and to issue an imperial law requiring all Protestants to return to Catholic practices (with a few superficial concessions to Protestant practices). Warfare ended when Charles V relented in the [[Peace of Passau]] (1552) and in the [[Peace of Augsburg]] (1555), which formalized the law that the rulers of a land decide its religion.\n\nOf the late Inquisitions in the modern era, there were two different manifestations:<ref name=\"fordhaminquisition\" />\n# the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] (1536\u20131821)\n# the [[Roman Inquisition]] (1542 \u2013 c.1860)\nThis Portuguese inquisition was a local analogue of the more famous Spanish Inquisition. The Roman Inquisition covered most of the [[Italian peninsula]] as well as [[Malta]] and also existed in isolated pockets of papal jurisdiction in other parts of Europe, including [[Avignon]].\n\nThe [[Catholic Reformation]] began in 1545 when the [[Council of Trent]] was called in reaction to the ''Protestant Rebellion''. The idea was to reform the state of worldliness and disarray that had befallen some of the [[Catholic clergy|clergy of the Church]], while reaffirming the spiritual authority of the Catholic Church and its position as the sole true [[Church of Christ]] on Earth. The effort sought to prevent further damage to the Church and her faithful at the hands of the newly formed [[Protestant denomination]]s.\n\n==== Tsardom of Russia ====\n{{Main|Tsardom of Russia}}\n\nIn development of the [[Third Rome]] ideas, the Grand Duke [[Ivan IV]] (the \"Awesome\"<ref>Frank D.

Thus by the end of the 16th century Russia was transformed into a [[multiethnic]], multiconfessional and [[transcontinental state]].\n\nRussia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. The native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian/Ruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the [[Eurasian Steppe|steppe]] and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.\n[[File:Repin Cossacks.jpg|left|thumb|[[Cossacks]] became the backbone of the early Russian Army.]]\nIn 1648, the peasants of [[Ukraine]] joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the river [[Dnieper]], leaving the western part (or [[Right-bank Ukraine]]) under Polish rule and eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian. Later, in 1670\u201371 the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[fur]]s and [[ivory]]. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian river routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the [[Bering Strait]] between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by [[Fedot Popov]] and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]].\n\n=== Discovery and trade ===\n[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cantino planisphere]] (1502), the oldest surviving Portuguese nautical chart showing the results of the explorations of [[Vasco da Gama]] to India, [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] to Central America, [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] to Newfoundland and [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] to Brazil. The meridian of [[Tordesillas]], separating the Portuguese and Spanish halves of the world is also depicted]]\nThe [[Age of Discovery]] was a period from the early 15th century and continuing into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners to feed burgeoning capitalism in Europe. They also were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and [[spices]]. In the process, Europeans encountered peoples and mapped lands previously unknown to them. This factor in the early European modern period was a [[proto-globalization|globalizing]] character; the 'discovery' of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe was an important historical event.\n\nThe search for new routes was based on the fact that the [[Silk Road]] was controlled by the Ottoman Empire, which was an impediment to European commercial interests, and other Eastern trade routes were not available to the Europeans due to Muslim control. The ability to outflank the Muslim states of North Africa was seen as crucial to European survival. At the same time, the Iberians learnt much from their Arab neighbors. The northwestern region of [[Eurasia]] has a very long coastline, and has arguably been more influenced by its ''[[maritime history]]'' than any other continent. Europe is uniquely situated between several navigable seas, and intersected by navigable rivers running into them in a way that greatly facilitated the influence of maritime traffic and commerce. In the [[maritime history of Europe]], the carrack and caravel both incorporated the [[lateen sail]] that made ships far more maneuverable. By translating the Arab versions of lost [[History of geography#Greco-Roman world|ancient Greek geographical works]] into Latin, European navigators acquired a deeper knowledge of the shape of Africa and Asia.\n\n==== Mercantile capitalism ====\n{{Main|Mercantilism|Merchant capitalism}}\n\n[[Mercantilism]] was the dominant school of economic thought throughout the early modern period (from the 16th to the 18th century). This led to some of the first instances of significant government intervention and control over the economy, and it was during this period that much of the modern capitalist system was established. Internationally, mercantilism encouraged the many European wars of the period and fueled European imperialism. Belief in mercantilism began to fade in the late 18th century, as the arguments of Adam Smith and the other classical economists won out.\n\nThe [[Commercial Revolution]] was a period of economic expansion, [[colonialism]], and mercantilism that lasted from approximately the 16th century until the early 18th century. Beginning with the [[Crusades]], Europeans rediscovered spices, silks, and other commodities rare in Europe. This development created a new desire for trade, which expanded in the second half of the [[Middle Ages]]. European nations, through [[Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]], were looking for new trade routes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which allowed the European powers to build vast, new [[international trade]] networks. Nations also sought new sources of wealth. To deal with this new-found wealth, new economic theories and practices were created. Because of competing national interest, nations had the desire for increased world power through their colonial empires. The Commercial Revolution is marked by an increase in general commerce, and in the growth of non-manufacturing pursuits, such as banking, insurance, and investing.\n\n===== Trade and the New Economy =====\nIn the [[Old World]], the most desired trading goods were gold, silver, and [[spice]]s. Western Europeans used the [[compass]], new [[sailing ship]] technologies, new maps, and advances in astronomy to seek a viable [[trade route]] to Asia for valuable spices that Mediterranean powers could not contest.\n{|align=\"center\" class=\"toccolours\"\n! style=\"background:#f8eaba;\"| mDesired trading goods\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Native gold nuggets.jpg|Gold fueled European exploration of the Americas. Explorers reported [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] in [[Central America]], [[Peru]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]] were to have had large amounts.\nFile:SilverUSGOV.jpg|Silver, valued as a [[precious metal]], has been used to make expensive [[decorative arts|ornaments]], fine [[jewelry]], high-value [[tableware]] and utensils ([[Silver (household)|silverware]]), and [[currency coin]]s.\nFile:Indianspicesherbs.jpg|Spices were among the most luxurious products, the most common being [[black pepper]], [[cinnamon]] (and the cheaper alternative [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]]), [[cumin]], [[nutmeg]], [[ginger]] and [[clove]]s.\n</gallery>\n|-\n|}\nIn terms of shipping advances, the most important developments were the creation of the [[carrack]] and [[caravel]] designs in [[Portugal]]. These vessels evolved from [[post-classical age|medieval]] European designs from the North Sea and both the Christian and Islamic Mediterranean. They were the first ships that could leave the relatively placid and calm [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] or [[North Sea]] and sail safely on the open [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].\n\nWhen the [[carrack]] and then the [[caravel]] were developed in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], European thoughts returned to the fabled East. These explorations have a number of causes. [[Monetarists]] believe the main reason the Age of Exploration began was because of a severe shortage of [[bullion]] in Europe. The European economy was dependent on gold and silver currency, but low domestic supplies had plunged much of Europe into a recession. Another factor was the centuries-long conflict between the Iberians and the Muslims to the south.\n\n===== Piracy's Golden Age =====\n{{Main|Golden Age of Piracy}}\n\nThe [[Golden Age of Piracy]] is a designation given to one or more outbursts of [[piracy]] in the early modern period, spanning from the mid-17th century to the mid-18th century. The [[Golden Age of Piracy#The buccaneering period, c. 1650\u20131680|buccaneering period]] covers approximately the late 17th century. The period is characterized by Anglo-French seamen based on Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. A sailing route known as the [[Pirate Round]] was followed by certain Anglo-American pirates at the turn of the 18th century, associated with long-distance voyages from Bermuda and the Americas to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. The post-Spanish Succession period extending into the early 18th century, when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the American eastern seaboard, the West African coast, and the Indian Ocean.\n\n==== European states and politics ====\nThe 15th to 18th century period is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable European nation states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.  Although the Renaissance included revolutions in many [[intellectual]] pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for European artistic developments and the contributions of such [[polymath]]s as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Michelangelo]], who inspired the term \"[[Polymath|Renaissance man]]\".<ref>BBC Science & Nature, ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/science/leonardo/ Leonardo da Vinci]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)</ref><ref>BBC History, ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/michelangelo.shtml Michelangelo]'' (Retrieved on May 12, 2007)</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Baroque]] period the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Central Europe decimated the population by up to 20%. In 1648, the [[Peace of Westphalia]], consisting of the [[Peace treaty|treaties]] of [[Osnabr\u00fcck]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], signed on May 15 and October 24, respectively, ended several wars in Europe and established the beginning of [[sovereign state]]s. The treaties involved the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] ([[Habsburg]]), the Kingdoms of Spain, France and [[Sweden]], the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] and their respective allies among the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] and the [[Free Imperial City|Republican Imperial States]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia resulted from the first modern [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] congress.  Until 1806, the regulations became part of the constitutional laws of the Holy Roman Empire.  The [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed in 1659, ended the [[war]] between France and Spain and is often considered part of the overall accord.\n\n===== Absolutism =====\nThe [[Age of Absolutism]] describes the [[monarch]]ical power that was unrestrained by any other institutions, such as churches, [[legislature]]s, or [[social elite]]s of the [[European monarch]]s during the transition from [[feudalism]] to capitalism. Monarchs described as absolute can especially be found in the 17th century through the 19th century. Nations that adopted Absolutism include France, Prussia, and Russia. Nobles tended to trade privileges for allegiance throughout the eighteenth century, so that the interests of the nobility aligned with that of the crown. Absolutism is characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of [[Political power|state power]], unification of the [[state law]]s, drastic increase in tax revenue collected by the monarch, and a decrease in the influence of [[nobility]].\n\n===== French power =====\nFor much of the reign of [[Louis XIV]], who was known as the ''Sun King'' (French: ''le Roi Soleil''), France stood as the leading power in Europe, engaging in three major [[war]]s\u2014the [[Franco-Dutch War]], the [[Nine Years War|War of the League of Augsburg]], and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]\u2014and two minor conflicts\u2014the [[War of Devolution]], and the [[War of the Reunions]]. Louis ruled according to the [[Divine Right of Kings]], the theory that the King was crowned by God and accountable to him alone. Consequently, he has long been considered the archetypal [[Absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]]. Louis XIV continued the work of his predecessor to create a [[Centralized government|centralized state]], governed from the capital to sweep away the remnants of [[feudalism]] that persisted in parts of France. He succeeded in breaking the power of the provincial nobility, much of which had risen in revolt during his minority called the [[Fronde]], and forced many leading nobles to live with him in his lavish [[Palace of Versailles]].\n\nMen who featured prominently in the political and military life of France during this period include [[Cardinal Mazarin|Mazarin]], [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], [[Vauban]]. French culture likewise flourished during this era, producing a number of figures of great renown, including [[Moli\u00e8re]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]], [[Nicolas Boileau-Despr\u00e9aux|Boileau]], [[Jean de La Fontaine|La Fontaine]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]], [[Charles Le Brun|Le Brun]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud|Rigaud]], [[Louis Le Vau]], [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]], [[Claude Perrault]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre|Le N\u00f4tre]].\n\n===== Early English revolutions =====\nBefore the Age of Revolution, the [[English Civil War]] was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists. The first and second civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester. The monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England ended with the victors consolidating the established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent. The [[English Restoration]], or simply put as the Restoration, began in 1660 when the English, Scottish and Irish monarchies were all restored under Charles II after the Commonwealth of England that followed the English Civil War. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 establishes modern [[parliamentary democracy]] in England.\n\n===== International balance of power =====\nThe [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a war fought between 1701 and 1714, in which several European powers combined to stop a possible unification of the Kingdoms of Spain and France under a single Bourbon monarch, upsetting the European [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]]. It was fought mostly in Europe, but it included [[Queen Anne's War]] in North America.  The war was marked by the military leadership of notable generals like the [[Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars|duc de Villars]], the Jacobite [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick-upon-Tweed|Duke of Berwick]], the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]].\n\nThe [[Peace of Utrecht]] established after a series of individual [[peace treaty|peace treaties]] signed in the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] concluded between various European states helped end the War of the Spanish Succession. The representatives who met were Louis XIV of France and [[Philip V of Spain]] on the one hand, and representatives of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], the [[Duchy of Savoy|Duke of Savoy]], and the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] on the other. The treaty enregistered the defeat of French ambitions expressed in the wars of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and preserved the European system based on the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]].<ref>R.R. Palmer, ''A History of the Modern World'' 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234.</ref> The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] marked the change from [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] naval supremacy.\n\n== Sub-Saharan Africa ==\n{{further|Dahomey|Aro Confederacy|Ashanti Empire|History of South Africa (1652\u20131815)|Atlantic Slave Trade}}\n\nThe [[Songhai Empire]] took control of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] at the beginning of the modern era. It seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenn\u00e9|Jenne]] in 1473, building the regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. The empire eventually made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought Muslim scholars to [[Gao]].<ref name=\"multiple\">Ira M. Lapidus, A History of Islamic Societies, Cambridge 1988</ref>\n\nAround the beginning of the modern era, the [[Benin Kingdom]] was an independent trading power in the southeastern coastline of West Africa, blocking the access of other inland nations to the coastal ports. Benin may have housed 100,000 inhabitants at its height, spreading over twenty-five square kilometres, enclosed by three concentric rings of earthworks. By the late 15th century Benin was in contact with [[Portugal]]. At its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the western [[Igbo people|Igbo]].\n\n== New World and Americas ==\n{{Main|European colonization of the Americas|History of colonialism|New World}}\n[[File:Declaration independence.jpg|thumb|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'', showing the [[Committee of Five]] in charge of drafting the Declaration in 1776 as it presents its work to the [[Second Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n[[File:colonisation2.gif|thumb|center|upright=2.75|World Colonization of 1492 (Early Modern World), 1550, 1660, 1754 (Age of Enlightenment), 1822 (Industrial revolution), 1885 (European Hegemony), 1914 (World War I era), 1938 (World War II era), 1959 (Cold War era) and 1974, 2008 (Recent history).]]\nThe term ''colonialism'' is normally used with reference to discontiguous overseas empires rather than contiguous land-based empires, European or otherwise. European colonisation during the 15th to 19th centuries resulted in the spread of Christianity to [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the Americas, Australia and the [[Philippines]].\n\n=== Exploration and conquest of the Americas ===\n\n{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n[[Christopher Columbus]] came to the Americas in 1492. Subsequently, the major sea powers in Europe sent expeditions to the [[New World]] to build trade networks and colonies and to convert the native peoples to Christianity. [[Pope Alexander VI]] divided newly discovered lands outside Europe between Spain and Portugal along a north\u2013south meridian 370 leagues west of the Cape Verde islands (off the west coast of Africa). The division was never accepted by the rulers of England or France. (See also the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], which followed the papal decree.)\n\n=== Colonial Latin America ===\n{{See also|New Spain|Spanish empire|Colonial Brazil}}\n\nWhat is now called [[Latin America]], a designation first used in the late 19th century,<ref>Jos\u00e9 C. Moya, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin America''. New York: Oxford University Press 2011</ref> was claimed by Spain and Portugal. The Western Hemisphere, the [[New World]],<ref>There is no known human evolution in the Western Hemisphere so all humans came on foot or boat to the vast new area.</ref> was divided between the two Iberian powers by the Treaty of Tordesillas in what until the late 16th-century, was an area that could be called \"Ibero-America.\" Spain called its overseas empire there \"The Indies,\" with Portugal calling its territory in South America [[Brazil]], after the dyewood found there. Spain concentrated building its empire where there were large indigenous populations, \"Indians,\" who could be compelled to work and large deposits of precious metals, mainly silver. Both [[New Spain]] (colonial Mexico) and [[Peru]] fit those criteria and the Spanish crown established [[viceroyalties]] to rule those two large areas. As Spanish settlements and the economy grew in size and complexity, the Spanish established viceroyalties in the eighteenth century during [[Bourbon reforms|administrative reforms]] Rio de la Plata (southeastern South America) and New Granada (northern South America).\n\nInitially, Portuguese settlements (Brazil) in the coastal northeast were of lesser importance in the larger Portuguese overseas empire, where lucrative commerce and small settlements devoted to trade were established in coastal Africa, India and China. With sparse indigenous populations that could not be coerced to work and no known deposits of precious metals, Portugal sought a high-value, low-bulk export product and found it in [[sugarcane]].  Black African slave labour from Portugal's West African possessions was imported to do the grueling agricultural work. As the wealth of the Ibero-America increased, some Western European powers (Dutch, French, British, Danish) sought to duplicate the model in areas that the Iberians had not settled in numbers. They seized some Caribbean islands from the Spanish and transferred the model of sugar production on plantations with slave labour and settled in northern areas of North America in what are now the Eastern Seaboard of the United States and Canada.<ref>[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and [[Stuart B. Schwartz]], ''Early Latin America''. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983.</ref>\n=== Colonial North America ===\n{{See also|New Spain|New France|New Netherland|Colonial history of the United States|Canada under British rule}}\n\nNorth America outside the zone of Spanish settlement was a contested area in the 17th century. Spain had founded small settlements in Florida and Georgia but nowhere near the size of those in [[New Spain]] or the Caribbean islands. France, The Netherlands, and Great Britain held several colonies in North America and the West Indies from the 17th century, 100 years after the Spanish and Portuguese established permanent colonies. The British colonies in North America were founded between 1607 (Virginia) and 1733 (Georgia). The Dutch explored the east coast of North America and began founding settlements in what they called [[New Netherland]] (now [[New York State]].). France colonized what is now [[Eastern Canada]], founding [[Quebec City]] in 1608. France's loss in the [[Seven Years' War]] resulted in the transfer of [[New France]] to [[Great Britain]]. The [[Thirteen Colonies]], in lower British North America, rebelled against British rule in 1775, largely due to the taxation that Great Britain was imposing on the colonies. The British colonies in Canada remained loyal to the crown, and a provisional government formed by the Thirteen Colonies proclaimed their independence on July 4, 1776 and subsequently became the original 13 United States of America. With the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the [[American Revolutionary War]], Britain recognised the former Thirteen Colonies' independence.\n\n==Atlantic World==\n{{see also|Atlantic history}}\n[[File:Waldseemuller map 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Waldseem\u00fcller map]] with joint sheets, 1507]]\nA recent development in early modern history is the creation of [[Atlantic World]] as a category. The term generally encompasses western Europe, West Africa, North and South and America and the Caribbean islands. It seeks to show both local and regional development and the connections between the various geographical regions.\n\n== Religion, science, philosophy, and education ==\n{{further|History of religion|History of philosophy}}\n\n=== Eastern philosophies ===\nConcerning the [[history of Philosophy|development of Eastern philosophies]], much of [[Eastern philosophy]] had been in an advanced state of development from study in the previous centuries. The various [[philosophy|philosophies]] include [[Indian philosophy]],<ref>Of note in modern Indian philosophy are the philosophers who gave contemporary meaning to traditional philosophy, such as [[Swami Vivekananda]].</ref> [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Iranian philosophy]], [[Japanese philosophy]], and [[Korean philosophy]].\n\n=== Muslim world ===\nThe [[Islamic Golden Age]] reached its peak in the [[High Middle Ages]], stopped short by the [[Mongol invasions]] of the 13th century. The re-establishment of three major Muslim empires by the 16th century (the aforementioned [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] and [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Empires) gave rise to a Muslim cultural revival.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} The [[Safavids]] [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|established]] [[Twelver Shi'a Islam]] as Iran's official religion, thus giving [[Iran]] a separate identity from its [[Sunni]] neighbors.\n\n=== Protestant Reformation ===\n{{Main|Protestant theology}}\n\nThe early modern period was initiated by the [[Protestant Reformation]] and the collapse of the unity of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church|Western Church]].\nThe theology of [[Calvinism]] in particular has been argued as instrumental to the rise of [[capitalism]] (''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'').\n\n=== Counter-Reformation and Jesuits ===\n{{Main|Counter-Reformation}}\nThe Counter-Reformation was a period of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] revival in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]] during the mid-16th to mid-17th centuries. The Counter-Reformation was a comprehensive effort, involving ecclesiastical or structural reforms as well as a political dimension and spiritual movements.\n\nSuch reforms included the foundation of [[seminaries]] for the proper training of priests in the spiritual life and the theological traditions of the Church, the reform of religious life by returning orders to their spiritual foundations and new spiritual movements focusing on the devotional life and a personal relationship with [[Christ]], including the [[Spanish mystics]] and the [[French school of spirituality]]. It also involved political activities that included the [[Roman Inquisition]].\n\nNew religious orders were a fundamental part of this trend. Orders such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Ursulines]], [[Theatines]], [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Barnabites]], and especially the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] strengthened rural parishes, improved popular piety, helped to curb corruption within the church and set examples that would be a strong impetus for Catholic renewal.\n\n=== Scientific Revolution ===\n[[File:PeuerbachSuperioribus2.png|thumb|right|147x147px|Model for the Three Superior Planets and Venus from [[Georg von Peuerbach]], ''Theoricae novae planetarum''.]]\n\nThe [[Great Divergence]] in scientific discovery, technological innovation, and economic development began in the early modern period as the pace of change in Western countries increased significantly compared to the rest of the world.\n\nDuring the [[Scientific Revolution]] of the 16th and 17 century, [[empiricism]] and [[modern science]] replaced older methods of studying nature \u2013 European research methods that mainly involved reading texts by ancient writers. In ancient times, [[natural philosopher]]s made observations of nature and came up with explanations, but never conducted [[experiment]]s to test those explanations, because creating an artificial situation was considered an invalid way to discover the rules of nature. The [[scientific method]] of testing hypotheses was first recorded in the 10th century by [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen), inspiring [[Roger Bacon]] to begin experimenting in 13th century Europe. By the time of the Revolution, these methods resulted in accumulation of knowledge that overturned ideas inherited from Ancient Greece (primarily [[Aristotelian physics]], which includes the modern domains of physics, chemistry, biology) through the Middle Ages and Islamic scholars. Major changes of the Scientific Revolution and the 18th century included:\n* The ancient [[geocentric model]] of the solar system (the planets circle the Earth) was replaced by the [[heliocentric model]] (Earth and other planets circle the Sun). Known as the [[Copernican Revolution]], the 1543 publication of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'s ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'', which was influenced by [[Mu'ayyad al-Din al-Urdi]] and was based on detailed astronomical observations) is often used to mark the beginning of the Scientific Revolution. Heliocentrism was resisted by the Catholic Church because it contradicted the Bible; the Catholic [[Inquisition]] imprisoned [[Galileo Galilei]] (sometimes called the \"father of modern science\" for his many empirical discoveries) for promoting this theory.\n* Armed with detailed observations from [[Tycho Brahe]], [[Johannes Kepler]] found the idea that the planets moved in ellipses rather than on perfect [[celestial spheres]], publishing [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]]. The commonly held idea that the [[fixed stars]] are mounted on a large sphere was replaced by the idea that they are distant suns. [[Astrology and astronomy]] began to separate into different disciplines, with only [[astronomy]] using scientific methods. [[Telescope]] technology improved tremendously as did the [[History of optics|study of optics]].\n* [[Aristotelian_physics#Natural_motion|Aristotle's laws of motion]] were demonstrated to be incorrect, and were replaced by [[Newton's laws of motion]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]]. The 1687 publication of [[Isaac Newton]]'s 1687 ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' is often used to mark the end of the Scientific Revolution.\n* A revival of [[atomism]] (denied by Aristotle) and [[corpuscularianism]] began to undermine the [[classical elements]]. Both 8th century Islamic experimenter [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] and 17th century Christian experimenter [[Robert Boyle]] have been described as the founders of modern [[chemistry]], both worked as [[alchemist]]s before the fields were clearly separated. Boyle argued for corpuscularism in the 1661 book ''[[The Sceptical Chymist]]'', and discovered [[Boyle's Law]] of gases. [[Phlogiston theory]] was refuted by empirical discovery of [[conservation of mass]], among other discoveries bring the [[chemical revolution]]. The discovery of modern chemical elements would not begin until the 19th century in the late modern period, followed by experimental confirmation of atoms.\n* Finally overcoming the difficulties human corpses to perform dissections, the anatomical descriptions of the 2nd century [[Galen]] were updated by the 1543 publication of ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' by [[Andreas Vesalius]], considered a foundational text of [[modern medicine]] and [[History of anatomy#Early modern anatomy|early modern anatomy]]. The 1628 work ''[[De Motu Cordis]]'' by [[William Harvey]] was a major advance in the understanding of the [[circulatory system]].\n* The field of [[microbiology]] began with the invention of the [[microscope]] and the first observations of microorganisms, famously by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] in the 1670s and probably also by [[Athanasius Kircher]] in the 1640s. Though microorganisms were (correctly) proposed as the cause of infectious diseases as soon as they were discovered, this theory was generally dismissed. Though scientific investigation undermined [[humorism]] in medicine, [[miasma theory]] remained dominant throughout the early modern period. The [[germ theory of disease]] was not widely accepted until the 1880s, in the late modern period.\n* Modern scientific [[dentistry]] was founded by [[Pierre Fauchard]].\n* The [[smallpox vaccine]] was invented in the 1770s and popularized by [[Edward Jenner]] in the 1790s, though it was unclear at the time how it worked.\n* [[Carl Linnaeus]] published the first modern [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] in 1735, replacing Aristotle's [[Great Chain of Being]]. [[Binomial nomenclature]] was used in publications by [[Gaspard Bauhin]] as early as 1622, and by Linnaeus in 1753.\n* The ancient theory of [[spontaneous generation]] remained dominant throughout the early modern period, but the [[history of evolutionary thought]] includes some who questioned the strictest form of this dogma. The idea of partial [[common descent]] was famously promoted by [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]]. [[Evolution]] was not fully articulated and accepted until the 19th century.\n* Modern [[geology]] began to take shape mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries. Early on, [[Nicolas Steno]] proposed the [[law of superposition]] in 1669, and various writers in the [[history of geology]] began to question the notion derived from the Christian Bible that the Earth was only about 6,000 years old and relatively unchanged over time. Steno and [[James Hutton]] are often considered founders of the modern field. The study of [[fossil]]s and rock types became systematic.\n* Early developments in the [[history of electromagnetism]] during this era include gradual teasing out of the relationships between [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], and [[lightning]]; development of the [[electrostatic generator]] and [[Leyden jar]] for storage; and the discoveries of [[ferromagnetism]], \"electrics\" and \"non-electrics\" ([[Electrical conductor|conductors]] and [[Electrical insulator|insulators]]). The now-obsolete [[fluid theory of electricity]] was developed to explain electrical phenomena in terms of \"vitreous\" and \"resinous\" fluids (later recognized as positive and negative electrical charges). [[Electrochemistry]] was born with the discovery of [[voltaic electricity]] (which would provide a power source for later experimentation) and [[pyroelectricity]]. Around 1784, [[Coulomb's law]] mathematically described the strength of electrical attraction. The discovery that electricity could cause muscles to contracted was termed \"[[Galvanic electricity]]\".\n\nIn the new [[social sciences]]:\n* [[Historical linguistics]] emerged in the late 18th century as a field after the discovery of the common origin what are now called [[Indo-European languages]] by [[philologist]] [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]]\n* The fields of [[anthropology]] and [[paleoanthropology]] emerged in the 18th century, but much of early modern anthropology is now considered [[scientific racism]].\n* The 1776 multi-book publication ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' by [[Adam Smith]] is considered the foundational text of [[classical economics]].\n\nScientific discovery would accelerate in the late modern period, and continues today.\n\n{{See also|History of science|Science in the Age of Enlightenment}}\n\n===Technology===\n{{main|Renaissance technology}}\nInventions of the early modern period included the [[Floating dock (impounded)|floating dock]], [[lifting tower]], [[newspaper]], [[grenade musket]], [[lightning rod]], [[bifocals]], and [[Franklin stove]].

Instead, [[reason]] became the central source of knowledge, beginning the era of [[modern philosophy]], especially in [[Western philosophy]]. The period was typified in Europe by the great system-builders, philosophers who presented unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]] and often [[politics]] and the [[physical sciences]] as well.\n\nEarly 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some consider it as the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. This era includes [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]]' [[Cogito, ergo sum|\"I think therefore I am\"]] (1637). The 18th century saw the beginning of [[secularization]] in Europe, rising to notability in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1|title=Kant, Immanuel: Metaphysics \u2013 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].\n\n[[Roger Williams]] founded [[Providence Plantations]] in New England, based on the principle of [[separation of church and state]] after being exiled by [[Puritans]] in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. The Enlightenment began at Harvard in 1646.\nThe first great advances towards modern science were made in the mid-17th century, most notably the theory of [[gravity]] by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643\u20131727). Newton, Spinoza, [[John Locke]] (1632\u20131704) and [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647\u20131706) were philosophers sparking the ideas for the furthering of the Enlightenment.\n\nFrench [[French art salons and academies|salon]] culture culminated in the Enlightenment's most influential publication, the great ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' (1751\u20131772), edited by [[Denis Diderot]] (1713\u20131784) with contributions by hundreds of leading [[philosophes]] (intellectuals) such as [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) and [[Montesquieu]] (1689\u20131755). The [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]] shook up the [[French Academy]] in the 1690s, elevating new discoveries over Greek and Roman wisdom. The French Enlightenment was received in Germany, notably fostered by [[Frederick the Great]], the [[king of Prussia]], and gave rise to a flowering of [[German philosophy]], represented foremost by [[Immanuel Kant]].\n\nThe French and German developments were further influential in [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish]], [[Russian Enlightenment|Russian]], [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish]] and [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish]] philosophy.\n\nThe Enlightenment flourished until about 1790\u20131800, after which the emphasis on reason gave way to [[Romanticism]]'s emphasis on emotion and a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] gained force.\n{{further|Atheism in the Age of the Enlightenment|Philosophical skepticism}}\n\n=== Humanism ===\n{{Main|Humanism}}\n{{further|Erasmus}}\nWith the adoption of large-scale printing after 1500, Italian [[Renaissance Humanism]] spread northward to France, Germany, Holland and England, where it became associated with the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nDeveloping during the Enlightenment era, [[Renaissance humanism]] as an intellectual movement spread across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). The term ''umanista'' comes from the latter part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'', a novel curriculum that was competing with the ''[[quadrivium]]'' and [[scholastic logic]].<ref>[[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113\u2013114, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' (1990).</ref>\n\nIn France, pre-eminent Humanist [[Guillaume Bud\u00e9]] (1467\u20131540) applied the [[philology|philological]] methods of Italian Humanism to the study of antique coinage and to legal history, composing a detailed commentary on [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Justinian's Code]]. Although a royal absolutist (and not a republican like the early Italian ''umanisti''), Bud\u00e9 was active in civic life, serving as a diplomat for [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and helping to found the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France|Coll\u00e8ge des Lecteurs Royaux]] (later the Coll\u00e8ge de France).

Near the end of the early modern period were the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[American Revolution]], the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 marked the end of this period of political upheaval and frequent war, with the rise of new concepts of nationalism and reorganization of military forces. 1815 is the latest year commonly reckoned as the end of the early modern period.\n\n==== The French Revolutions ====\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]'s ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830).

[[Liberalism]] and [[Nationalism]] were popular ideas that challenged [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchies]] in the 19th century. |alt=]]\n{{Main|French Revolution}}\nToward the middle and latter stages of the Age of Revolution, the French political and social revolutions and radical change saw the French governmental structure transform. It was previously an [[absolute monarchy]] with feudal privileges for the [[aristocracy]] and Catholic clergy. It changed to forms based on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles of citizenship and inalienable rights. The first revolution led to government by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], the second by the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]], and the third by the [[French Directory|Directory]].\n\nThe changes were accompanied by violent turmoil, which included the trial and [[execution of Louis XVI]], vast bloodshed and repression during the [[Reign of Terror]], and the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that can be traced to the Revolution include the [[Napoleonic Wars]], two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed at one point or another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.\n\n== See also ==\n; Economic concepts\n:[[Price revolution]], [[Proto-globalization]]\n\n; General concepts\n:[[Renaissance]], [[Early Modern English]], [[Early Modern warfare]], [[Periodization]], [[Atlantic history]], [[Timeline of early modern history]]\n\n; Political powers\n:[[Habsburg Spain]], [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Portuguese Empire]], [[Dutch Republic]], [[Early Modern Britain]], [[Early Modern France]], [[History of Italy during foreign domination and the unification|Early Modern Italy]], [[Ming Dynasty]], [[Russian Empire]], [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Mughal Empire]], [[Safavid Empire]]\n\n*[[Cuisine in the early modern world]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* Burke, Peter.

It is loosely related to the term ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' which was later used to describe the geopolitical containment of the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1940s. The strategy of \"containment\" is best known as a [[Cold War(A war that took place in alaska because it is cold there.)]] [[foreign policy of the United States]] and its allies to prevent the spread of [[communism]] after the end of [[World War II]].\n\nAs a component of the Cold War, this\n\n</gallery>\n [[foreign policy|policy]] was a response to the Soviet Union's move to increase communist influence in [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]]. Containment represented a middle-ground position between [[detente]] (relaxation of relations) and [[rollback]] (actively replacing a regime).\nThe basis of the [[doctrine]] was articulated in a [[Long Telegram|1946 cable]] by U.S. diplomat [[George F. Kennan]] during the post-WWII term of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]]. As a description of [[U.S. foreign policy]], the word originated in a report Kennan submitted to [[U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[James Forrestal]] in 1947, which was later used in a magazine article.\n\n==Earlier uses of term==\nThere were major historical precedents familiar to Americans and Europeans. In the 1850s, anti-slavery forces in the United States developed a [[free soil]] strategy of containment to stop the expansion of slavery until it later collapsed. Historian [[James Oakes (historian)|James Oakes]] explains the strategy:\n<blockquote>The Federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Oakes|title=Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaVp-YES1F0C&pg=PR12|year=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=12|isbn=9780393065312}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBetween 1873 and 1877, Germany repeatedly intervened in the internal affairs of France's neighbors. In Belgium, Spain, and Italy, Bismarck exerted strong and sustained political pressure to support the election or appointment of liberal, anticlerical governments. This was part of an integrated strategy to promote [[republicanism]] in France by strategically and ideologically isolating the clerical-monarchist regime of President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta|Patrice de Mac-Mahon]]. It was hoped that by ringing France with a number of liberal states, French republicans could defeat MacMahon and his reactionary supporters. The modern concept of containment provides a useful model for understanding the dynamics of this policy.<ref>James Stone, \"Bismarck and the Containment of France, 1873\u20131877,\" ''Canadian Journal of History'' (1994) 29#2 pp 281\u2013304 [http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240  online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214134224/http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240 |date=2014-12-14 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in Russia, there were calls by Western leaders to isolate the Bolshevik government, which seemed intent on promoting worldwide revolution. In March 1919, French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] called for a ''cordon sanitaire'', a ring of non-communist states, to isolate the Soviet Union. Translating that phrase, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] called for a \"quarantine.\" Both phrases compare communism to a contagious disease.\n\nThe [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|World War I Allies launched an incursion into Russia]], ostensibly to create an eastern front against Germany. In reality, the policy was anti-Bolshevik as well, and its economic warfare took a major toll on all of Russia. By 1919, the intervention was entirely anti-communist, although the unpopularity of the assault led it to be gradually withdrawn. The US simultaneously engaged in covert action against the new Soviet government, involving the work of a young [[Allen Dulles]]. While the campaigns were officially pro-democracy, they often supported the [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]] of former Tsarist generals like [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|GM Semenov]] and [[Alexander Kolchak]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Carley|first=Michael J.|title=Review of Foglesong, David S., America's Secret War Against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|date=June 1996|url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=489|publisher=H-Russia, H-Review|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ppojDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=David+S.+Foglesong,+containment#v=onepage&q=David%20S.%20Foglesong,%20containment&f=false|title=America's Secret War against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|last=Foglesong|first=David S.|date=2014-02-01|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469611136}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. initially refused to recognize the Soviet Union, but President [[Franklin D.

Truman (1884 \u2013 1972)==\n\nAfter Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman, a Democrat, made a dramatic speech that is often considered to mark the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. In March 1947, he requested that Congress appropriate $400 million in aid to the Greek and Turkish governments, which were fighting Communist subversion.<ref name=\"Truman\">[[s:Truman Doctrine|President Harry S.

Portraying the issue as a mighty clash between \"totalitarian regimes\" and \"free peoples,\" the speech marks the adoption of containment as official U.S. policy. Congress appropriated the money.\n\nTruman's motives on that occasion have been the subject of considerable scholarship and several schools of interpretation. In the orthodox explanation of [[Herbert Feis]], a series of aggressive Soviet actions in 1945\u201347 in Poland, Iran, Turkey, and elsewhere awakened the American public to the new danger to freedom to which Truman responded.<ref name=\"Larson9\">Larsen, Deborah Welch, ''Origins of Containment'', p. 9.</ref> In the revisionist view of [[William Appleman Williams]], Truman's speech was an expression of longstanding American expansionism.<ref name=\"Larson9\"/> In the [[realpolitik]] view of [[Lynn E. Davis]], Truman was a naive idealist who unnecessarily provoked the Soviets by couching disputes in terms like democracy and freedom that were alien to the Communist vision.<ref name=\"Larson15\">Larson, p. 15.</ref>\n\nAccording to psychological analysis by Deborah Larson, Truman felt a need to prove his decisiveness and feared that aides would make unfavorable comparisons between him and his predecessor, Roosevelt.<ref name=\"Larson147\">Larson, p. 147.</ref> \"I am here to make decisions, and whether they prove right or wrong I am going to take them,\" he once said.<ref name=\"Larson145-46\">Larson, pp 145-46.</ref>\n\nThe drama surrounding the announcement of the Truman Doctrine catered to president's self-image of a strong and decisive leader, but his real decision-making process was more complex and gradual. The timing of the speech was not a response to any particular Soviet action but to the fact that the Republican Party had just gained control of Congress.<ref name=\"Larson302\">Larson, p. 302.</ref> Truman was little involved in drafting the speech and did not himself adopt the hard-line attitude that it suggested until several months later.<ref name=\"LarsonXI\">Larson, p. xi., p. 303</ref>\n\nThe British, with their own position weakened by economic distress, urgently called on the U.S. to take over the traditional British role in Greece.<ref>Lawrence S.

He won wide support from both parties as well as experts in foreign policy inside and outside the government. It was strongly opposed by the Left, notably by former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]], who ran against Truman in the 1948 presidential campaign.<ref>John M. Schuessler, \"Absorbing The First Blow: Truman And The Cold War,\" ''White House Studies'' (2009) 9#3 pp 215-231.</ref>\n\nTruman, under the guidance of Acheson, followed up his speech with a series of measures to contain Soviet influence in Europe, including the [[Marshall Plan]], or European Recovery Program, and [[NATO]], a 1949 military alliance between the U.S. and Western European nations. Because containment required detailed information about Communist moves, the government relied increasingly on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Established by the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA conducted espionage in foreign lands, some of it visible, more of it secret. Truman approved a classified statement of containment policy called NSC 20/4 in November 1948, the first comprehensive statement of security policy ever created by the United States. The Soviet Union's first nuclear test in 1949 prompted the National Security Council to formulate a revised security doctrine. Completed in April 1950, it became known as [[NSC 68]].<ref>Efstathios T. Fakiolas, \"Kennan's Long Telegram and NSC-68: A Comparative Theoretical Analysis,\" ''East European Quarterly'' (1997) 31#4 pp 415-433.</ref>  It concluded that a massive military buildup was necessary to deal with the Soviet threat. According to the report, drafted by [[Paul Nitze]] and others:\n\n{{quote|In the words of the Federalist (No. 28) \"The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief.\" The mischief may be a global war or it may be a Soviet campaign for limited objectives. In either case we should take no avoidable initiative which would cause it to become a war of annihilation, and if we have the forces to defeat a Soviet drive for limited objectives it may well be to our interest not to let it become a global war.<ref name=\"Nitze\">''[https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68-4.htm NSC 68: United States Objectives and Programs for National Security]''</ref>}}\n\n==Alternative strategies==\nThere were three alternative policies to containment under discussion in the late 1940s. The first was a return to [[isolationism]], minimizing American involvement with the rest of the world, a policy that was supported by conservative Republicans, especially from the [[Midwest]], including former President [[Herbert Hoover]] and Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. However, many other Republicans, led by Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]], said that policy had helped cause World War II and so was too dangerous to revive.<ref>{{cite book|author=David McCullough|title=Truman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fp1A2s6aQwC&pg=PA631|year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=631|author-link=David McCullough|isbn=9780743260299}}</ref>\n\nThe second policy was continuation of the [[d\u00e9tente]] policies that aimed at friendly relationships with the Soviet Union, especially trade. Roosevelt had been the champion of d\u00e9tente, but he was dead, and most of his inner circle had left the government by 1946. The chief proponent of d\u00e9tente was Henry  Wallace, a former vice president and the [[Secretary of Commerce]] under Truman. Wallace's position was supported by far left elements of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]], but they were purged in 1947 and 1948. Wallace ran against Truman on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1948, but his campaign was increasingly dominated by Communists, which helped to discredit d\u00e9tente.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jerel A.

Military rollback against the Soviet Union was proposed by [[James Burnham]]<ref>Daniel Kelly, ''James Burnham and the Struggle for the World: A Life'' (2002) p. 155</ref> and other conservative strategists in the late 1940s. After 1954, Burnham and like-minded strategists became editors and regular contributors to [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]'s ''[[National Review]]'' magazine.\n\nTruman himself adopted a rollback strategy in the [[Korean War]] after the success of the [[Inchon]] landings in September 1950, only to reverse himself after the Chinese [[counterattack]] two months later and revert to containment. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called on Congress to continue the rollback policy, but Truman fired him for insubordination.<ref>James I.

Initially, this directed the action of the US to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Korea's sovereignty, thereby allowing North Korea's survival as a state. However, the success of the [[Inchon landing]] inspired the U.S. and the [[United Nations]] to adopt a [[rollback]] strategy instead and to overthrow communist North Korea, thus allowing nationwide elections under U.N. auspices.<ref>James I.

The Communists were later pushed back to roughly around the original border, with minimal changes. Truman criticized MacArthur's focus on absolute victory and adopted a \"[[limited war]]\" policy. His focus shifted to negotiating a settlement, which was finally reached in 1953.

There was fear of a [[nuclear war]] until a deal was reached in which the Soviets would publicly remove their nuclear weapons, the United States would secretly remove its missiles from Turkey and to avoid invading Cuba. The policy of containing Cuba was put into effect by President [[John F. Kennedy]] and continued until 2015.<ref>Alice L. George, ''The Cuban missile crisis: The threshold of nuclear war'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==Vietnam==\nSenator [[Barry Goldwater]], the Republican candidate for president in 1964, challenged containment and asked, \"Why not victory?\"<ref>[[Richard J. Jensen]], Jon Thares Davidann, Yoneyuki Sugita, ''Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century'', p. 178. (2003)</ref> President [[Lyndon Johnson]], the Democratic nominee, answered that rollback risked nuclear war.

The quote is from [[Book of Job|Job]] 38:11.</ref> Goldwater lost to Johnson in the 1964 election by a wide margin. Johnson adhered closely to containment during the [[Vietnam War]]. Rejecting proposals by General [[William Westmoreland]] for U.S. ground forces to advance into Laos and cut communist supply lines, Johnson gathered a group of elder statesmen called [[The Wise Men (book)|The Wise Men]]. The group included Kennan, Acheson and other former Truman advisors.\n\nRallies in support of the troops were discouraged for fear that a patriotic response would lead to demands for victory and rollback.<ref name=\"Jensen1\"/> Military responsibility was divided among three generals so that no powerful theater commander could emerge to challenge Johnson as MacArthur had challenged Truman.<ref>Jensen, p. 182.</ref>\n\nNixon, who replaced Johnson in 1969, referred to his foreign policy as d\u00e9tente, a relaxation of tension. Although it continued to aim at restraining the Soviet Union, it was based on political realism, thinking in terms of national interest, as opposed to crusades against communism or for democracy. Emphasis was placed on talks with the Soviet Union concerning nuclear weapons called the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]]. Nixon reduced U.S. military presence in Vietnam to the minimum required to contain communist advances, in a policy called [[Vietnamization]]. As the war continued, it grew less popular. A Democratic Congress forced Nixon, a Republican, to abandon the policy in 1973 by enacting the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], which ended U.S. military involvement in Vietnam and led to successful communist invasions of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nPresident [[Jimmy Carter]] came to office in 1977 and was committed to a foreign policy that emphasized [[human right]]s. However, in response to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]], containment was again made a priority. The wording of the [[Carter Doctrine]] (1980) intentionally echoed that of the Truman Doctrine.\n\n==Reagan Doctrine==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--2 paragraphs without citations-->\nFollowing the communist victory of Vietnam, Democrats began to view further communist advance as inevitable, but Republicans returned to the rollback doctrine. [[Ronald Reagan]], a long-time advocate of rollback, was elected US President in 1980. He took a more aggressive approach to dealings with the Soviets and believed that d\u00e9tente was misguided and [[peaceful coexistence]] was tantamount to surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded [[Afghanistan]] in 1979, American policy makers worried that the Soviets were making a run for control of the Persian Gulf. Throughout the 1980s, under a policy that came to be known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the United States provided technical and economic assistance to the Afghan guerrillas fighting against the Soviet army ([[Mujahideen]]).<ref>Olson, James Stuart. Historical dictionary of the 1950s. Westport, Conn: Greenwood P, 2000.</ref>\n\nBy sending military aid to anti-communist insurgents in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, and Nicaragua, Reagan confronted existing communist governments and went beyond the limits of containment doctrine. He deployed the [[Pershing II]] missile in Europe and promoted research on a [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], called \"Star Wars\" by its critics, to shoot down missiles fired at the United States.\n\nReagan's aim was to defeat the Soviets through an expensive arms buildup the Soviets could not match. However, Reagan continued to follow containment in several key areas. He pursued a comprehensive nuclear disarmament initiative called [[START I]] and policy toward Europe continued to emphasize a NATO-based defensive approach.\n\n==After Cold War==\nThe [[history of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|end of the Cold War]] in 1991 marked the official end of the containment policy, but the U.S. kept its bases in the areas around Russia, such as those in Iceland, Germany, and Turkey. Also, much of the policy helped influence U.S. foreign policy in later years, such as during the [[War on Terror]] and dealing with post-Cold War dictators, such as [[Iraq]]'s [[Saddam Hussein]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appeasement]]\n* [[Domino theory]]\n* [[D\u00e9tente]]\n* [[Marshall Plan]]\n* [[Rollback]]\n* [[Truman Doctrine]]\n* [[Dual containment]] (Iran-Iraq containment)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box}}\n\n* Corke, Sarah-Jane. \"History, historians and the Naming of Foreign Policy: A Postmodern Reflection on American Strategic thinking during the Truman Administration,\" ''Intelligence and National Security,'' Autumn 2001, Vol. 16 Issue 3, pp.&nbsp;146\u201363.\n* Felix, David.

It is loosely related to the term ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' which was later used to describe the geopolitical containment of the [[Soviet Union]] in the 1940s. The strategy of \"containment\" is best known as a [[Cold War]] [[foreign policy of the United States]] and its allies to prevent the spread of [[communism]] after the end of [[World War II]].\n\nAs a component of the Cold War, this [[foreign policy|policy]] was a response to the Soviet Union's move to increase communist influence in [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Latin America]]. Containment represented a middle-ground position between [[detente]] (relaxation of relations) and [[rollback]] (actively replacing a regime).\nThe basis of the [[doctrine]] was articulated in a [[Long Telegram|1946 cable]] by U.S. diplomat [[George F. Kennan]] during the post-WWII term of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Harry S. Truman]]. As a description of [[U.S. foreign policy]], the word originated in a report Kennan submitted to [[U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[James Forrestal]] in 1947, which was later used in a magazine article.\n\n==Earlier uses of term==\nThere were major historical precedents familiar to Americans and Europeans. In the 1850s, anti-slavery forces in the United States developed a [[free soil]] strategy of containment to stop the expansion of slavery until it later collapsed. Historian [[James Oakes (historian)|James Oakes]] explains the strategy:\n<blockquote>The Federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Oakes|title=Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861-1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaVp-YES1F0C&pg=PR12|year=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=12|isbn=9780393065312}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBetween 1873 and 1877, Germany repeatedly intervened in the internal affairs of France's neighbors. In Belgium, Spain, and Italy, Bismarck exerted strong and sustained political pressure to support the election or appointment of liberal, anticlerical governments. This was part of an integrated strategy to promote [[republicanism]] in France by strategically and ideologically isolating the clerical-monarchist regime of President [[Patrice de Mac-Mahon, Duke of Magenta|Patrice de Mac-Mahon]]. It was hoped that by ringing France with a number of liberal states, French republicans could defeat MacMahon and his reactionary supporters. The modern concept of containment provides a useful model for understanding the dynamics of this policy.<ref>James Stone, \"Bismarck and the Containment of France, 1873\u20131877,\" ''Canadian Journal of History'' (1994) 29#2 pp 281\u2013304 [http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240  online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214134224/http://utpjournalsreview.com/index.php/CJOH/article/download/10365/9240 |date=2014-12-14 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1917 [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in Russia, there were calls by Western leaders to isolate the Bolshevik government, which seemed intent on promoting worldwide revolution. In March 1919, French Premier [[Georges Clemenceau]] called for a ''cordon sanitaire'', a ring of non-communist states, to isolate the Soviet Union. Translating that phrase, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] called for a \"quarantine.\" Both phrases compare communism to a contagious disease.\n\nThe [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|World War I Allies launched an incursion into Russia]], ostensibly to create an eastern front against Germany. In reality, the policy was anti-Bolshevik as well, and its economic warfare took a major toll on all of Russia. By 1919, the intervention was entirely anti-communist, although the unpopularity of the assault led it to be gradually withdrawn. The US simultaneously engaged in covert action against the new Soviet government, involving the work of a young [[Allen Dulles]]. While the campaigns were officially pro-democracy, they often supported the [[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]] of former Tsarist generals like [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|GM Semenov]] and [[Alexander Kolchak]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Carley|first=Michael J.|title=Review of Foglesong, David S., America's Secret War Against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|date=June 1996|url=https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=489|publisher=H-Russia, H-Review|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ppojDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=David+S.+Foglesong,+containment#v=onepage&q=David%20S.%20Foglesong,%20containment&f=false|title=America's Secret War against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|last=Foglesong|first=David S.|date=2014-02-01|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469611136}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. initially refused to recognize the Soviet Union, but President [[Franklin D.

Kennan, ''Memoirs 1925-1950'' P. 359</ref>\n\n==Harry S. Truman (1884 \u2013 1972)==\n\nAfter Republicans gained control of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman, a Democrat, made a dramatic speech that is often considered to mark the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. In March 1947, he requested that Congress appropriate $400 million in aid to the Greek and Turkish governments, which were fighting Communist subversion.<ref name=\"Truman\">[[s:Truman Doctrine|President Harry S. Truman's Address Before a Joint Session of Congress]], March 12, 1947.</ref> Truman pledged to, \"support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.\"<ref name=\"Truman\"/> This pledge became known as the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Portraying the issue as a mighty clash between \"totalitarian regimes\" and \"free peoples,\" the speech marks the adoption of containment as official U.S. policy. Congress appropriated the money.\n\nTruman's motives on that occasion have been the subject of considerable scholarship and several schools of interpretation. In the orthodox explanation of [[Herbert Feis]], a series of aggressive Soviet actions in 1945\u201347 in Poland, Iran, Turkey, and elsewhere awakened the American public to the new danger to freedom to which Truman responded.<ref name=\"Larson9\">Larsen, Deborah Welch, ''Origins of Containment'', p. 9.</ref> In the revisionist view of [[William Appleman Williams]], Truman's speech was an expression of longstanding American expansionism.<ref name=\"Larson9\"/> In the [[realpolitik]] view of [[Lynn E. Davis]], Truman was a naive idealist who unnecessarily provoked the Soviets by couching disputes in terms like democracy and freedom that were alien to the Communist vision.<ref name=\"Larson15\">Larson, p. 15.</ref>\n\nAccording to psychological analysis by Deborah Larson, Truman felt a need to prove his decisiveness and feared that aides would make unfavorable comparisons between him and his predecessor, Roosevelt.<ref name=\"Larson147\">Larson, p. 147.</ref> \"I am here to make decisions, and whether they prove right or wrong I am going to take them,\" he once said.<ref name=\"Larson145-46\">Larson, pp 145-46.</ref>\n\nThe drama surrounding the announcement of the Truman Doctrine catered to president's self-image of a strong and decisive leader, but his real decision-making process was more complex and gradual. The timing of the speech was not a response to any particular Soviet action but to the fact that the Republican Party had just gained control of Congress.<ref name=\"Larson302\">Larson, p. 302.</ref> Truman was little involved in drafting the speech and did not himself adopt the hard-line attitude that it suggested until several months later.<ref name=\"LarsonXI\">Larson, p. xi., p. 303</ref>\n\nThe British, with their own position weakened by economic distress, urgently called on the U.S. to take over the traditional British role in Greece.<ref>Lawrence S. Wittner, ''American Intervention in Greece, 1943-1949'' (1982)</ref> Undersecretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] took the lead in Washington, warning congressional leaders in late February 1947 that if the United States did not take over from the British, the result most probably would be a \"Soviet breakthrough\" that \"might open three continents to Soviet penetration.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Dean Acheson|title=Present at the creation: my years in the State Department|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OirSz3Wtaa0C&pg=PA219|year=1987|publisher=W W Norton|page=219|isbn=9780393304121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=James Chace|authorlink=James Chace|title=Acheson: The Secretary Of State Who Created The American World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Jf32GR7t3IC&pg=PA166|year=2008|publisher=Simon & Schuster|pages=166\u201367|isbn=9780684864822}}</ref> Truman was explicit about the challenge of Communism taking control of Greece. He won wide support from both parties as well as experts in foreign policy inside and outside the government. It was strongly opposed by the Left, notably by former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]], who ran against Truman in the 1948 presidential campaign.<ref>John M. Schuessler, \"Absorbing The First Blow: Truman And The Cold War,\" ''White House Studies'' (2009) 9#3 pp 215-231.</ref>\n\nTruman, under the guidance of Acheson, followed up his speech with a series of measures to contain Soviet influence in Europe, including the [[Marshall Plan]], or European Recovery Program, and [[NATO]], a 1949 military alliance between the U.S. and Western European nations. Because containment required detailed information about Communist moves, the government relied increasingly on the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Established by the National Security Act of 1947, the CIA conducted espionage in foreign lands, some of it visible, more of it secret. Truman approved a classified statement of containment policy called NSC 20/4 in November 1948, the first comprehensive statement of security policy ever created by the United States. The Soviet Union's first nuclear test in 1949 prompted the National Security Council to formulate a revised security doctrine. Completed in April 1950, it became known as [[NSC 68]].<ref>Efstathios T. Fakiolas, \"Kennan's Long Telegram and NSC-68: A Comparative Theoretical Analysis,\" ''East European Quarterly'' (1997) 31#4 pp 415-433.</ref>  It concluded that a massive military buildup was necessary to deal with the Soviet threat. According to the report, drafted by [[Paul Nitze]] and others:\n\n{{quote|In the words of the Federalist (No. 28) \"The means to be employed must be proportioned to the extent of the mischief.\" The mischief may be a global war or it may be a Soviet campaign for limited objectives. In either case we should take no avoidable initiative which would cause it to become a war of annihilation, and if we have the forces to defeat a Soviet drive for limited objectives it may well be to our interest not to let it become a global war.<ref name=\"Nitze\">''[https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/nsc-hst/nsc-68-4.htm NSC 68: United States Objectives and Programs for National Security]''</ref>}}\n\n==Alternative strategies==\nThere were three alternative policies to containment under discussion in the late 1940s. The first was a return to [[isolationism]], minimizing American involvement with the rest of the world, a policy that was supported by conservative Republicans, especially from the [[Midwest]], including former President [[Herbert Hoover]] and Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. However, many other Republicans, led by Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]], said that policy had helped cause World War II and so was too dangerous to revive.<ref>{{cite book|author=David McCullough|title=Truman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8fp1A2s6aQwC&pg=PA631|year=2003|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=631|author-link=David McCullough|isbn=9780743260299}}</ref>\n\nThe second policy was continuation of the [[d\u00e9tente]] policies that aimed at friendly relationships with the Soviet Union, especially trade. Roosevelt had been the champion of d\u00e9tente, but he was dead, and most of his inner circle had left the government by 1946. The chief proponent of d\u00e9tente was Henry  Wallace, a former vice president and the [[Secretary of Commerce]] under Truman. Wallace's position was supported by far left elements of the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]], but they were purged in 1947 and 1948. Wallace ran against Truman on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket in 1948, but his campaign was increasingly dominated by Communists, which helped to discredit d\u00e9tente.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jerel A.

Military rollback against the Soviet Union was proposed by [[James Burnham]]<ref>Daniel Kelly, ''James Burnham and the Struggle for the World: A Life'' (2002) p. 155</ref> and other conservative strategists in the late 1940s. After 1954, Burnham and like-minded strategists became editors and regular contributors to [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]'s ''[[National Review]]'' magazine.\n\nTruman himself adopted a rollback strategy in the [[Korean War]] after the success of the [[Inchon]] landings in September 1950, only to reverse himself after the Chinese [[counterattack]] two months later and revert to containment. General [[Douglas MacArthur]] called on Congress to continue the rollback policy, but Truman fired him for insubordination.<ref>James I.

Initially, this directed the action of the US to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Korea's sovereignty, thereby allowing North Korea's survival as a state. However, the success of the [[Inchon landing]] inspired the U.S. and the [[United Nations]] to adopt a [[rollback]] strategy instead and to overthrow communist North Korea, thus allowing nationwide elections under U.N. auspices.<ref>James I.

The Chinese, fearful of a possible US presence on their border or even an invasion by them, then sent in a large army and defeated the U.N. forces, pushing them back below the 38th parallel.

The Communists were later pushed back to roughly around the original border, with minimal changes. Truman criticized MacArthur's focus on absolute victory and adopted a \"[[limited war]]\" policy. His focus shifted to negotiating a settlement, which was finally reached in 1953. For his part, MacArthur denounced Truman's \"no-win policy.\"<ref>[[Safire, William]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jK-0NPoMiYoC Safire's Political Dictionary]'', p. 531.</ref>\n\n==Dulles==\n\nMany Republicans, including [[John Foster Dulles]], were concerned that Truman had been too timid. In 1952, Dulles called for rollback and the eventual liberation of Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"StateDept\">\"[https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/cwr/17601.htm Kennan and Containment, 1947]\", ''Diplomacy in Action,'' U.S. Department of State,</ref> Dulles was named secretary of state by incoming President Eisenhower, but Eisenhower's decision not to intervene during the 1956 Hungarian Uprising made containment a bipartisan doctrine. Eisenhower relied on clandestine CIA actions to undermine hostile governments and used economic and military foreign aid to strengthen governments supporting the American position in the Cold War.<ref>John Prados, ''Safe for Democracy: The Secret Wars of the CIA,''  (2009)</ref>\n\n==Cuba==\nIn the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962, the top officials in Washington debated using rollback to get rid of Soviet nuclear missiles, which were threatening the United States. There was fear of a [[nuclear war]] until a deal was reached in which the Soviets would publicly remove their nuclear weapons, the United States would secretly remove its missiles from Turkey and to avoid invading Cuba. The policy of containing Cuba was put into effect by President [[John F. Kennedy]] and continued until 2015.<ref>Alice L. George, ''The Cuban missile crisis: The threshold of nuclear war'' (Routledge, 2013).</ref>\n\n==Vietnam==\nSenator [[Barry Goldwater]], the Republican candidate for president in 1964, challenged containment and asked, \"Why not victory?\"<ref>[[Richard J. Jensen]], Jon Thares Davidann, Yoneyuki Sugita, ''Trans-Pacific Relations: America, Europe, and Asia in the Twentieth Century'', p. 178. (2003)</ref> President [[Lyndon Johnson]], the Democratic nominee, answered that rollback risked nuclear war. Johnson explained containment doctrine by quoting the Bible: \"Hitherto shalt thou come, but not further.\"<ref name=\"Jensen1\">Jensen, p. 180. The quote is from [[Book of Job|Job]] 38:11.</ref> Goldwater lost to Johnson in the 1964 election by a wide margin. Johnson adhered closely to containment during the [[Vietnam War]]. Rejecting proposals by General [[William Westmoreland]] for U.S. ground forces to advance into Laos and cut communist supply lines, Johnson gathered a group of elder statesmen called [[The Wise Men (book)|The Wise Men]]. The group included Kennan, Acheson and other former Truman advisors.\n\nRallies in support of the troops were discouraged for fear that a patriotic response would lead to demands for victory and rollback.<ref name=\"Jensen1\"/> Military responsibility was divided among three generals so that no powerful theater commander could emerge to challenge Johnson as MacArthur had challenged Truman.<ref>Jensen, p. 182.</ref>\n\nNixon, who replaced Johnson in 1969, referred to his foreign policy as d\u00e9tente, a relaxation of tension. Although it continued to aim at restraining the Soviet Union, it was based on political realism, thinking in terms of national interest, as opposed to crusades against communism or for democracy. Emphasis was placed on talks with the Soviet Union concerning nuclear weapons called the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]]. Nixon reduced U.S. military presence in Vietnam to the minimum required to contain communist advances, in a policy called [[Vietnamization]]. As the war continued, it grew less popular. A Democratic Congress forced Nixon, a Republican, to abandon the policy in 1973 by enacting the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], which ended U.S. military involvement in Vietnam and led to successful communist invasions of South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nPresident [[Jimmy Carter]] came to office in 1977 and was committed to a foreign policy that emphasized [[human right]]s. However, in response to the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion]] of [[Afghanistan]], containment was again made a priority. The wording of the [[Carter Doctrine]] (1980) intentionally echoed that of the Truman Doctrine.\n\n==Reagan Doctrine==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2017}}<!--2 paragraphs without citations-->\nFollowing the communist victory of Vietnam, Democrats began to view further communist advance as inevitable, but Republicans returned to the rollback doctrine. [[Ronald Reagan]], a long-time advocate of rollback, was elected US President in 1980. He took a more aggressive approach to dealings with the Soviets and believed that d\u00e9tente was misguided and [[peaceful coexistence]] was tantamount to surrender. When the Soviet Union invaded [[Afghanistan]] in 1979, American policy makers worried that the Soviets were making a run for control of the Persian Gulf. Throughout the 1980s, under a policy that came to be known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], the United States provided technical and economic assistance to the Afghan guerrillas fighting against the Soviet army ([[Mujahideen]]).<ref>Olson, James Stuart. Historical dictionary of the 1950s. Westport, Conn: Greenwood P, 2000.</ref>\n\nBy sending military aid to anti-communist insurgents in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, and Nicaragua, Reagan confronted existing communist governments and went beyond the limits of containment doctrine. He deployed the [[Pershing II]] missile in Europe and promoted research on a [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], called \"Star Wars\" by its critics, to shoot down missiles fired at the United States.\n\nReagan's aim was to defeat the Soviets through an expensive arms buildup the Soviets could not match. However, Reagan continued to follow containment in several key areas. He pursued a comprehensive nuclear disarmament initiative called [[START I]] and policy toward Europe continued to emphasize a NATO-based defensive approach.\n\n==After Cold War==\nThe [[history of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|end of the Cold War]] in 1991 marked the official end of the containment policy, but the U.S. kept its bases in the areas around Russia, such as those in Iceland, Germany, and Turkey. Also, much of the policy helped influence U.S. foreign policy in later years, such as during the [[War on Terror]] and dealing with post-Cold War dictators, such as [[Iraq]]'s [[Saddam Hussein]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appeasement]]\n* [[Domino theory]]\n* [[D\u00e9tente]]\n* [[Marshall Plan]]\n* [[Rollback]]\n* [[Truman Doctrine]]\n* [[Dual containment]] (Iran-Iraq containment)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Library resources box}}\n\n* Corke, Sarah-Jane. \"History, historians and the Naming of Foreign Policy: A Postmodern Reflection on American Strategic thinking during the Truman Administration,\" ''Intelligence and National Security,'' Autumn 2001, Vol. 16 Issue 3, pp.&nbsp;146\u201363.\n* Felix, David.

It is a major anniversary celebrated by not only the Sinhalese people but by most [[Sri Lankan people|Sri Lankans]]. The timing of the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] New Year coincides with the new year celebrations of many traditional calendars of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The festival has close semblance to the [[Puthandu|Tamil New year]] and other [[South and Southeast Asian New Year]]s. It is a public holiday in Sri Lanka. It is generally celebrated on 13 April or 14 April and traditionally begins at the sighting of the [[new moon]].<ref>http://www.worktheworld.com.au/blog/new-years-festival-sri-lanka</ref><ref>http://www.island.lk/2004/04/13/featur03.html</ref>\n\nAccording to Sinhalese astrology, New Year begins when the sun moves from [[Pisces (astrology)|Meena Rashiya]] (the house of Pisces) to [[Aries (astrology)|Mesha Rashiya]] (the house of Aries). It also marks the end of the harvest season and of spring.\n\n==History==\nCultural anthropological history of the 'Traditional New Year' which is celebrated in the month of April, goes back to an ancient period in Sri Lankan history. People think that the celebration of new year is the change of thoughts too. Various beliefs, perhaps those associated with fertility of the harvest, gave birth to many rituals, customs, and ceremonies connected with the New Year. The advent of [[Buddhism]] in the 3rd century BC led to a re-interpretation of the existing New Year activities in the Buddhism light{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The majority of the people in the country are Buddhists, and as such, the Buddhistic outlook was predominant in transforming the New Year rites to what they are now.\n\n[[Hinduism]], on the other hand, existed side by side with Buddhism, in medieval times. New Year practices interpreted in the Hinduism way developed among the Hindus{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reference source for this legend|date=April 2011}}. Buddhism and Hinduism were historically connected with each other. Their philosophies were running along parallel dimensions, except for certain ultimate truths concerning the self, the way to achieve emancipation and the nature of a creative god (which Buddhism denies) and nirvana . There was no serious contradiction in New Year rituals that are found among the Buddhists and Hindus.\n\nThe mythological backdrop of the New Year is probably based on Hindu literature.

Also unlike 31st night celebrations, where old year ends at midnight and new year begins immediately afterwards; the ending of the ''old year'', and the beginning of the ''new year'' occur several hours apart from one another (this span of time is usually 12 hours and 48 minutes, which starts when the sun, as a disk, starts to cross the astrological boundary between 'House of Pisces' and 'House of Aries' and ends when the crossing is complete. The halfway point is considered as the dawn of the new year). This period is, referred to as the ''Nonagathe'' (or the 'neutral period' or 'Auspicious Time' ). During this time Sri Lankans are, according to tradition, encouraged to refrain from material pursuits, and engage solely in either religious activities or traditional games.\n\nCultural rituals begin shortly after the beginning of the Sinhalese New Year, with the cleaning of the house and lighting of an oil lamp. In some communities, women congregate to play upon the [[Raban]] (a type of a drum) to announce the incipient change in the year. Families carry out a variety of rituals, the exact timings of which are determined by [[astrology|astrological]] calculations - from lighting the fire to making the ''[[Kiribath]]'' (milk rice) to entering into the first business transaction and eating the first morsels. The rituals vary slightly based on the locale. However the core of the celebrations remains the same.\nThe approach of the each auspicious time for various rituals is heralded by the unmistakable sign of very loud firecrackers. Although loud firecrackers are an environmental concern, and a safety hazard, especially for children, this remains an integral part of the celebrations throughout Sri Lanka. \n\nOnce the important rituals are done, the partying begins as families mingle in the streets, homes are thrown open and children are let out to play. The ubiquitous plantain is dished out alongside celebratory feasts of [[Kavum]] (small oil cake) and [[Kokis]] (crisp and light sweetmeat, originally from the Netherlands). However, the extent of outdoor activities depends largely on the neighborhood. The suburban communities tend to have such social gatherings than urban or city dwellers.

This bird is known as the ''Koha (\u0d9a\u0ddc\u0dc4\u0dcf)'' in Sri Lanka by the [[Sinhala language]].

It is a major anniversary celebrated by not only the Sinhalese people but by most [[Sri Lankan people|Sri Lankans]]. The timing of the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] New Year coincides with the new year celebrations of many traditional calendars of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The festival has close semblance to the [[Puthandu|Tamil New year]] and other [[South and Southeast Asian New Year]]s. It is a public holiday in Sri Lanka. It is generally celebrated on 13 April or 14 April and traditionally begins at the sighting of the [[new moon]].<ref>http://www.worktheworld.com.au/blog/new-years-festival-sri-lanka</ref><ref>http://www.island.lk/2004/04/13/featur03.html</ref>\n\nAccording to Sinhalese astrology, New Year begins when the sun moves from [[Pisces (astrology)|Meena Rashiya]] (the house of Pisces) to [[Aries (astrology)|Mesha Rashiya]] (the house of Aries). It also marks the end of the harvest season and of spring.\n\n==History==\nCultural anthropological history of the 'Traditional New Year' which is celebrated in the month of April, goes back to an ancient period in Sri Lankan history. People think that the celebration of new year is the change of thoughts too. Various beliefs, perhaps those associated with fertility of the harvest, gave birth to many rituals, customs, and ceremonies connected with the New Year. The advent of [[Buddhism]] in the 3rd century BC led to a re-interpretation of the existing New Year activities in the Buddhism light{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. The majority of the people in the country are Buddhists, and as such, the Buddhistic outlook was predominant in transforming the New Year rites to what they are now.\n\n[[Hinduism]], on the other hand, existed side by side with Buddhism, in medieval times. New Year practices interpreted in the Hinduism way developed among the Hindus{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reference source for this legend|date=April 2011}}. Buddhism and Hinduism were historically connected with each other. Their philosophies were running along parallel dimensions, except for certain ultimate truths concerning the self, the way to achieve emancipation and the nature of a creative god (which Buddhism denies) and nirvana . There was no serious contradiction in New Year rituals that are found among the Buddhists and Hindus.\n\nThe mythological backdrop of the New Year is probably based on Hindu literature. The Prince of Peace called ''Indradeva'' descends upon the earth to ensure peace and happiness. He comes in a white carriage wearing on his head a white floral crown seven [[cubits]] high. He first dips, like a returning space capsule plunges, breaking earth's gravity, into a `Kiri Sayura' or sea of milk.{{Citation needed|reason=please give a reference source for this legend|date=April 2009}}\n\nModern day activities related to the celebration of the traditional New Year is based on auspicious times given by the [[astrology|astrologers]].
