It borders [[Semiahmoo Bay]] to the south and is surrounded on three sides by [[South Surrey]]. To the southeast across a footbridge lies the [[Semiahmoo First Nation]], which is within the borders of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]. Semiahmoo Bay and the Southern [[Gulf Islands]] in the [[Strait of Georgia]] are also to the south.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:White Rock pier - summer 2010.jpg|left|thumb|White Rock pier in summer]]\nThe boundaries between White Rock and Surrey are Bergstrom Road (136 Street) to the west, North Bluff Road (16th Avenue) to the north, Stayte Road (160 Street) to the east, and 8th Avenue to the south. The area south of 8 Avenue from Stayte Road westward to where 8 Avenue meets the water is the [[Semiahmoo Indian Reserve]] and lies within the bounds of the City of Surrey (though it is governed separately). The Surrey neighbourhoods of [[Ocean Park (Surrey)|Ocean Park]] and [[Crescent Beach (Surrey)|Crescent Beach]] lie immediately to the northwest.\n\nWhite Rock has a moderate climate, with average daily high temperatures of 23 degrees [[Celsius]] in summer and 6 degrees Celsius in winter.<ref>[http://www.city.whiterock.bc.ca/2005Misc/About-White-Rock.html City Of White Rock Website]</ref>\n\nWhite Rock is named for a distinctive large white boulder on its beach near the promenade, a [[glacial erratic]] that migrated south during the last glaciation. The 486-ton granite boulder was kept white by shellfish-eating seabirds whose [[guano]] covered the rock, so much so that 19th-century sailors used it as a beacon. However, it is now kept white through monthly applications of white paint by the city parks department, and has been a popular [[graffiti]] target for over thirty years.\n\n[[White Rock Pier|The pier]] and promenade are popular destinations, but do not allow dogs, bicycles or skateboards. A trial run of allowing dogs on the promenade will begin in late 2019. These areas are very busy during the warmer summer months, especially when it comes to line-ups for gelato or fish and chips.\n\nThe current Mayor, Darryl Walker, was elected on October 20, 2018 <ref>{{Cite web|title=Mayor and Council|url=http://www.whiterockcity.ca/736/Mayor-and-Council}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Legends===\n[[Image:thewhitreock.jpg|thumb|right|White Rock's namesake]]\n[[Image:Thewhiterock-mtbaker.jpg|thumb|right|White Rock's namesake as seen from the pier, with [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s [[Mount Baker]] in the distant background]]\nThe large, white rock is mentioned in the legends of the local [[Coast Salish peoples]]. One legend says that the white rock marks the landing spot of a stone that was hurled across the [[Strait of Georgia]] by a young chief.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.whiterock.museum.bc.ca/legend/index.html |title=White Rock Museum and Archives |access-date=2008-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606001205/http://www.whiterock.museum.bc.ca/legend/index.html |archive-date=2008-06-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was said that he and his bride would move from Vancouver Island to wherever the rock landed to make a home together.<ref name = Akrigg>{{Citation | last =Akrigg | first =G.P.V. | last2 =Akrigg | first2 =Helen B. | title =British Columbia Place Names | place =Vancouver | publisher =UBC Press | year =1986 | edition =3rd, 1997 | isbn =0-7748-0636-2 | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/britishcolumbiap0000akri_w1q9 }}</ref>{{rp|294}}\n\n===Early history===\n[[File:Clock and lookout at White Rock.JPG|thumb|right|Clock and lookout platform, which have since been revamped in 2018/19]]\nThe Straits Salish people dominated the region from [[Boundary Bay]] in the north to Birch Bay in the south (in the U.S.). [[Semiahmoo First Nation]] permanent encampments were known to exist between 1791, the first European contact, and the 1850s, the beginnings of European settlement. These were located along the waterfront at the eastern and western limits of the present City of White Rock. The Semiahmoo people also constructed forts as lookouts for raiders from the northern first nations; one is located in the Ocean Park area.\n\nThe [[Oregon boundary dispute]] culminated in the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846, which settled the outstanding border issues between Great Britain and the United States. Previously, these issues had been put on hold through a shared occupancy agreement of the Oregon territory by the two nations in the [[Treaty of 1818]]. In turn, the [[Canada\u2013United States border|International Boundary Survey Commission]] began in 1857 to set the boundary between the United States and British North America, roughly along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], which runs through Semiahmoo Bay and Boundary Bay to [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]], Washington.\n\nThe [[Sunnyside (Surrey)|Semiahmoo Trail]] still exists in White Rock and South Surrey, running from the site of the Boundary Commission Camp at the estuary of the Campbell River, overland to Mud Bay north of Crescent Beach. An 1865 survey map calls this route the 'Telegraph Trail'. During the real-estate boom of the 1980s and 90s, the City of Surrey preserved much of the trail, extending it from 20 Avenue to the Nicomekl River. On 148 Street, a specially constructed \"Semiahmoo Trail\" pedestrian overpass keeps the trail intact.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:White Rock City view from the pier1.JPG|thumb|right|The city as viewed from the White Rock Pier.]]\nThe modern history of White Rock is directly tied to the railway linking British Columbia to Washington state, which runs along the shore of Semiahmoo Bay to the border. The rail is currently owned by [[BNSF Railway]] and runs alongside the promenade at the beach. This was originally the Great Northern line, and it opened up White Rock and Crescent Beach to tourists from Vancouver and New Westminster in the early 1900s.<ref>[http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm.php?id=record_detail&fl=0&lg=English&ex=00000313 Virtual Museum Canada]</ref> The border crossing closest to White Rock (at Douglas, B.C., and [[Blaine, Washington]]) was officially opened in 1908, and the [[Peace Arch]] at the border crossing was constructed in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1913, the present railway station was opened, and the Fox and Hunter Shingle mill began operation. The Campbell River Mill also opened to the east, bringing a minor boom in the local economy. The now-famous pier was opened in 1914 to provide a deep-water mooring facility.\n\nIn the 1950s, White Rock residents began to feel isolated from the then\u2013District of Surrey, where development was being concentrated elsewhere, particularly in North Surrey and Cloverdale. On April 15, 1957, a special warrant from the Government of British Columbia created the City of White Rock within its present boundary.\n\nIn the 1950s, [[Peace Arch Hospital]] opened and continues as a major employer in the city and health facility for the region.\n\nDevelopment was concentrated near the waterfront until the 1960s and 1970s. Many small cliffside dwellings were affordable to those unable to pay the cost of living closer to Vancouver. White Rock gained a reputation for being a retirement centre, as it features the lowest rainfall in the Metro Vancouver region, while benefitting from the influence of the ocean, keeping both summers highs and winter lows bearable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comfortlife.ca/blog/seven-best-places-to-retire-in-canada-8414/|title=Seven Best Places to Retire in Canada|website=www.comfortlife.ca|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>\n\nThe development of [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] and the opening of the Deas Island Tunnel (now the [[George Massey Tunnel]]) created a second boom for the White Rock area, providing a more convenient commuter route to Vancouver. No longer dependent upon the railway, development crept up the hillside. In the 1980s, the City of Surrey designated [[South Surrey]] as a [[town centre]] comparable to Guildford, Cloverdale, and Newton. The Semiahmoo Mall opened in Surrey on the north side of 16 Avenue (the south side of which is North Bluff Road within White Rock).\n\nIn 1979, chartered accountant Tom Kirstein and architect Chip Barrett organized an annual sandcastle competition,<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/435434344.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+24%2C+1986&author=Masters%2C+John&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=F.3&desc=Patrons+gorging+at+Expo%27s+culture+banquet \"Patrons gorging at Expo's culture banquet\"]. ''Toronto Star'' - Toronto, Ont. Masters, John \tMay 24, 1986 Page: \tF.3</ref> which became internationally famous. The event took advantage of the long, sandy beach exposed at low tide, giving enough time for entrants to construct elaborate displays. Prizes of up to $10,000 were awarded, and crowds of 150,000 were estimated at the competition's height. In 1987, the contest was ended because of security costs and concerns. In 2008, a group of local high school students (Sara Woodward, Jorden Abernethy, Daniel Fowler, Michael Vanderpolder, and Tasha Svenson) and members of the community (Spenser Bolen, Michael Nolan, Trixie Nolan, and Lisa Nolan) launched a Sandcastle Competition revival. This competition drew 40,000 guests and over 70 teams.\n\nThe 1970s saw the White Rock/South Surrey area develop into a suburban bedroom community of the Lower Mainland. A real-estate boom in the area drew many young families to homes marketed to young professionals, a process that intensified in the mid-1990s. Today, many parts of the community resemble the type of suburban development seen across North America. Some cliffside cottages have given way to large homes, and multimillion-dollar properties have appeared in the area.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the development of the Peninsula Village Mall on 24 Avenue in Surrey pushed development farther north and hurt some small businesses in White Rock. Recent commercial and residential development in Surrey's Grandview Heights neighbourhood, east of Highway 99 at 24 Avenue, continues the trend of auto-oriented, suburban development in the surrounding area. While the City of White Rock lies ten blocks to the southwest of this 6.5-km big-box project, the community's centre of gravity may shift again as development continues.\n\n[[Image:2018 White Rock windstorm damage.jpg|thumb|right|White Rock's pier was severed during a windstorm in December 2018.]]\n[[File:WhiterockBroken pier 3-15-2019.jpg|thumb|The broken section of White Rock's pier (south side) as of March 2019]]\nUptown White Rock has been the site of significant new developments in recent years, with medium-rise condos becoming more prominent. The City of White Rock's fire department was located half a block north of its city limits until the early 1990s, when a new firehall was built across from City Hall. In 2007, the White Rock Little League team made it to the Little League World Series.\n\nOn December 20, 2018, during a severe windstorm, the White Rock Pier was severed when sailboats broke free from the attached marina and crashed into the pier destroying a 30-metre section.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/live-ferries-cancelled-as-wind-storm-hits-b-c-coast|title=B.C. windstorm: White Rock pier split in two, ferries cancelled, hundreds of thousands lose power|last=Crawford|first=Tiffany|date=21 December 2018|work=The Vancouver Sun|access-date=23 December 2018|last2=Brown|first2=Scott|last3=Ruttle|first3=Joseph}}</ref> At least 15 boats sank and several were wedged underneath the pier's pilings.

[[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] is a freeway that links the White Rock area with Vancouver to the north and U.S. [[Interstate 5]], via the Peace Arch border crossing, to the south. King George Highway ([[British Columbia Highway 99A|Highway 99A]]) links the Peace Arch border with [[Surrey Central station]] and [[New Westminster]] via the soon-to-be-replaced [[Pattullo Bridge]]. Johnston Road (152 Street) links White Rock to Guildford and the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] (Highway 1).\n\nMost of White Rock's bus routes run through the [[White Rock Centre]] transit exchange. From there, the 351 and 354 buses, which previously ran to downtown Vancouver, now terminate at [[Bridgeport Station (TransLink)|Bridgeport station]] in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]; Vancouver-bound passengers have to transfer onto the [[Canada Line]] rapid transit line. Only one route serving the area, the 352 Ocean Park/Bridgeport Station express bus, does not run through White Rock Centre, instead terminating near the [[South Surrey Athletic Park]]. The 321, 345, and 394 buses provide service to North Surrey, notably to [[Surrey Central station|Surrey Central]] and [[King George Station|King George]] [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Skytrain]] stations, and the 375 service runs through White Rock Centre from just north of the [[Peace Arch]] border crossing to [[Guildford Town Centre]]. The 531 bus runs from White Rock Centre to Willowbrook Mall in Langley. Community Shuttle routes, the 360, 361, 362, and 363, service local communities within White Rock and South Surrey.\n\n[[BNSF Railway]] has a single-track main line through White Rock that runs the length of the White Rock beach promenade. The city itself has no train service; however, this rail line is a major corridor for goods transported between the ports of Vancouver and the continental U.S., as well as for the [[Amtrak Cascades]] passenger service between Seattle and Vancouver via [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], Washington. The [[Canadian National Railway]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) also have [[trackage rights]] along the line. Goods transported on the corridor include Canadian [[softwood]] lumber, coal, paper products, and general merchandise. The CPR runs regular [[potash]] trains along the line to the [[Canpotex]] export terminal in Oregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://canpqlx.sasktelwebhosting.com/delivery.htm |title=Canpotex website |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823192135/http://canpqlx.sasktelwebhosting.com/delivery.htm |archive-date=2010-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nWhite Rock's climate is moderate year-round and its temperature is often two or three degrees higher than in nearby Vancouver. Because the city is set away from the Coast Mountains, it sees less fog, fewer rainy days and shorter snowfalls.

It borders [[Semiahmoo Bay]] to the south and is surrounded on three sides by [[South Surrey]]. To the southeast across a footbridge lies the [[Semiahmoo First Nation]], which is within the borders of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]]. Semiahmoo Bay and the Southern [[Gulf Islands]] in the [[Strait of Georgia]] are also to the south.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:White Rock pier - summer 2010.jpg|left|thumb|White Rock pier in summer]]\nThe boundaries between White Rock and Surrey are Bergstrom Road (136 Street) to the west, North Bluff Road (16th Avenue) to the north, Stayte Road (160 Street) to the east, and 8th Avenue to the south. The area south of 8 Avenue from Stayte Road westward to where 8 Avenue meets the water is the [[Semiahmoo Indian Reserve]] and lies within the bounds of the City of Surrey (though it is governed separately). The Surrey neighbourhoods of [[Ocean Park (Surrey)|Ocean Park]] and [[Crescent Beach (Surrey)|Crescent Beach]] lie immediately to the northwest.\n\nWhite Rock has a moderate climate, with average daily high temperatures of 23 degrees [[Celsius]] in summer and 6 degrees Celsius in winter.<ref>[http://www.city.whiterock.bc.ca/2005Misc/About-White-Rock.html City Of White Rock Website]</ref>\n\nWhite Rock is named for a distinctive large white boulder on its beach near the promenade, a [[glacial erratic]] that migrated south during the last glaciation. The 486-ton granite boulder was kept white by shellfish-eating seabirds whose [[guano]] covered the rock, so much so that 19th-century sailors used it as a beacon. However, it is now kept white through monthly applications of white paint by the city parks department, and has been a popular [[graffiti]] target for over thirty years.\n\n[[White Rock Pier|The pier]] and promenade are popular destinations, but do not allow dogs, bicycles or skateboards. A trial run of allowing dogs on the promenade will begin in late 2019.

[[Semiahmoo First Nation]] permanent encampments were known to exist between 1791, the first European contact, and the 1850s, the beginnings of European settlement. These were located along the waterfront at the eastern and western limits of the present City of White Rock. The Semiahmoo people also constructed forts as lookouts for raiders from the northern first nations; one is located in the Ocean Park area.\n\nThe [[Oregon boundary dispute]] culminated in the [[Oregon Treaty]] of 1846, which settled the outstanding border issues between Great Britain and the United States. Previously, these issues had been put on hold through a shared occupancy agreement of the Oregon territory by the two nations in the [[Treaty of 1818]]. In turn, the [[Canada\u2013United States border|International Boundary Survey Commission]] began in 1857 to set the boundary between the United States and British North America, roughly along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], which runs through Semiahmoo Bay and Boundary Bay to [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]], Washington.\n\nThe [[Sunnyside (Surrey)|Semiahmoo Trail]] still exists in White Rock and South Surrey, running from the site of the Boundary Commission Camp at the estuary of the Campbell River, overland to Mud Bay north of Crescent Beach. An 1865 survey map calls this route the 'Telegraph Trail'. During the real-estate boom of the 1980s and 90s, the City of Surrey preserved much of the trail, extending it from 20 Avenue to the Nicomekl River. On 148 Street, a specially constructed \"Semiahmoo Trail\" pedestrian overpass keeps the trail intact.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:White Rock City view from the pier1.JPG|thumb|right|The city as viewed from the White Rock Pier.]]\nThe modern history of White Rock is directly tied to the railway linking British Columbia to Washington state, which runs along the shore of Semiahmoo Bay to the border. The rail is currently owned by [[BNSF Railway]] and runs alongside the promenade at the beach. This was originally the Great Northern line, and it opened up White Rock and Crescent Beach to tourists from Vancouver and New Westminster in the early 1900s.<ref>[http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/pm.php?id=record_detail&fl=0&lg=English&ex=00000313 Virtual Museum Canada]</ref> The border crossing closest to White Rock (at Douglas, B.C., and [[Blaine, Washington]]) was officially opened in 1908, and the [[Peace Arch]] at the border crossing was constructed in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1913, the present railway station was opened, and the Fox and Hunter Shingle mill began operation. The Campbell River Mill also opened to the east, bringing a minor boom in the local economy. The now-famous pier was opened in 1914 to provide a deep-water mooring facility.\n\nIn the 1950s, White Rock residents began to feel isolated from the then\u2013District of Surrey, where development was being concentrated elsewhere, particularly in North Surrey and Cloverdale. On April 15, 1957, a special warrant from the Government of British Columbia created the City of White Rock within its present boundary.\n\nIn the 1950s, [[Peace Arch Hospital]] opened and continues as a major employer in the city and health facility for the region.\n\nDevelopment was concentrated near the waterfront until the 1960s and 1970s. Many small cliffside dwellings were affordable to those unable to pay the cost of living closer to Vancouver. White Rock gained a reputation for being a retirement centre, as it features the lowest rainfall in the Metro Vancouver region, while benefitting from the influence of the ocean, keeping both summers highs and winter lows bearable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comfortlife.ca/blog/seven-best-places-to-retire-in-canada-8414/|title=Seven Best Places to Retire in Canada|website=www.comfortlife.ca|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>\n\nThe development of [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] and the opening of the Deas Island Tunnel (now the [[George Massey Tunnel]]) created a second boom for the White Rock area, providing a more convenient commuter route to Vancouver. No longer dependent upon the railway, development crept up the hillside. In the 1980s, the City of Surrey designated [[South Surrey]] as a [[town centre]] comparable to Guildford, Cloverdale, and Newton. The Semiahmoo Mall opened in Surrey on the north side of 16 Avenue (the south side of which is North Bluff Road within White Rock).\n\nIn 1979, chartered accountant Tom Kirstein and architect Chip Barrett organized an annual sandcastle competition,<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/doc/435434344.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+24%2C+1986&author=Masters%2C+John&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=F.3&desc=Patrons+gorging+at+Expo%27s+culture+banquet \"Patrons gorging at Expo's culture banquet\"]. ''Toronto Star'' - Toronto, Ont. Masters, John \tMay 24, 1986 Page: \tF.3</ref> which became internationally famous. The event took advantage of the long, sandy beach exposed at low tide, giving enough time for entrants to construct elaborate displays. Prizes of up to $10,000 were awarded, and crowds of 150,000 were estimated at the competition's height. In 1987, the contest was ended because of security costs and concerns. In 2008, a group of local high school students (Sara Woodward, Jorden Abernethy, Daniel Fowler, Michael Vanderpolder, and Tasha Svenson) and members of the community (Spenser Bolen, Michael Nolan, Trixie Nolan, and Lisa Nolan) launched a Sandcastle Competition revival. This competition drew 40,000 guests and over 70 teams.\n\nThe 1970s saw the White Rock/South Surrey area develop into a suburban bedroom community of the Lower Mainland. A real-estate boom in the area drew many young families to homes marketed to young professionals, a process that intensified in the mid-1990s. Today, many parts of the community resemble the type of suburban development seen across North America. Some cliffside cottages have given way to large homes, and multimillion-dollar properties have appeared in the area.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the development of the Peninsula Village Mall on 24 Avenue in Surrey pushed development farther north and hurt some small businesses in White Rock. Recent commercial and residential development in Surrey's Grandview Heights neighbourhood, east of Highway 99 at 24 Avenue, continues the trend of auto-oriented, suburban development in the surrounding area. While the City of White Rock lies ten blocks to the southwest of this 6.5-km big-box project, the community's centre of gravity may shift again as development continues.\n\n[[Image:2018 White Rock windstorm damage.jpg|thumb|right|White Rock's pier was severed during a windstorm in December 2018.]]\n[[File:WhiterockBroken pier 3-15-2019.jpg|thumb|The broken section of White Rock's pier (south side) as of March 2019]]\nUptown White Rock has been the site of significant new developments in recent years, with medium-rise condos becoming more prominent. The City of White Rock's fire department was located half a block north of its city limits until the early 1990s, when a new firehall was built across from City Hall. In 2007, the White Rock Little League team made it to the Little League World Series.\n\nOn December 20, 2018, during a severe windstorm, the White Rock Pier was severed when sailboats broke free from the attached marina and crashed into the pier destroying a 30 metre section.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/live-ferries-cancelled-as-wind-storm-hits-b-c-coast|title=B.C. windstorm: White Rock pier split in two, ferries cancelled, hundreds of thousands lose power|last=Crawford|first=Tiffany|date=21 December 2018|work=The Vancouver Sun|access-date=23 December 2018|last2=Brown|first2=Scott|last3=Ruttle|first3=Joseph}}</ref> At least 15 boats sank and several were wedged underneath the pier's pilings.

[[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]] is a freeway that links the White Rock area with Vancouver to the north and U.S. [[Interstate 5]], via the Peace Arch border crossing, to the south. King George Highway ([[British Columbia Highway 99A|Highway 99A]]) links the Peace Arch border with [[Surrey Central station]] and [[New Westminster]] via the soon-to-be-replaced [[Pattullo Bridge]]. Johnston Road (152 Street) links White Rock to Guildford and the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] (Highway 1).\n\nMost of White Rock's bus routes run through the [[White Rock Centre]] transit exchange. From there, the 351 and 354 buses, which previously ran to downtown Vancouver, now terminate at [[Bridgeport Station (TransLink)|Bridgeport station]] in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]; Vancouver-bound passengers have to transfer onto the [[Canada Line]] rapid transit line. Only one route serving the area, the 352 Ocean Park/Bridgeport Station express bus, does not run through White Rock Centre, instead terminating near the [[South Surrey Athletic Park]]. The 321, 345, and 394 buses provide service to North Surrey, notably to [[Surrey Central station|Surrey Central]] and [[King George Station|King George]] [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Skytrain]] stations, and the 375 service runs through White Rock Centre from just north of the [[Peace Arch]] border crossing to [[Guildford Town Centre]]. The 531 bus runs from White Rock Centre to Willowbrook Mall in Langley. Community Shuttle routes, the 360, 361, 362, and 363, service local communities within White Rock and South Surrey.\n\n[[BNSF Railway]] has a single-track main line through White Rock that runs the length of the White Rock beach promenade. The city itself has no train service; however, this rail line is a major corridor for goods transported between the ports of Vancouver and the continental U.S., as well as for the [[Amtrak Cascades]] passenger service between Seattle and Vancouver via [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], Washington. The [[Canadian National Railway]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) also have [[trackage rights]] along the line. Goods transported on the corridor include Canadian [[softwood]] lumber, coal, paper products, and general merchandise. The CPR runs regular [[potash]] trains along the line to the [[Canpotex]] export terminal in Oregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://canpqlx.sasktelwebhosting.com/delivery.htm |title=Canpotex website |access-date=2009-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823192135/http://canpqlx.sasktelwebhosting.com/delivery.htm |archive-date=2010-08-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nWhite Rock's climate is moderate year-round and its temperature is often two or three degrees higher than in nearby Vancouver. Because the city is set away from the Coast Mountains, it sees less fog, fewer rainy days and shorter snowfalls. Meteorological statistics show that White Rock does, in fact, receive 20 per cent more sunshine than does Vancouver. Temperatures average 23&nbsp;\u00b0C/73&nbsp;\u00b0F in summer and 6&nbsp;\u00b0C/43&nbsp;\u00b0F in winter.

T. Roy Young had {{convert|40|acre|m2}}to develop Tampa's first suburb three miles (5&nbsp;km) north of downtown.  He called it Seminole Heights.\n\nTen years earlier Tampa's population had reached 26,000. A trolley line connected [[Sulphur Springs, Tampa|Sulphur Springs]] to downtown making travel to the suburbs possible and inviting. The streetcar made it possible to live in one area of town and work in another.\n\nYoung recognized this potential. His Seminole Development Corporation property encompassed a rectangle bordered by Hillsborough Avenue, Central Avenue, Wilder Avenue and Florida Avenue. The houses built here were mostly bungalow, oriented east-to-west and started at $5,000.\n\nOther developments quickly followed. By 1912, the Mutual Development Company owned by Milton and Giddings Mabry and the Dekle Investment Company owned by Lee and James Dekle surveyed and platted land adjacent to Seminole Heights forming the Suwanee Heights subdivision. Bounded by Henry Avenue, Hillsborough Avenue, Central Avenue and Florida Avenue, Suwanee Heights was also a restricted subdivision. Like the original Seminole Heights, houses required the same east/west orientation but started at $1,400.\n\nDuring the \"Florida Bloom\" years (roughly 1919-1929) more development came to areas north and east of the original subdivisions. Of course, with this development came the merchants seeing an opportunity to provide welcome goods and services to the residents. Some of those early businesses have faded away. However, many current Seminole Heights businesses have been open for more than 50 years.\n\nIn October and November 2017, [[Seminole Heights serial killer|four people were shot dead]] in separate incidents while walking in the Seminole Heights neighborhood.
