Passengers aboard for her maiden voyage are the cream of American and British society. Boarding are first class passengers Sir Richard and Lady Richard, second class passengers Mr. Clarke and Mrs. Clarke, a young newly wed couple, and steerage passengers Mr. Murphy, Mr. Gallagher and Mr. James Farrel. Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]] is also readying for the voyage. On 10 April, ''Titanic'' sails out to sea. On 14 April, at sea, the ship receives a number of ice warnings from other steamers. Only a few of the messages are relayed to Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]], who orders a lookout, but does not slow the ship or consider changing course.\n\nLate that night, the ''[[SS Californian]]'' spots float ice in the distance, and tries to send a message to the ''Titanic''. On the ''Titanic'', the steerage passengers enjoy their time at a party in Third Class where Murphy becomes attracted to a young Polish girl, and dances with her. In the ship's boiler room, [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]], the ship's builder, finishes an inspection. In the wireless room, wireless operators [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]] and [[Harold Sydney Bride]] are changing shifts. Phillips receives an ice warning, but when more messages arrive for him to send out, it is lost under them. On the Californian, field ice is spotted, and the ship stops, for it is too dangerous to proceed, and a message is sent to the ''Titanic''. Because the ''Californian'' is so close, the message is very loud, and Phillips interrupts the message. ''Titanic''{{'}}s passengers begin to settle in for the night, while some, including Mr. Hoyle and Jay Yates stay up to gamble. Suddenly, the vessel collides with an iceberg. Captain Smith sends for Thomas Andrews who goes to inspect the damage. Andrews determines that the ship will sink within two hours, and it lacks sufficient [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] capacity for everyone on board.\n\nA distress signal is sent out, and efforts begin to signal the ''Californian'', visible on the horizon 10&nbsp;miles away, but its radio operator is off duty and does not hear the distress signal. Fortunately, the radio operator on the {{RMS|Carpathia}} receives the distress call and alerts Captain [[Arthur Rostron]], who orders the ship to head to the site. Unfortunately, the ship is 58 miles away, and will take around four hours to reach the ''Titanic''. Meanwhile, the ''Californian'' remains where it is, the crew failing to comprehend why the large ship they are in sight of is firing rockets. Captain Smith orders Officers Lightoller and [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]] to start lowering the lifeboats. On Lightoller's side, men are not allowed on board, but Murdoch, working the other side of the ship, is far more lenient, letting men board lifeboats. Chief Baker [[Charles Joughin]], after giving up his space in a lifeboat, turns to the bottle to ease his ailments. In the [[Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic|Grand Staircase]], Robbie Lucas runs into Mr. Andrews and asks if the ship is seriously damaged. Andrews tells him to get his wife and children into the boats. Lucas rouses his children and wife to go to the lifeboats. He gets them safety in a boat, and turns away, realizing he will never see his family again. Murphy, Gallagher, and Farrel help the Polish girl, and her mother find their way through the ship, and get them in a lifeboat. The Richards, and Hoyle are admitted to a boat by Murdoch. Yates gives a female passenger a note to send to his sister. Several women refuse to leave their husbands, inadvertently setting an example for Mrs. Clarke, who first decides to stay with her husband, until Andrews advises them on how to escape the sinking ship. As the stewards struggle to hold back women and children in third-class, most of those from first- and second-class board the lifeboats and launch away from the ship. The ship quickly fills with water, and the passengers begin to realize the danger, as the ship lists more and more. When the third-class passengers are allowed up from below, chaos ensues. The ''Titanic''{{'}}s bow submerges, and only two collapsible lifeboats are left. Lightoller and other able seamen struggle to free them, when the ship begins its final plunge. Captain Smith retreats into the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the bridge is engulfed by the sea. Lightoller and many others are swept off the ship. Thomas Andrews remains in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Passengers jump into the sea as the stern rises high into the air. The Clarkes, struggling in the water, are killed by a falling funnel. The stricken liner rapidly sinks into the icy sea.\n\nMany passengers, including Lucas, and Farrel, die of hypothermia. One of the collapsibles is floating overturned, so Lightoller and a few more men balance on it and wait. Yates, denied access to the upturned boat, swims away to drown himself. Murphy and Gallagher make it to the collapsible and are taken on board. Joughin holds onto the side, not minding the cold because he's been drinking, and is eventually taken aboard. Lightoller spots another boat, and the men are saved. The ''Carpathia'' arrives and rescues the survivors. On the ''Carpathia'', after a group prayer, Lightoller is told by Rostron the numbers of the saved and lost.

Lord dated the genesis of his interest in the subject to childhood. So did producer MacQuitty, who, as a boy of six, watched the ''Titanic'' set out from Belfast, as well as screenwriter Ambler, who was a lad in London when the ship was launched. MacQuitty had seen ''Titanic'' being launched on 31 May 1911 and still remembered the occasion vividly.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=31}} He also watched the maiden voyage departure the following year.\n\n===1956 television adaptation===\nThe book was previously adapted as a live TV production, screened by [[NBC]] and sponsored by [[Kraft Foods]] as part of the ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'' strand on 28 March 1956.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=97}} It has been described as \"the biggest, most lavish, most expensive thing of its kind\" attempted up to that point, with 31 sets, 107 actors, 72 speaking parts, 3,000 gallons of water and costing $95,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|95000|1956|r=1}}}} at present-day prices). [[George Roy Hill]] directed and [[Claude Rains]] provided a narration{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}} \u2013 a practice borrowed from radio dramas which provided a template for many television dramas of the time.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=98}} It took a similar approach to the book, lacking dominant characters and switching between a multiplicity of scenes. Rains' narration was used \"to bridge the almost limitless number of sequences of life aboard the doomed liner\", as a reviewer put it,{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=160}} and closed with his declaration that \"never again has Man been so confident. An age had come to an end.\"{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=161}} \n\nThe production was a major hit, attracting 28 million viewers, and greatly boosted the book's sales.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}} It was rerun on [[kinescope]] on 2 May 1956, five weeks after its first broadcast.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=97}}{{sfn|Rasor|2001|p=119}}\n\n==Development==\nThe film adaptation came about after its eventual director, [[Roy Ward Baker]], and its producer, Belfast-born [[William MacQuitty]] both acquired copies of the book \u2013 Baker from his favorite bookshop and MacQuitty from his wife \u2013 and decided to obtain the film rights. He met Lord and brought him on board the production as a consultant.{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=149}} \n\nMacQuitty succeeded in raising finance from John Davis at the Rank Organisation, who in the late 1950s were expanding into bigger-budgeted filmmaking. The job was assigned to Roy Baker who was under contract to Rank and Baker recommended Ambler be given the job of writing.<ref>Richards p 29</ref>\n\nThe film diverges from both the book and the NBC TV adaptation in focusing on a central character, Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]], played by More. Its conclusion reflects Lord's world-historical theme of a \"world changed for ever\" with a fictional conversation between two survivors, Lightoller and Colonel [[Archibald Gracie IV|Archibald Gracie]], sitting on an overturned lifeboat. Lightoller declares that the disaster is \"different ... Because we were so sure. Because even though it's happened, it's still unbelievable. I don't think I'll ever feel sure again. About anything.\"{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=161}} \n\nProducer MacQuitty had originally contracted with [[Shaw, Savill & Albion Line]] to use its former flagship {{ship|QSMV|Dominion Monarch}} to shoot scenes for the film, but the company pulled out of the production at the last minute, citing that they did not want to use one of their liners to recreate the ''Titanic'' sinking. However, according to MacQuitty, the Shaw Savill Line at the time was managed by Basil Sanderson, son of Harold Sanderson, the White Star Line's director in the U.S. at the time of the sinking. Harold Sanderson would later succeed [[J. Bruce Ismay]] as president of the [[International Mercantile Marine Company]], [[J.P. Morgan]]'s shipping conglomerate that owned the White Star Line. This connection to White Star, according to MacQuitty, is what actually led the Shaw Savill Line to pull out of the film. MacQuitty eventually got permission from Ship Breaking Industries in [[Faslane]], Scotland to film scenes aboard {{RMS|Asturias|1925|6}}, a 1920s ocean liner that the company was [[Ship breaking|scrapping]]. The liner's port side had been demolished, but its starboard was still intact, and so MacQuitty got art students to paint the liner the White Star Line colors and used mirrors to recreate scenes that took place on the port side. 30 sets were constructed using the builders' original plans for ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Aldridge|2008|p=89}}\n\nRank wanted a star and the only role really suitable was Lightoller. The part was offered to Kenneth More, Britain's leading star at the time, who accepted. It was the first movie he made under a new contract with Rank to make seven films in five years at a fee of \u00a340,000 a film.<ref>Richards p 35-36</ref>\n\nThe film was to a significant extent fictional, based on real events but with numerous changes made to increase its drama and appeal. The composite characters, while based in large part on Americans, are depicted as British, and the involvement of American passengers was either limited or left out (with the exception of the Strauses, Guggenheim, Molly Brown and Colonel Gracie). When questioned as to why he did the changes, Roy Baker noted that \"it was a British film made by British artists for a British audience\".<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=bZs5LJAU0l8C&pg=PA298 The Titanic on Film: Myth versus Truth] [[Linda Maria Koldau]]; McFarland, 2012 307 pages, page 139</ref>\n\nIn addition to basing the script&nbsp;\u2014 both in action and dialogue&nbsp;\u2014 on Lord's book, the filmmakers achieved nuanced performances and authentic atmosphere by consulting several actual ''Titanic'' survivors who served as technical advisors. Among them were [[Joseph Boxhall|Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall]], and passengers [[Edith Rosenbaum|Edith Russell]] and [[Lawrence Beesley]].{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=226}} One day during shooting Beesley famously gatecrashed the set; he infiltrated the set during the sinking scene, hoping to 'go down with the ship', but was discovered by the director, who ordered him off, and vetoed this unscheduled appearance due to actors' union rules; thus, as [[Julian Barnes]] puts it, \"for the second time in his life, Beesley left the ''Titanic'' just before it was due to go down.\"{{sfn|Barnes|2010|p=175}} Charles Lightoller's widow Sylvia Lightoller was also consulted during production, at one point visiting Pinewood Studios and meeting with Kenneth More, whom she introduced to her children on set. Sylvia commended More for the role of her husband.<ref name=\"sylvia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/widow-titanic-officer-visits-chorley.html|title=Widow of Titanic Officer visits Chorley|work=[[Encyclopedia Titanica]]|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Shooting==\nFilming began 15 October 1957 at Pinewood Studios. It went until 5 March 1958.\n\n[[Kenneth More]] recalled the production of the film in his autobiography, published 20 years later in 1978. There was no tank big enough at [[Pinewood Studios]] to film the survivors struggling to climb into lifeboats, so it was done in the open-air swimming bath at [[Ruislip Lido]], at 2:00 am on an icy November morning. When the extras refused to jump in, More realised he would have to set an example. He called out: \"Come on!\"\n\n{{quote|I leaped. Never have I experienced such cold in all my life. It was like jumping into a deep freeze. The shock forced the breath out of my body. My heart seemed to stop beating. I felt crushed, unable to think. I had ''rigor mortis'', without the ''mortis''. And then I surfaced, spat out the dirty water and, gasping for breath, found my voice.\n\n\"Stop!\" I shouted. \"Don't listen to me! It's bloody awful!

The scene was also repeated in ''[[S.O.S. Titanic]]'' (1979), with a stewardess asking him if he will save himself, pointing out that there would be questions that only he could answer.\n\nFour clips from the [[Nazi]] [[propaganda film]] ''[[Titanic (1943 film)|Titanic]]'' (1943) were used in ''A Night to Remember''; two of the ship sailing in calm waters during the day, and two of a flooding walkway in the engine room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nzpetesmatteshot.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/tale-of-two-titanics-retrospective-look.html|title=Matte Shot: a Tribute to Golden Era special fx |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref> As Brian Hawkins writes: the British came closest \"to the ''Titanic'' truth in 1958 with their black-and-white production of Walter Lord's novel ''A Night to Remember'', seamlessly incorporating sequences from director [[Herbert Selpin]]'s 1943 (Nazi) ''Titanic'' without giving any screen credits for these incredible scenes.\"<ref>Brian Hawkins, The Titanic's last victim: in 1942, a German film director put a uniquely Nazi take on the great ship's sinking.

(There was still doubt about the fact she split in two when the book and film were produced. The accepted view at the time and the result of the inquires was that she sank intact; it was only confirmed that she split after the wreck was found in 1985.) <ref name=\"Michael Janusonis 2003\">Michael Janusonis, \"VIDEO \u2013 Documentary just the tip of the iceberg for ''Titanic'' fans\", ''The Providence Journal'' (5 September 2003), E-05.</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117339997 | title=Titanic | work=Variety | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> Lightoller's widow Sylvia Lightoller praised the film's historical accuracy in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', stating \"The film is really the truth and has not been embroidered\".<ref name=\"sylvia\"/>\n\nHowever, although some events are based on true history, the characters and the storyline are fictional; the characters of Mr. Murphy, Mr. Gallagher, Mr Hoyle, and Jay Yates being [[composite character|composites]] of several men.<ref name=\"Remember 1958\">The Goofs of A Night To Remember (1958, Rank Pictures)</ref>  Murphy, who leads the steerage girls to the lifeboat, is a composite of several Irish emigrants.

John Chapman's body was recovered by the [[CS Mackay-Bennett|cable ship ''Mackay-Bennett'']], and there were no mentions or indications that his body was crushed, soot-blackened or disfigured in a manner suggesting that he had been killed by a falling funnel. Sarah's body was never found.<ref>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/frozen-in-time-the-watch-which-shows-the-moment-378299</ref> The involvement of American passengers was either limited or left out (with the exception of the Strauses, Guggenheim, Molly Brown and Colonel Gracie).<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nSeveral historical figures were renamed or went unnamed to avoid potential legal action. [[Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon]] and [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]] are depicted as Sir Richard and Lady Richard (Lady Duff's secretary Miss Francatelli is completely omitted) and Bruce Ismay is referred to throughout only as \"The Chairman\".\n\nThe film omits several key historical figures, including [[John Jacob Astor IV]], the wealthiest passenger aboard ''Titanic'', and [[Stoker (occupation)|Stoker]] [[Frederick Barrett]], with 2nd Engineer Officer John Henry Hesketh's role being expanded to include duties and actions that were performed by Barrett and others.<ref name=\"Remember 1958\"/>\n\nIn reality, the American gambler Jay Yates (played as British by the distinctive British actor Ralph Michael) was never on board the ''Titanic'' and the note he was said to have handed to a passenger was a hoax. Yates wrote the note in New York and then had a woman accomplice pose as a survivor and deliver the note to the newspaper. Yates did this in order to make the police think he was dead. They didn't fall for the ruse, though, and Yates was captured a couple of months after the sinking. (He was wanted on federal charges connected with postal thefts.)\n\nThe film was also clearly intended as a vehicle for its main star, Kenneth More, who played Lightoller. Throughout the sinking, Lightoller is shown personally loading nearly every lifeboat. In reality, many of Lightoller's actions were performed by other officers.<ref name=\"Remember 1958\"/><ref name=\"seaofglass\">ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE & LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC\" by Tad Fitch, J.

It actually depicted the entrance to [[Plymouth Sound]], which ''Titanic'' had been expected to visit on her return voyage. It was an error made by Walter Lord in his research, which he acknowledged in the documentary \"The Making of A Night to Remember\".{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=155}}<ref>{{harvsp|Walter Lord|1998|p=113}}</ref><ref>{{harvsp|Mark Chirnside|2004|p=177}}</ref>\n\nThe first scene of ''A Night to Remember'' depicts the christening of the ship at its launch. However, the ''Titanic'' was never christened, as it was not the practice of the White Star Line to stand on this sort of ceremony. This has come down in popular lore as one of the many contributing factors to the ship's \"bad luck\".\n\nThe crew, including [[Edward John Smith|Captain Smith]], is depicted having a full trust in the ''Titanic'', considering her \"unsinkable\", an allegation which was never claimed with such certainty.<ref>[[Richard Howells]], ''The Myth of the Titanic'', {{ISBN|0-333-72597-2}}</ref>\n\nLightoller is depicted nearly being crushed by the fourth funnel falling in the ship's last moments.

Lightoller takes one look inside the child's hood, realizes it is dead and sets it adrift in the ocean. In real life, neither Lightoller, nor anyone else on the overturned boat, ever reported receiving a child from the water.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nUpon its December 1958 U.S. premiere, [[Bosley Crowther]] called the film a \"tense, exciting and supremely awesome drama...[that] puts the story of the great disaster in simple human terms and yet brings it all into a drama of monumental unity and scope\"; according to Crowther:<ref>{{cite web| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DEEDF153DE53BBC4F52DFB4678383649EDE | title= Screen: Sinking of Titanic; ''A Night to Remember'' Opens at Criterion | date= December 17, 1958| first= Bosley|last= Crowther| authorlink= Bosley Crowther| publisher= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>this remarkable picture is a brilliant and moving account of the behavior of the people on the ''Titanic'' on that night that should never be forgotten.

Its budget of \u00a3600,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|600000|1958|2012}}}} adjusted for inflation [2012]) was exceptional and made it the most expensive film ever made in Britain up to that time.{{sfn|Street|2004|p=143}}\n\nThe World Premiere was on Thursday, 3 July 1958 at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]].

Passengers aboard for her maiden voyage are the cream of American and British society. Boarding are first class passengers Sir Richard and Lady Richard, second class passengers Mr. Clarke and Mrs. Clarke, a young newly wed couple, and steerage passengers Mr. Murphy, Mr. Gallagher and Mr. James Farrel. Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]] is also readying for the voyage. On 10 April, ''Titanic'' sails out to sea. On 14 April, at sea, the ship receives a number of ice warnings from other steamers. Only a few of the messages are relayed to Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]], who orders a lookout, but does not slow the ship or consider changing course.\n\nLate that night, the ''[[SS Californian]]'' spots float ice in the distance, and tries to send a message to the ''Titanic''. On the ''Titanic'', the steerage passengers enjoy their time at a party in Third Class where Murphy becomes attracted to a young Polish girl, and dances with her. In the ship's boiler room, [[Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)|Thomas Andrews]], the ship's builder, finishes an inspection. In the wireless room, wireless operators [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]] and [[Harold Sydney Bride]] are changing shifts. Phillips receives an ice warning, but when more messages arrive for him to send out, it is lost under them. On the Californian, field ice is spotted, and the ship stops, for it is too dangerous to proceed, and a message is sent to the ''Titanic''. Because the ''Californian'' is so close, the message is very loud, and Phillips interrupts the message. ''Titanic''{{'}}s passengers begin to settle in for the night, while some, including Mr. Hoyle and Jay Yates stay up to gamble. Suddenly, the vessel collides with an iceberg. Captain Smith sends for Thomas Andrews who goes to inspect the damage. Andrews determines that the ship will sink within two hours, and it lacks sufficient [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] capacity for everyone on board.\n\nA distress signal is sent out, and efforts begin to signal the ''Californian'', visible on the horizon 10&nbsp;miles away, but its radio operator is off duty and does not hear the distress signal. Fortunately, the radio operator on the {{RMS|Carpathia}} receives the distress call and alerts Captain [[Arthur Rostron]], who orders the ship to head to the site. Unfortunately, the ship is 58 miles away, and will take around four hours to reach the ''Titanic''. Meanwhile, the ''Californian'' remains where it is, the crew failing to comprehend why the large ship they are in sight of is firing rockets. Captain Smith orders Officers Lightoller and [[William McMaster Murdoch|William Murdoch]] to start lowering the lifeboats. On Lightoller's side, men are not allowed on board, but Murdoch, working the other side of the ship, is far more lenient, letting men board lifeboats. Chief Baker [[Charles Joughin]], after giving up his space in a lifeboat, turns to the bottle to ease his ailments. In the [[Grand Staircase of the RMS Titanic|Grand Staircase]], Robbie Lucas runs into Mr. Andrews and asks if the ship is seriously damaged. Andrews tells him to get his wife and children into the boats. Lucas rouses his children and wife to go to the lifeboats. He gets them safety in a boat, and turns away, realizing he will never see his family again. Murphy, Gallagher, and Farrel help the Polish girl, and her mother find their way though the ship, and get them in a lifeboat. The Richards, and Hoyle are admitted to a boat by Murdoch. Yates gives a female passenger a note to send to his sister. Several woman refuse to leave their husbands, inadvertently setting an example for Mrs. Clarke, who first decides to stay with her husband, until Andrews advises them on how to escape the sinking ship. As the stewards struggle to hold back women and children in third-class, most of those from first- and second-class board the lifeboats and launch away from the ship. The ship quickly fills with water, and the passengers begin to realize the danger, as the ship lists more and more. When the third-class passengers are allowed up from below, chaos ensues. The ''Titanic''{{'}}s bow submerges, and only two collapsible lifeboats are left. Lightoller and other able seamen struggle to free them, when the ship begins its final plunge. Captain Smith retreats into the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the bridge is engulfed by the sea. Lightoller and many others are swept off the ship. Thomas Andrews remains in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Passengers jump into the sea as the stern rises high into the air. The Clarkes, struggling in the water, are killed by a falling funnel. The stricken liner rapidly sinks into the icy sea.\n\nMany passengers, including Lucas, and Farrel, die of hypothermia. One of the collapsibles is floating overturned, so Lightoller and a few more men balance on it and wait. Yates, denied access to the upturned boat, swims away to drown himself. Murphy and Gallagher make it to the collapsible, and are taken on board. Joughin holds onto the side, not minding the cold because he's been drinking, and is eventually taken aboard. Lightoller spots another boat, and the men are saved. The ''Carpathia'' arrives and rescues the survivors. On the ''Carpathia'', after a group prayer, Lightoller is told by Rostron the numbers of the saved and lost. In all, 1500 people were lost; 705 survived.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Kenneth More]] as Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller|Charles Herbert Lightoller]] \n* [[Michael Goodliffe]] as shipbuilder [[Thomas Andrews]]\n* [[Laurence Naismith]] as Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J.

Lord dated the genesis of his interest in the subject to childhood. So did producer MacQuitty, who, as a boy of six, watched the ''Titanic'' set out from Belfast, as well as screenwriter Ambler, who was a lad in London when the ship was launched. MacQuitty had seen ''Titanic'' being launched on 31 May 1911 and still remembered the occasion vividly.{{sfn|Mayer|2004|p=31}} He also watched the maiden voyage departure the following year.\n\n===1956 television adaptation===\nThe book was previously adapted as a live TV production, screened by [[NBC]] and sponsored by [[Kraft Foods]] as part of the ''[[Kraft Television Theatre]]'' strand on 28 March 1956.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=97}} It has been described as \"the biggest, most lavish, most expensive thing of its kind\" attempted up to that point, with 31 sets, 107 actors, 72 speaking parts, 3,000 gallons of water and costing $95,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|95000|1956|r=1}}}} at present-day prices). [[George Roy Hill]] directed and [[Claude Rains]] provided a narration{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}} \u2013 a practice borrowed from radio dramas which provided a template for many television dramas of the time.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=98}} It took a similar approach to the book, lacking dominant characters and switching between a multiplicity of scenes. Rains' narration was used \"to bridge the almost limitless number of sequences of life aboard the doomed liner\", as a reviewer put it,{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=160}} and closed with his declaration that \"never again has Man been so confident. An age had come to an end.\"{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=161}} \n\nThe production was a major hit, attracting 28 million viewers, and greatly boosted the book's sales.{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=151}} It was rerun on [[kinescope]] on 2 May 1956, five weeks after its first broadcast.{{sfn|Anderson|2005|p=97}}{{sfn|Rasor|2001|p=119}}\n\n==Development==\nThe film adaptation came about after its eventual director, [[Roy Ward Baker]], and its producer, Belfast-born [[William MacQuitty]] both acquired copies of the book \u2013 Baker from his favorite bookshop and MacQuitty from his wife \u2013 and decided to obtain the film rights. He met Lord and brought him on board the production as a consultant.{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=149}} \n\nMacQuitty succeeded in raising finance from John Davis at the Rank Organisation, who in the late 1950s were expanding into bigger budgeted filmmaking. The job was assigned to Roy Baker who was under contract to Rank and Baker recommended Ambler be given the job of writing.<ref>Richards p 29</ref>\n\nThe film diverges from both the book and the NBC TV adaptation in focusing on a central character, Second Officer [[Charles Lightoller]], played by More. Its conclusion reflects Lord's world-historical theme of a \"world changed for ever\" with a fictional conversation between two survivors, Lightoller and Colonel [[Archibald Gracie IV|Archibald Gracie]], sitting on an overturned lifeboat. Lightoller declares that the disaster is \"different ... Because we were so sure. Because even though it's happened, it's still unbelievable. I don't think I'll ever feel sure again. About anything.\"{{sfn|Biel|1996|p=161}} \n\nProducer MacQuitty had originally contracted with [[Shaw, Savill & Albion Line]] to use its former flagship {{ship|QSMV|Dominion Monarch}} to shoot scenes for the film, but the company pulled out of the production at the last minute, citing that they did not want to use one of their liners to recreate the ''Titanic'' sinking. However, according to MacQuitty, the Shaw Savill Line at the time was managed by Basil Sanderson, son of Harold Sanderson, the White Star Line's director in the U.S. at the time of the sinking. Harold Sanderson would later succeed [[J. Bruce Ismay]] as president of the [[International Mercantile Marine Company]], [[J.P. Morgan]]'s shipping conglomerate that owned the White Star Line. This connection to White Star, according to MacQuitty, is what actually led the Shaw Savill Line to pull out of the film. MacQuitty eventually got permission from Ship Breaking Industries in [[Faslane]], Scotland to film scenes aboard {{RMS|Asturias|1925|6}}, a 1920s ocean liner that the company was [[Ship breaking|scrapping]]. The liner's port side had been demolished, but its starboard was still intact, and so MacQuitty got art students to paint the liner the White Star Line colors and used mirrors to recreate scenes that took place on the port side. 30 sets were constructed using the builders' original plans for ''Titanic''.{{sfn|Aldridge|2008|p=89}}\n\nRank wanted a star and the only role really suitable was Lightoller. The part was offered to Kenneth More, Britain's leading star at the time, who accepted. It was the first movie he made under a new contract with Rank to make seven films in five years at a fee of \u00a340,000 a film.<ref>Richards p 35-36</ref>\n\nThe film was to a significant extent fictional, based on real events but with numerous changes made to increase its drama and appeal. The composite characters, while based in large part on Americans, are depicted as British, and the involvement of American passengers was either limited or left out (with the exception of the Strauses, Guggenheim, Molly Brown and Colonel Gracie). When questioned as to why he did the changes, Roy Baker noted that \"it was a British film made by British artists for a British audience\".<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=bZs5LJAU0l8C&pg=PA298 The Titanic on Film: Myth versus Truth] [[Linda Maria Koldau]]; McFarland, 2012 307 pages, page 139</ref>\n\nIn addition to basing the script&nbsp;\u2014 both in action and dialogue&nbsp;\u2014 on Lord's book, the filmmakers achieved nuanced performances and authentic atmosphere by consulting several actual ''Titanic'' survivors who served as technical advisors. Among them were [[Joseph Boxhall|Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall]], and passengers [[Edith Rosenbaum|Edith Russell]] and [[Lawrence Beesley]].{{sfn|Ward|2012|p=226}} One day during shooting Beesley famously gatecrashed the set; he infiltrated the set during the sinking scene, hoping to 'go down with the ship', but was discovered by the director, who ordered him off, and vetoed this unscheduled appearance due to actors' union rules; thus, as [[Julian Barnes]] puts it, \"for the second time in his life, Beesley left the ''Titanic'' just before it was due to go down.\"{{sfn|Barnes|2010|p=175}} Charles Lightoller's widow Sylvia Lightoller was also consulted during production, at one point visiting Pinewood Studios and meeting with Kenneth More, whom she introduced to her children on set. Sylvia commended More for the role of her husband.<ref name=\"sylvia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/widow-titanic-officer-visits-chorley.html|title=Widow of Titanic Officer visits Chorley|work=[[Encyclopedia Titanica]]|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n==Shooting==\nFilming began 15 October 1957 at Pinewood Studios. It went until 5 March 1958.\n\n[[Kenneth More]] recalled the production of the film in his autobiography, published 20 years later in 1978. There was no tank big enough at [[Pinewood Studios]] to film the survivors struggling to climb into lifeboats, so it was done in the open-air swimming bath at [[Ruislip Lido]], at 2:00am on an icy November morning. When the extras refused to jump in, More realised he would have to set an example. He called out: \"Come on!\"\n\n{{quote|I leaped. Never have I experienced such cold in all my life. It was like jumping into a deep freeze. The shock forced the breath out of my body. My heart seemed to stop beating. I felt crushed, unable to think. I had ''rigor mortis'', without the ''mortis''. And then I surfaced, spat out the dirty water and, gasping for breath, found my voice.\n\n\"Stop!\" I shouted. \"Don't listen to me! It's bloody awful!

The scene was also repeated in ''[[S.O.S. Titanic]]'' (1979), with a stewardess asking him if he will save himself, pointing out that there would be questions that only he could answer.\n\nFour clips from the [[Nazi]] [[propaganda film]] ''[[Titanic (1943 film)|Titanic]]'' (1943) were used in ''A Night to Remember''; two of the ship sailing in calm waters during the day, and two of a flooding walkway in the engine room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nzpetesmatteshot.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/tale-of-two-titanics-retrospective-look.html|title=Matte Shot: a Tribute to Golden Era special fx |accessdate=2011-05-26}}</ref> As Brian Hawkins writes: the British came closest \"to the ''Titanic'' truth in 1958 with their black-and-white production of Walter Lord's novel ''A Night to Remember'', seamlessly incorporating sequences from director [[Herbert Selpin]]'s 1943 (Nazi) ''Titanic'' without giving any screen credits for these incredible scenes.\"<ref>Brian Hawkins, The Titanic's last victim: in 1942, a German film director put a uniquely Nazi take on the great ship's sinking. The reviews were deadly, The [[National Post]], Thursday 12 April 2012, p.A10</ref> Selpin himself was arrested on instruction from Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] over the course of production in early August 1942, for offering a negative opinion of the German military while directing this earlier Nazi era film. He was then found dead in his prison cell.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n[[File:Titanic the sinking.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the sinking of the ''Titanic'']] \nThe film is regarded as one of the most historically accurate ''Titanic'' disaster films, with the exception of not featuring the ship breaking in half. (There was still doubt about the fact she split in two when the book and film were produced. The accepted view at the time and the result of the inquires was that she sank intact; it was only confirmed that she split after the wreck was found in 1985.) <ref name=\"Michael Janusonis 2003\">Michael Janusonis, \"VIDEO \u2013 Documentary just the tip of the iceberg for ''Titanic'' fans\", ''The Providence Journal'' (5 September 2003), E-05.</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117339997 | title=Titanic | work=Variety | accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> Lightoller's widow Sylvia Lightoller praised the film's historical accuracy in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', stating \"The film is really the truth and has not been embroidered\".<ref name=\"sylvia\"/>\n\nHowever, although some events are based on true history, the characters and the storyline are fictional; the characters of Mr. Murphy, Mr. Gallagher, Mr Hoyle, and Jay Yates being [[composite character|composites]] of several men.<ref name=\"Remember 1958\">The Goofs of A Night To Remember (1958, Rank Pictures)</ref>  Murphy, who leads the steerage girls to the lifeboat, is a composite of several Irish emigrants.

Lucas even says the words actually spoken by Lucien Smith to his wife: \"I never expected to ask you to obey me, but this is one time you must\".<ref>{{cite video\n  | people = Melissa Jo Peltier\n  | title = Titanic: Death of a Dream \n  | medium = documentary\n  | publisher = A&E Network\n  | location = United States\n  | date = 1994 }}</ref> Mr. Clarke and Mrs. Clarke are composites of several honeymoon couples, notably Mr. John Chapman and Mrs. Sarah Chapman, a pair of newlyweds from second-class who died in the sinking. In real life, when Sarah boarded a lifeboat, she found that her husband John couldn't go. She turned back saying. ''Goodbye' Mrs. Richards. If John can't go, I won't go either.'' John Chapman's body was recovered by the [[CS Mackay-Bennett|cable ship ''Mackay-Bennett'']], and there were no mentions or indications that his body was crushed, soot-blackened or disfigured in a manner suggesting that he had been killed by a falling funnel. Sarah's body was never found.<ref>https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/frozen-in-time-the-watch-which-shows-the-moment-378299</ref> The involvement of American passengers was either limited or left out (with the exception of the Strauses, Guggenheim, Molly Brown and Colonel Gracie).<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nSeveral historical figures were renamed or went unnamed to avoid potential legal action. [[Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon]] and [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]] are depicted as Sir Richard and Lady Richard (Lady Duff's secretary Miss Francatelli is completely omitted) and Bruce Ismay is referred to throughout only as \"The Chairman\".\n\nThe film omits several key historical figures, including [[John Jacob Astor IV]], the wealthiest passenger aboard ''Titanic'', and [[Stoker (occupation)|Stoker]] [[Frederick Barrett]], with 2nd Engineer Officer John Henry Hesketh's role being expanded to include duties and actions that were performed by Barrett and others.<ref name=\"Remember 1958\"/>\n\nIn reality, the American gambler Jay Yates (played as British by the distinctive British actor Ralph Michael) was never on board the ''Titanic'' and the note he was said to have handed to a passenger was a hoax. Yates wrote the note in New York and then had a woman accomplice pose as a survivor and deliver the note to the newspaper. Yates did this in order to make the police think he was dead. They didn't fall for the ruse, though, and Yates was captured a couple of months after the sinking. (He was wanted on federal charges connected with postal thefts.)\n\nThe film was also clearly intended as a vehicle for its main star, Kenneth More, who played Lightoller. Throughout the sinking, Lightoller is shown personally loading nearly every lifeboat. In reality, many of Lightoller's actions were performed by other officers.<ref name=\"Remember 1958\"/><ref name=\"seaofglass\">ON A SEA OF GLASS: THE LIFE & LOSS OF THE RMS TITANIC\" by Tad Fitch, J.

It actually depicted the entrance to [[Plymouth Sound]], which ''Titanic'' had been expected to visit on her return voyage. It was an error made by Walter Lord in his research, which he acknowledged in the documentary \"The Making of A Night to Remember\".{{sfn|Eaton|Haas|1994|p=155}}<ref>{{harvsp|Walter Lord|1998|p=113}}</ref><ref>{{harvsp|Mark Chirnside|2004|p=177}}</ref>\n\nThe first scene of ''A Night to Remember'' depicts the christening of the ship at its launch. However, the ''Titanic'' was never christened, as it was not the practice of the White Star Line to stand on this sort of ceremony. This has come down in popular lore as one of the many contributing factors to the ship's \"bad luck\".\n\nThe crew, including [[Edward John Smith|Captain Smith]], is depicted having a full trust in the ''Titanic'', considering her \"unsinkable\", an allegation which was never claimed with such certainty.<ref>[[Richard Howells]], ''The Myth of the Titanic'', {{ISBN|0-333-72597-2}}</ref>\n\nLightoller is depicted nearly being crushed by the fourth funnel falling in the ship's last moments. It was actually the first funnel that fell near Lightoller.{{sfn|Barczewski|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Winocour|1960|p=299}}<ref name=\"Remember 1958\"/>\n\nMurphy and Gallagher make it to the overturned Collapsible B with a child in their arms, which they pass to Lightoller. Lightoller takes one look inside the child's hood, realizes it is dead and sets it adrift in the ocean. In real life, neither Lightoller, nor anyone else on the overturned boat, ever reported receiving a child from the water.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical reception===\nUpon its December 1958 U.S. premiere, [[Bosley Crowther]] called the film a \"tense, exciting and supremely awesome drama...[that] puts the story of the great disaster in simple human terms and yet brings it all into a drama of monumental unity and scope\"; according to Crowther:<ref>{{cite web| url= https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DEEDF153DE53BBC4F52DFB4678383649EDE | title= Screen: Sinking of Titanic; ''A Night to Remember'' Opens at Criterion | date= December 17, 1958| first= Bosley|last= Crowther| authorlink= Bosley Crowther| publisher= [[The New York Times]] | accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>this remarkable picture is a brilliant and moving account of the behavior of the people on the ''Titanic'' on that night that should never be forgotten. It is an account of the casualness and flippancy of most of the people right after the great ship has struck (even though an ominous cascade of water is pouring into her bowels); of the slow accumulation of panic that finally mounts to a human holocaust, of shockingly ugly bits of baseness and of wonderfully brave and noble deeds.</blockquote>\n\nThe film won numerous awards, including a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film|Best English-Language Foreign Film]] and received high praise from reviewers on both sides of the Atlantic.{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=151}} \n\n===Box office===\nThe film  was at best only a modest commercial success due to its original huge budget and a relatively poor impact in America.{{sfn|Richards|2003|p=98}} The film was one of the twenty most popular films of the year in Britain according to ''Motion Picture Herald''. \n\n''Kinematograph Weekly'' listed it as being \"in the money\" at the British box office in 1958.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Kinematograph Weekly|date=18 December 1958|first=Josh|last=Billings|page=7|title=Others in the Money}}</ref>\n\nBy 2001 it had not made a profit, in part because the film was issued as part of a slate of ten films and all its profits were cross-collateralised.<ref>Richards p 98</ref>\n\n===Reputation today===\nIt has nonetheless aged well; the film has considerable artistic merit and, according to Professor Paul Heyer, it helped to spark the wave of [[disaster film]]s that included ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'' (1974).{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=151}} Heyer comments that it \"still stands as the definitive cinematic telling of the story and the prototype and finest example of the disaster-film genre.\"{{sfn|Heyer|2012|p=104}} On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has a \"certified fresh\" score of 100% based on 20 reviews with an average score of 8.71/10.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1015079_night_to_remember</ref> It is considered \"the best ''Titanic'' film before ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997)\" and \"the most ''accurate'' of all ''Titanic'' films\" <ref name=\"Michael Janusonis 2003\"/> and \"the definitive ''Titanic'' tale\",<ref>Howard Thompson, \"Movies This Week\", ''The New York Times'' (9 August 1998), p. 6, col. 1.</ref> especially for its social realism, reflecting, in the words of one critic, \"the overwhelming historical evidence that the class rigidity of 1912, for all its defects, produced a genuine sense of behavioural obligation on the ''Titanic'' among rich and poor alike; that the greatest number of people aboard faced death or hardship with a stoic and selfless grace that the world has wondered at for most of this century.\"<ref>Ken Ringle, \"Integrity Goes Down With the Ship; Historical Facts, Including True-Life Gallantry, Lost in ''Titanic''\", ''The Washington Post'' (22 March 1998), p.

The building houses lecture and conference suites and restaurant facilities including a 101-room hotel that is opening in 2017. It is also the home of the MBA programme. The complex was designed by Hugh Wilson and Lewis Womersley and dates from the 1970s.<ref>Brian Pullan & Michele Abendstern, ''A History of the University of Manchester, 1973\u201390''. 2 vols.

It was completed in 1997 at the time when the UMIST departments co-located to form the Federal School.<ref name=\"THE\" /> The building cost \u00a37m and was designed by London architects ORMS. MBS East currently houses undergraduate services and some of the Research Centres of MBS.\n\nManchester Accounting and Finance Group (MAFG) of MBS is located in Crawford House, which is situated opposite MBS East on the southwest corner of Oxford Road and Booth Street West and is linked via a pedestrian walkway. The [[Manchester Enterprise Centre]], pioneer of the [[Master of Enterprise]] degree, is located in the Zochonis Building, Brunswick Street.\n\nAs announced on 15 August 2014, The MBS West is now approved for \u00a350m refurbishment. This strategic development forms part of the University's ten-year, \u00a31 billion Campus Masterplan to create some of the most modern campus facilities in the world along the southern gateway to the city, known as the Manchester Corridor. Subject to planning consent, work on the retail redevelopment will begin in 2015, with the development set to open in mid-2016.  The wider scheme of MBS refurbishment works will be completed in phases with the final phase due for completion in early 2018. The plans reconfigure the existing precinct centre to create up to 14 units with double-height glazed frontages onto Oxford Road.  The variety of units will create a mixed offer of retail, food and leisure for students, staff and visitors to the University and Business School. The offer will complement the new hotel and enhanced Manchester Business School Executive Education Centre, both of which are being developed as part of phase one, which was granted planning consent in April 2013 with construction due to commence later in 2014. In addition to the retail and leisure, phase two includes the removal of a link bridge across Oxford Road to improve views and light levels in the area.  Public realm improvements such as pavement widening will enhance the area for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users. The phase two redevelopment also includes the refurbishment of circa 200,000 sq ft of MBS facilities to create significantly improved teaching and administrative accommodation, a new Learning Library and Enterprise Zone.\n\n==Research profile==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\nIn the previous 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (pre-merger) the 'old' Manchester Business School and Manchester School of Management were both rated 5. Manchester School of Accounting and Finance is one of only two accounting and finance schools in the UK rated as 6* by the RAE (i.e. with RAE 5* rating for two consecutive periods). According to a survey published by ''Accounting and Finance'' in 2008, MBS is ranked as the \"world number one for accounting research\".\n\nManchester has several research centres of international standing.

The building houses lecture and conference suites and restaurant facilities including a 101-room hotel that is opening in 2017. It is also the home of the MBA programme. The complex was designed by Hugh Wilson and Lewis Womersley and dates from the 1970s.<ref>Brian Pullan & Michele Abendstern, ''A History of the University of Manchester, 1973\u201390''. 2 vols.

It was completed in 1997 at the time when the UMIST departments co-located to form the Federal School.<ref name=\"THE\" /> The building cost \u00a37m and was designed by London architects ORMS. MBS East currently houses undergraduate services and some of the Research Centres of MBS.\n\nManchester Accounting and Finance Group (MAFG) of MBS is located in Crawford House, which is situated opposite MBS East on the southwest corner of Oxford Road and Booth Street West and is linked via a pedestrian walkway. The [[Manchester Enterprise Centre]], pioneer of the [[Master of Enterprise]] degree, is located in the Zochonis Building, Brunswick Street.\n\nAs announced on 15 August 2014, The MBS West is now approved for \u00a350m refurbishment. This strategic development forms part of the University's ten-year, \u00a31 billion Campus Masterplan to create some of the most modern campus facilities in the world along the southern gateway to the city, known as the Manchester Corridor. Subject to planning consent, work on the retail redevelopment will begin in 2015, with the development set to open in mid-2016.  The wider scheme of MBS refurbishment works will be completed in phases with the final phase due for completion in early 2018. The plans reconfigure the existing precinct centre to create up to 14 units with double-height glazed frontages onto Oxford Road.  The variety of units will create a mixed offer of retail, food and leisure for students, staff and visitors to the University and Business School. The offer will complement the new hotel and enhanced Manchester Business School Executive Education Centre, both of which are being developed as part of phase one, which was granted planning consent in April 2013 with construction due to commence later in 2014. In addition to the retail and leisure, phase two includes the removal of a link bridge across Oxford Road to improve views and light levels in the area.  Public realm improvements such as pavement widening will enhance the area for pedestrians, cyclists and public transport users. The phase two redevelopment also includes the refurbishment of circa 200,000 sq ft of MBS facilities to create significantly improved teaching and administrative accommodation, a new Learning Library and Enterprise Zone.\n\n==Research profile==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\nIn the previous 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (pre-merger) the 'old' Manchester Business School and Manchester School of Management were both rated 5. Manchester School of Accounting and Finance is one of only two accounting and finance schools in the UK rated as 6* by the RAE (i.e. with RAE 5* rating for two consecutive periods). According to a survey published by ''Accounting and Finance'' in 2008, MBS is ranked as the \"world number one for accounting research\".\n\nManchester has several research centres of international standing.
