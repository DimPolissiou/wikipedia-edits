Most of them had established themselves in Argentina coming from the United Kingdom as managers and workers of the British-owned railway companies that operated in Argentina. British citizens founded social and sports clubs where they could practise their sports, such as [[bowls]], [[cricket]], [[association football|football]], [[golf]], [[horse riding]], [[rugby union]] and [[tennis]] amongst others.\n\n[[File:Bacrc.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Buenos Aires Cricket Club Ground]] in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]] held the first football match on 20 June 1867]]\nTwo English immigrants, Thomas and James Hogg, organized a meeting on 9 May 1867 in Buenos Aires where the [[Buenos Aires Football Club]] was founded. The club was given permission by the [[Buenos Aires Cricket Club]] to make use of the cricket field in [[Parque Tres de Febrero]], [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]], on the site now occupied by the [[Galileo Galilei planetarium]].

(In the 19th century, it was common practice for teams to be distinguished by caps rather than shirts.) The teams consisted of eight players each as the organisers were unable to find more players for the match. The line-ups were: Thomas Hogg, James Hogg, William Forrester, T. B. Smith, J. W. Bond, E. S. Smith, J. Rabsbottom and N. H. Smith (one team); William Heald, T. R. Best, U. Smith, H. J. Barge, H. Willmont, R. M. Ramsay, J. Simpson and W. Boschetti (second team).

In these early days of football in Argentina, nearly all of the players and officials were expatriate Britons or of British extraction and the oldest football clubs in Argentina like [[Rosario Central]], [[Newell's Old Boys]] and [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes]] were all founded by British expatriates.\n\n[[File:Alumni AC 1904.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] before playing [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in Buenos Aires, 1904]]\nThe most successful and admired team of this early period was [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]], founded by graduates and students of [[Alexander Watson Hutton|Watson Hutton's]] English High School.

The backlash against this policy at [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes Athletic Club]] resulted in the formation of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Argentino de Quilmes|Argentino de Quilmes]] in 1899, the first of many Argentine clubs for Argentine players. The name Argentino or Argentinos has remained popular in Argentine football. The most famous team with the name is [[Argentinos Juniors]] who won the [[Copa Libertadores]] in [[Copa Libertadores 1985|1985]].\n\n[[United Kingdom|British]] [[football club]]s [[British football clubs tours to South America|tours over South America]] contributed to the spread and develop of football in Argentina during the first years of the 20th century. The first club to tour on the country was [[Southampton F.C.]] in 1904, followed by several teams (mainly from England although some Scotland clubs also visited South America) until 1929 with [[Chelsea F.C.]] being the last team to tour.<ref name=chelseatour>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chelsea-satrip29.html South American Trip of Chelsea FC 1929] by Pablo Ciullini on RSSSF</ref>\n\nBritish teams were considered the best in the world by then, and some of them served as inspiration to establish football clubs in Argentina, helped by the immigration of British citizens that had arrived to worked for British companies (mostly in railway construction). [[Belgrano Athletic Club|Belgrano A.C.]], [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario A.C.]], [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] and [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes]] are some examples of clubs established by British immigrants to South America.<ref name=iwa/><ref name=cuna>[https://www.lacapital.com.ar/ovacion/plaza-jewell-el-club-donde-nacioacute-el-deporte-rosarino-cumple-hoy-145-antildeos-n361847.html Plaza Jewell, el club donde naci\u00f3 el deporte rosarino, cumple hoy 145 a\u00f1os], ''La Capital'', 27 Mar 2012</ref>\n\n=== Consolidation ===\nThe early years of the 20th century saw a large number of new clubs formed; by 1907, there were over 300 teams in [[Argentina]].<ref>[http://www.efdeportes.com/efd10/jdf10.htm EFD Deportes] {{in lang|es}}</ref> Most of the major clubs were created around this period; they played in the national amateur tournament or in local championships. By this time, matches had a considerable attendance and as the popularity of the game increased the British influence on the game waned. In 1911, Alumni folded and by 1912 the Association was renamed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as the [[Argentine Football Association|Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Football]], although the tradition of giving the clubs English names continued for many years.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, many new football leagues were started in cities across Argentina as the popularity of the game spread out from [[Greater Buenos Aires]], these include [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] (with the establishment of [[Liga Rosarina de Football|Liga Rosarina]] in 1905), [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] (1912), [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] (1913), [[Tucum\u00e1n, Argentina|Tucum\u00e1n]] (1919), [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]] (1920) and [[Salta, Argentina|Salta]] (1921).\n\nAlthough the city of Rosario did not have an organised league, since 1900 the football squads of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario A.C.]] and [[Rosario Central]] had taken part of the first international tournament in South America, the [[Tie Cup]], played by teams of [[Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Uruguay]] leagues.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/argurucuptie.html#a1900 Cup Tie Competition] on RSSSF.com</ref> [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario A.C.]] became the first Rosarian team to win an international competition after winning the cup in 1902, defeating legendary Alumni 2\u20131 in the playoff match.

In the branch of clubs indirectly affiliates to AFA below the fourth level, there are 250 other [[List of regional football leagues in Argentina|Regional Leagues]] that are affiliated with AFA and compete for the right to enter the league system at the lowest tier.\n\nThe [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] is the highest level of club football in Argentina. It was founded in [[1891 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1891]] as an amateur competition, becoming professional in [[1931 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1931]] with a league by 18 teams which were dissatisfied with the amateur system they were participating on until [[1930 in Argentine football|1930]]. This group of 18 founding members of the present league included nearly all of the most prominent clubs of those times, unified by the idea that full and compulsory amateurism was no longer sustainable (many of those teams are still today among the most popular clubs in Argentina). For many years, the only winners were the so-called \"[[The Big Five of Argentine football|big five]]\"<ref name=\"Argentina - List of champions\">[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/argchamp.html Argentina - List of champions] at [[rsssf]]</ref> ([[Boca Juniors]], [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente|Independiente]], [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]], [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] and [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]]). This dominance was finally broken in 1967 by [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Since then, ten other teams have won the championship, resulting in a total of 27 teams having been champions of Argentina as of 2016. River Plate has won the most championships with 36. The only teams outside the [[City of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]] and [[Greater Buenos Aires]] to have won the championship are [[Rosario Central]] and [[Newell's Old Boys]] from [[Rosario]], [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]] and [[Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata|Gimnasia y Esgrima]] from [[La Plata]].\n\nBelow the second division, [[Primera B Nacional|Primera Nacional]], the league system is regionalized with three divisions for clubs directly affiliated to AFA of [[City of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]], [[Greater Buenos Aires]] and twenty clubs from the cities of [[Rosario]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], [[La Plata]], [[Z\u00e1rate, Buenos Aires|Zarate]], [[Campana, Buenos Aires Province|Campana]], [[Luj\u00e1n, Buenos Aires|Luj\u00e1n]], [[Jun\u00edn, Buenos Aires|Jun\u00edn]], [[General Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Ca\u00f1uelas]] and [[Pilar, Buenos Aires Province|Pilar]], and two divisions for clubs indirectly affiliated to AFA that cover the so-called \"Interior\" (the rest of the country). Even below these seven leagues, Argentine football is regionalized into almost 250 [[List of regional football leagues in Argentina|Regional Leagues]], which consist of teams that participate in championships and tournaments organized by the [[:es:Asociaci\u00f3n del F\u00fatbol Argentino#\u00d3rganos|Consejo Federal del F\u00fatbol Argentino]] (CFFA), internal organ of the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA), to obtain the right to enter the [[:es:Torneo Regional Federal Amateur|Torneo Regional Federal]], established in 2018.\n\n=== League championships ===\n{{main|Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n}}\nThe Primera Divisi\u00f3n has been using different formats for its championships, from a double [[round-robin tournament]] (1891 to 1966) to a single round-robin that would become the standard in Latin America, the [[Apertura and Clausura]]. In the particular case of Argentina, the Apertura was contested in the second half of the calendar year, and the Clausura was played in the first half of the following year (in order to synchronize the seasons with those of the European football). Different formats used also included the organization of [[Metropolitano championship|Metropolitano]] and [[Nacional championship|Nacional]] championships, that lasted from 1967 to 1985.\n\nAs of [[2019\u201320 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|2019\u201320 season]], the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n league is made up of 24 teams, with a championship organized in a single round-robin schedule, resulting in a total of 23 rounds per team. Six teams from Argentina are eligible to play the [[Copa Libertadores]], four from the league championship and the rest from the [[Copa Argentina]] and [[Copa de la Superliga]].\n\nFrom 1891 to date, [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] is the most winning team with 36 domestic championships, followed by [[Boca Juniors]] with 34 titles. [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] holds the third position with 18 titles.\n\n=== Domestic cups ===\n{{main|List of Argentine football national cups}}\n\nSince the creation of the first league in 1891, several cups have been played in Argentine apart from the main competition, the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. The first cup held in the country was the [[Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires]]; first contested in 1905, it was played until 1936.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/argcuphist.html Argentina - Domestic Cup History] on [[RSSSF]]</ref>\n\nAs of the present, four domestic cups are held in Argentina: the [[Copa Argentina]], that includes teams of all divisions of Argentine football, and the [[Supercopa Argentina]] \u2013contested by the reigning champions of Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Copa Argentina, organised by the AFA.

Even those supporters who usually do not attend the matches watch them on television and comment on them the next day with friends and co-workers. When the [[Argentina national football team]] plays (especially during world cup matches), streets tend to look completely deserted as everyone is watching the match. After the victories in [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], streets were flooded with people celebrating the championship, making it impossible not to become part of the celebration.\n\nIt was in 1986 when the figure of [[Diego Maradona]] exploded, becoming an icon not only of Argentine football but of football itself.

Most of them had established themselves in Argentina coming from the United Kingdom as managers and workers of the British-owned railway companies that operated in Argentina. British citizens founded social and sports clubs where they could practise their sports, such as [[bowls]], [[cricket]], [[association football|football]], [[golf]], [[horse riding]], [[rugby union]] and [[tennis]] amongst others.\n\n[[File:Bacrc.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Buenos Aires Cricket Club Ground]] in [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]] held the first football match on 20 June 1867]]\nTwo English immigrants, Thomas and James Hogg, organized a meeting on 9 May 1867 in Buenos Aires where the [[Buenos Aires Football Club]] was founded. The club was given permission by the [[Buenos Aires Cricket Club]] to make use of the cricket field in [[Parque Tres de Febrero]], [[Palermo, Buenos Aires]], on the site now occupied by the [[Galileo Galilei planetarium]]. The first recorded football match in Argentina took place on this pitch on 20 June 1867,<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arg-early-info.html \"''Early History of Football in Argentina'\"] - [[Rec.sport.soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] by Osvaldo J. Georgazzi, 1999</ref> being covered by [[English language]] daily newspaper ''The Standard''. This newspaper, published in Argentina, was the first one to cover football matches in the country.<ref name=iwa/>\n\nThe match was played between two teams of British merchants, the White Caps and the Red Caps. (In the 19th century, it was common practice for teams to be distinguished by caps rather than shirts.) The teams consisted of eight players each as the organisers were unable to find more players for the match. The line-ups were: Thomas Hogg, James Hogg, William Forrester, T. B. Smith, J. W. Bond, E. S. Smith, J. Rabsbottom and N. H. Smith (one team); William Heald, T. R. Best, U. Smith, H. J. Barge, H. Willmont, R. M. Ramsay, J. Simpson and W. Boschetti (second team). The team led by Hogg won 4\u20130, according to ''The Standard'' newspaper published on June 23.<ref>[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/06/20/deportes/d-05801.htm \"El f\u00fatbol nacional cumple a\u00f1os\"], ''[[Clar\u00edn (Argentine newspaper)|Clar\u00edn]]'', 20 June 2007</ref> The match played was a blend of both [[association football|association]] and [[rugby football|rugby]] footballs, with no [[Football pitch#Goals|goals]] on the field.

The chronicle referred to a ''\"foot-ball\"'' match played in a [[cricket field]] in [[Montevideo]] between an Uruguayan-Argentine combined vs a [[United Kingdom|British]] team. The attendance was estimated in 1,000 people. Nevertheless it is unclear what form of \"[[football]]\" was played due to the number of players on the field (15 per side).<ref>[http://cihfhistoria.blogspot.com/2017/04/la-primera-cronica.html La primera cr\u00f3nica] by Jorge Gallego on CIHF website, 29 Apr 2017</ref>\n\n[[File:Great southern railway fc 1888.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Team of Southern Railway Athletic Club, with Alexander Watson Hutton as one of its players, 1888]]\nThe \"Southern Railway Athletic Club\" (not related with [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway|the British railway company]]) might have been the first organised team under the [[laws of the Game (association football)|\"Association\" rules]], according to ''The Standard'', that published a chronicle describing the existence of that team, with records of a match played at Lan\u00fas A.C. field in 1888.

It eventually became the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA). In these early days of football in Argentina, nearly all of the players and officials were expatriate Britons or of British extraction and the oldest football clubs in Argentina like [[Rosario Central]], [[Newell's Old Boys]] and [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes]] were all founded by British expatriates.\n\n[[File:Alumni AC 1904.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] before playing [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in Buenos Aires, 1904]]\nThe most successful and admired team of this early period was [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]], founded by graduates and students of [[Alexander Watson Hutton|Watson Hutton's]] English High School. Like all of the early clubs, it was composed mainly of British players.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the game became increasingly popular amongst other European immigrants, especially Italians.\n\nMost of the early clubs had a policy of excluding the local [[Creole peoples|creole]] population. The backlash against this policy at [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes Athletic Club]] resulted in the formation of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Argentino de Quilmes|Argentino de Quilmes]] in 1899, the first of many Argentine clubs for Argentine players. The name Argentino or Argentinos has remained popular in Argentine football. The most famous team with the name is [[Argentinos Juniors]] who won the [[Copa Libertadores]] in [[Copa Libertadores 1985|1985]].\n\n[[United Kingdom|British]] [[football club]]s [[British football clubs tours to South America|tours over South America]] contributed to the spread and develop of football in Argentina during the first years of the 20th century. The first club to tour on the country was [[Southampton F.C.]] in 1904, followed by several teams (mainly from England although some Scotland clubs also visited South America) until 1929 with [[Chelsea F.C.]] being the last team to tour.<ref name=chelseatour>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/chelsea-satrip29.html South American Trip of Chelsea FC 1929] by Pablo Ciullini on RSSSF</ref>\n\nBritish teams were considered the best in the world by then, and some of them served as inspiration to establish football clubs in Argentina, helped by the immigration of British citizens that had arrived to worked for British companies (mostly in railway construction). [[Belgrano Athletic Club|Belgrano A.C.]], [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario A.C.]], [[Alumni Athletic Club|Alumni]] and [[Quilmes Atl\u00e9tico Club|Quilmes]] are some examples of clubs established by British immigrants to South America.<ref name=iwa/><ref name=cuna>[https://www.lacapital.com.ar/ovacion/plaza-jewell-el-club-donde-nacioacute-el-deporte-rosarino-cumple-hoy-145-antildeos-n361847.html Plaza Jewell, el club donde naci\u00f3 el deporte rosarino, cumple hoy 145 a\u00f1os], ''La Capital'', 27 Mar 2012</ref>\n\n=== Consolidation ===\nThe early years of the 20th century saw a large number of new clubs formed; by 1907, there were over 300 teams in [[Argentina]].<ref>[http://www.efdeportes.com/efd10/jdf10.htm EFD Deportes] {{in lang|es}}</ref> Most of the major clubs were created around this period; they played in the national amateur tournament or in local championships. By this time, matches had a considerable attendance and as the popularity of the game increased the British influence on the game waned. In 1911, Alumni folded and by 1912 the Association was renamed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as the [[Argentine Football Association|Asociaci\u00f3n Argentina de Football]], although the tradition of giving the clubs English names continued for many years.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, many new football leagues were started in cities across Argentina as the popularity of the game spread out from [[Greater Buenos Aires]], these include [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] (with the establishment of [[Liga Rosarina de Football|Liga Rosarina]] in 1905), [[C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina|C\u00f3rdoba]] (1912), [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] (1913), [[Tucum\u00e1n, Argentina|Tucum\u00e1n]] (1919), [[San Luis, Argentina|San Luis]] (1920) and [[Salta, Argentina|Salta]] (1921).\n\nAlthough the city of Rosario did not have an organised league, since 1900 the football squads of [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario A.C.]] and [[Rosario Central]] had taken part of the first international tournament in South America, the [[Tie Cup]], played by teams of [[Rosario]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Uruguay]] leagues.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/argurucuptie.html#a1900 Cup Tie Competition] on RSSSF.com</ref> [[Club Atl\u00e9tico del Rosario|Rosario A.C.]] became the first Rosarian team to win an international competition after winning the cup in 1902, defeating legendary Alumni 2\u20131 in the playoff match.

Argentine clubs have won the tournament a record three times.<ref>[[Copa CONMEBOL]]</ref>\n\nIn [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004]], the [[Argentina Olympic football team]] won Gold at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympic games]]; they defended their title in [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]] to become the first team to defend the Olympic football title since Hungary in 1968.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tableso/olympics.html Olympic football tournament] at [[rsssf]]</ref>\n\n== Clubs ==\n\n=== League system ===\n{{main|Argentine football league system}}\n\nAround 326 registered football clubs play in the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA) league system, which is organized in a pyramid of seven leagues, divided into the third level between [[:es:Anexo:Clubes directamente afiliados a la AFA|clubs directly affiliated to AFA]] and [[:es:Anexo:Clubes indirectamente afiliados a la AFA|clubs indirectly affiliates to AFA]]. In the branch of clubs indirectly affiliates to AFA below the fourth level, there are 250 other [[List of regional football leagues in Argentina|Regional Leagues]] that are affiliated with AFA and compete for the right to enter the league system at the lowest tier.\n\nThe [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] is the highest level of club football in Argentina. It was founded in [[1891 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1891]] as an amateur competition, becoming professional in [[1931 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|1931]] with a league by 18 teams which were dissatisfied with the amateur system they were participating on until [[1930 in Argentine football|1930]]. This group of 18 founding members of the present league included nearly all of the most prominent clubs of those times, unified by the idea that full and compulsory amateurism was no longer sustainable (many of those teams are still today among the most popular clubs in Argentina). For many years, the only winners were the so-called \"[[The Big Five of Argentine football|big five]]\"<ref name=\"Argentina - List of champions\">[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/argchamp.html Argentina - List of champions] at [[rsssf]]</ref> ([[Boca Juniors]], [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente|Independiente]], [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]], [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] and [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]]). This dominance was finally broken in 1967 by [[Estudiantes de La Plata]]. Since then, ten other teams have won the championship, resulting in a total of 27 teams having been champions of Argentina as of 2016. River Plate has won the most championships with 36. The only teams outside the [[City of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]] and [[Greater Buenos Aires]] to have won the championship are [[Rosario Central]] and [[Newell's Old Boys]] from [[Rosario]], [[Estudiantes de La Plata|Estudiantes]] and [[Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata|Gimnasia y Esgrima]] from [[La Plata]].\n\nBelow the second division, [[Primera B Nacional|Primera Nacional]], the league system is regionalized with three divisions for clubs directly affiliated to AFA of [[City of Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]], [[Greater Buenos Aires]] and twenty clubs from the cities of [[Rosario]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], [[La Plata]], [[Z\u00e1rate, Buenos Aires|Zarate]], [[Campana, Buenos Aires Province|Campana]], [[Luj\u00e1n, Buenos Aires|Luj\u00e1n]], [[Jun\u00edn, Buenos Aires|Jun\u00edn]], [[General Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Ca\u00f1uelas]] and [[Pilar, Buenos Aires Province|Pilar]], and two divisions for clubs indirectly affiliated to AFA that cover the so-called \"Interior\" (the rest of the country). Even below these seven leagues, Argentine football is regionalized into almost 250 [[List of regional football leagues in Argentina|Regional Leagues]], which consist of teams that participate in championships and tournaments organized by the [[:es:Asociaci\u00f3n del F\u00fatbol Argentino#\u00d3rganos|Consejo Federal del F\u00fatbol Argentino]] (CFFA), internal organ of the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA), to obtain the right to enter the [[:es:Torneo Regional Federal Amateur|Torneo Regional Federal]], established in 2018.\n\n=== League championships ===\n{{main|Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n}}\nThe Primera Divisi\u00f3n has been using different formats for its championships, from a double [[round-robin tournament]] (1891 to 1966) to a single round-robin that would become the standard in Latin America, the [[Apertura and Clausura]]. In the particular case of Argentina, the Apertura was contested in the second half of the calendar year, and the Clausura was played in the first half of the following year (in order to synchronize the seasons with those of the European football). Different formats used also included the organization of [[Metropolitano championship|Metropolitano]] and [[Nacional championship|Nacional]] championships, that lasted from 1967 to 1985.\n\nAs of [[2019\u201320 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n|2019\u201320 season]], the Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n league is made up of 24 teams, with a championship organized in a single round-robin schedule, resulting in a total of 23 rounds per team. Six teams from Argentina are eligible to play the [[Copa Libertadores]], four from the league championship and the rest from the [[Copa Argentina]] and [[Copa de la Superliga]].\n\nFrom 1891 to date, [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] is the most winning team with 36 domestic championships, followed by [[Boca Juniors]] with 34 titles. [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing Club]] holds the third position with 18 titles.\n\n=== Domestic cups ===\n{{main|List of Argentine football national cups}}\n\nSince the creation of the first league in 1891, several cups have been played in Argentine apart from the main competition, the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. The first cup held in the country was the [[Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires]]; first contested in 1905, it was played until 1936.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/argcuphist.html Argentina - Domestic Cup History] on [[RSSSF]]</ref>\n\nAs of the present, four domestic cups are held in Argentina: the [[Copa Argentina]], that includes teams of all divisions of Argentine football, and the [[Supercopa Argentina]] \u2013contested by the reigning champions of Primera Divisi\u00f3n and Copa Argentina, organised by the AFA. The third one is [[Copa de la Superliga Argentina]], organised by the [[Superliga Argentina (association)|Superliga Argentina]] body.

The most important is the [[Supercl\u00e1sico|superderby]], which is contested between Argentina's two most popular<ref>[http://www.consultoraequis.com/Estudios_PDF/futbol_marzo06_.pdf Argentine football statistics PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624113018/http://www.consultoraequis.com/Estudios_PDF/futbol_marzo06_.pdf |date=2006-06-24 }}</ref> and successful<ref name=\"Argentina - List of champions\"/> teams, [[Buenos Aires]] rivals [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]] and [[Boca Juniors]].

Other important derbies include the derby between [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Hurac\u00e1n|Hurac\u00e1n]] and [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] (has no particular denomination), the [[Rosario derby|Rosarian derby]] (between [[Newell's Old Boys]] and [[Rosario Central]]), the [[La Plata derby|''Platense'' derby]] (between [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] and [[Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata]]), the West derby (between [[Ferro Carril Oeste]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield|V\u00e9lez Sarsfield]]), the derby between [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Atlanta|Atlanta]] and [[Chacarita Juniors]] (formerly denominated \"Villa Crespo derby\"), the ''Santafesino'' derby (between [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Col\u00f3n|Col\u00f3n]] and [[Uni\u00f3n de Santa Fe|Uni\u00f3n]]), the North Zone derby (between [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Platense|Platense]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Tigre|Tigre]]), the Cordovan derby (between [[Belgrano de C\u00f3rdoba|Belgrano]] and [[Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba|Talleres]]), the derby between [[Instituto Atl\u00e9tico Central C\u00f3rdoba|Instituto]] and [[Racing de C\u00f3rdoba]] (has no particular denomination) and the ''Tucumanian'' derby (between [[San Mart\u00edn de Tucum\u00e1n|San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n|Tucum\u00e1n]]).\n\n=== Clubs at international competitions ===\n{{further|Qualifying method of Copa Libertadores in Argentina}}\n\nThe first international club competition was organized by both, [[Argentine Football Association|Argentine]] and [[Uruguayan Football Association|Uruguayan]] associations, with the establishment of [[Tie Cup]] or \"Copa de Competencia Chevallier Boutell\" in 1900. The tournament was held until 1919. Several competitions between teams from both countries followed, being the last the [[Copa Aldao]], which last edition was played in 1955.\n\nThe most successful Argentine club on the international stage is [[Boca Juniors]]. The club has won a total of 22 international titles.<ref>[https://www.clarin.com/deportes/futbol/titulos-internacionales-independiente_0_B1_H4qPBQ.html Independiente vs. Boca: qui\u00e9n tiene m\u00e1s t\u00edtulos internacionales] by Oscar Barnade, ''Clar\u00edn'', 8 Aug 2018</ref> Three of its wins are the [[Copa Intercontinental|Intercontinental Cup]] titles of [[1977 Intercontinental Cup|1977]], [[2000 Intercontinental Cup|2000]] and [[2003 Intercontinental Cup|2003]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablest/toyota.html Intercontinental Cup] ar [[rsssf]]</ref>\n\n[[Club Atl\u00e9tico Independiente|Independiente]] has won the most important continental title on the most occasions, its seven [[Copa Libertadores]] titles is a record, as is its feat of winning the title on four consecutive occasions (1972\u201375).<ref name=\"Copa Libertadores\">[http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/copalib.html Copa Libertadores] at [[rsssf]]</ref> Also, Independiente was the most successful club on international cups by more than twenty years.

Even those supporters who usually do not attend the matches watch them on television and comment on them the next day with friends and co-workers. When the [[Argentina national football team]] plays (especially during world cup matches), streets tend to look completely deserted as everyone is watching the match. After the victories in [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] and [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], streets were flooded with people celebrating the championship, making it impossible not to become part of the celebration.\n\nIt was in 1986 when the figure of [[Diego Maradona]] exploded, becoming an icon not only of Argentine football but of football itself. In Argentina, Maradona became something resemblant of a god (see [[Iglesia Maradoniana|Maradonian Church]]), admired by fans of every club (even River Plate).\n\nArgentine fans are not allowed to travel to see their teams in away matches, as they have been banned since 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Argentina bans football away supporters after fan death|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-22864505|accessdate=24 March 2015|work=BBC News|date=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n''Hinchas'' (supporters) create an emotional ambiance in many stadiums, singing and cheering loudly all game long, but since the away' fan ban due to violence, the atmosphere in many stadia has become poorer, with goals for away teams greeted by silence and the dissapear of ''round trip chants'' between home and away fans, that provoked in each side to sing louder for show more passion.\n\n''[[Barra brava]]s'' (Argentine organized groups -like the English [[hooligans|hooligan]] [[hooligan firms|firms]]-) also create occasional problems, usually in riots after the match.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]]\n*[[Argentine football league system]]\n*[[Football rivalries in Argentina]]\n*[[Argentina and Brazil football rivalry]]\n*[[Argentina and England football rivalry]]\n*[[Argentina national football team]]\n*[[British football clubs tours to South America]]\n*[[Creole football]]\n*[[English Argentines]]\n*[[Torneos de Verano (Argentina)|Torneos de Verano]]\n*[[List of football clubs in Argentina]]\n*[[Big Five (Argentine football)|Big five clubs]]\n*[[List of Argentine football announcers]]\n*[[Women's football in Argentina]]\n*[[English Argentines]]\n*[[Sport in Argentina]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Association football in Argentina}}\n\n*[http://www.afa.org.ar/ Argentine Football Association website]\n\n{{Football in Argentina}}\n{{Football in South America}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Football In Argentina}}\n[[Category:Football in Argentina]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: dissapear \u2192 disappear,typo(s) fixed: Nevertheless \u2192 Nevertheless,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Argentina"}
