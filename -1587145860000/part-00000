{"title_page": "Remilitarization of the Rhineland", "text_new": "My ham sandwich was good\n\nAfter the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], the Rhineland came under [[Occupation of the Rhineland|Allied occupation]]. Under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, German military presence was forbidden from all territory west of the [[Rhine]] and within 50 kilometers east of the Rhine. The 1925 Locarno Treaties reaffirmed the permanent demilitarised status of the Rhineland. In 1929, German foreign minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] negotiated the withdrawal of Allied forces. The last Allied soldiers left the Rhineland in June 1930.\n\nFollowing the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Germany began working towards rearmament and the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. On 7 March 1936, using the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance]] as a pretext, chancellor and ''F\u00fchrer'' [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' to march 3,000 German troops into the Rhineland, to joyous celebrations across Germany. The French and British governments, unwilling to risk war, decided against enforcing the treaties. The remilitarisation changed the balance of power in Europe from France and its allies towards Germany, making it possible for Germany to pursue a policy of aggression in Western Europe that the demilitarised status of the Rhineland had blocked until then.\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|International relations (1919\u20131939)}}\n\n===Versailles and Locarno===\n[[File:Rhineland Versailles treaty English.png|thumb|upright=1.7|Border between France and Germany after WW I (1919-1926).]]\nUnder Articles 42, 43 and 44 of the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]\u2014imposed on Germany by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] after the [[World War I|Great War]]\u2014Germany was \"forbidden to maintain or construct any fortification either on the Left bank of the [[Rhine]] or on the Right bank to the west of a line drawn fifty kilometers to the East of the Rhine\".

However, the German Foreign Minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] announced in 1929 that Germany would not ratify the 1928 [[Young Plan]] for continuing to pay reparations unless the Allies agreed to leave the Rhineland in 1930. The British delegation at the Hague Conference on German [[War reparations|reparations]] in 1929 proposed that reparations paid by Germany be reduced and that British and French forces should evacuate the Rhineland.  The last British soldiers left in late 1929 and the last French soldiers left in June 1930. As long as the French continued to occupy the Rhineland, the Rhineland functioned as a form of \"collateral\" under which the French could respond to any German attempt at overt rearmament by annexing the Rhineland.  Once the last French soldiers left the Rhineland in June 1930, it could no longer play its \"collateral\" role,  thus opening the door for German rearmament. The French decision to build the [[Maginot Line]] in 1929 was a tacit French admission that it was only a matter of time before German rearmament on a massive scale would begin sometime in the 1930s and that the Rhineland was going to be remilitarized sooner or later.<ref>Emmerson, p. 25.</ref><ref>Young (1996), pp. 19\u201321.</ref> Intelligence from the ''[[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]]'' indicated that Germany had been violating Versailles continuously all through the 1920s with the considerable help of the Soviet Union, and with the French troops out of the Rhineland, it could only be expected that Germany would become more open about violating Versailles.<ref>Young (1996), p. 21.</ref> The Maginot Line in its turn lessened the importance of the Rhineland's demilitarised status from a French security viewpoint.\n\n===The foreign policies of the interested powers===\nThe foreign policy of [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] was to maintain an \"equidistant\" stance from all the major powers in order to exercise \"determinant weight\", which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change the balance of power in Europe, and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe and/or Africa.<ref>Kallis, pp. 129 & 141.</ref>\n\nThe foreign policy goal of the Soviet Union was set forth by [[Joseph Stalin]] in a speech on 19 January 1925 that if another world war broke out between the capitalist states that: \"We will enter the fray at the end, throwing our critical weight onto the scale, a weight that should prove to be decisive\".<ref>Uebersch\u00e4r, Gerd & M\u00fcller, Rolf-Dieter ''[[Hitler's War in the East 1941\u22121945|Hitler's War in the East, 1941\u20131945]]: A Critical Assessment'', Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2002 page 14</ref> To promote this goal which would lead to the global triumph of Communism, the Soviet Union tended to support German efforts to challenge the Versailles system by assisting German secret rearmament, a policy that caused much tension with France. An additional problem in Franco-Soviet relations was the Russian debt issue. Before 1917, the French had been by far the largest investors in Imperial Russia, and the largest buyers of Russian debt, so the decision by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] in 1918 to repudiate all debts and to confiscate all private property, whether it be owned by Russians or by foreigners, had hurt the world of French business and finance quite badly. The question of the Russian debt repudiation and compensation for French businesses affected by Soviet nationalisation policies poisoned Franco-Soviet relations until the early 1930s.\n\nThe centerpiece of interwar French diplomacy had been the ''cordon sanitaire'' in Eastern Europe, which was intended to keep both the Soviet Union and Germany out of Eastern Europe. To this end, France had signed treaties of alliance with Poland in 1921, Czechoslovakia in 1924, Romania in 1926 and Yugoslavia in 1927.<ref name=\"Young pages 17-18\">Young, (1996), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> The ''cordon sanitaire'' states were intended as a collective replacement for Imperial Russia as France's chief eastern ally. The states of the ''cordon sanitaire'' emerged as an area of French political, military, economic and cultural influence.<ref name=\"Young pages 17-18\"/><ref>Duroselle, pp. 172\u2013182.</ref>\n\nAs regards Germany, it had always been assumed by the states of the ''cordon sanitaire'' that if Germany should attack any of them, France would respond by beginning an offensive into western Germany. Long before 1933, German military and diplomatic elites had regarded the Rhineland's demilitarised status as only temporary, and planned to remilitarise the Rhineland at the first favorable diplomatic opportunity.<ref>Kallis, pp. 78\u201379 & 82\u201383.</ref> In December 1918, at a meeting of Germany's leading generals (the German Army functioned as a \"state within the state\"), it had decided that the chief aim would be to rebuild German military power to launch a new world war to win the \"world power status\" that the ''Reich'' had sought, but failed to win in the last war.<ref>M\u00fcller, Klaus J\u00fcrgen ''The Army, Politics and Society in Germany, 1933\u20131945'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987page 48.</ref> All through the 1920s and the early 1930s, the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' had been developing plans for a war to destroy France and its ally Poland, which necessarily presumed remilitarisation of the Rhineland.<ref>Kallis, p. 79.</ref> Steps were taken by the German government to prepare for the remilitarisation, such as keeping former barracks in a good state of repair, hiding military materials in secret depots, and building customs and fire watch towers that could be easily converted into observation and machine gun posts along the frontier.<ref>Emmerson, p. 28.</ref>\n\nFrom 1919 to 1932, British defense spending was based upon the [[Ten Year Rule]], which assumed that there was to be no major war for the next ten years, a policy that led to the British military being cut to the bone.<ref>Bond, pp. 197\u2013198.</ref> Amongst British decision-makers, the idea of the \"continental commitment\" of sending a large army to fight on the European mainland against Germany was never explicitly rejected, but was not favored.<ref>Bond, p. 198.</ref> The memory of the heavy losses taken in the Great War had led many to see the \"continental commitment\" of 1914 as a serious mistake. For most of the inter-war period, the British were extremely reluctant to make security commitments in Eastern Europe, regarding the region as too unstable and likely to embroil Britain in unwanted wars. At most, Britain was willing to make only limited security commitments in Western Europe, and even then tried to avoid the \"continental commitment\" as much as possible. In 1925, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]] had famously stated in public at the Locarno conference that the [[Polish Corridor]] was \"not worth the bones of a single British grenadier\".<ref name=\"Rothstein\">{{in lang|en}} {{cite book | author = Andrew Rothstein | title =The Soldiers\u2019 Strikes of 1919 | year =1980 | editor = | pages =35 | publisher =Macmillan Publishing | location =Basingstoke | isbn =0-333-27693-0 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=wDQaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Soldiers'+Strikes&q= }}</ref><ref name= \"Harris\">[[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] used the same phrase in 1945 and the historian Frederick Taylor on p. 432 in ''Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945'' mentions that it was a deliberate echo of a famous sentence used by [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]: \"The whole of the Balkans is not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.\"</ref> As such, Chamberlain declared that Britain would not guarantee the German-Polish border on the grounds that the Polish Corridor should be returned to Germany. That the British did not take even their Locarno commitments seriously could be seen in Whitehall's prohibition of the British military chiefs' holding staff talks with German, French and Italian militaries about what to do if a \"flagrant violation\" of Locarno occurred.<ref>Emmerson, p. 24.</ref> In general, for most of the 1920s\u201330s, British foreign policy was based upon appeasement, under which the international system established by Versailles would be revised in Germany's favor, within limits in order to win German acceptance of that international order, and thereby ensure the peace. One of the main British aims at Locarno was to create a situation where Germany could pursue territorial revisionism in Eastern Europe peacefully.<ref name=\"Stephen Schuker pages 38-56\">Schuker (1999), pp. 48\u201349.</ref> The British viewpoint was that if Franco-German relations improved, France would gradually abandon the ''cordon sanitaire''.<ref name=\"Stephen Schuker pages 38-56\"/>\n\nOnce France had abandoned its allies in Eastern Europe as the price of better relations with the ''Reich'', the Poles and Czechoslovaks would be forced to adjust to German demands, and would peacefully hand over the territories claimed by Germany such as the [[Sudetenland]], the [[Polish Corridor]] and the [[Free City of Danzig]] (modern [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland).<ref name=\"Stephen Schuker pages 38-56\"/> British policy-makers tended to exaggerate French power with the normally Francophile Sir [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert \"Van\" Vansittart]], the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office writing in 1931 that Britain was faced with an \"unbearable\" French domination of Europe, and what was needed was a revival of German power to counterbalance French power.<ref>Bennett, Edward ''German Rearmament and the West, 1932\u20131933'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015 page 109</ref> French economic and demographic weaknesses in the face of Germany's strengths such as the ''Reich'''s  far larger population and economy together with the fact that much of France had been devastated by World War I while Germany had escaped mostly undamaged were little appreciated in Whitehall.\n\n==The European Situation, 1933\u201336==\n\n===The diplomatic maneuvers=== \nIn March 1933, the German Defence Minister, General [[Werner von Blomberg]] had plans drawn up for remilitarization.<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 82\">Kallis, p. 82.</ref> Blomberg starting in the fall of 1933 had a number of the para-military ''Landspolizei'' units in the Rhineland given secret military training and equipped with military weapons in order to prepare for remilitarization.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> General [[Ludwig Beck]]'s memo of March 1935 on the need for Germany to secure ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) in Eastern Europe had accepted that remilitarization should take place as soon it was diplomatically possible.<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 82\"/> In general, it was believed by German military, diplomatic and political elites that it would not be possible to remiltarize before 1937.<ref>Kallis, p. 83.</ref>\n\nThe change of regime in Germany in 1933 did cause alarm in London, but there was considerable uncertainty about what Hitler's long term intentions were. This uncertainty over what Hitler's ultimate intentions in foreign policy were was to color much of British policy towards Germany until 1939. British decision-makers could never quite decide if Hitler was merely seeking the acceptable goal (to the British) of revising Versailles or the unacceptable goal of seeking to dominate Europe. British policy towards Germany was a dual-track policy of seeking a \"general settlement\" with the ''Reich'' in which the \"legitimate\" German complaints about the Versailles treaty would be addressed in Germany's favor while at the same time pursuing rearmament to negotiate with Germany from a position of strength, to deter Hitler from choosing war as an option, and in a worst-case scenario ensure that Britain was prepared if Hitler really did want to conquer Europe. In February 1934, a secret report by the Defence Requirements Committee identified Germany as the \"ultimate potential enemy\", which British rearmament was to be directed against.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Keith Neilson|author2=Greg Kennedy|author3=David French|title=The British Way in Warfare: Power and the International System, 1856\u20131956 : Essays in Honour of David French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtFHowpztiYC&pg=PA120|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate |page=120}}</ref> Although the possibility of German bombing attacks against British cities increased the importance of having a friendly power on the other side of the English Channel, many British decision-makers were cool, if not downright hostile, towards the idea of the \"continental commitment\".<ref>Bond, pp. 198\u2013199.</ref> When British rearmament began in 1934, the Army received the lowest priority in terms of funding after the air force and the navy, in part to rule out the \"continental commitment\" as an option.<ref>Bond, p. 199.</ref> Increasingly, decision-makers came to favor the idea of \"limited liability\", under which if the \"continental commitment\" were to be made, Britain should only send the smallest possible expeditionary force to Europe, and reserve its main efforts towards the war in the air and on the sea.<ref>Bond, pp. 200\u2013201.</ref> Britain's refusal to make the \"continental commitment\" on the same scale as World War I caused tensions with the French, who believed that it would be impossible to defeat Germany without another large-scale \"continental commitment\", and deeply disliked the idea that they should do the bulk of the fighting on the land.\n\nStarting in 1934, the French Foreign Minister [[Louis Barthou]] decided to put an end to any potential German aggression by building a network of alliances intended to encircle Germany, and made overtures to the Soviet Union and Italy. Until 1933, the Soviet Union had supported German efforts to challenge the Versailles system, but the strident anti-communism of the National Socialist regime together with its claim for ''[[Lebensraum]]'' led the Soviets change positions on the question of maintaining the Versailles system. In September 1933, the Soviet Union ended its secret support for German rearmament, which had started in 1921. Under the guise of collective security, the Soviet Foreign Commissar [[Maxim Litvinov]] started to praise the Versailles system, which until then the Soviet leaders had denounced as a capitalist plot to \"enslave\" Germany.\n\nStarting in the 1920s, [[Benito Mussolini]] had subsidized the right-wing ''[[Heimwehr]]'' (\"Home Defense\") movement in Austria, and after the ultra-conservative Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] had seized dictatorial power in March 1933, Austria had fallen within the Italian sphere of influence.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\">Sullivan, Barry \"More than meets the eye: the Ethiopian War and the Origins of the Second World War\" pages 178\u2013203 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered A.J.P. Taylor and the Historians'', London: Routledge, 1999 page 179</ref> The terrorist campaign mounted by Austrian Nazis with the open support of Germany against the Dollfuss regime with the aim of overthrowing Dollfuss to achieve an ''[[Anschluss]]'' caused considerable tensions between Rome and Berlin.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> Mussolini had warned Hitler several times that Austria was within the Italian sphere of influence, not the German, and to cease trying to overthrow his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Dollfuss. On 25 July 1934 there had occurred the [[July Putsch]] in Vienna that saw Dollfuss assassinated by the Austrian SS, and an announcement by the Austrian Nazis that the ''Anschluss'' was at hand. At the same time that Austrian Nazis attempted to seize power all over Austria, the SS Austrian Legion based in Bavaria began to attack frontier posts along the German-Austrian border in what looked like the beginning of an invasion. In response, Mussolini had mobilized the Italian Army, concentrated several divisions at the [[Brenner Pass]], and warned Hitler that Italy would go to war with Germany if he tried to follow up the ''putsch'' by invading Austria.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> The Austrian-born Hitler, although deeply offended by Mussolini's blunt assertions that his birthplace was within the sphere of influence of any power other than Germany, nevertheless realized he was in no position to do anything except to beat a humiliating retreat. To his disgust, the German Fuhrer had to disallow the ''Putsch'' he had ordered and not follow it up by invading Austria while the Austrian government crushed the ''Putsch'' by the Austrian Nazis.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/>\n\nAfter Barthou was killed on 9 October 1934, his work in trying to build anti-German alliances with the Soviet Union and Italy was continued by [[Pierre Laval]]. On 7 January 1935 during a summit in Rome, Laval essentially told Mussolini that he had a [[Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935|\"free hand\"]] in the Horn of Africa, and France would not oppose an Italian invasion of Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> On 14 April 1935, Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] of Great Britain, Premier [[Pierre Laval]] of France and Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]] met in [[Stresa]] to form the [[Stresa Front]] to oppose any further German violations of Versailles following the German statement in March 1935 that Germany would no longer abide by Parts V or VI of the Treaty of Versailles.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> In the spring of 1935, joint staff talks had begun between France and Italy with the aim of forming an anti-German military alliance.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> On 2 May 1935, Laval travelled to Moscow, where he a signed a treaty of alliance with Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. page 33\">Emmerson, p. 33.</ref> At once, the German government began a violent press campaign against the Franco-Soviet pact, claiming it was a violation of Locarno that was an immense danger for the ''Reich''.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. page 33\"/>\n\nIn his \"peace speech\" of May 21, 1935, [[Adolf Hitler]] stated \"In particular, they [the Germans] will uphold and fulfill all obligations arising out of the Locarno Treaty, so long as the other parties are on their side ready to stand by that pact\".<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\">Heinemann, p. 112.</ref> That line in Hitler's speech was written by his foreign minister, Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]] who wished to reassure foreign leaders who felt threatened by Germany's denunciation in March 1935 of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, which had disarmed Germany.<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> At the same time, Neurath wanted to provide an opening for the eventual remilitarisation of the Rhineland, hence the conditional hedging of the promise to obey Locarno only as long as other powers did.<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> Hitler always took the line that Germany did not consider itself bound by the ''Diktat'' of Versailles, but that Germany would respect any treaty that it willingly signed such as Locarno, under which Germany had promised to keep the Rhineland demilitarized forever; hence Hitler always promised during his \"peace speeches\" to obey Locarno as opposed to Versailles.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 188\">Weinberg (2013), p. 188.</ref>\n\n===The Abyssinia Crisis===\n{{main|Abyssinia Crisis}}\nOn 7 June 1935, MacDonald resigned as British Prime Minister due to ailing health and was replaced by [[Stanley Baldwin]] of the Conservative Party; the leadership change did not affect British foreign policy in any meaningful way. On October 3, 1935, [[Italy]] invaded [[Ethiopia]], and thus began the [[Abyssinia Crisis]]. Under strong pressure from a  British public opinion, which was very much in favor of [[collective security]], the British government took the lead in pressing the [[League of Nations]] for sanctions against Italy.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 171\">Weinberg (2013), p. 171.</ref> The decision of the British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] to take a strong line in favor of collective security was mostly motivated by domestic politics.  Having just won an [[1935 United Kingdom general election|election]] on 14 November 1935 on the platform of upholding collective security, the Baldwin government pressed very strongly for sanctions against Italy for invading Ethiopia. The League Assembly voted for a British motion to impose sanctions on Italy with immediate effect on 18 November 1935.\n\nThe British line that collective security must be upheld with regard to Ethiopia caused considerable tensions between Paris and London, with the French taking the viewpoint that Hitler, not Mussolini, was the real danger to the peace, and that if the price of continuing Stresa Front was accepting the conquest of Ethiopia, it was worth paying. The British historian [[Correlli Barnett]] wrote for Laval: \"...all that really mattered was Nazi Germany. His eyes were on the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland; his thoughts on the Locarno guarantees. To estrange Italy, one of the Locarno powers, over such a question as Abyssinia did not appeal to Laval's Auvergnat peasant mind\".<ref>Correlli Barnett, ''The Collapse of British Power'', London: Methuen, 1972, page 353.</ref> With Paris and London openly at loggerheads over the correct response to Italian invasion of Ethiopia, to say nothing of the very public rift between Rome and London, an opening was seen in Germany for remilitarisation of the Rhineland.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 171\"/> The Anglo-Italian dispute placed the French in an uncomfortable position. On one hand, Britain's repeated refusal to make the \"continental commitment\" increased the value to the French of Italy as the only other nation in Western Europe capable of fielding a large army against Germany.<ref name=\"Shore pages 5\">Shore, p. 8.</ref> But on the other hand, the British economy was far larger than the Italian economy, which thus meant from the long-term French perspective, Britain was a much better ally as Britain had vastly more economic staying power than Italy for what was assumed would be another ''guerre de la longue dur\u00e9e'' (\"war of the long duration\", i.e. a long war against Germany).<ref name=\"Shore pages 5\"/> The American historian Zach Shore wrote that: \"...French leaders found themselves in the awkward position of seeking the military co-operation of two incompatible allies. Since Italy and Britain had clashing interests in the Mediterranean, France could not ally with one without alienating the other\".<ref name=\"Shore pages 5\"/> To avoid a total rupture with Britain, France did not use its veto power as a member of the League Council, and instead voted for the sanctions. But Laval did use the threat of a French veto to water down the sanctions, and to have such items such as oil and coal, which might have crippled Italy, removed from the sanctions list.<ref name=\"Duroselle, p. 109\">Duroselle, p. 109.</ref> Nonetheless, Mussolini felt betrayed by his French friends, and next to Britain, France was the nation that he was most angry with for the sanctions. Despite all of Mussolini's outrage about the sanctions, they were largely ineffective. The United States and Germany-both of which were not members of the League-chose not to abide by the sanctions, and as result, American  and German businesses supplied Italy with all of the goods that League had placed on the sanctions list, making the sanctions more of an annoyance than a problem for the Italians.<ref>Duroselle, p. 114.</ref>\n\nItalian cryptographers had broken the British naval and diplomatic codes in the early 1930s; consequently, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] knew very well that although Britain might threaten war through such moves like reinforcing the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1935, the British had already decided in advance that they would never go to war for Ethiopia.<ref>Smith, p. 261.</ref> Armed with this knowledge, Mussolini felt free to engage in all sorts of wild threats of war against Britain from late 1935 onwards, declaring at one point that he rather see the entire world \"go up in a blaze\" than stop his invasion of Ethiopia.<ref>Smith, p. 262.</ref> Mussolini's frequent threats to destroy the British Empire if the British continued to oppose his Ethiopian war had created the impression in late 1935-early 1936 that Britain and Italy were on the verge of war.\n\nIn late 1935, Neurath started rumours that Germany was considering remilitarising the Rhineland in response to the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|Franco-Soviet pact]] of May 1935, which Neurath insisted was a violation of Locarno that menaced Germany.<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> At the same time, Neurath ordered German diplomats to start drawing up legal briefs justifying remilitarisation of the Rhineland under the grounds that the Franco-Soviet pact violated Locarno.<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> In doing so, Neurath was acting without orders from Hitler, but in the expectation that time was ripe for remilitarisation due to the crisis in Anglo-Italian relations caused by the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]].<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> To resolve the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], the Permanent Undersecretary at the British Foreign Office proposed to the Foreign Secretary [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] what came to be known as the [[Hoare\u2013Laval Pact|Hoare\u2013Laval plan]] under which half of Ethiopia would be given to Italy with the rest nominally independent under the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. Vansittart who was a passionate Francophile and an equally ardent Germanophobe saw Germany as the real danger, and wanted to sacrifice Ethiopia for the sake of maintaining the  Stresa Front.<ref>Doerr, Paul ''British Foreign Policy, 1919\u20131939'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998 page 137</ref><ref>Neville, Peter ''Hitler and Appeasement: The British Attempt to Prevent the Second World War'', London: A&C Black, 2006 page 138</ref> Vansittart had a powerful ally in Hankey, a proponent of ''realpolitik'' who saw the entire idea of imposing sanctions on Italy as so much folly.<ref>Pratt, Larry ''East of Malta, West of Suez: Britain's Mediterranean Crisis, 1936\u20131939'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975 pages 26\u201327</ref> Persuaded of the merits of Vansittart's approach, Hoare travelled to Paris to meet with Laval, who agreed to the plan. However, [[Saint-John Perse|Alexis St. Leger]], the General Secretary at the [[Quai d'Orsay]]-who unusually amongst the generally pro-Italian French officials, happened to have a visceral dislike of Fascist Italy-and he decided to sabotage the Hoare-Laval plan by leaking it to the French press.<ref>Duroselle, p. 111.</ref> St. Leger was by all accounts a \"rather strange\" character who sometimes chose to undercut policy initiatives that he disapproved of.<ref>Cairns, John \"Reflections on France, Britain and the Winter War Problem, 1939\u20131940\" pages 269\u2013285 from ''The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments'' edited by Joel Blatt, Berghahn Books: Providence, Rhode Island, 1998 page 285</ref> In a strange asymmetry, the Francophile Vansittart at the Foreign Office was in favor the French approach that it was worth letting Italy conquer Ethiopia in order to continue the Stresa Front, whereas the Anglophile St. Leger at the Quai d'Orsay was in favor of the British approach of upholding collective security, even at the risk of damaging the Stresa Front. When the news of the Hoare-Laval plan to essentially reward Mussolini reached Britain, it caused such an uproar that Hoare had to resign in disgrace (to be replaced by [[Anthony Eden]]) and the newly elected Baldwin government was almost toppled by a backbenchers' revolt. Baldwin lied to the House of Commons by claiming quite falsely that the cabinet was unaware of the Hoare-Laval plan, and that Hoare was a rogue minister acting on his own. In France, public opinion was just as outraged by the Hoare-Laval plan as British public opinion was. Laval's policy of internal devaluation of forcing deflation on the French economy in order to increase French exports to combat the Great Depression had already made him extremely unpopular, and the Hoare-Laval plan further damaged his reputation. The Chamber of Deputies debated the plan on 27 and 28 December, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] condemned it, with [[L\u00e9on Blum]] telling Laval: \"You have tried to give and to keep. You wanted to have your cake and eat it. You cancelled your words by your deeds and your deeds by your words. You have debased everything by fixing, intrigue and slickness \u2026 Not sensitive enough to the importance of great moral issues, you have reduced everything to the level of your petty methods\".<ref>Geoffrey Warner, ''Pierre Laval and the Eclipse of France'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969), p. 126.</ref>\n\nMussolini for his part rejected the Hoare-Laval plan, saying he wanted to subject all of Ethiopia, not just half. Following the fiasco of the Hoare-Laval plan, the British government resumed its previous policy of imposing sanctions against Italy in a half-hearted  way, which in turn imposed serious strains on relations with both Paris and especially Rome.

on the other hand, if it were ruled that Franco-Soviet pact was compatible with Locarno, Germany would likewise have no excuse for remilitarisation.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 241\"/> Although Neurath indicated several times in press conferences in early 1936 that Germany was planning on using the arbitration clause in Locarno in order to help convince public opinion abroad that the Franco-Soviet pact was a violation of Locarno, the German government never invoked the arbitration clause.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 241\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Neurath received an intelligence report on 10 January 1936 from Gottfried Aschmann, the Chief of the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|''Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt'']]'s Press Division, who during a visit to Paris in early January 1936 had talked to a minor French politician named Jean Montiny who was a close friend of Premier Laval, who had frankly mentioned that France's economic problems had retarded French military modernization and that France would do nothing if Germany remilitarized the Rhineland.<ref>Shore, pp. 5\u20136.</ref> Neurath did not pass on Aschmann's report to Hitler, but he placed a high value upon it.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Shore, p. 6.</ref> Neurath was seeking to improve his position within the Nazi regime;

Originally Hitler had planned to remilitarize the Rhineland in 1937, but chose in early 1936 to move re-militarization forward by a year for several reasons, namely: the ratification by the French National Assembly of the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|Franco-Soviet pact]] of 1935 allowed him to present his coup both at home and abroad as a defensive move against Franco-Soviet \"encirclement\"; the expectation that France would be better armed in 1937; the government in Paris had just fallen and a caretaker government was in charge; economic problems at home required a foreign policy success to restore the regime's popularity; the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]], which had set Britain against Italy, had effectively broken up the [[Stresa Front]]; and apparently because Hitler simply did not feel like waiting an extra year.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref>Weinberg (1970), p. 246.</ref> In his biography of Hitler, the British historian Sir [[Ian Kershaw]] argued that the primary reasons for the decision to remilitarize in 1936 as opposed to 1937 were Hitler's preference for dramatic unilateral coups to obtain what could easily be achieved via quiet talks, and Hitler's need for a foreign policy triumph to distract public attention from the major economic crisis that was gripping Germany in 1935\u201336.<ref>Kershaw (1998), pp. 582\u2013586.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H28122, Werner von Blomberg.jpg|thumb|right| The German War Minister General Werner von Blomberg.]]\n\nDuring a meeting between Prince Bernhard von B\u00fclow, the State Secretary at the ''Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt'' (who is not to be confused with his more famous uncle Chancellor [[Bernhard von B\u00fclow]]) and the French Ambassador [[Andr\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet]] on 13 January 1936, where B\u00fclow handed Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet yet another note protesting against the Franco-Soviet pact, Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet accused B\u00fclow to his face of seeking any excuse, no matter how bizarre, strange or implausible to send troops back into the Rhineland.<ref>Emmerson, p. 39</ref> On 15 January 1936, a top-secret [[NKVD]] report was sent to [[Joseph Stalin]] entitled \"Summary of Military and Political Intelligence on Germany\", which reported \u2013 based on statements from various diplomats in the ''Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt'' \u2013 that Germany was planning on remilitarizing the Rhineland in the near-future.<ref>Shore, p. 10.</ref> The same summary quoted B\u00fclow as saying that if Britain and France made any sort of agreement concerning military co-operation that did not involve Germany: \"We would view this as a violation of Locarno, and if we are not dragged into participating in negotiations, we will not consider ourselves bound by Locarno obligations concerning the preservation of the Rhine demilitarized zone\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Shore, p. 11.</ref> The Soviet report warning of German plans for remilitarization was not passed on to either the British or French governments.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nOn 17 January 1936 [[Benito Mussolini]] \u2013 who was angry about the League of Nations sanctions applied against his country for aggression against [[Ethiopia]] \u2013 told the German Ambassador in Rome, [[Ulrich von Hassell]], that he wanted to see an Austro-German agreement \"which would in practice bring Austria into Germany's wake, so that she could pursue no other foreign policy than one parallel with Germany.

The story that the Germans had orders to withdraw if France moved against them is partially correct, but essentially misleading; the withdrawal was to be a tactical defensive move, not a return to the earlier position.

Those historians who favour an \"intentionist\" interpretation of German foreign policy such as [[Klaus Hildebrand]] and the late [[Andreas Hillgruber]] see the Rhineland remilitarization as only one \"stage\" of Hitler's ''stufenplan'' (stage by stage plan) for world conquest. Those historians who take a \"functionist\" interpretation see the Rhineland remilitarization more as ''ad hoc'', improvised response on the part of Hitler to the economic crisis of 1936 as a cheap and easy way of restoring the regime's popularity. The British Marxist historian [[Timothy Mason]] famously argued that Hitler's foreign policy was driven by domestic needs related to a failing economy, and that it was economic problems at home as opposed to Hitler's \"will\" or \"intentions\" that drove Nazi foreign policy from 1936 onwards, which ultimately degenerated into a \u201cbarbaric variant of social imperialism\", which led to a \"flight into war\" in 1939.<ref>Kallis, p. 165.</ref><ref>Kershaw (2000), pp. 7, 88 & 165\u2013166.</ref>\n\nAs Hildebrand himself has noted, these interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Hildebrand has argued that although Hitler did have a \"programme\" for world domination, the way in which Hitler attempted to execute his \"programme\" was highly improvised and much subject to structural factors both on the international stage and domestically that were often not under Hitler's control.<ref>Kershaw (2000), p. 143.</ref> On February 26 the French National Assembly ratified the Franco-Soviet pact. On February 27, Hitler had lunch with [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] to discuss the planned remilitarization, with Goebbels writing in his diary afterwards: \"Still somewhat too early\".<ref>Kershaw (1998), p. 585.</ref> On February 29 an interview Hitler had on February 21 with the French fascist and journalist [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]] was published in the newspaper ''Paris-Midi''.<ref name=\"Duroselle, p. 122\">Duroselle, p. 122.</ref> During his interview with a clearly admiring de Jouvenel, Hitler professed himself a man of peace who desperately wanted friendship with France and blamed all of the problems in Franco-German relations on the French who for some strange reason were trying to \"encircle\" Germany via the Franco-Soviet pact, despite the evident fact that the Fuhrer was not seeking to threaten France.<ref name=\"Duroselle, p. 122\"/> Hitler's interview with de Jouvenel was intended to influence French public opinion into believing that it was their government that was responsible for the remilitarization. Only on March 1 did Hitler finally make up his mind to proceed.<ref name=\"Kershaw 1998, p. 586\">Kershaw (1998), p. 586.</ref> A further factor in Hitler's decision was that the sanctions committee of the League was due to start discussing possible oil sanctions against Italy on 2 March, something that was likely to lead the diplomats of Europe to be focused on the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] at the expense of everything else.<ref>Weinberg (2013), p. 196.</ref>\n\n===The Wehrmacht marches===\nNot long after dawn on March 7, 1936, nineteen German infantry battalions and a handful of [[Luftwaffe|planes]] entered the Rhineland. By doing so, Germany violated Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles and Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty of Locarno.<ref>Parker (1956), p. 355.</ref> They reached the river Rhine by 11:00&nbsp;a.m. and then three battalions crossed to the west bank of the Rhine. At the same time, Baron von Neurath summoned the Italian ambassador Baron [[Bernardo Attolico]], the British ambassador Sir [[Eric Phipps]] and the French ambassador [[Andr\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet]] to the [[Wilhelmstrasse]] to hand them notes accusing France of violating Locarno by ratifying the Franco-Soviet pact, and announcing that as such Germany had decided to renounce Locarno and remilitarize the Rhineland.<ref name=\"Shirer, p. 291\">Shirer, p. 291.</ref>\n\nWhen German [[reconnaissance]] learned that thousands of French soldiers were congregating on the Franco-German border, General Blomberg begged Hitler to evacuate the German forces. Under Blomberg's influence, Hitler nearly ordered the German troops to withdraw, but was then persuaded by the resolutely calm Neurath to continue with Operation Winter Exercise.<ref name=\"Kallis, p. 113\">Kallis, p. 113.</ref> Following Neurath's advice, Hitler inquired whether the French forces had actually crossed the border and when informed that they had not, he assured Blomberg that Germany would wait until this happened.<ref>Rupert Matthews, ''Hitler: Military Commander'' (Arcturus, 2003), page 116.</ref> In marked contrast to Blomberg who was highly nervous during Operation Winter Exercise, Neurath stayed calm and very much urged Hitler to stay the course.<ref>Heinemann, p. 115.</ref>\n\nThe Rhineland coup is often seen as the moment when Hitler could have been stopped with very little effort; the German forces involved in the move were small, compared to the much larger, and at the time more powerful, French military. The American journalist [[William L. Shirer]] wrote if the French had marched into the Rhineland,\n\n{{quote|... in March 1936 the two Western democracies, were given their last chance to halt, without the risk of a serious war, the rise of a militarized, aggressive, totalitarian Germany and, in fact \u2013 as we have seen Hitler admitting \u2013 bring the Nazi dictator and his regime tumbling down.

Gamelin's analysis was supported by the War Minister, General [[Louis Maurin]] who told the Cabinet that it was inconceivable that France could reverse the German remilitarization without full mobilization.<ref name = \"Young 1978 121\">Young (1978), p. 121.</ref> This was especially the case as the ''[[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]]'' had seriously exaggerated the number of German troops in the Rhineland, sending in a report to the French cabinet estimating that there were 295,000 German troops in the Rhineland.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 588\"/> The ''Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau'' had come up with this estimate by counting all of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and ''[[Landespolizei]]'' formations in the Rhineland as regular troops, and so the French believed only by full mobilization would France have enough troops to expel the alleged 295,000 German troops from the Rhineland.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 588\"/> The real number was actually 3,000 German soldiers.<ref name=\"Kallis, p. 113\"/> The French historian [[Jean-Baptiste Duroselle]] accused Gamelin of distorting what the ''Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau'''s intelligence in his report to the cabinet by converting the SS, SA and ''Landespolizei''  units into fully trained troops to provide a reason for inaction.<ref>Duroselle, p. 125-126.</ref> Neurath's (truthful) statement that Germany had only sent 19 battalions into the Rhineland was dismissed by Gamelin as a ruse to allow Germans to claim that they had not committed a \"flagrant violation\" of Locarno in order to avoid having Locarno invoked against Germany, and that Hitler would never risk a war by sending such a small force into the Rhineland.  \n[[File:Albert Sarraut.png|thumb|left|150| Albert Sarraut, the French Premier at the time of the crisis]]\n\nAt the same time, in late 1935-early 1936 France was gripped by a financial crisis, with the French Treasury informing the government that sufficient cash reserves to maintain the value of the franc as currently pegged by the [[gold standard]] in regard to the U.S. dollar and the British pound no longer existed, and only a huge foreign loan on the money markets of London and New York could prevent the value of the franc from experiencing a disastrous downfall.<ref name=\"Schuker pages 206-221\">Schuker, (1997), p. 237.</ref> Because France was on the verge of elections scheduled for the spring of 1936, devaluation of the franc, which was viewed as abhorrent by large sections of French public opinion, was rejected by the caretaker government of Premier [[Albert Sarraut]] as politically unacceptable.<ref name=\"Schuker pages 206-221\"/> Investor fears of a war with Germany were not conducive to raising the necessary loans to stabilize the franc: the German remilitarization of the Rhineland, by sparking fears of war, worsened the French economic crisis by causing a massive cash flow out of France as worried investors shifted their savings towards what were felt to be safer foreign markets.<ref>Schuker, (1997) pp. 237\u2013238.</ref> The fact that France had defaulted on its World War I debts in 1932 understandably led most investors to conclude if France should be involved in another war with Germany, the French would default again on their debts. On March 18, 1936 Wilfrid Baumgartner, the director of the ''Mouvement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des fonds'' (the French equivalent of a permanent under-secretary) reported to the government that France for all intents and purposes was bankrupt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Schuker, (1997), p. 238.</ref> Only by desperate arm-twisting from the major French financial institutions did Baumgartner manage to obtain enough in the way of short-term loans to prevent France from defaulting on her debts and keeping the value of the franc from sliding too far, in March 1936.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Given the financial crisis, the French government feared that there were insufficient funds to cover the costs of mobilization, and that a full-blown war scare caused by mobilization would only exacerbate the financial crisis.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The American historian Zach Shore wrote that: \"It was not lack of French will to fight in 1936 which permitted Hitler's coup, but rather France's lack of funds, military might, and therefore operational plans to counter German remilitarization.\"<ref>Shore, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nAn additional issue for the French was the state of the [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']].<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. pages 108-109\">Emmerson, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> The ''Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau'' reported that not only had the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' developed considerably more advanced aircraft than what France possessed, but owing to the superior productivity of German industry and the considerably larger size of the German economy the ''Luftwaffe'' had a three to one advantage in fighters.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. pages 108-109\"/> Problems with productivity within the French aircraft industry meant the French air force would have a great deal of trouble replacing their losses in the event of combat with the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. pages 108-109\"/> Thus, it was believed by the French military elite that should war come, then the ''Luftwaffe'' would dominate the skies, and not only attack French troops marching into the Rhineland, but bomb French cities. Yet another problem for the French were the attitudes of the states of the ''cordon sanitaire''.<ref name=Emmerson119>Emmerson, p. 119.</ref> Since 1919, it had accepted that France needed the alliance system in Eastern Europe to provide additional manpower (Germany's population was one and half times the size of France's) and to open up an eastern front against the ''Reich''. Without the states of the ''cordon sanitaire'', it was believed impossible for France to defeat Germany. Only [[Czechoslovakia]] indicated firmly that it would go to war with Germany if France marched into the Rhineland while [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] all indicated that they would only to go to war if German soldiers entered France.<ref name=Emmerson119/> French public opinion and newspapers were very hostile towards the German coup, but few called for war.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. page 116\">Emmerson, p. 116.</ref> The majority of the French newspapers called for League of Nations sanctions to be imposed on the ''Reich'' to inflict such economically crippling costs as to force the German Army out of the Rhineland, and for France to build new and reinforce the existing alliances with the aim of preventing further German challenges to the international status quo.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. page 116\"/> One of the few newspapers to support Germany was the royalist ''L'Action Fran\u00e7aise'' which ran a banner headline reading: \"The Republic Has Assassinated the Peace!\", and went on to say that the German move was justified by the Franco-Soviet pact.<ref>Duroselle, p. 129.</ref> On the other ideological extreme, the Communists issued a statement calling for national unity against \"those who would lead us to carnage\" who were the \"Laval clique\" who were allegedly pushing for a war with Germany because war was supposedly good for capitalism.<ref>Duroselle, p. 128.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mandel 1932.jpg|thumb|Georges Mandel in 1932.

As such, Flandin expected London to apply pressure for \"restraint\" on Paris.<ref name = \"Young 1978 124\">Young (1978), p. 124.</ref> The price of the French \"restraint\" in regards to the Rhineland provocation, an open violation of both the Versailles and Locarno treaties was to be the British \"continental commitment\" unequivocally linking British security to French security, and committing the British to send another large expeditionary force to defend France in the event of a German attack.<ref name = \"Young 1978 124-5\">Young, (1978), pp. 124\u201325.</ref>\n\nDuring his visit to London to consult with the British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] and Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], Flandin carried out what the Canadian historian [[Robert J.

All of the Dominion High Commissioners in London, with [[South Africa]] and [[Canada]] being especially outspoken in this regard, made it quite clear that they would not go to war to restore the demilitarized status of the Rhineland, and that if Britain did so, she would be on her own.<ref name = \"Emmerson 1977 144\" /> The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote that \"...by 13 March that the British Dominions, especially the [[Union of South Africa]] and Canada, would not stand with England if war came. The South African government in particular was busy backing the German position in London and with the other Dominion governments\".<ref>Weinberg (1970), p. 258.</ref> Both the South African Prime Minister General [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] and the Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] had to face domestic constituencies, respectively the [[Afrikaner]]s and the [[French Canadian]]s, many of whom had deep objections to fighting in another \"British war\" against Germany, and as such both Hertzog and Mackenzie King were staunch supporters of appeasement as the best way of avoiding such a war. Neither Hertzog nor Mackenzie King wished to have chose between loyalty to the British Empire vs. dealing with anti-British voters if war came. Ever since the [[Chanak Crisis]] of 1922, Britain had been keenly conscious that Dominion support could no longer be automatically assumed, and remembering the huge role the Dominions had played in the victory of 1918, could not consider fighting another major war without Dominion support.\n\nThe British Foreign Office for its part expressed a great deal of frustration over Hitler's action in unilaterally taking what London had proposed to negotiate.  As a Foreign Office memo complained: \"Hitler has deprived us of the possibility of making to him a concession which might otherwise have been a useful bargaining counter in our hands in the general negotiations with Germany which we had it in contemplation to initiate\".<ref>Medlicott, W.N. ''Britain and Germany'' Athlone Press: London, United Kingdom, 1969 page 24.</ref> The Rhineland crisis completed the estrangement between Eden who believed that Hitler's proposals in his speech of 7 March were the grounds for a \"general settlement\" with Germany, and Vansittart who argued that Hitler was negotiating in bad faith.<ref name=Roi128-129>Roi, pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> Eden and Vansittart had already clashed during the Abyssinia Crisis with Eden supporting sanctions against Italy while Vansittart wanted Italy as an ally against Germany. Vansittart argued that there was no prospect of a \"general settlement\" with Hitler, and the best that could be done was to strengthen ties with the French in order to confront Germany.<ref name=Roi128-130>Roi, pp. 128\u2013130.</ref> The Germanophobe Vansittart had always hated the Germans, and especially disliked the Nazis, whom he saw as a menace to civilization. Vansittart had supported Eden's efforts to defuse the Rhineland crisis as British rearmament had only just began, but being an intense Francophile Vansittart urged the government to use the crisis as a chance to begin forming a military alliance with France against Germany.<ref name=Roi128-130/> By the spring of 1936, Vansittart had become convinced that a \"general settlement\" with Germany was not possible, and Hitler was seeking the conquest of the world. A Foreign Office official [[Owen O'Malley]] suggested that Britain give Germany a \"free hand in the East\" (i.e. accept the German conquest of all Eastern Europe) in exchange for a German promise to accept the status quo in Western Europe.<ref name=Roi130>Roi, p. 130.</ref> Vansittart wrote in response that Hitler was seeking world conquest, and that to allow Germany to conquer all of Eastern Europe would give the ''Reich'' sufficient raw materials to make Germany immune to a British blockade, which would then allow the Germans to overrun Western Europe.<ref name=Roi130/> Vansittart commented that to allow Germany to conquer Eastern Europe would \"lead to the disappearance of liberty and democracy in Europe\".<ref name=Roi130/> By contrast, Eden saw British interests as confined only to Western Europe, and did not share Vansittart's beliefs about what Hitler's ultimate intentions might be.<ref name=Roi130/> Nor did Eden, the rest of the Cabinet or the majority of the British people share Vansittart's conviction that Britain could not afford to be indifferent about Eastern Europe.<ref name=Roi130/>\n\nThough the British had agreed to staff talks with the French as the price of French \"restraint\", many British ministers were unhappy with these talks. The Home Secretary Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] wrote to Eden and Baldwin that staff talks to be held with the French after the Rhineland remilitarization would lead the French to perceive that:\n\n{{quote|\"they have got us so tied that they can safely wait for the breakdown of discussions with Germany. In such circumstances France will be as selfish and as pig-headed as France has always been and the prospect of agreement with Germany will grow dimmer and dimmer\".<ref>Parker (1997), p. 214.</ref>}}\n\nIn response to objections like Simon's, the British ended the staff talks with the French five days after they had begun; Anglo-French staff talks were not to occur again until February 1939 in the aftermath of the [[1939 in Germany#Events|Dutch War Scare]] of January 1939. Besides opposition within the cabinet, the Anglo-French staff talks generated furious criticism from [[David Lloyd George]] and the Beaverbrook and Rothermere press who fumed, as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' put it in a leader, over \"military arrangements that will commit us to some war at the call of others\".<ref>Emmerson, p. 217.</ref> Furthermore, Hitler's Extraordinary Ambassador-at-Large [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] had warned Baldwin and Eden that Germany regarded the Anglo-French staff talks as a mortal threat, and any hope of a \"general settlement\" with Germany would end forever if the talks continued.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 215\u2013216.</ref> However, the rather hazily phrased British statement linking British security to French ''s\u00e9curit\u00e9'' was not disallowed out of the fear that it would irreparably damage Anglo-French relations, which as the British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] observed, meant should France become involved in a war with Germany, there would be at a minimum a strong moral case because of the statement of March 19, 1936 for Britain to fight on the side of France.<ref>Taylor, A.J.P. ''The Origins of the Second World War'', London: Penguin 1961, 1976 p. 148.</ref>\n\nUntil the statement by [[Neville Chamberlain]] on March 31, 1939 offering the \"guarantee\" of Poland, there were no British security commitments in [[Eastern Europe]] beyond the Covenant of the League of Nations. However, because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called ''[[Cordon sanitaire]]'', any German attack on France's Eastern European allies would cause a Franco-German war, and because of the statement of March 19, 1936 a Franco-German war would create strong pressure for British intervention on the side of France. This was all the more the case because unlike the Locarno, where Britain was committed to come to France's defence only in the event of a German attack, the British statement of March 19 as part of an effort to be as vague as possible only stated Britain considered French security to be a vital national need, and did not distinguish between a German attack on France vs. France going to war with Germany in the event of a German attack on a member of the ''cordon sanitarie''. Thus, in this way, the British statement of March 1936 offered not only a direct British commitment to defend France (albeit phrased in exceedingly ambiguous language), but also indirectly to the Eastern European states of the ''cordon sanitaire''. In this way, the British government found itself drawn into the Central European crisis of 1938 because the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance of 1924 meant any German-Czechoslovak war would automatically become a Franco-German war. It was because of this indirect security commitment that the British involved themselves in the Central European crisis of 1938, despite the widespread feeling that the German-Czechoslovak dispute did not concern Britain directly.<ref>Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road To War'', London: Macmillan, 1989 p. 86.</ref>\n\nDuring a House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on 12 March, [[Winston Churchill]], a [[Backbencher|backbench]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, argued for Anglo-French co-ordination under the League of Nations to help France challenge the remilitarization of the Rhineland,<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill: A Life'' (Pimlico, 2000), p. 552.</ref> but this never happened. On 6 April Churchill said of the remilitarization, \"The creation of a line of forts opposite to the French frontier will enable the German troops to be economized on that line and will enable the main forces to swing round through Belgium and Holland\", accurately predicting the [[Battle of France]].{{r|knickerbocker1941}}\n\n===Belgium===\nBelgium concluded an alliance with France in 1920 but after the remilitarization Belgium opted again for neutrality. On 14 October 1936 King [[Leopold III of Belgium]] said in a speech:\n\n{{quote|\"The reoccupation of the Rhineland, by ending the Locarno arrangement, has almost brought us back to our international position before the war...  We must follow a policy exclusively and entirely Belgian. The policy must aim solely at placing us outside the quarrels of our neighbors\".<ref>Charles Cheney Hyde, 'Belgium and Neutrality', ''The American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 31, No. 1. (January 1937), p. 82.</ref>}} Since the leaders of Germany knew well that neither Britain nor France would violate Belgian neutrality, the declaration of Belgian neutrality effectively meant that there was no more danger of an Allied offensive in the West should Germany start another war as the Germans were now busy building the [[Siegfried Line]] along their border with France.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 283-284\">Weinberg (1970), pp. 283\u2013284.</ref> By contrast, just as before 1914, Germany's leaders were all too willing to violate Belgian neutrality.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 283-284\"/> Belgian neutrality meant there could be no staff talks between the Belgian military and those of other nations, which meant that when German forces invaded Belgium in 1940, there were no plans whatsoever for coordinating the movement of Belgian forces with those of France and Britain, which gave the Germans a head-start in their offensive.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 283-284\"/>\n\n===Poland===\n\nPoland, announced that the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]] signed in 1921 would be honoured, although the treaty stipulated that Poland would aid France only if France was invaded.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 255\">Weinberg (1970), p. 255.</ref> At the same time that Colonel Beck was assuring the French ambassador [[L\u00e9on No\u00ebl]] of his commitment to the Franco-Polish alliance and Poland's willingness to stand with France, he was also telling the German ambassador Count [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]] that since Germany was not planning on invading France, the Franco-Polish alliance would not come into effect and Poland would do nothing if France acted.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 255\"/> Beck made a point of stressing to Moltke that Poland had not been allowed to sign Locarno and would not go to war for Locarno, and that as one of the architects of the German-Polish nonaggression pact of 1934 that he was a friend of the ''Reich''.<ref>Emmerson, p. 158.</ref> Beck told Moltke on 9 March that his promise to go to war with France was \"in practice, without effect\" because it only came into effect if German troops entered France.<ref>Emmerson, p. 159.</ref> Weinberg wrote that Beck's \"duplicity\" during the Rhineland crisis of telling the German and French ambassadors different things about what Poland would do \"\u2026 did nothing for Beck's personal reputation and involved enormous risks \u2026\" for Poland.<ref>Weinberg (1970), p. 256.</ref> Poland did agree to mobilize its forces if France did first, however they abstained from voting against the remilitarization in the Council of the League of Nations.\n\n===United States===\nDuring the Rhineland crisis, the [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]] American government took a strict \"hands off\" policy of doing nothing.<ref name=\"Offner pages 413-427\">Offner, p. 415.</ref> During the crisis, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] went off on a \"diplomatically convenient\" extended fishing trip to [[Florida]] to avoid having to answer questions from journalists about what his administration planned to do in response to the crisis in Europe.<ref name=\"Offner pages 413-427\"/> The general sentiment within the U.S. government was expressed by [[Truman Smith (officer)|Truman Smith]], the American military attach\u00e9 in Berlin who wrote that Hitler was seeking only to end French domination in Europe, and was not seeking to destroy France as a power.<ref name=\"Offner pages 413-427\"/> Smith's report concluded: \"Versailles is dead. There may possibly be a German catastrophe and a new Versailles, but it will not be the Versailles which has hung like a dark cloud over Europe since 1920\".<ref name=\"Offner pages 413-427\"/>\n\n===The Soviet Union===\nIn public, the Soviet government took a strong line in denouncing the German coup as a threat to peace.<ref name=\"Hochman, Ji\u0159\u00ed page 104\">Jiri Hochman, ''The Soviet Union and the Failure of Collective Security 1934-1938'' (1984) p. 104.</ref> At the same time the Soviet Foreign Commissar [[Maxim Litvinov]] was giving speeches before the General Assembly of the League of Nations praising collective security and urging the world to oppose Hitler's coup, Soviet diplomats in Berlin were telling their counterparts at the ''Ausw\u00e4rtiges Amt'' of their desire for better commercial relations, which in turn might lead to better political relations.<ref>Hochman, p. 122.</ref> Just after the remilitarization, the Soviet Premier [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] gave an interview with the Swiss newspaper ''[[Le Temps]]'' hinting that the Soviet Union wanted better relations with Germany.<ref name=\"Hochman, Ji\u0159\u00ed page 104\"/> In April 1936, the Soviet Union signed a commercial treaty with Germany providing for expanded German-Soviet trade.<ref name=\"Hochman, Ji\u0159\u00ed page 104\"/> A major problem for the Soviet Union to go to war with Germany was the lack of a common German-Soviet frontier, which would require both the Polish and Romanian governments to grant transit right to the [[Red Army]].<ref>Hochman, p. 57.</ref> Despite their professed willingness to engage with the [[Wehrmacht]], the [[Narkomindel]] tended to negotiate with the Poles and the Romanians over transit rights in the event of a war in such a manner to suggest that they wanted the talks to fail, suggesting that the Soviet hard line against Germany was just posturing.<ref>Hochman, p. 76.</ref> The Romanians and even more so the Poles expressed a great deal of fear that if the Red Army were allowed transit rights to enter their countries on the way to fight Germany that they would fail to leave once the war was over; the Narkomindel failed to provide convincing reassurances on that point.\n\n===League of Nations===\n\nWhen the Council of the League of Nations met in London, the only delegate in favour of [[International sanctions|sanctions]] against Germany was [[Maxim Litvinov]], the representative of the Soviet Union. Though Germany was no longer a member of the League, Ribbentrop was allowed to give a speech before the League Assembly on 19 March where he tried to justify Germany's actions as something imposed on the ''Reich'' by the Franco-Soviet pact, and warned that there would be serious economic consequences for those states who voted to impose sanctions on Germany.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 170\u2013171.</ref> By 1936, a number of Eastern European, Scandinavian  and Latin American countries whose economies were hard-pressed by the [[Great Depression]] had become very dependent upon trade with Germany to keep their economies afloat, which meant for economic reasons alone none of those states wished to offend Germany.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> President [[Federico P\u00e1ez]] of [[Ecuador]] gave a speech in which he declared the idea of sanctions against the ''Reich'' to be \"nonsensical\".<ref name=\"Emmerson, p. 166\">Emmerson, p. 166.</ref> At the time, the British Foreign Office estimated that Britain, France, Romania, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were the only nations in the entire world willing to impose sanctions on Germany.<ref>Emmerson, p. 171.</ref> The Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Dutch, Greek, Swiss, Turkish, Chilean, Estonian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Finnish ambassadors to the League all let it be known that they regarded sanctions on Germany as \"economic suicide\" for their countries.<ref>Emmerson, p. 172.</ref> Mussolini, who was still angry with the League sanctions applied against Italy, made a speech in which he made it clear that he definitely would not be joining any sanctions against Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland.<ref>Kallis, p. 144.</ref> In the fall of 1935, Britain had been able to have the League impose limited sanctions on Italy, but by the later winter of 1936, the idea of imposing sweeping sanctions on Germany\u2014whose economy was four times the size of Italy's, making Germany an \"economic octopus\" whose tentacles were everywhere around the world\u2014was unthinkable for rest of the world.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 171\u2013171.</ref> Moreover, for the sanctions to work, the [[United States]] had to join in. In 1935, the American government had declared that as the U.S. was not a League member, it would not abide by the League sanctions on Italy, which was hardly a hopeful precedent for the idea that U.S. would join in with imposing sanctions on Germany. [[Argentina]] declared that it would vote for sanctions against Germany only if the United States promised to join in.<ref name=\"Emmerson, p. 166\"/> The Council declared, though not unanimously, that the remilitarization constituted a breach of the Treaties of Versailles and Locarno. Hitler was invited to plan a new scheme for European security, and he responded by claiming he had \"no territorial claims in Europe\" and wanted a 25-year [[Non-aggression pact|pact of non-aggression]] with Britain and France. However, when the British Government inquired further into this proposed pact, they did not receive a reply.<ref>Taylor, p. 133.</ref>\n\n==Significance==\nThe remilitarization changed the balance of power decisively in favor of the ''Reich''.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 262\">Weinberg (1970), p. 262.</ref> French credibility in standing against German expansion or aggression was left in doubt. French military strategy was entirely defensive, and it had no intention whatsoever of invading Germany. Instead it planned  to defend the [[Maginot Line]]. Its failure to send even a single unit into Rhineland signaled that strategy to all of Europe. Potential allies in Eastern Europe could no longer trust in an alliance with a France that could not be trusted to deter Germany through threat of an invasion.  without such deterrence, the ally was militarily helpless.  Belgium dropped its defensive alliance with France and relied on neutrality. Paris neglected to expand the Maginot line to cover the Belgian border, which is where Germany invaded in 1940.  Mussolini had previously pushed back against German expansion, now he realized cooperation with France was unpromising, so he began instead to swing in favor of Berlin. All of France's friends were disappointed \u2013 even the Pope told the French ambassador that, \"Had you ordered the immediate advance of 200,000 men into the zone the Germans had occupied, you would have done everyone a very great favor.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Record|title=The Specter of Munich: Reconsidering the Lessons of Appeasing Hitler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV0B4_cBkc0C&pg=PA29|year=2007|publisher=Potomac Books|pages=27\u201329}}</ref>\n\nWith the Rhineland remilitarized, Germany started the construction of the [[Siegfried Line]], which meant that if Germany attacked any of the states in the ''cordon sanitaire'', the ability of France to threaten an invasion was henceforward limited.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 261\">Weinberg (1970), p. 261.</ref> Such was the impact of the remilitarization on the balance of power that the Czechoslovak President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] seriously considered renouncing the alliance with France, and instead seeking a rapprochement with Germany, only abandoning that idea when it became clear that the price of a rapprochement with Hitler would be the effective loss of his country's independence.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 261\"/> Likewise, King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] of Romania concluded that Romania might have to abandon its alliance with France, and instead accept that his country would have to move from being in the French sphere of influence to being in the German sphere of influence.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 261\"/>  When [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William C. Bullitt]], the newly appointed American ambassador to France visited Germany in May 1936, he met with Baron von Neurath. On 18 May 1936, Bullitt reported to President Roosevelt that: <blockquote>\"Von Neurath said that it was the policy of the German government to do nothing active in foreign affairs until \"the Rhineland had been digested\". He explained that he meant that until the German fortifications had been constructed on the French and Belgian borders, the German government would do everything possible to prevent rather than encourage an outbreak by Nazis in Austria and would pursue a quiet line with regard to Czechoslovakia. \"As soon as our fortifications are constructed and the countries of Central Europe realize that France cannot enter German territory at will, all those countries will begin to feel very differently about their foreign policies and a new constellation will develop\", he said\".<ref>Shirer, p. 295.</ref> </blockquote> Between the 15\u201320 June 1936, the chiefs of staff of the [[Little Entente]] of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia met to discuss the changed international situation. They decided to maintain their present plans for a war with Hungary, but concluded that, with the Rhineland now remilitarized, there was little hope of effective French action in the event of a war with Germany.<ref>Weinberg (1970), pp. 261\u2013262.</ref> The meeting ended with the conclusion that there now were only two great powers in Eastern Europe, namely Germany and the Soviet Union, and the best that could be hoped for was to avoid another war that would almost certainly mean the loss of their nations' independence, regardless of who won.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 262\"/>\n\nWeinberg wrote that attitude of the entire German elite and much of the German people, that any new war would only benefit Germany and that ending the Rhineland's demilitarized status could only be a good thing as it opened the door to starting a new war, was an extremely short-sighted, self-destructive and stupid attitude, even from a narrowly German viewpoint.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 239\"/> Weinberg notes that Germany lost its independence in 1945 and lost far more territory under the [[Oder-Neisse line]] imposed in 1945 than it ever had under Versailles, together with millions of dead and the destruction of its cities. Thus, from the German viewpoint, the best thing to do would have been to accept Versailles rather than start a new war\u2014one which ended with Germany being totally crushed, partitioned and occupied.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 239\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*[[Correlli Barnett]].

Under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, German military presence was forbidden from all territory west of the [[Rhine]] and within 50 kilometers east of the Rhine. The 1925 Locarno Treaties reaffirmed the permanent demilitarised status of the Rhineland. In 1929, German foreign minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] negotiated the withdrawal of Allied forces. The last Allied soldiers left the Rhineland in June 1930.\n\nFollowing the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Germany began working towards rearmament and the remilitarisation of the Rhineland. On 7 March 1936, using the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance]] as a pretext, chancellor and ''F\u00fchrer'' [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' to march 3,000 German troops into the Rhineland, to joyous celebrations across Germany. The French and British governments, unwilling to risk war, decided against enforcing the treaties. The remilitarisation changed the balance of power in Europe from France and its allies towards Germany, making it possible for Germany to pursue a policy of aggression in Western Europe that the demilitarised status of the Rhineland had blocked until then.\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|International relations (1919\u20131939)}}\n\n===Versailles and Locarno===\n[[File:Rhineland Versailles treaty English.png|thumb|upright=1.7|Border between France and Germany after WW I (1919-1926).]]\nUnder Articles 42, 43 and 44 of the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]\u2014imposed on Germany by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] after the [[World War I|Great War]]\u2014Germany was \"forbidden to maintain or construct any fortification either on the Left bank of the [[Rhine]] or on the Right bank to the west of a line drawn fifty kilometers to the East of the Rhine\".

However, the German Foreign Minister [[Gustav Stresemann]] announced in 1929 that Germany would not ratify the 1928 [[Young Plan]] for continuing to pay reparations unless the Allies agreed to leave the Rhineland in 1930. The British delegation at the Hague Conference on German [[War reparations|reparations]] in 1929 proposed that reparations paid by Germany be reduced and that British and French forces should evacuate the Rhineland.  The last British soldiers left in late 1929 and the last French soldiers left in June 1930. As long as the French continued to occupy the Rhineland, the Rhineland functioned as a form of \"collateral\" under which the French could respond to any German attempt at overt rearmament by annexing the Rhineland.  Once the last French soldiers left the Rhineland in June 1930, it could no longer play its \"collateral\" role,  thus opening the door for German rearmament. The French decision to build the [[Maginot Line]] in 1929 was a tacit French admission that it was only a matter of time before German rearmament on a massive scale would begin sometime in the 1930s and that the Rhineland was going to be remilitarized sooner or later.<ref>Emmerson, p. 25.</ref><ref>Young (1996), pp. 19\u201321.</ref> Intelligence from the ''[[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]]'' indicated that Germany had been violating Versailles continuously all through the 1920s with the considerable help of the Soviet Union, and with the French troops out of the Rhineland, it could only be expected that Germany would become more open about violating Versailles.<ref>Young (1996), p. 21.</ref> The Maginot Line in its turn lessened the importance of the Rhineland's demilitarised status from a French security viewpoint.\n\n===The foreign policies of the interested powers===\nThe foreign policy of [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] was to maintain an \"equidistant\" stance from all the major powers in order to exercise \"determinant weight\", which by whatever power Italy chose to align with would decisively change the balance of power in Europe, and the price of such an alignment would be support for Italian ambitions in Europe and/or Africa.<ref>Kallis, pp. 129 & 141.</ref>\n\nThe foreign policy goal of the Soviet Union was set forth by [[Joseph Stalin]] in a speech on 19 January 1925 that if another world war broke out between the capitalist states that: \"We will enter the fray at the end, throwing our critical weight onto the scale, a weight that should prove to be decisive\".<ref>Uebersch\u00e4r, Gerd & M\u00fcller, Rolf-Dieter ''[[Hitler's War in the East 1941\u22121945|Hitler's War in the East, 1941\u20131945]]: A Critical Assessment'', Oxford: Berghahn Books, 2002 page 14</ref> To promote this goal which would lead to the global triumph of Communism, the Soviet Union tended to support German efforts to challenge the Versailles system by assisting German secret rearmament, a policy that caused much tension with France. An additional problem in Franco-Soviet relations was the Russian debt issue. Before 1917, the French had been by far the largest investors in Imperial Russia, and the largest buyers of Russian debt, so the decision by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] in 1918 to repudiate all debts and to confiscate all private property, whether it be owned by Russians or by foreigners, had hurt the world of French business and finance quite badly. The question of the Russian debt repudiation and compensation for French businesses affected by Soviet nationalisation policies poisoned Franco-Soviet relations until the early 1930s.\n\nThe centerpiece of interwar French diplomacy had been the ''cordon sanitaire'' in Eastern Europe, which was intended to keep both the Soviet Union and Germany out of Eastern Europe. To this end, France had signed treaties of alliance with Poland in 1921, Czechoslovakia in 1924, Romania in 1926 and Yugoslavia in 1927.<ref name=\"Young pages 17-18\">Young, (1996), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> The ''cordon sanitaire'' states were intended as a collective replacement for Imperial Russia as France's chief eastern ally. The states of the ''cordon sanitaire'' emerged as an area of French political, military, economic and cultural influence.<ref name=\"Young pages 17-18\"/><ref>Duroselle, pp. 172\u2013182.</ref>\n\nAs regards Germany, it had always been assumed by the states of the ''cordon sanitaire'' that if Germany should attack any of them, France would respond by beginning an offensive into western Germany. Long before 1933, German military and diplomatic elites had regarded the Rhineland's demilitarised status as only temporary, and planned to remilitarise the Rhineland at the first favorable diplomatic opportunity.<ref>Kallis, pp. 78\u201379 & 82\u201383.</ref> In December 1918, at a meeting of Germany's leading generals (the German Army functioned as a \"state within the state\"), it had decided that the chief aim would be to rebuild German military power to launch a new world war to win the \"world power status\" that the ''Reich'' had sought, but failed to win in the last war.<ref>M\u00fcller, Klaus J\u00fcrgen ''The Army, Politics and Society in Germany, 1933\u20131945'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1987page 48.</ref> All through the 1920s and the early 1930s, the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' had been developing plans for a war to destroy France and its ally Poland, which necessarily presumed remilitarisation of the Rhineland.<ref>Kallis, p. 79.</ref> Steps were taken by the German government to prepare for the remilitarisation, such as keeping former barracks in a good state of repair, hiding military materials in secret depots, and building customs and fire watch towers that could be easily converted into observation and machine gun posts along the frontier.<ref>Emmerson, p. 28.</ref>\n\nFrom 1919 to 1932, British defense spending was based upon the [[Ten Year Rule]], which assumed that there was to be no major war for the next ten years, a policy that led to the British military being cut to the bone.<ref>Bond, pp. 197\u2013198.</ref> Amongst British decision-makers, the idea of the \"continental commitment\" of sending a large army to fight on the European mainland against Germany was never explicitly rejected, but was not favored.<ref>Bond, p. 198.</ref> The memory of the heavy losses taken in the Great War had led many to see the \"continental commitment\" of 1914 as a serious mistake. For most of the inter-war period, the British were extremely reluctant to make security commitments in Eastern Europe, regarding the region as too unstable and likely to embroil Britain in unwanted wars. At most, Britain was willing to make only limited security commitments in Western Europe, and even then tried to avoid the \"continental commitment\" as much as possible. In 1925, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir [[Austen Chamberlain]] had famously stated in public at the Locarno conference that the [[Polish Corridor]] was \"not worth the bones of a single British grenadier\".<ref name=\"Rothstein\">{{in lang|en}} {{cite book | author = Andrew Rothstein | title =The Soldiers\u2019 Strikes of 1919 | year =1980 | editor = | pages =35 | publisher =Macmillan Publishing | location =Basingstoke | isbn =0-333-27693-0 | url= https://books.google.com/?id=wDQaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Soldiers'+Strikes&q= }}</ref><ref name= \"Harris\">[[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] used the same phrase in 1945 and the historian Frederick Taylor on p. 432 in ''Dresden: Tuesday, February 13, 1945'' mentions that it was a deliberate echo of a famous sentence used by [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]]: \"The whole of the Balkans is not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.\"</ref> As such, Chamberlain declared that Britain would not guarantee the German-Polish border on the grounds that the Polish Corridor should be returned to Germany. That the British did not take even their Locarno commitments seriously could be seen in Whitehall's prohibition of the British military chiefs' holding staff talks with German, French and Italian militaries about what to do if a \"flagrant violation\" of Locarno occurred.<ref>Emmerson, p. 24.</ref> In general, for most of the 1920s\u201330s, British foreign policy was based upon appeasement, under which the international system established by Versailles would be revised in Germany's favor, within limits in order to win German acceptance of that international order, and thereby ensure the peace. One of the main British aims at Locarno was to create a situation where Germany could pursue territorial revisionism in Eastern Europe peacefully.<ref name=\"Stephen Schuker pages 38-56\">Schuker (1999), pp. 48\u201349.</ref> The British viewpoint was that if Franco-German relations improved, France would gradually abandon the ''cordon sanitaire''.<ref name=\"Stephen Schuker pages 38-56\"/>\n\nOnce France had abandoned its allies in Eastern Europe as the price of better relations with the ''Reich'', the Poles and Czechoslovaks would be forced to adjust to German demands, and would peacefully hand over the territories claimed by Germany such as the [[Sudetenland]], the [[Polish Corridor]] and the [[Free City of Danzig]] (modern [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland).<ref name=\"Stephen Schuker pages 38-56\"/> British policy-makers tended to exaggerate French power with the normally Francophile Sir [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert \"Van\" Vansittart]], the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office writing in 1931 that Britain was faced with an \"unbearable\" French domination of Europe, and what was needed was a revival of German power to counterbalance French power.<ref>Bennett, Edward ''German Rearmament and the West, 1932\u20131933'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2015 page 109</ref> French economic and demographic weaknesses in the face of Germany's strengths such as the ''Reich'''s  far larger population and economy together with the fact that much of France had been devastated by World War I while Germany had escaped mostly undamaged were little appreciated in Whitehall.\n\n==The European Situation, 1933\u201336==\n\n===The diplomatic maneuvers=== \nIn March 1933, the German Defence Minister, General [[Werner von Blomberg]] had plans drawn up for remilitarization.<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 82\">Kallis, p. 82.</ref> Blomberg starting in the fall of 1933 had a number of the para-military ''Landspolizei'' units in the Rhineland given secret military training and equipped with military weapons in order to prepare for remilitarization.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> General [[Ludwig Beck]]'s memo of March 1935 on the need for Germany to secure ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) in Eastern Europe had accepted that remilitarization should take place as soon it was diplomatically possible.<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 82\"/> In general, it was believed by German military, diplomatic and political elites that it would not be possible to remiltarize before 1937.<ref>Kallis, p. 83.</ref>\n\nThe change of regime in Germany in 1933 did cause alarm in London, but there was considerable uncertainty about what Hitler's long term intentions were. This uncertainty over what Hitler's ultimate intentions in foreign policy were was to color much of British policy towards Germany until 1939. British decision-makers could never quite decide if Hitler was merely seeking the acceptable goal (to the British) of revising Versailles or the unacceptable goal of seeking to dominate Europe. British policy towards Germany was a dual-track policy of seeking a \"general settlement\" with the ''Reich'' in which the \"legitimate\" German complaints about the Versailles treaty would be addressed in Germany's favor while at the same time pursuing rearmament to negotiate with Germany from a position of strength, to deter Hitler from choosing war as an option, and in a worst-case scenario ensure that Britain was prepared if Hitler really did want to conquer Europe. In February 1934, a secret report by the Defence Requirements Committee identified Germany as the \"ultimate potential enemy\", which British rearmament was to be directed against.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Keith Neilson|author2=Greg Kennedy|author3=David French|title=The British Way in Warfare: Power and the International System, 1856\u20131956 : Essays in Honour of David French|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtFHowpztiYC&pg=PA120|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate |page=120}}</ref> Although the possibility of German bombing attacks against British cities increased the importance of having a friendly power on the other side of the English Channel, many British decision-makers were cool, if not downright hostile, towards the idea of the \"continental commitment\".<ref>Bond, pp. 198\u2013199.</ref> When British rearmament began in 1934, the Army received the lowest priority in terms of funding after the air force and the navy, in part to rule out the \"continental commitment\" as an option.<ref>Bond, p. 199.</ref> Increasingly, decision-makers came to favor the idea of \"limited liability\", under which if the \"continental commitment\" were to be made, Britain should only send the smallest possible expeditionary force to Europe, and reserve its main efforts towards the war in the air and on the sea.<ref>Bond, pp. 200\u2013201.</ref> Britain's refusal to make the \"continental commitment\" on the same scale as World War I caused tensions with the French, who believed that it would be impossible to defeat Germany without another large-scale \"continental commitment\", and deeply disliked the idea that they should do the bulk of the fighting on the land.\n\nStarting in 1934, the French Foreign Minister [[Louis Barthou]] decided to put an end to any potential German aggression by building a network of alliances intended to encircle Germany, and made overtures to the Soviet Union and Italy. Until 1933, the Soviet Union had supported German efforts to challenge the Versailles system, but the strident anti-communism of the National Socialist regime together with its claim for ''[[Lebensraum]]'' led the Soviets change positions on the question of maintaining the Versailles system. In September 1933, the Soviet Union ended its secret support for German rearmament, which had started in 1921. Under the guise of collective security, the Soviet Foreign Commissar [[Maxim Litvinov]] started to praise the Versailles system, which until then the Soviet leaders had denounced as a capitalist plot to \"enslave\" Germany.\n\nStarting in the 1920s, [[Benito Mussolini]] had subsidized the right-wing ''[[Heimwehr]]'' (\"Home Defense\") movement in Austria, and after the ultra-conservative Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] had seized dictatorial power in March 1933, Austria had fallen within the Italian sphere of influence.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\">Sullivan, Barry \"More than meets the eye: the Ethiopian War and the Origins of the Second World War\" pages 178\u2013203 from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered A.J.P. Taylor and the Historians'', London: Routledge, 1999 page 179</ref> The terrorist campaign mounted by Austrian Nazis with the open support of Germany against the Dollfuss regime with the aim of overthrowing Dollfuss to achieve an ''[[Anschluss]]'' caused considerable tensions between Rome and Berlin.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> Mussolini had warned Hitler several times that Austria was within the Italian sphere of influence, not the German, and to cease trying to overthrow his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Dollfuss. On 25 July 1934 there had occurred the [[July Putsch]] in Vienna that saw Dollfuss assassinated by the Austrian SS, and an announcement by the Austrian Nazis that the ''Anschluss'' was at hand. At the same time that Austrian Nazis attempted to seize power all over Austria, the SS Austrian Legion based in Bavaria began to attack frontier posts along the German-Austrian border in what looked like the beginning of an invasion. In response, Mussolini had mobilized the Italian Army, concentrated several divisions at the [[Brenner Pass]], and warned Hitler that Italy would go to war with Germany if he tried to follow up the ''putsch'' by invading Austria.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> The Austrian-born Hitler, although deeply offended by Mussolini's blunt assertions that his birthplace was within the sphere of influence of any power other than Germany, nevertheless realized he was in no position to do anything except to beat a humiliating retreat. To his disgust, the German Fuhrer had to disallow the ''Putsch'' he had ordered and not follow it up by invading Austria while the Austrian government crushed the ''Putsch'' by the Austrian Nazis.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/>\n\nAfter Barthou was killed on 9 October 1934, his work in trying to build anti-German alliances with the Soviet Union and Italy was continued by [[Pierre Laval]]. On 7 January 1935 during a summit in Rome, Laval essentially told Mussolini that he had a [[Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935|\"free hand\"]] in the Horn of Africa, and France would not oppose an Italian invasion of Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> On 14 April 1935, Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] of Great Britain, Premier [[Pierre Laval]] of France and Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]] met in [[Stresa]] to form the [[Stresa Front]] to oppose any further German violations of Versailles following the German statement in March 1935 that Germany would no longer abide by Parts V or VI of the Treaty of Versailles.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> In the spring of 1935, joint staff talks had begun between France and Italy with the aim of forming an anti-German military alliance.<ref name=\"Sullivan pages 178-203\"/> On 2 May 1935, Laval travelled to Moscow, where he a signed a treaty of alliance with Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. page 33\">Emmerson, p. 33.</ref> At once, the German government began a violent press campaign against the Franco-Soviet pact, claiming it was a violation of Locarno that was an immense danger for the ''Reich''.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. page 33\"/>\n\nIn his \"peace speech\" of May 21, 1935, [[Adolf Hitler]] stated \"In particular, they [the Germans] will uphold and fulfill all obligations arising out of the Locarno Treaty, so long as the other parties are on their side ready to stand by that pact\".<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\">Heinemann, p. 112.</ref> That line in Hitler's speech was written by his foreign minister, Baron [[Konstantin von Neurath]] who wished to reassure foreign leaders who felt threatened by Germany's denunciation in March 1935 of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles, which had disarmed Germany.<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> At the same time, Neurath wanted to provide an opening for the eventual remilitarisation of the Rhineland, hence the conditional hedging of the promise to obey Locarno only as long as other powers did.<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> Hitler always took the line that Germany did not consider itself bound by the ''Diktat'' of Versailles, but that Germany would respect any treaty that it willingly signed such as Locarno, under which Germany had promised to keep the Rhineland demilitarized forever; hence Hitler always promised during his \"peace speeches\" to obey Locarno as opposed to Versailles.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 188\">Weinberg (2013), p. 188.</ref>\n\n===The Abyssinia Crisis===\n{{main|Abyssinia Crisis}}\nOn 7 June 1935, MacDonald resigned as British Prime Minister due to ailing health and was replaced by [[Stanley Baldwin]] of the Conservative Party; the leadership change did not affect British foreign policy in any meaningful way. On October 3, 1935, [[Italy]] invaded [[Ethiopia]], and thus began the [[Abyssinia Crisis]]. Under strong pressure from a  British public opinion, which was very much in favor of [[collective security]], the British government took the lead in pressing the [[League of Nations]] for sanctions against Italy.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 171\">Weinberg (2013), p. 171.</ref> The decision of the British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] to take a strong line in favor of collective security was mostly motivated by domestic politics.  Having just won an [[1935 United Kingdom general election|election]] on 14 November 1935 on the platform of upholding collective security, the Baldwin government pressed very strongly for sanctions against Italy for invading Ethiopia. The League Assembly voted for a British motion to impose sanctions on Italy with immediate effect on 18 November 1935.\n\nThe British line that collective security must be upheld with regard to Ethiopia caused considerable tensions between Paris and London, with the French taking the viewpoint that Hitler, not Mussolini, was the real danger to the peace, and that if the price of continuing Stresa Front was accepting the conquest of Ethiopia, it was worth paying. The British historian [[Correlli Barnett]] wrote for Laval: \"...all that really mattered was Nazi Germany. His eyes were on the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland; his thoughts on the Locarno guarantees. To estrange Italy, one of the Locarno powers, over such a question as Abyssinia did not appeal to Laval's Auvergnat peasant mind\".<ref>Correlli Barnett, ''The Collapse of British Power'', London: Methuen, 1972, page 353.</ref> With Paris and London openly at loggerheads over the correct response to Italian invasion of Ethiopia, to say nothing of the very public rift between Rome and London, an opening was seen in Germany for remilitarisation of the Rhineland.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 171\"/> The Anglo-Italian dispute placed the French in an uncomfortable position. On one hand, Britain's repeated refusal to make the \"continental commitment\" increased the value to the French of Italy as the only other nation in Western Europe capable of fielding a large army against Germany.<ref name=\"Shore pages 5\">Shore, p. 8.</ref> But on the other hand, the British economy was far larger than the Italian economy, which thus meant from the long-term French perspective, Britain was a much better ally as Britain had vastly more economic staying power than Italy for what was assumed would be another ''guerre de la longue dur\u00e9e'' (\"war of the long duration\", i.e. a long war against Germany).<ref name=\"Shore pages 5\"/> The American historian Zach Shore wrote that: \"...French leaders found themselves in the awkward position of seeking the military co-operation of two incompatible allies. Since Italy and Britain had clashing interests in the Mediterranean, France could not ally with one without alienating the other\".<ref name=\"Shore pages 5\"/> To avoid a total rupture with Britain, France did not use its veto power as a member of the League Council, and instead voted for the sanctions. But Laval did use the threat of a French veto to water down the sanctions, and to have such items such as oil and coal, which might have crippled Italy, removed from the sanctions list.<ref name=\"Duroselle, p. 109\">Duroselle, p. 109.</ref> Nonetheless, Mussolini felt betrayed by his French friends, and next to Britain, France was the nation that he was most angry with for the sanctions. Despite all of Mussolini's outrage about the sanctions, they were largely ineffective. The United States and Germany-both of which were not members of the League-chose not to abide by the sanctions, and as result, American  and German businesses supplied Italy with all of the goods that League had placed on the sanctions list, making the sanctions more of an annoyance than a problem for the Italians.<ref>Duroselle, p. 114.</ref>\n\nItalian cryptographers had broken the British naval and diplomatic codes in the early 1930s; consequently, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] knew very well that although Britain might threaten war through such moves like reinforcing the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1935, the British had already decided in advance that they would never go to war for Ethiopia.<ref>Smith, p. 261.</ref> Armed with this knowledge, Mussolini felt free to engage in all sorts of wild threats of war against Britain from late 1935 onwards, declaring at one point that he rather see the entire world \"go up in a blaze\" than stop his invasion of Ethiopia.<ref>Smith, p. 262.</ref> Mussolini's frequent threats to destroy the British Empire if the British continued to oppose his Ethiopian war had created the impression in late 1935-early 1936 that Britain and Italy were on the verge of war.\n\nIn late 1935, Neurath started rumours that Germany was considering remilitarising the Rhineland in response to the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|Franco-Soviet pact]] of May 1935, which Neurath insisted was a violation of Locarno that menaced Germany.<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> At the same time, Neurath ordered German diplomats to start drawing up legal briefs justifying remilitarisation of the Rhineland under the grounds that the Franco-Soviet pact violated Locarno.<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> In doing so, Neurath was acting without orders from Hitler, but in the expectation that time was ripe for remilitarisation due to the crisis in Anglo-Italian relations caused by the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Italo-Ethiopian War]].<ref name=\"Heinemann, John page 112\"/> To resolve the [[Abyssinia Crisis]], [[Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart|Robert Vansittart]], the Permanent Undersecretary at the British Foreign Office proposed to the Foreign Secretary [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] what came to be known as the [[Hoare\u2013Laval Pact|Hoare\u2013Laval plan]] under which half of Ethiopia would be given to Italy with the rest nominally independent under the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. Vansittart who was a passionate Francophile and an equally ardent Germanophobe saw Germany as the real danger, and wanted to sacrifice Ethiopia for the sake of maintaining the  Stresa Front.<ref>Doerr, Paul ''British Foreign Policy, 1919\u20131939'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1998 page 137</ref><ref>Neville, Peter ''Hitler and Appeasement: The British Attempt to Prevent the Second World War'', London: A&C Black, 2006 page 138</ref> Vansittart had a powerful ally in Hankey, a proponent of ''realpolitik'' who saw the entire idea of imposing sanctions on Italy as so much folly.<ref>Pratt, Larry ''East of Malta, West of Suez: Britain's Mediterranean Crisis, 1936\u20131939'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975 pages 26\u201327</ref> Persuaded of the merits of Vansittart's approach, Hoare travelled to Paris to meet with Laval, who agreed to the plan. However, [[Saint-John Perse|Alexis St. Leger]], the General Secretary at the [[Quai d'Orsay]]-who unusually amongst the generally pro-Italian French officials, happened to have a visceral dislike of Fascist Italy-and he decided to sabotage the Hoare-Laval plan by leaking it to the French press.<ref>Duroselle, p. 111.</ref> St. Leger was by all accounts a \"rather strange\" character who sometimes chose to undercut policy initiatives that he disapproved of.<ref>Cairns, John \"Reflections on France, Britain and the Winter War Problem, 1939\u20131940\" pages 269\u2013285 from ''The French Defeat of 1940 Reassessments'' edited by Joel Blatt, Berghahn Books: Providence, Rhode Island, 1998 page 285</ref> In a strange asymmetry, the Francophile Vansittart at the Foreign Office was in favor the French approach that it was worth letting Italy conquer Ethiopia in order to continue the Stresa Front, whereas the Anglophile St. Leger at the Quai d'Orsay was in favor of the British approach of upholding collective security, even at the risk of damaging the Stresa Front. When the news of the Hoare-Laval plan to essentially reward Mussolini reached Britain, it caused such an uproar that Hoare had to resign in disgrace (to be replaced by [[Anthony Eden]]) and the newly elected Baldwin government was almost toppled by a backbenchers' revolt. Baldwin lied to the House of Commons by claiming quite falsely that the cabinet was unaware of the Hoare-Laval plan, and that Hoare was a rogue minister acting on his own. In France, public opinion was just as outraged by the Hoare-Laval plan as British public opinion was. Laval's policy of internal devaluation of forcing deflation on the French economy in order to increase French exports to combat the Great Depression had already made him extremely unpopular, and the Hoare-Laval plan further damaged his reputation. The Chamber of Deputies debated the plan on 27 and 28 December, the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] condemned it, with [[L\u00e9on Blum]] telling Laval: \"You have tried to give and to keep. You wanted to have your cake and eat it. You cancelled your words by your deeds and your deeds by your words.

Following the fiasco of the Hoare-Laval plan, the British government resumed its previous policy of imposing sanctions against Italy in a half-hearted  way, which in turn imposed serious strains on relations with both Paris and especially Rome.

Those historians who favour an \"intentionist\" interpretation of German foreign policy such as [[Klaus Hildebrand]] and the late [[Andreas Hillgruber]] see the Rhineland remilitarization as only one \"stage\" of Hitler's ''stufenplan'' (stage by stage plan) for world conquest. Those historians who take a \"functionist\" interpretation see the Rhineland remilitarization more as ''ad hoc'', improvised response on the part of Hitler to the economic crisis of 1936 as a cheap and easy way of restoring the regime's popularity. The British Marxist historian [[Timothy Mason]] famously argued that Hitler's foreign policy was driven by domestic needs related to a failing economy, and that it was economic problems at home as opposed to Hitler's \"will\" or \"intentions\" that drove Nazi foreign policy from 1936 onwards, which ultimately degenerated into a \u201cbarbaric variant of social imperialism\", which led to a \"flight into war\" in 1939.<ref>Kallis, p. 165.</ref><ref>Kershaw (2000), pp. 7, 88 & 165\u2013166.</ref>\n\nAs Hildebrand himself has noted, these interpretations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Hildebrand has argued that although Hitler did have a \"programme\" for world domination, the way in which Hitler attempted to execute his \"programme\" was highly improvised and much subject to structural factors both on the international stage and domestically that were often not under Hitler's control.<ref>Kershaw (2000), p. 143.</ref> On February 26 the French National Assembly ratified the Franco-Soviet pact. On February 27, Hitler had lunch with [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and [[Joseph Goebbels]] to discuss the planned remilitarization, with Goebbels writing in his diary afterwards: \"Still somewhat too early\".<ref>Kershaw (1998), p. 585.</ref> On February 29 an interview Hitler had on February 21 with the French fascist and journalist [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]] was published in the newspaper ''Paris-Midi''.<ref name=\"Duroselle, p. 122\">Duroselle, p. 122.</ref> During his interview with a clearly admiring de Jouvenel, Hitler professed himself a man of peace who desperately wanted friendship with France and blamed all of the problems in Franco-German relations on the French who for some strange reason were trying to \"encircle\" Germany via the Franco-Soviet pact, despite the evident fact that the Fuhrer was not seeking to threaten France.<ref name=\"Duroselle, p. 122\"/> Hitler's interview with de Jouvenel was intended to influence French public opinion into believing that it was their government that was responsible for the remilitarization.

Schuker who have examined the relevant French primary sources have rejected Shirer's claims, finding that a major paralyzing factor on French policy was the economic situation.<ref>Schuker (1997), pp. 223 & 236\u201337.</ref> France's top military official, General [[Maurice Gamelin]], informed the French government that the only way to remove the Germans from the Rhineland was to mobilize the French Army, which would not only be unpopular, it would also cost the French treasury 30 million francs per day.<ref>Schuker, (1997), p. 235.</ref> Gamelin assumed a worst-case scenario in which a French move into the Rhineland would spark an all-out Franco-German war, a case which required full mobilization. Gamelin's analysis was supported by the War Minister, General [[Louis Maurin]] who told the Cabinet that it was inconceivable that France could reverse the German remilitarization without full mobilization.<ref name = \"Young 1978 121\">Young (1978), p. 121.</ref> This was especially the case as the ''[[Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau]]'' had seriously exaggerated the number of German troops in the Rhineland, sending in a report to the French cabinet estimating that there were 295,000 German troops in the Rhineland.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 588\"/> The ''Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau'' had come up with this estimate by counting all of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and ''[[Landespolizei]]'' formations in the Rhineland as regular troops, and so the French believed only by full mobilization would France have enough troops to expel the alleged 295,000 German troops from the Rhineland.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 588\"/> The real number was actually 3,000 German soldiers.<ref name=\"Kallis, p. 113\"/> The French historian [[Jean-Baptiste Duroselle]] accused Gamelin of distorting what the ''Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau'''s intelligence in his report to the cabinet by converting the SS, SA and ''Landespolizei''  units into fully trained troops to provide a reason for inaction.<ref>Duroselle, p. 125-126.</ref> Neurath's (truthful) statement that Germany had only sent 19 battalions into the Rhineland was dismissed by Gamelin as a ruse to allow Germans to claim that they had not committed a \"flagrant violation\" of Locarno in order to avoid having Locarno invoked against Germany, and that Hitler would never risk a war by sending such a small force into the Rhineland.  \n[[File:Albert Sarraut.png|thumb|left|150| Albert Sarraut, the French Premier at the time of the crisis]]\n\nAt the same time, in late 1935-early 1936 France was gripped by a financial crisis, with the French Treasury informing the government that sufficient cash reserves to maintain the value of the franc as currently pegged by the [[gold standard]] in regard to the U.S. dollar and the British pound no longer existed, and only a huge foreign loan on the money markets of London and New York could prevent the value of the franc from experiencing a disastrous downfall.<ref name=\"Schuker pages 206-221\">Schuker, (1997), p. 237.</ref> Because France was on the verge of elections scheduled for the spring of 1936, devaluation of the franc, which was viewed as abhorrent by large sections of French public opinion, was rejected by the caretaker government of Premier [[Albert Sarraut]] as politically unacceptable.<ref name=\"Schuker pages 206-221\"/> Investor fears of a war with Germany were not conducive to raising the necessary loans to stabilize the franc: the German remilitarization of the Rhineland, by sparking fears of war, worsened the French economic crisis by causing a massive cash flow out of France as worried investors shifted their savings towards what were felt to be safer foreign markets.<ref>Schuker, (1997) pp. 237\u2013238.</ref> The fact that France had defaulted on its World War I debts in 1932 understandably led most investors to conclude if France should be involved in another war with Germany, the French would default again on their debts. On March 18, 1936 Wilfrid Baumgartner, the director of the ''Mouvement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des fonds'' (the French equivalent of a permanent under-secretary) reported to the government that France for all intents and purposes was bankrupt.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Schuker, (1997), p. 238.</ref> Only by desperate arm-twisting from the major French financial institutions did Baumgartner manage to obtain enough in the way of short-term loans to prevent France from defaulting on her debts and keeping the value of the franc from sliding too far, in March 1936.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Given the financial crisis, the French government feared that there were insufficient funds to cover the costs of mobilization, and that a full-blown war scare caused by mobilization would only exacerbate the financial crisis.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The American historian Zach Shore wrote that: \"It was not lack of French will to fight in 1936 which permitted Hitler's coup, but rather France's lack of funds, military might, and therefore operational plans to counter German remilitarization.\"<ref>Shore, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nAn additional issue for the French was the state of the [[French Air Force|''Arm\u00e9e de l'Air'']].<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. pages 108-109\">Emmerson, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref> The ''Deuxi\u00e8me Bureau'' reported that not only had the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' developed considerably more advanced aircraft than what France possessed, but owing to the superior productivity of German industry and the considerably larger size of the German economy the ''Luftwaffe'' had a three to one advantage in fighters.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. pages 108-109\"/> Problems with productivity within the French aircraft industry meant the French air force would have a great deal of trouble replacing their losses in the event of combat with the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. pages 108-109\"/> Thus, it was believed by the French military elite that should war come, then the ''Luftwaffe'' would dominate the skies, and not only attack French troops marching into the Rhineland, but bomb French cities. Yet another problem for the French were the attitudes of the states of the ''cordon sanitaire''.<ref name=Emmerson119>Emmerson, p. 119.</ref> Since 1919, it had accepted that France needed the alliance system in Eastern Europe to provide additional manpower (Germany's population was one and half times the size of France's) and to open up an eastern front against the ''Reich''. Without the states of the ''cordon sanitaire'', it was believed impossible for France to defeat Germany. Only [[Czechoslovakia]] indicated firmly that it would go to war with Germany if France marched into the Rhineland while [[Poland]], [[Romania]] and [[Yugoslavia]] all indicated that they would only to go to war if German soldiers entered France.<ref name=Emmerson119/> French public opinion and newspapers were very hostile towards the German coup, but few called for war.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. page 116\">Emmerson, p. 116.</ref> The majority of the French newspapers called for League of Nations sanctions to be imposed on the ''Reich'' to inflict such economically crippling costs as to force the German Army out of the Rhineland, and for France to build new and reinforce the existing alliances with the aim of preventing further German challenges to the international status quo.<ref name=\"Emmerson, J.T. page 116\"/> One of the few newspapers to support Germany was the royalist ''L'Action Fran\u00e7aise'' which ran a banner headline reading: \"The Republic Has Assassinated the Peace!\", and went on to say that the German move was justified by the Franco-Soviet pact.<ref>Duroselle, p. 129.</ref> On the other ideological extreme, the Communists issued a statement calling for national unity against \"those who would lead us to carnage\" who were the \"Laval clique\" who were allegedly pushing for a war with Germany because war was supposedly good for capitalism.<ref>Duroselle, p. 128.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mandel 1932.jpg|thumb|Georges Mandel in 1932.

As such, Flandin expected London to apply pressure for \"restraint\" on Paris.<ref name = \"Young 1978 124\">Young (1978), p. 124.</ref> The price of the French \"restraint\" in regards to the Rhineland provocation, an open violation of both the Versailles and Locarno treaties was to be the British \"continental commitment\" unequivocally linking British security to French security, and committing the British to send another large expeditionary force to defend France in the event of a German attack.<ref name = \"Young 1978 124-5\">Young, (1978), pp. 124\u201325.</ref>\n\nDuring his visit to London to consult with the British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] and Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]], Flandin carried out what the Canadian historian [[Robert J.

As long as the Rhineland was demilitarized, the French could easily re-occupy the area and threaten the economically important [[Ruhr Area|Ruhr industrial area]] which was liable to French invasion if France believed the situation in Germany ever became a threat.<ref>Correlli Barnett, ''The Collapse of British Power'' (Pan, 2002), p. 336.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Appeasement|l1=Policy of appeasement}}\n\nThe reaction in Britain was mixed, but they did not generally regard the remilitarization as harmful.  [[Philip Kerr, 11th Marquess of Lothian|Lord Lothian]] famously said it was no more than the Germans walking into their own backyard. [[George Bernard Shaw]] similarly claimed it was no different than if Britain had reoccupied [[Portsmouth]]. In his diary entry for 23 March, [[Harold Nicolson]] MP noted that \"the feeling in the House [of Commons] is terribly pro-German, which means afraid of war\".<ref>Harold Nicolson, ''The Harold Nicolson Diaries: 1919\u20131964'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2004), p. 139.</ref> During the Rhineland crisis of 1936, no public meetings or rallies were held anywhere in protest at the remilitarization of the Rhineland, and instead there were several \"peace\" rallies where it was demanded that Britain not use war to resolve the crisis.<ref name = \"Emmerson 1977 144\">Emmerson, p. 144.</ref> Ever since the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] had published his best-selling  book ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'' in 1919\u2014in which Keynes depicted Versailles as an unbearably harsh ''[[Carthaginian peace]]'' imposed by the vindictive Allies\u2014an increasingly large segment of British public opinion had become convinced that the Treaty of Versailles was deeply \"unjust\" to Germany.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 259\">Weinberg (1970), p. 259.</ref> By 1936, when German troops marched back into the Rhineland, the majority of British people believed that Hitler was right to violate the \"unjust\" Versailles treaty, and it would be morally wrong for Britain to go to war to uphold the \"unjust\" Treaty of Versailles.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 259\"/> The British War Secretary [[Duff Cooper|Alfred Duff Cooper]] told the German Ambassador [[Leopold von Hoesch]] on 8 March: \"through the British people were prepared to fight for France in the event of a German incursion into French territory, they would not resort to arms on account of the recent occupation of the Rhineland.

All of the Dominion High Commissioners in London, with [[South Africa]] and [[Canada]] being especially outspoken in this regard, made it quite clear that they would not go to war to restore the demilitarized status of the Rhineland, and that if Britain did so, she would be on her own.<ref name = \"Emmerson 1977 144\" /> The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote that \"...by 13 March that the British Dominions, especially the [[Union of South Africa]] and Canada, would not stand with England if war came. The South African government in particular was busy backing the German position in London and with the other Dominion governments\".<ref>Weinberg (1970), p. 258.</ref> Both the South African Prime Minister General [[J. B. M. Hertzog]] and the Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] had to face domestic constituencies, respectively the [[Afrikaner]]s and the [[French Canadian]]s, many of whom had deep objections to fighting in another \"British war\" against Germany, and as such both Hertzog and Mackenzie King were staunch supporters of appeasement as the best way of avoiding such a war. Neither Hertzog nor Mackenzie King wished to have chose between loyalty to the British Empire vs. dealing with anti-British voters if war came. Ever since the [[Chanak Crisis]] of 1922, Britain had been keenly conscious that Dominion support could no longer be automatically assumed, and remembering the huge role the Dominions had played in the victory of 1918, could not consider fighting another major war without Dominion support.\n\nThe British Foreign Office for its part expressed a great deal of frustration over Hitler's action in unilaterally taking what London had proposed to negotiate.  As a Foreign Office memo complained: \"Hitler has deprived us of the possibility of making to him a concession which might otherwise have been a useful bargaining counter in our hands in the general negotiations with Germany which we had it in contemplation to initiate\".<ref>Medlicott, W.N. ''Britain and Germany'' Athlone Press: London, United Kingdom, 1969 page 24.</ref> The Rhineland crisis completed the estrangement between Eden who believed that Hitler's proposals in his speech of 7 March were the grounds for a \"general settlement\" with Germany, and Vansittart who argued that Hitler was negotiating in bad faith.<ref name=Roi128-129>Roi, pp. 128\u2013129.</ref> Eden and Vansittart had already clashed during the Abyssinia Crisis with Eden supporting sanctions against Italy while Vansittart wanted Italy as an ally against Germany. Vansittart argued that there was no prospect of a \"general settlement\" with Hitler, and the best that could be done was to strengthen ties with the French in order to confront Germany.<ref name=Roi128-130>Roi, pp. 128\u2013130.</ref> The Germanophobe Vansittart had always hated the Germans, and especially disliked the Nazis, whom he saw as a menace to civilization. Vansittart had supported Eden's efforts to defuse the Rhineland crisis as British rearmament had only just began, but being an intense Francophile Vansittart urged the government to use the crisis as a chance to begin forming a military alliance with France against Germany.<ref name=Roi128-130/> By the spring of 1936, Vansittart had become convinced that a \"general settlement\" with Germany was not possible, and Hitler was seeking the conquest of the world. A Foreign Office official [[Owen O'Malley]] suggested that Britain give Germany a \"free hand in the East\" (i.e. accept the German conquest of all Eastern Europe) in exchange for a German promise to accept the status quo in Western Europe.<ref name=Roi130>Roi, p. 130.</ref> Vansittart wrote in response that Hitler was seeking world conquest, and that to allow Germany to conquer all of Eastern Europe would give the ''Reich'' sufficient raw materials to make Germany immune to a British blockade, which would then allow the Germans to overrun Western Europe.<ref name=Roi130/> Vansittart commented that to allow Germany to conquer Eastern Europe would \"lead to the disappearance of liberty and democracy in Europe\".<ref name=Roi130/> By contrast, Eden saw British interests as confined only to Western Europe, and did not share Vansittart's beliefs about what Hitler's ultimate intentions might be.<ref name=Roi130/> Nor did Eden, the rest of the Cabinet or the majority of the British people share Vansittart's conviction that Britain could not afford to be indifferent about Eastern Europe.<ref name=Roi130/>\n\nThough the British had agreed to staff talks with the French as the price of French \"restraint\", many British ministers were unhappy with these talks. The Home Secretary Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]] wrote to Eden and Baldwin that staff talks to be held with the French after the Rhineland remilitarization would lead the French to perceive that:\n\n{{quote|\"they have got us so tied that they can safely wait for the breakdown of discussions with Germany. In such circumstances France will be as selfish and as pig-headed as France has always been and the prospect of agreement with Germany will grow dimmer and dimmer\".<ref>Parker (1997), p. 214.</ref>}}\n\nIn response to objections like Simon's, the British ended the staff talks with the French five days after they had begun; Anglo-French staff talks were not to occur again until February 1939 in the aftermath of the [[1939 in Germany#Events|Dutch War Scare]] of January 1939. Besides opposition within the cabinet, the Anglo-French staff talks generated furious criticism from [[David Lloyd George]] and the Beaverbrook and Rothermere press who fumed, as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' put it in a leader, over \"military arrangements that will commit us to some war at the call of others\".<ref>Emmerson, p. 217.</ref> Furthermore, Hitler's Extraordinary Ambassador-at-Large [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] had warned Baldwin and Eden that Germany regarded the Anglo-French staff talks as a mortal threat, and any hope of a \"general settlement\" with Germany would end forever if the talks continued.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 215\u2013216.</ref> However, the rather hazily phrased British statement linking British security to French ''s\u00e9curit\u00e9'' was not disallowed out of the fear that it would irreparably damage Anglo-French relations, which as the British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]] observed, meant should France become involved in a war with Germany, there would be at a minimum a strong moral case because of the statement of March 19, 1936 for Britain to fight on the side of France.<ref>Taylor, A.J.P. ''The Origins of the Second World War'', London: Penguin 1961, 1976 p. 148.</ref>\n\nUntil the statement by [[Neville Chamberlain]] on March 31, 1939 offering the \"guarantee\" of Poland, there were no British security commitments in [[Eastern Europe]] beyond the Covenant of the League of Nations. However, because of the French alliance system in Eastern Europe, the so-called ''[[Cordon sanitaire]]'', any German attack on France's Eastern European allies would cause a Franco-German war, and because of the statement of March 19, 1936 a Franco-German war would create strong pressure for British intervention on the side of France. This was all the more the case because unlike the Locarno, where Britain was committed to come to France's defence only in the event of a German attack, the British statement of March 19 as part of an effort to be as vague as possible only stated Britain considered French security to be a vital national need, and did not distinguish between a German attack on France vs. France going to war with Germany in the event of a German attack on a member of the ''cordon sanitarie''. Thus, in this way, the British statement of March 1936 offered not only a direct British commitment to defend France (albeit phrased in exceedingly ambiguous language), but also indirectly to the Eastern European states of the ''cordon sanitaire''. In this way, the British government found itself drawn into the Central European crisis of 1938 because the Franco-Czechoslovak alliance of 1924 meant any German-Czechoslovak war would automatically become a Franco-German war. It was because of this indirect security commitment that the British involved themselves in the Central European crisis of 1938, despite the widespread feeling that the German-Czechoslovak dispute did not concern Britain directly.<ref>Overy, Richard & Wheatcroft, Andrew ''The Road To War'', London: Macmillan, 1989 p. 86.</ref>\n\nDuring a House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee meeting on 12 March, [[Winston Churchill]], a [[Backbencher|backbench]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP, argued for Anglo-French co-ordination under the League of Nations to help France challenge the remilitarization of the Rhineland,<ref>Martin Gilbert, ''Churchill: A Life'' (Pimlico, 2000), p. 552.</ref> but this never happened. On 6 April Churchill said of the remilitarization, \"The creation of a line of forts opposite to the French frontier will enable the German troops to be economized on that line and will enable the main forces to swing round through Belgium and Holland\", accurately predicting the [[Battle of France]].{{r|knickerbocker1941}}\n\n===Belgium===\nBelgium concluded an alliance with France in 1920 but after the remilitarization Belgium opted again for neutrality. On 14 October 1936 King [[Leopold III of Belgium]] said in a speech:\n\n{{quote|\"The reoccupation of the Rhineland, by ending the Locarno arrangement, has almost brought us back to our international position before the war...  We must follow a policy exclusively and entirely Belgian. The policy must aim solely at placing us outside the quarrels of our neighbors\".<ref>Charles Cheney Hyde, 'Belgium and Neutrality', ''The American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 31, No. 1. (January 1937), p. 82.</ref>}} Since the leaders of Germany knew well that neither Britain nor France would violate Belgian neutrality, the declaration of Belgian neutrality effectively meant that there was no more danger of an Allied offensive in the West should Germany start another war as the Germans were now busy building the [[Siegfried Line]] along their border with France.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 283-284\">Weinberg (1970), pp. 283\u2013284.</ref> By contrast, just as before 1914, Germany's leaders were all too willing to violate Belgian neutrality.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 283-284\"/> Belgian neutrality meant there could be no staff talks between the Belgian military and those of other nations, which meant that when German forces invaded Belgium in 1940, there were no plans whatsoever for coordinating the movement of Belgian forces with those of France and Britain, which gave the Germans a head-start in their offensive.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard pages 283-284\"/>\n\n===Poland===\n\nPoland, announced that the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]] signed in 1921 would be honoured, although the treaty stipulated that Poland would aid France only if France was invaded.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 255\">Weinberg (1970), p. 255.</ref> At the same time that Colonel Beck was assuring the French ambassador [[L\u00e9on No\u00ebl]] of his commitment to the Franco-Polish alliance and Poland's willingness to stand with France, he was also telling the German ambassador Count [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]] that since Germany was not planning on invading France, the Franco-Polish alliance would not come into effect and Poland would do nothing if France acted.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 255\"/> Beck made a point of stressing to Moltke that Poland had not been allowed to sign Locarno and would not go to war for Locarno, and that as one of the architects of the German-Polish nonaggression pact of 1934 that he was a friend of the ''Reich''.<ref>Emmerson, p. 158.</ref> Beck told Moltke on 9 March that his promise to go to war with France was \"in practice, without effect\" because it only came into effect if German troops entered France.<ref>Emmerson, p. 159.</ref> Weinberg wrote that Beck's \"duplicity\" during the Rhineland crisis of telling the German and French ambassadors different things about what Poland would do \"\u2026 did nothing for Beck's personal reputation and involved enormous risks \u2026\" for Poland.<ref>Weinberg (1970), p. 256.</ref> Poland did agree to mobilize its forces if France did first, however they abstained from voting against the remilitarization in the Council of the League of Nations.\n\n===United States===\nDuring the Rhineland crisis, the [[United States non-interventionism|isolationist]] American government took a strict \"hands off\" policy of doing nothing.<ref name=\"Offner pages 413-427\">Offner, p. 415.</ref> During the crisis, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] went off on a \"diplomatically convenient\" extended fishing trip to [[Florida]] to avoid having to answer questions from journalists about what his administration planned to do in response to the crisis in Europe.<ref name=\"Offner pages 413-427\"/> The general sentiment within the U.S. government was expressed by [[Truman Smith (officer)|Truman Smith]], the American military attach\u00e9 in Berlin who wrote that Hitler was seeking only to end French domination in Europe, and was not seeking to destroy France as a power.<ref name=\"Offner pages 413-427\"/> Smith's report concluded: \"Versailles is dead.

Though Germany was no longer a member of the League, Ribbentrop was allowed to give a speech before the League Assembly on 19 March where he tried to justify Germany's actions as something imposed on the ''Reich'' by the Franco-Soviet pact, and warned that there would be serious economic consequences for those states who voted to impose sanctions on Germany.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 170\u2013171.</ref> By 1936, a number of Eastern European, Scandinavian  and Latin American countries whose economies were hard-pressed by the [[Great Depression]] had become very dependent upon trade with Germany to keep their economies afloat, which meant for economic reasons alone none of those states wished to offend Germany.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref> President [[Federico P\u00e1ez]] of [[Ecuador]] gave a speech in which he declared the idea of sanctions against the ''Reich'' to be \"nonsensical\".<ref name=\"Emmerson, p. 166\">Emmerson, p. 166.</ref> At the time, the British Foreign Office estimated that Britain, France, Romania, Belgium, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union were the only nations in the entire world willing to impose sanctions on Germany.<ref>Emmerson, p. 171.</ref> The Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Polish, Dutch, Greek, Swiss, Turkish, Chilean, Estonian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Finnish ambassadors to the League all let it be known that they regarded sanctions on Germany as \"economic suicide\" for their countries.<ref>Emmerson, p. 172.</ref> Mussolini, who was still angry with the League sanctions applied against Italy, made a speech in which he made it clear that he definitely would not be joining any sanctions against Germany for remilitarizing the Rhineland.<ref>Kallis, p. 144.</ref> In the fall of 1935, Britain had been able to have the League impose limited sanctions on Italy, but by the later winter of 1936, the idea of imposing sweeping sanctions on Germany\u2014whose economy was four times the size of Italy's, making Germany an \"economic octopus\" whose tentacles were everywhere around the world\u2014was unthinkable for rest of the world.<ref>Emmerson, pp. 171\u2013171.</ref> Moreover, for the sanctions to work, the [[United States]] had to join in. In 1935, the American government had declared that as the U.S. was not a League member, it would not abide by the League sanctions on Italy, which was hardly a hopeful precedent for the idea that U.S. would join in with imposing sanctions on Germany. [[Argentina]] declared that it would vote for sanctions against Germany only if the United States promised to join in.<ref name=\"Emmerson, p. 166\"/> The Council declared, though not unanimously, that the remilitarization constituted a breach of the Treaties of Versailles and Locarno. Hitler was invited to plan a new scheme for European security, and he responded by claiming he had \"no territorial claims in Europe\" and wanted a 25-year [[Non-aggression pact|pact of non-aggression]] with Britain and France. However, when the British Government inquired further into this proposed pact, they did not receive a reply.<ref>Taylor, p. 133.</ref>\n\n==Significance==\nThe remilitarization changed the balance of power decisively in favor of the ''Reich''.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 262\">Weinberg (1970), p. 262.</ref> French credibility in standing against German expansion or aggression was left in doubt. French military strategy was entirely defensive, and it had no intention whatsoever of invading Germany. Instead it planned  to defend the [[Maginot Line]]. Its failure to send even a single unit into Rhineland signaled that strategy to all of Europe. Potential allies in Eastern Europe could no longer trust in an alliance with a France that could not be trusted to deter Germany through threat of an invasion.  without such deterrence, the ally was militarily helpless.  Belgium dropped its defensive alliance with France and relied on neutrality. Paris neglected to expand the Maginot line to cover the Belgian border, which is where Germany invaded in 1940.  Mussolini had previously pushed back against German expansion, now he realized cooperation with France was unpromising, so he began instead to swing in favor of Berlin. All of France's friends were disappointed \u2013 even the Pope told the French ambassador that, \"Had you ordered the immediate advance of 200,000 men into the zone the Germans had occupied, you would have done everyone a very great favor.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Record|title=The Specter of Munich: Reconsidering the Lessons of Appeasing Hitler|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aV0B4_cBkc0C&pg=PA29|year=2007|publisher=Potomac Books|pages=27\u201329}}</ref>\n\nWith the Rhineland remilitarized, Germany started the construction of the [[Siegfried Line]], which meant that if Germany attacked any of the states in the ''cordon sanitaire'', the ability of France to threaten an invasion was henceforward limited.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 261\">Weinberg (1970), p. 261.</ref> Such was the impact of the remilitarization on the balance of power that the Czechoslovak President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] seriously considered renouncing the alliance with France, and instead seeking a rapprochement with Germany, only abandoning that idea when it became clear that the price of a rapprochement with Hitler would be the effective loss of his country's independence.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 261\"/> Likewise, King [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] of Romania concluded that Romania might have to abandon its alliance with France, and instead accept that his country would have to move from being in the French sphere of influence to being in the German sphere of influence.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 261\"/>  When [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|William C. Bullitt]], the newly appointed American ambassador to France visited Germany in May 1936, he met with Baron von Neurath. On 18 May 1936, Bullitt reported to President Roosevelt that: <blockquote>\"Von Neurath said that it was the policy of the German government to do nothing active in foreign affairs until \"the Rhineland had been digested\". He explained that he meant that until the German fortifications had been constructed on the French and Belgian borders, the German government would do everything possible to prevent rather than encourage an outbreak by Nazis in Austria and would pursue a quiet line with regard to Czechoslovakia. \"As soon as our fortifications are constructed and the countries of Central Europe realize that France cannot enter German territory at will, all those countries will begin to feel very differently about their foreign policies and a new constellation will develop\", he said\".<ref>Shirer, p. 295.</ref> </blockquote> Between the 15\u201320 June 1936, the chiefs of staff of the [[Little Entente]] of Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia met to discuss the changed international situation. They decided to maintain their present plans for a war with Hungary, but concluded that, with the Rhineland now remilitarized, there was little hope of effective French action in the event of a war with Germany.<ref>Weinberg (1970), pp. 261\u2013262.</ref> The meeting ended with the conclusion that there now were only two great powers in Eastern Europe, namely Germany and the Soviet Union, and the best that could be hoped for was to avoid another war that would almost certainly mean the loss of their nations' independence, regardless of who won.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 262\"/>\n\nWeinberg wrote that attitude of the entire German elite and much of the German people, that any new war would only benefit Germany and that ending the Rhineland's demilitarized status could only be a good thing as it opened the door to starting a new war, was an extremely short-sighted, self-destructive and stupid attitude, even from a narrowly German viewpoint.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 239\"/> Weinberg notes that Germany lost its independence in 1945 and lost far more territory under the [[Oder-Neisse line]] imposed in 1945 than it ever had under Versailles, together with millions of dead and the destruction of its cities. Thus, from the German viewpoint, the best thing to do would have been to accept Versailles rather than start a new war\u2014one which ended with Germany being totally crushed, partitioned and occupied.<ref name=\"Weinberg, Gerhard page 239\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*[[Correlli Barnett]].

Note this follows from the previous theorem and the following trick: if <math>||\\cdot||_1,||\\cdot||_2</math> are two equivalent norms, and<blockquote><math>||x||_1 < ||x||_2</math></blockquote>then for a fixed constant <math>c_1</math> there exists an <math>N_0 \\in \\mathbb{N}</math> such that<blockquote><math>\\left(\\frac{||x||_1}{||x||_2} \\right)^N < \\frac{1}{c_1}</math></blockquote>for all <math>N \\geq N_0</math> since the sequence generated from the powers of <math>N</math> converge to <math>0</math>.\n\n==== Finite Galois extensions ====\nIf the index of the extension is of degree <math>n = [K:F]</math> and <math>K/F</math> is a [[galois extension]], (so all solutions to the minimal polynomial of any <math>a \\in K</math> is also contained in <math>K</math>) then the unique field norm <math>|\\cdot|_K</math> can be constructed using the [[field norm]]<ref name=\":0\" /> <sup>pg. 61</sup>. This is defined as<blockquote><math>|a|_K = |N_{K/F}(a)|^{1/n}</math></blockquote>Note the n-th root is required in order to have a well-defined field norm extending the one over <math>F</math> since given any <math>f \\in K</math> in the image of <math>F \\hookrightarrow K</math> its norm is<blockquote><math>N_{K/F}(f) = \\det m_f = f^n</math></blockquote>since it acts as scalar multiplication on the <math>F</math>-vector space <math>K</math>.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Finite fields ===\nAll finite fields are locally compact since they can be equipped with the discrete topology. In particular, any field with the discrete topology is locally compact since every point is the neighborhood of itself, and also the closure of the neighborhood, hence is compact.\n\n=== Local fields ===\nThe main examples of locally compact fields are the p-adic rationals <math>\\mathbb{Q}_p</math> and finite extensions <math>K/\\mathbb{Q}_p</math>. Each of these are examples of [[local field]]s. Note the algebraic closure <math>\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_p</math> and its completion <math>\\mathbb{C}_p</math> are '''not''' locally compact fields<ref name=\":0\" /> <sup>pg. 72</sup> with their standard topology.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Local field]]\n*[[Ramification of local fields]]\n* [[Locally compact group]]\n* [[Locally compact quantum group]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Topology]]\n\n== External Links ==\n\n* Inequality trick https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2252625<br />\n{{algebra-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact_field"}

Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned. Carloman, son of Pepin and brother to Charles, supported Stephen II, and was named along with his father and brother as kings.-->. In return, the pope could provide only legitimacy. He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]].

The middle kingdom had broken up by 890 and partly absorbed into the Western kingdom (later France) and the Eastern kingdom (Germany) and the rest developing into smaller \"buffer\" nations that exist between France and Germany to this day, namely the [[Benelux]] and [[Switzerland]]. \n==Rise to power==\n\n===Early life===\n\n====Date of birth====\nThe most likely date of Charlemagne's birth is reconstructed from several sources.

Plan of This Work}}}}\n\n===Ambiguous high office===\n{{further|Mayor of the Palace}}\n\nThe most powerful officers of the Frankish people, the Mayor of the Palace (''Maior Domus'') and one or more kings (''rex'', ''reges''), were appointed by the election of the people. Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 751, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]] in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u201331}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was [[queen regent]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.\n\n== Wives, concubines, and children ==\nCharlemagne had eighteen children with eight of his ten known wives or concubines.<ref>Durant, Will.

In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pepin of Italy]]), who was illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. Among his descendants are several royal dynasties, including the [[Habsburg]], [[Capetian]] and [[Plantagenet]] dynasties. By consequence, most if not all established European noble families ever since can genealogically trace their background to Charlemagne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Start date\n! Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[King of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished Pepin the Hunchback to [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]] because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion. He took [[Barcelona]] in a great siege in 797.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne et Louis le Pieux.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne instructing his son [[Louis the Pious]]]]\n\nCharlemagne kept his daughters at home with him and refused to allow them to contract [[marriage#Marriage and religion|sacramental marriages]] (though he originally condoned an engagement between his eldest daughter Rotrude and [[Constantine VI]] of Byzantium, this engagement was annulled when Rotrude was 11).<ref>Runciman, Steven. \"The Empress Irene the Athenian.\" Medieval Women.

However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father. At least one of them, Bertha, had a recognised relationship, if not a marriage, with [[Angilbert]], a member of Charlemagne's court circle.{{sfn|Becher|2005|p=122}}{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|p=91}}\n\n==Italian campaigns==\n\n===Conquest of the Lombard kingdom===\n[[File:Charlemagne and Pope Adrian I.jpg|thumb|The Frankish king Charlemagne was a devout Catholic and maintained a close relationship with the papacy throughout his life.

Instead, Desiderius took over certain papal cities and invaded the [[Pentapolis]], heading for Rome. Adrian sent ambassadors to Charlemagne in autumn requesting he enforce the policies of his father, Pepin. Desiderius sent his own ambassadors denying the pope's charges. The ambassadors met at [[Thionville]], and Charlemagne upheld the pope's side. Charlemagne demanded what the pope had requested, but Desiderius swore never to comply.

There he confirmed [[Donation of Pepin|his father's grants of land]],<ref name=\"Campaigns\" /> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled. Charlemagne rushed back from [[Saxony]] and defeated the Duke of Friuli in battle; the Duke was slain.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}} The Duke of Spoleto signed a treaty.

Charlemagne's siege of [[Salerno]] forced Arechis into submission. However, after Arechis II's death in 787, his son [[Grimoald III of Benevento|Grimoald III]] proclaimed the Duchy of Benevento newly independent. Grimoald was attacked many times by Charles' or his sons' armies, without achieving a definitive victory.{{sfn|Hodgkin|1889|pp=85\u201386}} Charlemagne lost interest and never again returned to [[Southern Italy]] where Grimoald was able to keep the Duchy free from Frankish [[suzerainty]].\n\n==Carolingian expansion to the south==\n{{See also|Abbasid\u2013Carolingian alliance}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Vasconia and the Pyrenees===\nThe destructive war led by Pepin in Aquitaine, although brought to a satisfactory conclusion for the Franks, proved the Frankish power structure south of the [[Loire]] was feeble and unreliable. After the defeat and death of [[Waiofar]] in 768, while Aquitaine submitted again to the Carolingian dynasty, a new rebellion broke out in 769 led by Hunald II, a possible son of Waifer. He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent.

Subsidia, '''13''', 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 Westphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons.

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried? Who, in other words, was qualified to pass judgement on the Vicar of Christ? In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\n[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coronation of Charlemagne, drawing by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law. Charlemagne introduced the ''[[Capitulary for the Jews]]'', a prohibition on Jews engaging in money-lending due to the religious convictions of the majority of his constituents, in essence banning it across the board, a reversal of his earlier recorded general policy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldology.com/Europe/early_dark_ages_3.htm |title=Charlemagne created a peaceful environment for Jews in his kingdom.

Carolus Magnus.jpg|thumb|Charlemagne in a copper engraving of the 16th-century by Giovanni Battista Cavalieri]]\n\nPart of Charlemagne's success as a warrior, an administrator and ruler can be traced to his admiration for learning and education. His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it. Charlemagne came into contact with the culture and learning of other countries (especially Moorish Spain, Anglo-Saxon England,<ref>''Charlemagne and Anglo-Saxon England'', Joanna Story, ''Charlemagne: Empire and Society'', ed. Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests. He greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia.\n\nCharlemagne was a lover of books, sometimes having them read to him during meals. He was thought to enjoy the works of [[Augustine of Hippo]].<ref name=\"onlinelibrary.wiley.com\">{{cite journal |last=Bullough |first=Donald A. |authorlink=Donald A.

Due to the increased interest of intellectual pursuits and the urging of their king, the monks accomplished so much copying that almost every manuscript from that time was preserved. At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian. It is almost certain that a text which survived to the Carolingian age survives still.\n\nThe pan-European nature of Charlemagne's influence is indicated by the origins of many of the men who worked for him: [[Alcuin]], an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] from [[York]]; [[Theodulf]], a [[Visigoths|Visigoth]], probably from [[Septimania]]; [[Paul the Deacon]], Lombard; [[Italians]] [[Peter of Pisa]] and [[Saint Paulinus II|Paulinus of Aquileia]]; and Franks [[Angilbert]], Angilram, [[Einhard]] and [[Waldo of Reichenau]].\n\nCharlemagne promoted the [[liberal arts]] at court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself (in a time when even leaders who promoted education did not take time to learn themselves) under the tutelage of Peter of Pisa, from whom he learned grammar; Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialectic (logic), and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars); and Einhard, who tutored him in arithmetic.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nHis great scholarly failure, as Einhard relates, was his inability to write: when in his old age he attempted to learn\u2014practising the formation of letters in his bed during his free time on books and wax tablets he hid under his pillow\u2014\"his effort came too late in life and achieved little success\", and his ability to read\u2014which Einhard is silent about, and which no contemporary source supports\u2014has also been called into question.{{sfn|Dutton|2016}}\n\nIn 800, Charlemagne enlarged the hostel at the [[Muristan]] in [[Jerusalem]] and added a library to it. He certainly had not been personally in Jerusalem.<ref>Karl der Grosse und das Erbe der Kulturen, Band 1999, Franz-Reiner Erkens, Akademie Verlag, 2001.</ref><ref>Saint-Denis zwischen Adel und K\u00f6nig, Rolf Gro\u00dfe, Thorbecke, Stuttgart 2002.</ref>\n\n===Church reforms===\n{{See also|Charlemagne and church music}}\n[[File:Aachen Cathedral top floor.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Palatine Chapel in Aachen|Charlemagne's chapel]] at [[Aachen Cathedral]]]]\n\nCharlemagne expanded the reform Church's programme unlike his father, Pippin, and uncle, Carloman. The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance. His reform focused on strengthening the church's power structure, improving clergy's skill and moral quality, standardising liturgical practices, improvements on the basic tenets of the faith and the rooting out of paganism. His authority extended over church and state. He could discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property and define orthodox doctrine. Despite the harsh legislation and sudden change, he had developed support from clergy who approved his desire to deepen the piety and morals of his subjects.<ref name=britannica>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne |title=Charlemagne |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date= 2012 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 809\u2013810, Charlemagne called a church council in [[Aachen]], which confirmed the unanimous belief in the West that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son (''ex Patre [[Filioque]]'') and sanctioned inclusion in the [[Nicene Creed]] of the phrase ''Filioque'' (and the Son). For this Charlemagne sought the approval of [[Pope Leo III]].

[[Carolingian minuscule]] was created partly under the patronage of Charlemagne. [[Alcuin]], who ran the palace school and [[scriptorium]] at Aachen, was probably a chief influence.\n\nThe revolutionary character of the Carolingian reform, however, can be over-emphasised; efforts at taming Merovingian and Germanic influence had been underway before Alcuin arrived at Aachen. The new minuscule was disseminated first from Aachen and later from the influential scriptorium at [[Tours]], where Alcuin retired as an abbot.\n\n===Political reforms===\nCharlemagne engaged in many reforms of Frankish governance while continuing many traditional practices, such as the division of the kingdom among sons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The rise of the medieval world, 500\u20131300: a biographical dictionary|last=Schulman|first=Jana K.|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0313011085|location=Westport, CN|page=xx}}</ref>\n\n====Divisio regnorum====\nIn 806, Charlemagne first made provision for the traditional division of the empire on his death. For Charles the Younger he designated Austrasia and Neustria, Saxony, Burgundy and [[Thuringia]]. To Pippin, he gave Italy, Bavaria, and [[Swabia]]. Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LUCPcwybApIC&pg=PA10&dq=Bernard+of+Italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mIyl-5PXAhVCOyYKHUBcD6oQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=Bernard%20of%20Italy&f=false Noble, Thomas F.

His meals ordinarily consisted of four courses, not counting the roast, which his huntsmen used to bring in on the spit; he was more fond of this than of any other dish.

The author of the ''[[Visio Karoli Magni]]'' written around 865 uses facts gathered apparently from Einhard and his own observations on the decline of Charlemagne's family after the dissensions war (840\u201343) as the basis for a visionary tale of Charles' meeting with a prophetic spectre in a dream.\n\nCharlemagne was a model [[knight]] as one of the [[Nine Worthies]] who enjoyed an important legacy in European culture. One of the great medieval [[literary cycle]]s, the Charlemagne cycle or the ''[[Matter of France]]'', centres on his deeds\u2014the Emperor with the Flowing Beard of ''[[Song of Roland|Roland]]'' fame\u2014and his historical commander of the border with [[Brittany]], [[Roland]], and the 12 [[paladin]]s.

It should. It seems to be based, in large part, on the historical adventures of Charlemagne, the Frankish King of the Ninth Century, who eventually became Emperor. Looking at Charlemagne's life and personality, it becomes clear that he and Geoffrey's Arthur are practically twins.\"</ref> During the [[Hundred Years' War]] in the 14th century, there was considerable cultural conflict in England, where the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] rulers were aware of their French roots and identified with Charlemagne, Anglo-Saxon natives felt more affinity for Arthur, whose own legends were relatively primitive. Therefore, storytellers in England adapted legends of Charlemagne and his 12 Peers to the Arthurian tales.<ref>[http://www.mementomedievalia.com/charlemagne-king-arthur-and-contested-national-identity-in-english-romances/ Charlemagne, King Arthur and Contested National Identity in English Romances]<br /> Modelling his narrative on earlier Middle English texts, the English AMA-poet, appropriates aspects of the historical reality of Charlemagne and refashions them to fit Arthur, creating a hero that the English can claim as their own.</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', the spirit of Charlemagne appears to [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in the [[Paradiso (Dante)#Fifth Sphere (Mars: The Warriors of the Faith)|Heaven of Mars]], among the other \"warriors of the faith\".<ref name=\"DLS17\">[[Dorothy L.

Charles was succeeded in 741 by his sons [[Carloman (mayor of the palace)|Carloman]] and [[Pepin the Short]], the father of Charlemagne. In 743, the brothers placed [[Childeric III]] on the throne to curb separatism in the periphery. He was the last Merovingian king. Carloman resigned office in 746, preferring to enter the church as a monk. Pepin brought the question of the kingship before [[Pope Zachary]], asking whether it was logical for a king to have no royal power. The pope handed down his decision in 749, decreeing that it was better for Pepin to be called king, as he had the powers of high office as Mayor, so as not to confuse the hierarchy. He, therefore, ordered him to become the ''true king''.<ref name=\"France/Pippin\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/40284/Pippin-III |title=France :: Pippin III \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=24 April 2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 750, Pepin was elected by an assembly of the Franks, anointed by the archbishop, and then raised to the office of king. The Pope branded Childeric III as \"the false king\" and ordered him into a monastery. The Merovingian dynasty was thereby replaced by the [[Carolingian]] dynasty, named after Charles Martel. In 753, [[Pope Stephen II]] fled from Italy to Francia, appealing to Pepin for assistance for the rights of St. Peter. He was supported in this appeal by Carloman, Charles' brother<!---should this be Pepin's brother?- Apparently not; Pepin's brother only left the monastery (Monte Cassino), to plead that Pepin NOT provide aid to Stephen II, and was then imprisoned. Carloman, son of Pepin and brother to Charles, supported Stephen II, and was named along with his father and brother as kings.-->. In return, the pope could provide only legitimacy. He did this by again anointing and confirming Pepin, this time adding his young sons Carolus (Charlemagne) and Carloman to the royal patrimony. They thereby became heirs to the realm that already covered most of western Europe. In 754, Pepin accepted the Pope's invitation to visit Italy on behalf of St. Peter's rights, dealing successfully with the [[Lombards]].<ref name=\"France/Pippin\" /><ref>The background relies heavily on {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745\u2013755}}</ref>\n\nUnder the Carolingians, the Frankish kingdom spread to encompass an area including most of Western Europe; the east-west division of the kingdom formed the basis for modern [[History of France|France]] and [[History of Germany|Germany]]. Orman{{sfn|Oman|1914|pp=409\u201310}} portrays the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843) between the warring grandsons of Charlemagne as the foundation event of an independent [[France]] under its first king [[Charles the Bald]]; an independent Germany under its first king [[Louis the German]]; and an independent intermediate state stretching from the [[Low Countries]] along the borderlands to south of Rome under [[Lothair I]], who retained the title of emperor and the capitals [[Aachen]] and [[Rome]] without the jurisdiction. The middle kingdom had broken up by 890 and partly absorbed into the Western kingdom (later France) and the Eastern kingdom (Germany) and the rest developing into smaller \"buffer\" nations that exist between France and Germany to this day, namely the [[Benelux]] and [[Switzerland]]. \n==Rise to power==\n\n===Early life===\n\n====Date of birth====\nThe most likely date of Charlemagne's birth is reconstructed from several sources.

The year given in the ''[[Annales Petaviani]]'', 747, would be more likely, except that it contradicts Einhard and a few other sources in making Charlemagne sixty-seven years old at his death.

Elections were not periodic, but were held as required to elect officers ''ad quos summa imperii pertinebat'', \"to whom the highest matters of state pertained\". Evidently, interim decisions could be made by the Pope, which ultimately needed to be ratified using an assembly of the people that met annually.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=1. The Merovingian Family}}\n\nBefore he was elected king in 751, Pepin was initially a mayor, a high office he held \"as though hereditary\" (''velut hereditario fungebatur''). Einhard explains that \"the honour\" was usually \"given by the people\" to the distinguished, but Pepin the Great and his brother Carloman the Wise received it as though hereditary, as had their father, [[Charles Martel]]. There was, however, a certain ambiguity about quasi-inheritance. The office was treated as joint property: one Mayorship held by two brothers jointly.<ref>The ''Annales'' uses maiores domus, a plural followed by a singular: one house, two chief officers. {{harvnb|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 742}}</ref> Each, however, had his own geographic jurisdiction. When Carloman decided to resign, becoming ultimately a Benedictine at [[Monte Cassino]],{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Years 745, 746}} the question of the disposition of his quasi-share was settled by the pope. He converted the mayorship into a kingship and awarded the joint property to Pepin, who gained the right to pass it on by inheritance.{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=6. Lombard War}}\n\nThis decision was not accepted by all family members. Carloman had consented to the temporary tenancy of his own share, which he intended to pass on to his son, Drogo, when the inheritance should be settled at someone's death. By the Pope's decision, in which Pepin had a hand, Drogo was to be disqualified as an heir in favour of his cousin Charles. He took up arms in opposition to the decision and was joined by [[Grifo]], a half-brother of Pepin and Carloman, who had been given a share by Charles Martel, but was stripped of it and held under loose arrest by his half-brothers after an attempt to seize their shares by military action. Grifo perished in combat in the Battle of [[Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne]] while Drogo was hunted down and taken into custody.{{sfn|Collins|1998|pp=32\u201333}}\n\nOn the death of Pepin, 24 September 768, the kingship passed jointly to his sons, \"with divine assent\" (''divino nutu'').{{sfn|Einhard|1999|loc=3. Charlemagne's Accession}} According to the ''Life'', Pepin died in Paris. The Franks \"in general assembly\" (''generali conventu'') gave them both the rank of a king (''reges'') but \"partitioned the whole body of the kingdom equally\" (''totum regni corpus ex aequo partirentur''). The ''annals''{{sfn|Einhard, putative|741\u2013829|loc=Year 768}} tell a slightly different version, with the king dying at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Denis]], near Paris. The two \"lords\" (''domni'') were \"elevated to kingship\" (''elevati sunt in regnum''), Charles on 9 October in [[Noyon]], Carloman on an unspecified date in [[Soissons]]. If born in 742, Charles was 26 years old, but he had been campaigning at his father's right hand for several years, which may help to account for his military skill. [[Carloman I|Carloman]] was 17.\n\nThe language, in either case, suggests that there were not two inheritances, which would have created distinct kings ruling over distinct kingdoms, but a single joint inheritance and a joint kingship tenanted by two equal kings, Charles and his brother Carloman. As before, distinct jurisdictions were awarded. Charles received Pepin's original share as Mayor: the outer parts of the kingdom bordering on the sea, namely [[Neustria]], western [[Aquitaine]], and the northern parts of [[Austrasia]]; while Carloman was awarded his uncle's former share, the inner parts: southern Austrasia, [[Septimania]], eastern Aquitaine, [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], Provence, and [[Swabia]], lands bordering [[Italy]]. The question of whether these jurisdictions were joint shares reverting to the other brother if one brother died or were inherited property passed on to the descendants of the brother who died was never definitely settled. It came up repeatedly over the succeeding decades until the grandsons of Charlemagne created distinct sovereign kingdoms.\n\n===Aquitainian rebellion===\n====Formation of a new Aquitaine====\n{{main|Aquitaine}}\n\n[[Aquitaine]] under Rome had been in southern [[Gaul]], Romanised and speaking a [[Romance language]]. Similarly, [[Hispania]] had been populated by peoples who spoke various languages, including [[Celtic language|Celtic]], but the area was now populated primarily by Romance language speakers. Between Aquitaine and Hispania were the [[Basques|Euskaldunak]], Latinised to [[Vascones]], or [[Basques]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=32}} living in Basque country, Vasconia, which extended, according to the distributions of place names attributable to the Basques, most densely in the western [[Pyrenees]] but also as far south as the upper [[Ebro River]] in Spain and as far north as the [[Garonne River]] in France.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=105}} The French name, [[Gascony]], derives from [[Vasconia]]. The Romans were never able to entirely subject Vasconia. The parts they did, in which they placed the region's first cities, were sources of legions in the Roman army valued for their fighting abilities. The border with Aquitaine was [[Toulouse]].\n\nAt about 660, the [[Duchy of Vasconia]] united with the [[Duke of Aquitaine|Duchy of Aquitaine]] to form a single realm under [[Felix of Aquitaine]], governing from Toulouse. This was a joint kingship with a Basque Duke, [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus I]]. ''Lupus'' is the Latin translation of Basque Otsoa, \"wolf\".{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|pp=36\u201337}} At Felix's death in 670 the joint property of the kingship reverted entirely to Lupus. As the Basques had no law of joint inheritance but practised [[primogeniture]], [[Lupus I of Aquitaine|Lupus]] in effect founded a hereditary dynasty of Basque rulers of an expanded Aquitaine.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=100}}\n\n====Acquisition of Aquitaine by the Carolingians====\n{{further|Umayyad conquest of Hispania}}\n[[File:Al-Andalus732.jpg|thumb|Moorish Hispania in 732]]\n\nThe Latin chronicles of the end of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] omit many details, such as identification of characters, filling in the gaps and reconciliation of numerous contradictions.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2004|pp=130\u201331}}, \"The sequence of events...has not been assisted by the tendency of the historians to take all the information...from all the available sources and combine it to produce a single synthetic account...As a rule of thumb, reliability, and also brevity of narrative, are usually in direct proportion to chronological proximity.\"</ref> Muslim sources, however, present a more coherent view, such as in the ''Ta'rikh iftitah al-Andalus'' (\"History of the Conquest of al-Andalus\") by [[Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya]] (\"the son of the Gothic woman\", referring to the granddaughter of [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania, who married a Moor). Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya, who had another, much longer name, must have been relying to some degree on family oral tradition.\n\nAccording to Ibn al-Q\u016b\u1e6diyya{{sfn|James|2009|p=49}} [[Wittiza]], the last Visigothic king of a united Hispania died before his three sons, Almund, Romulo, and Ardabast reached maturity. Their mother was [[queen regent]] at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], but [[Roderic]], army chief of staff, staged a rebellion, capturing [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]]. He chose to impose a joint rule over distinct jurisdictions on the true heirs. Evidence of a division of some sort can be found in the distribution of coins imprinted with the name of each king and in the king lists.{{sfn|Collins|2004|pp=131\u201332}} Wittiza was succeeded by Roderic, who reigned for seven and a half years, followed by Achila (Aquila), who reigned three and a half years. If the reigns of both terminated with the incursion of the [[Saracens]], then Roderic appears to have reigned a few years before the majority of Achila. The latter's kingdom is securely placed to the northeast, while Roderic seems to have taken the rest, notably modern [[Portugal]].\n\nThe Saracens crossed the mountains to claim Ardo's [[Septimania]], only to encounter the Basque dynasty of Aquitaine, always the allies of the Goths. [[Odo the Great]] of [[Aquitaine]] was at first victorious at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]] in 721.{{sfn|Douglass|Bilbao|2005|p=40}} Saracen troops gradually massed in Septimania and in 732 an army under Emir [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi]] advanced into Vasconia, and Odo was defeated at the [[Battle of the River Garonne]]. They took [[Bordeaux]] and were advancing towards [[Tours]] when Odo, powerless to stop them, appealed to his arch-enemy, [[Charles Martel]], mayor of the Franks. In one of the first of the lightning marches for which the Carolingian kings became famous, Charles and his army appeared in the path of the Saracens between Tours and [[Poitiers]], and in the [[Battle of Tours]] decisively defeated and killed al-Ghafiqi. The Moors returned twice more, each time suffering defeat at Charles' hands\u2014at the River Berre near Narbonne in 737{{sfn|Einhard|2007|p=24}} and in the [[Dauphin\u00e9]] in 740.<ref name=\"Lewis2009\">{{cite book|first=David Levering |last=Lewis|title=God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570\u20131215|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=NwA7mQEACAAJ|page=177}}|date=2009|publisher=W.W.

However, Odo had ambiguously left the kingdom jointly to his two sons, Hunald and Hatto. The latter, loyal to Francia, now went to war with his brother over full possession. Victorious, Hunald blinded and imprisoned his brother, only to be so stricken by conscience that he resigned and entered the church as a monk to do penance. The story is told in [[Annales Mettenses priores]].<ref name=\"Freeman1904\">{{cite book|first=Edward Augustus |last=Freeman|title=Western Europe in the Eighth Century & Onward: An Aftermath|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=5HCIvgAACAAJ|page=74}}|year=1904|publisher=Macmillan and Company, limited| page=74}}</ref> His son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] took an early inheritance, becoming duke of Aquitaine and ratified the alliance with Lombardy. Waifer decided to honour it, repeating his father's decision, which he justified by arguing that any agreements with Charles Martel became invalid on Martel's death. Since [[Aquitaine]] was now Pepin's inheritance because of the earlier assistance that was given by Charles Martel, according to some the latter and his son, the young Charles, hunted down Waifer, who could only conduct a guerrilla war, and executed him.{{sfn|Russell|1930|p=88}}\n\nAmong the contingents of the Frankish army were [[Bavaria]]ns under [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]], an [[Agilofing]], the hereditary Bavarian ducal family. [[Grifo]] had installed himself as Duke of Bavaria, but Pepin replaced him with a member of the ducal family yet a child, Tassilo, whose protector he had become after the death of his father. The loyalty of the Agilolfings was perpetually in question, but Pepin exacted numerous oaths of loyalty from Tassilo. However, the latter had married [[Liutperga]], a daughter of [[Desiderius]], king of [[Lombardy]]. At a critical point in the campaign, Tassilo left the field with all his Bavarians. Out of reach of Pepin, he repudiated all loyalty to Francia.{{sfn|McKitterick|2008|pp=118\u201325}} Pepin had no chance to respond as he grew ill and died within a few weeks after Waifer's execution.\n\nThe first event of the brothers' reign was the uprising of the Aquitainians and [[Gascony|Gascons]], in 769, in that territory split between the two kings. One year earlier, Pepin had finally defeated [[Waifer of Aquitaine|Waifer]], [[Duke of Aquitaine]], after waging a destructive, ten-year war against Aquitaine. Now, [[Hunald II]] led the Aquitainians as far north as [[Angoul\u00eame]]. Charles met Carloman, but Carloman refused to participate and returned to Burgundy. Charles went to war, leading an army to [[Bordeaux]], where he set up a fort at Fronsac. Hunald was forced to flee to the court of Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupus&nbsp;II of Gascony]]. Lupus, fearing Charles, turned Hunald over in exchange for peace, and Hunald was put in a monastery. Gascon lords also surrendered, and Aquitaine and [[Duchy of Vasconia|Gascony]] were finally fully subdued by the Franks.\n\n===Marriage to Desiderata===\nThe brothers maintained lukewarm relations with the assistance of their mother Bertrada, but in 770 Charles signed a treaty with Duke [[Tassilo III of Bavaria]] and married a Lombard Princess (commonly known today as [[Desiderata, wife of Charlemagne|Desiderata]]), the daughter of King [[Desiderius]], to surround Carloman with his own allies. Though [[Pope Stephen III]] first opposed the marriage with the Lombard princess, he found little to fear from a Frankish-Lombard alliance.\n\nLess than a year after his marriage, Charlemagne repudiated Desiderata and married a 13-year-old Swabian named [[Hildegard, wife of Charlemagne|Hildegard]]. The repudiated Desiderata returned to her father's court at [[Pavia]]. Her father's wrath was now aroused, and he would have gladly allied with Carloman to defeat Charles. Before any open hostilities could be declared, however, Carloman died on 5 December 771, apparently of natural causes. Carloman's widow [[Gerberge, wife of Carloman|Gerberga]] fled to Desiderius' court with her sons for protection.\n\n== Wives, concubines, and children ==\nCharlemagne had eighteen children with eight of his ten known wives or concubines.<ref>Durant, Will.

In addition, he had a grandson ([[Bernard of Italy]], the only son of his third son, [[Pepin of Italy]]), who was illegitimate but included in the line of inheritance. Among his descendants are several royal dynasties, including the [[Habsburg]], [[Capetian]] and [[Plantagenet]] dynasties. By consequence, most if not all established European noble families ever since can genealogically trace their background to Charlemagne.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Start date\n! Wives and their children\n! Concubines and their children\n|-\n| c.768\n| His first relationship was with [[Himiltrude]]. The nature of this relationship is variously described as [[concubinage]], a legal marriage, or a [[Friedelehe]].<ref>Charlemagne's biographer [[Einhard]] (Vita Karoli Magni, ch. 20) calls her a \"concubine\" and [[Paulus Diaconus]] speaks of Pippin's birth \"before legal marriage\", whereas a letter by [[Pope Stephen III]] refers to Charlemagne and his brother Carloman as being already married (to Himiltrude and [[Gerberga, wife of Carloman I|Gerberga]]), and advises them not to dismiss their wives. Historians have interpreted the information in different ways. Some, such as [[Pierre Rich\u00e9]] (''The Carolingians'', p.86.), follow Einhard in describing Himiltrude as a concubine. Others, for example Dieter H\u00e4gemann (''Karl der Gro\u00dfe. Herrscher des Abendlands'', p. 82f.), consider Himiltrude a wife in the full sense. Still others subscribe to the idea that the relationship between the two was \"something more than concubinage, less than marriage\" and describe it as a [[Friedelehe]], a form of marriage unrecognised by the Church and easily dissolvable. Russell Chamberlin (''The Emperor Charlemagne'', p. 61.), for instance, compared it with the English system of common-law marriage. This form of relationship is often seen in a conflict between Christian marriage and more flexible Germanic concepts.</ref> (Charlemagne put her aside when he married Desiderata.)

The younger of the two, [[Louis the Pious|Louis]], became [[King of Aquitaine]]. Charlemagne ordered Pepin and Louis to be raised in the customs of their kingdoms, and he gave their regents some control of their subkingdoms, but kept the real power, though he intended his sons to inherit their realms. He did not tolerate insubordination in his sons: in 792, he banished Pepin the Hunchback to [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]] because the young man had joined a rebellion against him.\n\nCharles was determined to have his children educated, including his daughters, as his parents had instilled the importance of learning in him at an early age.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hbnY8GTet_kC}}|title=Charlemagne |last=Gelfand|first=Dale Evva|date=2003|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438117850|language=en}}</ref> His children were also taught skills in accord with their aristocratic status, which included training in riding and weaponry for his sons, and embroidery, spinning and weaving for his daughters.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=bQlJP9O9hKkC}}|title=Daily Life in the Age of Charlemagne|last=Butt|first=John J.|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313316685|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe sons fought many wars on behalf of their father. [[Charles the Younger|Charles]] was mostly preoccupied with the Bretons, whose border he shared and who insurrected on at least two occasions and were easily put down. He also fought the Saxons on multiple occasions. In 805 and 806, he was sent into the B\u00f6hmerwald (modern [[Bohemia]]) to deal with the Slavs living there (Bohemian tribes, ancestors of the modern [[Czech people|Czechs]]). He subjected them to Frankish authority and devastated the valley of the Elbe, forcing tribute from them. Pippin had to hold the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avar]] and Beneventan borders and fought the [[Slavs]] to his north. He was uniquely poised to fight the [[Byzantine Empire]] when that conflict arose after Charlemagne's imperial coronation and a [[Venetia (region)|Venetian]] rebellion. Finally, Louis was in charge of the [[Spanish March]] and fought the Duke of Benevento in southern Italy on at least one occasion.

However, he tolerated their extramarital relationships, even rewarding their common-law husbands and treasuring the illegitimate grandchildren they produced for him. He also, apparently, refused to believe stories of their wild behaviour. After his death the surviving daughters were banished from the court by their brother, the pious Louis, to take up residence in the convents they had been bequeathed by their father.

There he confirmed [[Donation of Pepin|his father's grants of land]],<ref name=\"Campaigns\" /> with some later chronicles falsely claiming that he also expanded them, granting [[Tuscany]], [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], Venice and [[Corsica]]. The pope granted him the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]''. He then returned to Pavia, where the Lombards were on the verge of surrendering. In return for their lives, the Lombards surrendered and opened the gates in early summer. Desiderius was sent to the [[abbey]] of [[Corbie]], and his son Adelchis died in [[Constantinople]], a patrician. Charles, unusually, had himself crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|Iron Crown]] and made the magnates of Lombardy pay homage to him at Pavia. Only Duke [[Arechis II of Benevento]] refused to submit and proclaimed independence. Charlemagne was then master of Italy as king of the Lombards. He left Italy with a garrison in Pavia and a few Frankish counts in place the same year.\n\nInstability continued in Italy. In 776, Dukes [[Hrodgaud of Friuli]] and [[Hildeprand of Spoleto]] rebelled.

He took refuge with the ally Duke [[Lupus II of Gascony]], but probably out of fear of Charlemagne's reprisal, Lupus handed him over to the new King of the Franks to whom he pledged loyalty, which seemed to confirm the peace in [[Duchy of Vasconia|the Basque area]] south of the [[Garonne]].<ref name=Lewis>{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Archibald Ross |year=1965 |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society 718\u20131050 |publisher=University of Texas Press |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nWary of new Basque uprisings, Charlemagne seems to have tried to contain Duke Lupus's power by appointing [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin]] as the Count of Bordeaux (778) and other counts of Frankish background in bordering areas ([[History of Toulouse#768\u2013877: Carolingian Franks and the Kingdom of Aquitaine|Toulouse]], [[County of F\u00e9zensac]]). The [[History of the Basque people#Early Middle Ages|Basque]] Duke, in turn, seems to have contributed decisively or schemed the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]] (referred to as \"Basque treachery\"). The defeat of Charlemagne's army in Roncevaux (778) confirmed his determination to rule directly by establishing the Kingdom of Aquitaine (ruled by [[Louis the Pious]]) based on a power base of Frankish officials, distributing lands among colonisers and allocating lands to the Church, which he took as an ally. A Christianisation programme was put in place across the high [[Pyrenees]] (778).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\n[[File:771 CE, Europe.svg|thumb|Europe in 771]]\nThe new political arrangement for Vasconia did not sit well with local lords. As of 788 [[Adalric of Gascony|Adalric]] was fighting and capturing [[Torson of Toulouse|Chorson]], Carolingian Count of Toulouse. He was eventually released, but Charlemagne, enraged at the compromise, decided to depose him and appointed his trustee [[William of Gellone]]. William, in turn, fought the Basques and defeated them after banishing Adalric (790).<ref name=Lewis/>\n\nFrom 781 ([[County of Pallars|Pallars]], [[County of Ribagorza|Ribagor\u00e7a]]) to 806 ([[Pamplona#Early Middle Ages|Pamplona]] under Frankish influence), taking the County of Toulouse for a power base, Charlemagne asserted Frankish authority over the Pyrenees by subduing the south-western marches of Toulouse (790) and establishing vassal counties on the southern Pyrenees that were to make up the [[Marca Hispanica]].{{sfn|Lewis|1965|p=40}} As of 794, a Frankish vassal, the Basque lord Belasko (''al-Galashki'', 'the Gaul') ruled [[\u00c1lava]], but Pamplona remained under Cordovan and local control up to 806. Belasko and the counties in the Marca Hisp\u00e1nica provided the necessary base to attack the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]] (an expedition led by [[William of Gellone|William Count of Toulouse]] and Louis the Pious to capture Barcelona in 801). Events in the Duchy of Vasconia (rebellion in Pamplona, [[Aznar Gal\u00edndez I|count overthrown in Aragon]], Duke Seguin of Bordeaux deposed, uprising of the Basque lords, etc.) were to prove it ephemeral upon Charlemagne's death.\n\n===Roncesvalles campaign===\nAccording to the Muslim historian [[Ibn al-Athir]], the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Diet]] of [[Paderborn]] had received the representatives of the Muslim rulers of [[Zaragoza]], [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Huesca]]. Their masters had been cornered in the [[Iberian peninsula]] by [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], the [[Umayyad]] [[emir of C\u00f3rdoba|emir of Cordova]]. These \"Saracen\" ([[Moorish]] and [[Muladi]]) rulers offered their homage to the king of the Franks in return for military support. Seeing an opportunity to extend [[Christendom]] and his own power and believing the Saxons to be a fully conquered nation, Charlemagne agreed to go to Spain.\n\nIn 778, he led the Neustrian army across the Western [[Pyrenees]], while the Austrasians, Lombards, and Burgundians passed over the Eastern Pyrenees. The armies met at Saragossa and Charlemagne received the homage of the Muslim rulers, Sulayman al-Arabi and Kasmin ibn Yusuf, but the city did not fall for him. Indeed, Charlemagne faced the toughest battle of his career. The Muslims forced him to retreat. He decided to go home since he could not trust the [[Basques]], whom he had subdued by conquering [[Pamplona]]. He turned to leave Iberia, but as he was passing through the Pass of [[Roncesvalles]] one of the most famous events of his reign occurred. The Basques attacked and destroyed his rearguard and baggage train. The [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]], though less a battle than a skirmish, left many famous dead, including the [[seneschal]] Eggihard, the count of the palace Anselm, and the [[wikt:warden|warden]] of the [[Breton March]], [[Roland]], inspiring the subsequent creation of the [[Song of Roland]] (''La Chanson de Roland'').\n\n===Contact with the Saracens===\n[[File:Harun-Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Harun al-Rashid]] receiving a delegation of Charlemagne in [[Baghdad]], by [[Julius K\u00f6ckert]] (1864)]]\n\nThe conquest of Italy brought Charlemagne in contact with the [[Saracen]]s who, at the time, controlled the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Charlemagne's eldest son, [[Pepin the Hunchback]], was much occupied with Saracens in Italy. Charlemagne conquered [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] at an unknown date and in 799 the [[Balearic Islands]]. The islands were often attacked by Saracen pirates, but the counts of [[Genoa]] and Tuscany ([[Boniface I of Tuscany|Boniface]]) controlled them with large fleets until the end of Charlemagne's reign. Charlemagne even had contact with the [[caliph]]al court in [[Baghdad]]. In 797 (or possibly 801), the caliph of Baghdad, [[Harun al-Rashid]], presented Charlemagne with an [[Asian elephant]] named [[Abul-Abbas]] and a [[clock]].<ref name=\"Heck2007\">{{cite book|first=Gene W. |last=Heck|title=When Worlds Collide: Exploring the Ideological and Political Foundations of the Clash of Civilizations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=dtAyMXqaozwC|page=172}}|year=2007|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-5856-4|pages=172\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Wars with the Moors===\n\nIn [[Hispania]], the struggle against the Moors continued unabated throughout the latter half of his reign. Louis was in charge of the Spanish border. In 785, his men captured Girona permanently and extended Frankish control into the [[Catalonia|Catalan]] littoral for the duration of Charlemagne's reign (the area remained nominally Frankish until the [[Treaty of Corbeil (1258)|Treaty of Corbeil]] in 1258). The Muslim chiefs in the northeast of [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] were constantly rebelling against Cordovan authority, and they often turned to the Franks for help. The Frankish border was slowly extended until 795, when Girona, [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]], [[Ausona]] and [[County of Urgell|Urgell]] were united into the new [[Spanish March]], within the old duchy of [[Septimania]].\n\nIn 797, [[Barcelona]], the greatest city of the region, fell to the Franks when Zeid, its governor, rebelled against Cordova and, failing, handed it to them. The [[Umayyad]] authority recaptured it in 799. However, Louis of Aquitaine marched the entire army of his kingdom over the [[Pyrenees]] and besieged it for two years, wintering there from 800 to 801, when it capitulated. The Franks continued to press forward against the [[emir]]. They took [[Tarragona]] in 809 and [[Tortosa]] in 811. The last conquest brought them to the mouth of the [[Ebro]] and gave them raiding access to [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], prompting the Emir [[al-Hakam I]] to recognise their conquests in 813.\n\n==Eastern campaigns==\n\n===Saxon Wars===\n{{Further|Saxon Wars}}\n[[File:Frankish Empire 481 to 814-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map showing Charlemagne's additions (in light green) to the Frankish Kingdom]]\n\nCharlemagne was engaged in almost constant warfare throughout his reign,<ref>France, John, \"The Composition and Raising of the Armies of Charlemagne\", in Journal of Medieval Military History, ed. B. Bachrach (2002), pp. 63\u201365</ref> often at the head of his elite ''[[scara]]'' bodyguard squadrons. In the [[Saxon Wars]], spanning thirty years and eighteen battles, he conquered [[Old Saxony|Saxonia]] and proceeded to convert it to Christianity.\n\nThe [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Saxons]] were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to [[Austrasia]] was [[Westphalia]] and furthest away was [[Eastphalia]]. Between them was [[Engria]] and north of these three, at the base of the [[Jutland]] peninsula, was [[Nordalbingia]].\n\nIn his first campaign, in 773, Charlemagne forced the Engrians to submit and cut down an [[Irminsul]] pillar near [[Paderborn]].<ref>Revised annals of the kingdom of the Franks, ed. and trans. King, Sources, p. 110</ref> The campaign was cut short by his first expedition to Italy. He returned in 775, marching through Westphalia and conquering the Saxon fort at [[Sigiburg]]. He then crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated a Saxon force, and its leader [[Hessi]] converted to Christianity. Charlemagne returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and [[Eresburg]], which had been important Saxon bastions. He then controlled Saxony with the exception of Nordalbingia, but Saxon resistance had not ended.\n\nFollowing his subjugation of the Dukes of Friuli and Spoleto, Charlemagne returned rapidly to Saxony in 776, where a rebellion had destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again defeated, but their main leader, [[Widukind]], escaped to Denmark, his wife's home. Charlemagne built a new camp at [[Karlstadt am Main|Karlstadt]]. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised as Christians.\n\nIn the summer of 779, he again invaded Saxony and reconquered Eastphalia, Engria and Westphalia. At a diet near [[Lippe]], he divided the land into missionary districts and himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy and, for the first time, the Saxons did not immediately revolt. Saxony was peaceful from 780 to 782.\n\n[[File:Ary Scheffer, Charlemagne re\u00e7oit la soumission de Widukind \u00e0 Paderborn, (1840).jpg|thumb|left|Charlemagne receiving the submission of [[Widukind]] at [[Paderborn]] in 785, painted c.&nbsp;1840 by [[Ary Scheffer]]]]\n\nHe returned to Saxony in 782 and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were draconian on religious issues; for example, the ''[[Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae]]'' prescribed death to Saxon pagans who refused to convert to Christianity. This led to renewed conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a new revolt. In response, at [[Verden, Germany|Verden]] in Lower Saxony, Charlemagne is recorded as having ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners by beheading, known as the [[Massacre of Verden]] (\"Verdener Blutgericht\"). The killings triggered three years of renewed bloody warfare. During this war, the [[East Frisia]]ns between the [[Lauwers]] and the [[Weser]] joined the Saxons in revolt and were finally subdued.<ref>Oebele Vries, \"Friesland\", ''Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 252\u201356.</ref> The war ended with Widukind accepting baptism.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yW-GfElbafQC&pg=PA368|title=Encyclopedia of Barbarian Europe: Society in Transformation|first=Michael|last=Frassetto|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003 |isbn=9781576072639|chapter=Widukind|page=368}}</ref> The Frisians afterwards asked for missionaries to be sent to them and a bishop of their own nation, [[Ludger]], was sent.

Subsidia, '''13''', 1\u201315.</ref>\n\nThereafter, the Saxons maintained the peace for seven years, but in 792 Westphalia again rebelled. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection was unpopular and was put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed in 796, but the presence of Charlemagne, Christian Saxons and [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] quickly crushed it. The last insurrection occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them, but also failed. According to Einhard:\n{{quote|\nThe war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.\n}}\n\n===Submission of Bavaria===\n[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Equestrian statue of Charlemagne (Cornacchini)|Equestrian statue of Charlemagne]]'' by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), [[St. Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican City]].]]\n\nBy 774, Charlemagne had invaded the [[Kingdom of the Lombards|Kingdom of Lombardy]], and he later annexed the Lombardian territories and assumed its crown, placing the [[Papal States]] under Frankish protection.<ref name=\"autogenerated30\">Historical Atlas of Knights and Castles, Cartographica, Dr Ian Barnes, 2007 pp.30&31</ref> The [[Duchy of Spoleto]] south of Rome was acquired in 774, while in the central western parts of Europe, the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] was absorbed and the Bavarian policy continued of establishing tributary [[marches]], (borders protected in return for tribute or taxes) among the [[Slavs|Slavic]] Serbs and Czechs.

Charlemagne was preoccupied with other matters until 790 when he marched down the [[Danube]] and ravaged Avar territory to the [[Gy\u0151r]]. A Lombard army under Pippin then marched into the [[Drava]] valley and ravaged [[Pannonia]]. The campaigns ended when the Saxons revolted again in 792.\n\nFor the next two years, Charlemagne was occupied, along with the Slavs, against the Saxons. Pippin and Duke [[Eric of Friuli]] continued, however, to assault the Avars' ring-shaped strongholds. The great Ring of the Avars, their capital fortress, was taken twice. The booty was sent to Charlemagne at his capital, [[Aachen]], and redistributed to his followers and to foreign rulers, including King [[Offa of Mercia]]. Soon the Avar [[tudun]]s had lost the will to fight and travelled to Aachen to become vassals to Charlemagne and to become Christians. Charlemagne accepted their surrender and sent one native chief, baptised Abraham, back to Avaria with the ancient title of [[khagan]]. Abraham kept his people in line, but in 800, the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] under [[Krum|Khan Krum]] attacked the remains of the Avar state.\n\nIn 803, Charlemagne sent a Bavarian army into [[Pannonia]], defeating and bringing an end to the [[Avar Khaganate|Avar confederation]].<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite book|first1=Bernard S. |last1=Bachrach|author2=Clifford J.

The Slavs ultimately submitted, led by their leader Witzin. Charlemagne then accepted the surrender of the [[Veleti]] under Dragovit and demanded many hostages. He also demanded permission to send missionaries into this pagan region unmolested. The army marched to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] before turning around and marching to the Rhine, winning much booty with no harassment. The tributary Slavs became loyal allies. In 795, when the Saxons broke the peace, the Abotrites and Veleti rebelled with their new ruler against the Saxons. Witzin died in battle and Charlemagne avenged him by harrying the Eastphalians on the Elbe. Thrasuco, his successor, led his men to conquest over the Nordalbingians and handed their leaders over to Charlemagne, who honoured him. The Abotrites remained loyal until Charles' death and fought later against the Danes.\n\n===Southeast Slav expeditions===\n[[File:Europe around 800.gif|thumb|Europe around 800]]\n\nWhen Charlemagne incorporated much of Central Europe, he brought the Frankish state face to face with the Avars and Slavs in the southeast.<ref name=\"Bruce Ross\">{{cite journal | last=Bruce Ross | first=James | pages=212\u201335 | jstor=2854596 | title=Two Neglected Paladins of Charlemagne: Erich of Friuli and Gerold of Bavaria Speculum, Vol. 20, No. 2 | journal=Speculum | volume=20 | issue=2 |date = April 1945| doi=10.2307/2854596 }}</ref> The most southeast Frankish neighbours were [[Croats]], who settled in [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Pannonian Croatia]] and [[Dalmatian Croatia]].

Einhard, ''Vita Karoli Magni'',&nbsp;28.</ref> but that debate obscured the more significant question of ''why'' the Pope granted the title and why Charlemagne accepted it.\n\n[[Roger Collins|Collins]] points out \"[t]hat the motivation behind the acceptance of the imperial title was a romantic and antiquarian interest in reviving the Roman empire is highly unlikely.\"{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=147}} For one thing, such romance would not have appealed either to Franks or Roman Catholics at the turn of the ninth century, both of whom viewed the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] heritage of the Roman Empire with distrust. The Franks took pride in having \"fought against and thrown from their shoulders the heavy yoke of the Romans\" and \"from the knowledge gained in baptism, clothed in gold and precious stones the bodies of the holy martyrs whom the Romans had killed by fire, by the sword and by wild animals\", as [[Pepin the Short|Pepin&nbsp;III]] described it in a law of 763 or 764.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}}\n\nFurthermore, the new title\u2014carrying with it the risk that the new emperor would \"make drastic changes to the traditional styles and procedures of government\" or \"concentrate his attentions on Italy or on Mediterranean concerns more generally\"\u2014risked alienating the Frankish leadership.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=149}}\n\nFor both the Pope and Charlemagne, the Roman Empire remained a significant power in European politics at this time. The [[Byzantine Empire]], based in [[Constantinople]], continued to hold a substantial portion of Italy, with borders not far south of Rome. Charles' sitting in judgment of the Pope could be seen as usurping the prerogatives of the Emperor in Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|By whom, however, could he [the Pope] be tried?

In normal circumstances the only conceivable answer to that question would have been the Emperor at Constantinople; but the imperial throne was at this moment occupied by [[Irene of Athens|Irene]]. That the Empress was notorious for having blinded and murdered her own son was, in the minds of both Leo and Charles, almost immaterial: it was enough that she was a woman. The female sex was known to be incapable of governing, and by the old Salic tradition was debarred from doing so. As far as Western Europe was concerned, the Throne of the Emperors was vacant: Irene's claim to it was merely an additional proof, if any were needed, of the degradation into which the so-called Roman Empire had fallen.|[[John Julius Norwich]]{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=378}}|}}\n\n[[File:Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (German - The Coronation of Charlemagne - Google Art Project.jpg|alt=|thumb|Coronation of Charlemagne, drawing by [[Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld]]]]\nFor the Pope, then, there was \"no living Emperor at that time\"{{sfn|Norwich|1992b|p=379}} though [[Henri Pirenne]]{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=234n}} disputes this saying that the coronation \"was not in any sense explained by the fact that at this moment a woman was reigning in Constantinople\". Nonetheless, the Pope took the extraordinary step of creating one. The papacy had since 727 been in conflict with Irene's predecessors in Constantinople over a number of issues, chiefly the continued Byzantine adherence to the doctrine of [[iconoclasm]], the destruction of Christian images; while from 750, the secular power of the Byzantine Empire in central Italy had been nullified.\n\n[[File:Couronnement d'un prince - Sacramentaire de Charles le Chauve Lat1141 f2v.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coronation of an idealised king, depicted in the Sacramentary of [[Charles the Bald]] (about 870)]]\n\nBy bestowing the Imperial crown upon Charlemagne, the Pope arrogated to himself \"the right to appoint&nbsp;... the Emperor of the Romans,&nbsp;... establishing the imperial crown as his own personal gift but simultaneously granting himself implicit superiority over the Emperor whom he had created.\" And \"because the Byzantines had proved so unsatisfactory from every point of view\u2014political, military and doctrinal\u2014he would select a westerner: the one man who by his wisdom and statesmanship and the vastness of his dominions&nbsp;... stood out head and shoulders above his contemporaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Popes: A History|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=978-0701182908|location=|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nWith Charlemagne's coronation, therefore, \"the Roman Empire remained, so far as either of them [Charlemagne and Leo] were concerned, one and indivisible, with Charles as its Emperor\", though there can have been \"little doubt that the coronation, with all that it implied, would be furiously contested in Constantinople\".{{sfn|Norwich|1992a|p=3}}\n\n[[Alcuin]] writes hopefully in his letters of an ''Imperium Christianum'' (\"Christian Empire\"), wherein, \"just as the inhabitants of the [Roman Empire] had been united by a common Roman citizenship\", presumably this new empire would be united by a common Christian faith.{{sfn|Collins|1987|p=151}} This writes the view of Pirenne when he says \"Charles was the Emperor of the ''ecclesia'' as the Pope conceived it, of the Roman Church, regarded as the universal Church\".{{sfn|Pirenne|2012|p=233}} The ''Imperium Christianum'' was further supported at a number of [[synod]]s all across Europe by Paulinus of Aquileia.<ref name=\"Butler1995\">{{cite book |chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XIEAD2MC1YkC|page=74}} |title=Butler's Lives of the Saints: New Full Edition |first=Alban |last=Butler |first2=David |last2=Hugh Farmer |chapter=St Paulinus of Aquileia, Bishop (c. 726\u2013804) |pages=74\u201375 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-86012-250-0}}</ref>\n\nWhat is known, from the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]],{{sfn|Collins|1987|p= 153}} is that Charlemagne's reaction to his coronation was to take the initial steps towards securing the Constantinopolitan throne by sending envoys of marriage to Irene, and that Irene reacted somewhat favourably to them.\n\n[[File:Raphael Charlemagne.jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Charlemagne]]'', by assistants of [[Raphael]], c. 1516\u20131517]]\n\nIt is important to distinguish between the universalist and localist conceptions of the empire, which remain controversial among historians. According to the former, the empire was a universal monarchy, a \"commonwealth of the whole world, whose sublime unity transcended every minor distinction\"; and the emperor \"was entitled to the obedience of Christendom\". According to the latter, the emperor had no ambition for universal dominion; his realm was limited in the same way as that of every other ruler, and when he made more far-reaching claims his object was normally to ward off the attacks either of the Pope or of the Byzantine emperor. According to this view, also, the origin of the empire is to be explained by specific local circumstances rather than by overarching theories.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/269851/Holy-Roman-Empire |title=Holy Roman Empire |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=2013 |accessdate=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Ohnsorge, for a long time, it had been the custom of Byzantium to designate the German princes as spiritual \"sons\" of the Romans. What might have been acceptable in the fifth century had become provoking and insulting to the Franks in the eighth century. Charles came to believe that the Roman emperor, who claimed to head the world hierarchy of states, was, in reality, no greater than Charles himself, a king as other kings, since beginning in 629 he had entitled himself \"Basileus\" (translated literally as \"king\"). Ohnsorge finds it significant that the chief wax seal of Charles, which bore only the inscription: \"Christe, protege Carolum regem Francorum [Christ, protect Charles, king of the Franks], was used from 772 to 813, even during the imperial period and was not replaced by a special imperial seal; indicating that Charles felt himself to be just the king of the Franks. Finally, Ohnsorge points out that in the spring of 813 at Aachen Charles crowned his only surviving son, Louis, as the emperor without recourse to Rome with only the acclamation of his Franks. The form in which this acclamation was offered was Frankish-Christian rather than Roman. This implies both independence from Rome and a Frankish (non-Roman) understanding of empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clc-library-org-docs.angelfire.com/charlemagne.html |title=Ohnsorge, Werner, ''Das Zweikaiserproblem im fr\u00fcheren Mittelalter.

When the family of Charles ceased to produce worthy heirs, the Pope gladly crowned whichever Italian magnate could best protect him from his local enemies.

The council was not recognised by Charlemagne since no Frankish emissaries had been invited, even though Charlemagne ruled more than three provinces of the classical Roman empire and was considered equal in rank to the Byzantine emperor. And while the Pope supported the reintroduction of the iconic veneration, he politically digressed from Byzantium.<ref name=Becher2011/> He certainly desired to increase the influence of the papacy, to honour his saviour Charlemagne, and to solve the constitutional issues then most troubling to European jurists in an era when Rome was not in the hands of an emperor. Thus, Charlemagne's assumption of the imperial title was not a usurpation in the eyes of the Franks or Italians. It was, however, seen as such in Byzantium, where it was protested by Irene and her successor [[Nikephoros I]]\u2014neither of whom had any great effect in enforcing their protests.\n\nThe East Romans, however, still held several territories in Italy: Venice (what was left of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]), [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]] (in [[Calabria]]), [[Otranto]] (in [[Apulia]]), and [[Naples]] (the ''[[Ducatus Neapolitanus]]''). These regions remained outside of Frankish hands until 804, when the Venetians, torn by infighting, transferred their allegiance to the Iron Crown of Pippin, Charles' son. The ''[[Pax Nicephori]]'' ended. Nicephorus ravaged the coasts with a fleet, initiating the only instance of war between the Byzantines and the Franks. The conflict lasted until 810 when the pro-Byzantine party in Venice gave their city back to the Byzantine Emperor, and the two emperors of Europe made peace: Charlemagne received the [[Istria]]n peninsula and in 812 the emperor [[Michael I Rangabe]] recognised his status as Emperor,<ref>''eum imperatorem et basileum appellantes'', cf.

The Danevirke protected Danish land and gave Godfred the opportunity to harass [[Frisia]] and [[Flanders]] with pirate raids. He also subdued the Frank-allied Veleti and fought the Abotrites.\n\nGodfred invaded Frisia, joked of visiting Aachen, but was murdered before he could do any more, either by a Frankish assassin or by one of his own men.

Pursuing his father's reforms, Charlemagne abolished the monetary system based on the gold {{lang|fr|[[solidus (coin)|sou]]}}. Instead, he and the [[Anglo-Saxon monarchs|Anglo-Saxon King]] [[Offa of Mercia]] took up Pippin's system for pragmatic reasons, notably a shortage of the metal.\n\nThe gold shortage was a direct consequence of the conclusion of peace with Byzantium, which resulted in ceding Venice and Sicily to the East and losing their trade routes to Africa. The resulting standardisation economically harmonised and unified the complex array of currencies that had been in use at the commencement of his reign, thus simplifying trade and commerce.\n\n[[File:Charlemagne denier Tours 793 to 812.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denier from the era of Charlemagne, [[Tours]], 793\u2013812]]\nCharlemagne established a new standard, the {{lang|fr|[[French livre|livre carolinienne]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement|libra]]}}, the modern [[pound (currency)|pound]]), which was based upon a pound of silver\u2014a unit of both money and weight\u2014worth 20 sous (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]}} [which was primarily an accounting device and never actually minted], the modern [[shilling]]) or 240 {{lang|fr|[[denier (coin)|deniers]]}} (from the Latin {{lang|la|[[denarius]]}}, the modern [[penny]]). During this period, the {{lang|fr|livre}} and the {{lang|fr|sou}} were counting units; only the {{lang|fr|denier}} was a coin of the realm.\n\nCharlemagne instituted principles for [[accountancy|accounting practice]] by means of the [[Capitulare de villis]] of 802, which laid down strict rules for the way in which incomes and expenses were to be recorded.\n\nCharlemagne applied this system to much of the European continent, and Offa's standard was voluntarily adopted by much of England. After Charlemagne's death, continental coinage degraded, and most of Europe resorted to using the continued high-quality English coin until about 1100.\n\n===Jews in Charlemagne's realm===\nEarly in Charlemagne's rule he tacitly allowed Jews to monopolise money lending. At the time, lending of money for interest was proscribed in 814 because it violated Church law.

His reign is often referred to as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] because of the flowering of scholarship, literature, art and architecture that characterise it.

Joanna Story, (Manchester University Press, 2005), 195.</ref> and Lombard Italy) due to his vast conquests.

At the same time, at the urging of their king, scholars were producing more secular books on many subjects, including history, poetry, art, music, law, theology, etc. Due to the increased number of titles, private libraries flourished. These were mainly supported by aristocrats and churchmen who could afford to sustain them. At Charlemagne's court, a library was founded and a number of copies of books were produced, to be distributed by Charlemagne.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Charlemagne's court library revisited|journal=Early Medieval Europe|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=339\u201363|doi=10.1111/j.0963-9462.2004.00141.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Anderson2013\" /> Book production was completed slowly by hand and took place mainly in large monastic libraries.

Indeed, the earliest manuscripts available for many ancient texts are Carolingian.

The deepening of the spiritual life was later to be seen as central to public policy and royal governance.

Louis received Aquitaine, the Spanish March and [[Provence]]. The imperial title was not mentioned, which led to the suggestion that, at that particular time, Charlemagne regarded the title as an honorary achievement that held no hereditary significance.\n\nPepin died in 810 and Charles in 811. Charlemagne then reconsidered the matter, and in 813, crowned his youngest son, Louis, co-emperor and co-King of the Franks, granting him a half-share of the empire and the rest upon Charlemagne's own death. The only part of the Empire that Louis was not promised was Italy, which Charlemagne specifically bestowed upon Pippin's illegitimate son [[Bernard of Italy|Bernard]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LUCPcwybApIC&pg=PA10&dq=Bernard+of+Italy&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4mIyl-5PXAhVCOyYKHUBcD6oQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=Bernard%20of%20Italy&f=false Noble, Thomas F.

The match was contested by [[Seattle Sounders FC]] and [[Toronto FC]] to determine the champion of the [[2019 Major League Soccer season|2019 season]]. It was a rematch of the [[MLS Cup 2016|2016]] and [[MLS Cup 2017|2017]] editions of the MLS Cup, which were won by Seattle and Toronto, respectively.

The match marked the conclusion of the [[2019 MLS Cup Playoffs]], which was contested by fourteen teams under a new [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] format that replaced the former [[two-legged tie]]s. As a result, this was the earliest calendar date for the MLS Cup showdown since [[MLS Cup 2002|2002]].\n\nThe defending MLS Cup champions were [[Atlanta United FC]], who were eliminated in the Eastern Conference Finals by Toronto FC.

The English word dates back to the 16th century, from the older [[Middle French]] and [[Middle Latin]] equivalents.\n\nAccording to American political scientist [[Larry Diamond]], democracy consists of four key elements: a political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair [[election]]s; the active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life; protection of the [[human rights]] of all citizens; a [[rule of law]], in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.<ref>Diamond, L., Lecture at Hilla University for Humanistic Studies 21 January 2004: [http://web.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/iraq/WhaIsDemocracy012004.htm \"What is Democracy\"]; Diamond, L. and Morlino, L., The quality of democracy (2016).

New York: Routledge. p. 511. {{ISBN|0-415-97334-1}}.</ref> The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class, until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the [[suffrage]] movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nDemocracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in an [[absolute monarchy]], or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an [[oligarchy]]. Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy,<ref>{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Ernest|title=The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle|year=1906|publisher=G.P.

The Constitution was designed to correct the Commonwealth's political flaws and had been preceded by a period of agitation for{{mdash}}and gradual introduction of{{mdash}}reforms, beginning with the [[Convocation Sejm (1764)|Convocation Sejm of 1764]] and the consequent [[Royal elections in Poland|election]] that year of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] as the Commonwealth's last king.\n\nThe Constitution sought to implement a more effective [[constitutional monarchy]], introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, mitigating the worst abuses of [[serfdom]]. It banned pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any single deputy, who could veto and thus undo all the legislation that had been adopted by that Sejm. The Commonwealth's neighbours reacted with hostility to the adoption of the Constitution. [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II]] broke [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]'s alliance with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and joined with [[Catherine the Great]]'s [[Imperial Russia]] and the [[Targowica Confederation]] of anti-reform Polish magnates to defeat the Commonwealth in the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792]].\n\nThe 1791 Constitution was in force for less than 19 months.<ref name=\"Machnikowski2010\"/><ref name=\"Ligeza2017\"/> It was declared null and void by the [[Grodno Sejm]] that met in 1793,<ref name=\"Davies1992\"/><ref name=\"Ligeza2017\"/> though the Sejm's legal power to do so was questionable.<ref name=\"Ligeza2017\"/> The [[Second Partition of Poland|Second]] and [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partitions]] of Poland (1793, 1795) ultimately ended Poland's sovereign existence until the close of [[World War I]] in 1918. Over those 123 years, the 1791 Constitution helped keep alive Polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the country's sovereignty. In the words of two of its principal authors, [[Ignacy Potocki]] and [[Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj]], the 1791 Constitution was \"the last will and testament of the expiring Homeland.\"{{efn|name=Fatherland|Piotr Machnikowski renders the Polish ''\"Ojczyzna\"'' as \"[[Fatherland]]\".<ref name=\"Machnikowski2010\"/> The \"[[literal translation|literal]]\" English translation of \"''ojczyzna''\" is indeed \"[[fatherland]]\": both these words are [[calque]]s of the [[Latin]] \"''patria'',\" which itself derives from the Latin \"''pater''\" (\"father\").   [[:wikisource:Constitution of 3 May 1791|The English translation of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, by Christopher Kasparek]], reproduced in [[Wikisource]] (e.g. at the end of section II, [[:wikisource:Constitution of 3 May 1791#II. The Landed Nobility|\"The Landed Nobility\"]]) renders \"''ojczyzna''\" as \"country\", which is the usual English-language [[Translation#Equivalence|equivalent]] of the expression.  In this particular context, \"Homeland\" may be the most natural rendering.}}\n\nThe Constitution of 3 May 1791 combined a [[monarchy|monarchic]] [[republic]] with a clear division of executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. It is generally considered Europe's first, and the world's second, modern written national constitution, after the [[United States Constitution]] that had come into force in 1789.<ref name=\"Ligeza2017\"/>{{efn|name=Constitution|The claims of \"first\" and \"second constitution\" have been disputed.

The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe, and they are now members or candidate members of the [[European Union]].

Yet variations between democratic institutions are very large across countries which constrains meaningful comparisons using statistical approaches. Since democracy is typically measured aggregately as a macro variable using a single observation for each country and each year, studying democracy faces a range of econometric constraints and is limited to basic correlations.

A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the people's interest, they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so.

Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.<ref>Keen, Benjamin, A History of Latin America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1980.</ref><ref>Kuykendall, Ralph, Hawaii: A History. New York: Prentice Hall, 1948.</ref><ref>Brown, Charles H., The Correspondents' War.

Chicago: Rand McNally & Company, 1963</ref>\n\nParliamentary systems have the right to dismiss a Prime Minister at any point in time that they feel he or she is not doing their job to the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\">O'Neil, Patrick H. Essentials of Comparative Politics. 3rd ed. New York: W.W. Norton 2010. Print</ref> In some countries, the Prime Minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses, and typically the Prime Minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies, extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the \"loyal opposition\". The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.\n\n=====Presidential=====\n{{Main|Presidential system}}\nPresidential Democracy is a system where the public elects the president through free and fair elections. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. Elections typically have a fixed date and aren't easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\"/>\n\nThe president cannot be easily removed from office by the legislature, but he or she cannot remove members of the legislative branch any more easily. This provides some measure of [[separation of powers]]. In consequence, however, the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties, allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\"/>\n\nA [[semi-presidential system]] is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\"/>\n\n====Hybrid or semi-direct====\n{{See also|Politics of Switzerland|Voting in Switzerland}}\nSome modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic.

For example, in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].<ref name= Kopstein2014/><ref name=refNARoP />\n\nIn other countries, the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in France, China, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece and Egypt). An elected president, with or without significant powers, became the head of state in these countries.\n\nElite upper houses of legislatures, which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure, were common in many nations. Over time, these either had their powers limited (as with the British [[House of Lords]]) or else became elective and remained powerful (as with the [[Australian Senate]]).\n\n====Republic====\n{{Main|Republicanism}}\nThe term ''[[republic]]'' has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected [[head of state]], such as a [[President (government title)|president]], serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary [[monarch]] as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed [[head of government]] such as a [[Prime Minister|prime minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/republic |title=Republic \u2013 Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-W.com |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] rarely praised and often criticised democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean direct democracy, often without the protection of a constitution enshrining basic rights; [[James Madison]] argued, especially in [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' No. 10]], that what distinguished a direct ''democracy'' from a ''republic'' was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.\n\nWhat was critical to American values, [[John Adams]] insisted,<ref>Novanglus, no. 7. 6 March 1775</ref> was that the government be \"bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend.\" As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the U.S. constitution, a woman asked him \"Well, Doctor, what have we got\u2014a republic or a monarchy?\".

In other words, citizens can \"vote with their feet\" or \"vote with their dollars\", resulting in significant informal government-by-the-masses that exercises many \"powers\" associated with formal government elsewhere.\n\n====Socialist====\n{{See also|Democracy in Marxism}}\n\n[[Socialism|Socialist]] thought has several different views on democracy. [[Social democracy]], [[democratic socialism]], and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (usually exercised through [[Soviet democracy]]) are some examples. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of [[participatory democracy|participatory]], [[industrial democracy|industrial]], [[economic democracy|economic]] and/or [[workplace democracy]] combined with a [[representative democracy]].\n\nWithin [[Democracy in Marxist theory|Marxist orthodoxy]] there is a hostility to what is commonly called \"liberal democracy\", which is simply referred to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature. Because of orthodox Marxists' desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism, [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[Leninism|Leninists]] and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of [[commune (Socialism)|communes]] (which are sometimes called [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]). This system ultimately manifests itself as council democracy and begins with workplace democracy.\n\n{{quote|Democracy cannot consist solely of elections that are nearly always fictitious and managed by rich landowners and professional politicians.|[[Che Guevara]]|Speech, Uruguay, 1961<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1961/08/08.htm \"Economics Cannot be Separated from Politics\"] speech by Che Guevara to the ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (CIES), in Punta del Este, Uruguay on August 8, 1961</ref>}}\n\n====Anarchist====\n[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a [[Tyranny of the majority|majority-rule is tyrannic or not]].  To many anarchists, the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.<ref>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''General Idea of the Revolution'' See also commentary by [[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/proudhon/grahamproudhon.html ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution'']</ref> However, [[anarcho-communist]] [[Murray Bookchin]] criticised [[individualist anarchists]] for opposing democracy,<ref>Bookchin, Murray.

[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/soclife.html Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]</ref>\n\nSome anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt-in favour of a non-majoritarian form of [[consensus democracy]], similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy.<ref>Graeber, David and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''</ref> [[Henry David Thoreau]], who did not self-identify as an anarchist but argued for \"a better government\"<ref name=\"disobedience\">Thoreau, H.D. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/71/71.txt On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]''</ref> and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists, argued that people should not be in the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is no consent.\n\n====Sortition====\n{{Main|Sortition}}\nSometimes called \"democracy without elections\", [[sortition]] chooses decision makers via a random process. The intention is that those chosen will be representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large, and be more fair and impartial than an elected official. The technique was in widespread use in [[Athenian Democracy]] and [[Republic of Florence|Renaissance Florence]]<ref name=\"Imprint Academic\">{{cite book|last1=Dowlen|first1=Oliver|title=The Political Potential of Sortition: A study of the random selection of citizens for public office|date=2008|publisher=Imprint Academic}}</ref> and is still used in modern [[jury selection]].\n\n====Consociational====\n{{Main|Consociational democracy}}\nA consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno-religious constituencies, and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them.\n\n====Consensus democracy====\n{{Main| Consensus democracy}}\nA consensus democracy, in contrast, would not be dichotomous. Instead, decisions would be based on a multi-option approach, and policies would be enacted if they gained sufficient support, either in a purely verbal agreement or via a consensus vote\u2014a multi-option preference vote. If the threshold of support were at a sufficiently high level, minorities would be as it were protected automatically. Furthermore, any voting would be ethno-colour blind.\n\n====Supranational====\n[[Qualified majority voting]] is designed by the [[Treaty of Rome]] to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the [[European Council of Ministers]]. This system allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. This might be seen as a form of representative democracy, but representatives to the Council might be appointed rather than directly elected.\n\n====Inclusive====\n{{Youth rights sidebar}}\n{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}\nInclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for [[direct democracy]] in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, [[economic democracy]] in a [[Stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in \"Towards An Inclusive Democracy\" and was further developed in the journal ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''.\n\nThe basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. An inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.\n\nThe citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker. Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example, to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle, by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.\n\n====Participatory politics====\n{{Main|Participatory politics}}\nA [[Parpolity]] or Participatory Polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a [[Parpolity|Nested Council]] structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25\u201350 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.\n\nA council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the [[tyranny of the majority]], and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a [[participatory economy]].\n\n====Cosmopolitan====\n{{Main|Cosmopolitan democracy}}\nCosmopolitan democracy, also known as ''Global democracy'' or ''World Federalism'', is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |title=Article on Cosmopolitan democracy by Daniele Archibugi |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220629/http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing [[international organisations]], e.g. the [[United Nations]], as well as the creation of new institutions such as a [[World Parliament]], which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.\n\nCosmopolitan Democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |title=letter by Einstein \u2013 \"To the General Assembly of the United Nations\" |accessdate=2 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510174259/http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |archive-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}, first published in United Nations World New York, Oct 1947, pp. 13\u201314</ref> writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist [[George Monbiot]], and professors [[David Held]] and [[Daniele Archibugi]].<ref>Daniele Archibugi & David Held, eds., ''Cosmopolitan Democracy.

Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy''], Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008</ref> The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.\n\n====Creative democracy====\n{{Main|Creative democracy}}\nCreative Democracy is advocated by American philosopher [[John Dewey]]. The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of \"Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212175652/http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf |archive-date=12 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a [[Morality|moral ideal]] requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. \"The task of democracy\", Dewey concludes, \"is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute\".\n\n====Guided democracy====\n{{Main|Guided democracy}}\nGuided democracy is a form of democracy which incorporates regular popular elections, but which often carefully \"guides\" the choices offered to the electorate in a manner which may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them.  Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority.  Russian-style democracy has often been referred to as a \"Guided democracy.\"<ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/17149/pdf Ten Years After the Soviet Breakup: From Democratization to \"Guided Democracy\"] Journal of Democracy.

Many [[non-governmental organisation]]s decide policy and leadership by voting. Most [[trade union]]s and [[cooperative]]s are governed by democratic elections. [[Corporation]]s are controlled by [[shareholder]]s on the principle of [[one share, one vote]]\u2014sometimes supplemented by [[workplace democracy]]. [[Amitai Etzioni]] has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with [[sharia law]], termed ''islamocracy''.<ref>\nCompare:\n{{cite book\n|last1= Tibi|first1= Bassam\n|title= The Sharia State: Arab Spring and Democratization\n|date= 2013|page= 161\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uXAdAAAAQBAJ\n|isbn= 978-1-135-92468-3\n}}\n</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Theory<!--'Democratic theory' redirects here-->==\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|A marble statue of [[Aristotle]]]]\n\n===Aristotle===\n[[Aristotle]] contrasted rule by the many (democracy/[[timocracy]]), with rule by the few ([[oligarchy]]/[[aristocracy]]), and with rule by a single person ([[tyranny]] or today [[autocracy]]/[[absolute monarchy]]). He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system (he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.8.viii.html |title=Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII, Chapter 10 (1160a.31-1161a.9) |publisher=Internet Classics Archive |date= |accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aristotl.htm|title=Aristotle |encyclopedia= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>\n\nFor Aristotle, the underlying principle of democracy is freedom, since only in a democracy can the citizens have a share in freedom. In essence, he argues that this is what every democracy should make its aim. There are two main aspects of freedom: being ruled and ruling in turn, since everyone is equal according to number, not merit, and to be able to live as one pleases.\n\n{{quote|But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth,&nbsp;...

Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on [[voting]], where the policy with the most votes gets implemented.\n\nDifferent variants of aggregative democracy exist. Under ''minimalism'', democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not \"rule\" because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] articulated this view most famously in his book ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''.<ref>[[Joseph Schumpeter]], (1950). ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''. Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-133008-6}}.</ref> Contemporary proponents of minimalism include [[William H. Riker]], [[Adam Przeworski]], [[Richard Posner]].\n\nAccording to the theory of [[direct democracy]], on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.\n\nGovernments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter\u2014with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. [[Anthony Downs]] suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.<ref>[[Anthony Downs]], (1957). ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''. Harper Collins College. {{ISBN|0-06-041750-1}}.</ref>\n\n[[Robert A. Dahl]] argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term [[polyarchy]] to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open [[elections]] which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.<ref>[[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl, Robert]], (1989). ''Democracy and its Critics''. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-04938-2}}</ref> Similarly, [[Ronald Dworkin]] argues that \"democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.\"<ref>Dworkin, Ronald (2006). ''Is Democracy Possible Here?'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-13872-5}}, p. 134.</ref>\n\n====Deliberative====\n''[[Deliberative democracy]]'' is based on the notion that democracy is government by [[deliberation]]. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. ''Authentic deliberation'' is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.<ref>Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson (2002). ''Why Deliberative Democracy?''

Democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Main|Criticism of democracy}}\n[[File:2011 Wisconsin Budget Protests 1 JO.jpg|thumb|Protests]]\n\n<ref></ref>===Inefficiencies===\n\nSome economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy, citing the premise of the irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information in order to make a truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Democracy a Pre-Condition in Economic Growth? A Perspective from the Rise of Modern China|url=https://unchronicle.un.org/article/democracy-pre-condition-economic-growth-perspective-rise-modern-china|website=UN Chronicle|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, [[Socrates]] believed that democracy without educated masses (educated in the more broader sense of being knowledgeable and responsible) would only lead to populism being the criteria to become an elected leader and not competence. This would ultimately lead to a demise of the nation. This was quoted by Plato in book 10 of The Republic, in Socrates' conversation with Adimantus.<ref name=\"Republic\">{{cite book|last1=Conversation of Socrates|first1=Plato|last2=H|first2=Translated by Spens|title=The Republic of Plato \u2013 Book ten \u2013 A conversation between Socrates and Admimantus}}</ref> Socrates was of the opinion that the right to vote must not be an indiscriminate right (for example by birth or citizenship), but must be given only to people who thought sufficiently of their choice.\n\nAnother downside of democracy is the tension it creates between people and the associated stresses. It's been shown that democracy, voting, can be harmful to health.\n\n===Popular rule as a fa\u00e7ade===\n\nThe 20th-century Italian thinkers [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Gaetano Mosca]] (independently) argued that democracy was illusory, and served only to mask the reality of elite rule. Indeed, they argued that elite oligarchy is the unbendable law of human nature, due largely to the apathy and division of the masses (as opposed to the drive, initiative and unity of the elites), and that democratic institutions would do no more than shift the exercise of power from oppression to manipulation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Against the masses : varieties of anti-democratic thought since the French Revolution|first=Joseph V.|last=Femia|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-828063-7|location=Oxford|oclc=46641885}}</ref> As [[Louis Brandeis]] once professed, \"We may have democracy, or we may have [[wealth]] concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\"{{clarify|date=March 2018}}.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mr. Justice Brandeis, great American;press opinion and public appraisal|last=Dilliard|first=Irving|date=1941|publisher=Saint Louis|isbn=|location=|pages=|hdl = 2027/mdp.39015009170443}}</ref> British writer [[Ivo Mosley]], grandson of blackshirt [[Oswald Mosley]] describes in ''In the Name of the People: Pseudo-Democracy and the Spoiling of Our World'', how and why current forms of electoral governance are destined to fall short of their promise.<ref>{{cite news|work=Publishers Weekly|title=Book Review, In the Name of the People|date=3 April 2013|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/9781845402624}}</ref>\nA study led by Princeton professor Martin Gilens of 1,779 U.S. government decisions concluded that\n\"elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.\" <ref>\"Testing theories of American politics: Elites, interest groups, and average citizens\", M.

Dutton & Co. Inc.), 558-C.</ref> In his work, Plato lists [[Plato's five regimes|5 forms of government]] from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only Kallipolis, an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a just form of government.<ref>The contrast between Plato's theory of philosopher-kings, arresting change, and Aristotle's embrace of change is the historical tension espoused by [[Karl Raimund Popper]] in his WWII treatise, ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1943).</ref>\n\n[[James Madison]] critiqued direct democracy (which he referred to simply as \"democracy\") in [[Federalist No. 10]], arguing that representative democracy\u2014which he described using the term \"republic\"\u2014is a preferable form of government, saying: \"...&nbsp;democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\" Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against [[tyranny of the majority]], stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: \"the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic\".\n\n===Political instability===\n\nMore recently, democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline-grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth.

The uncertainty of outcomes is inherent in democracy.

The English word dates back to the 16th century, from the older [[Middle French]] and [[Middle Latin]] equivalents.\n\nAccording to American political scientist [[Larry Diamond]], democracy consists of four key elements: a political system for choosing and replacing the government through free and fair [[election]]s; the active participation of the people, as citizens, in politics and civic life; protection of the [[human rights]] of all citizens; a [[rule of law]], in which the laws and procedures apply equally to all citizens.<ref>Diamond, L., Lecture at Hilla University for Humanistic Studies 21 January 2004: [http://web.stanford.edu/~ldiamond/iraq/WhaIsDemocracy012004.htm \"What is Democracy\"]; Diamond, L. and Morlino, L., The quality of democracy (2016).

While theoretically, these definitions are in opposition, in practice the distinction has been blurred historically.<ref>Wilson, N.G. (2006). ''Encyclopedia of ancient Greece''. New York: Routledge. p. 511. {{ISBN|0-415-97334-1}}.</ref> The political system of Classical Athens, for example, granted democratic citizenship to free men and excluded slaves and women from political participation. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history, democratic citizenship consisted of an elite class, until full enfranchisement was won for all adult citizens in most modern democracies through the [[suffrage]] movements of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nDemocracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by an individual, as in an [[absolute monarchy]], or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an [[oligarchy]]. Nevertheless, these oppositions, inherited from Greek philosophy,<ref>{{cite book|last=Barker|first=Ernest|title=The Political Thought of Plato and Aristotle|year=1906|publisher=G.P.

The Constitution was designed to correct the Commonwealth's political flaws and had been preceded by a period of agitation for{{mdash}}and gradual introduction of{{mdash}}reforms, beginning with the [[Convocation Sejm (1764)|Convocation Sejm of 1764]] and the consequent [[Royal elections in Poland|election]] that year of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] as the Commonwealth's last king.\n\nThe Constitution sought to implement a more effective [[constitutional monarchy]], introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility, and placed the peasants under the protection of the government, mitigating the worst abuses of [[serfdom]]. It banned pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which had put the Sejm at the mercy of any single deputy, who could veto and thus undo all the legislation that had been adopted by that Sejm. The Commonwealth's neighbours reacted with hostility to the adoption of the Constitution. [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II]] broke [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]'s alliance with the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and joined with [[Catherine the Great]]'s [[Imperial Russia]] and the [[Targowica Confederation]] of anti-reform Polish magnates to defeat the Commonwealth in the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792]].\n\nThe 1791 Constitution was in force for less than 19 months.<ref name=\"Machnikowski2010\"/><ref name=\"Ligeza2017\"/> It was declared null and void by the [[Grodno Sejm]] that met in 1793,<ref name=\"Davies1992\"/><ref name=\"Ligeza2017\"/> though the Sejm's legal power to do so was questionable.<ref name=\"Ligeza2017\"/> The [[Second Partition of Poland|Second]] and [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partitions]] of Poland (1793, 1795) ultimately ended Poland's sovereign existence until the close of [[World War I]] in 1918. Over those 123 years, the 1791 Constitution helped keep alive Polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the country's sovereignty. In the words of two of its principal authors, [[Ignacy Potocki]] and [[Hugo Ko\u0142\u0142\u0105taj]], the 1791 Constitution was \"the last will and testament of the expiring Homeland.\"{{efn|name=Fatherland|Piotr Machnikowski renders the Polish ''\"Ojczyzna\"'' as \"[[Fatherland]]\".<ref name=\"Machnikowski2010\"/> The \"[[literal translation|literal]]\" English translation of \"''ojczyzna''\" is indeed \"[[fatherland]]\": both these words are [[calque]]s of the [[Latin]] \"''patria'',\" which itself derives from the Latin \"''pater''\" (\"father\").   [[:wikisource:Constitution of 3 May 1791|The English translation of the Constitution of 3 May 1791, by Christopher Kasparek]], reproduced in [[Wikisource]] (e.g. at the end of section II, [[:wikisource:Constitution of 3 May 1791#II. The Landed Nobility|\"The Landed Nobility\"]]) renders \"''ojczyzna''\" as \"country\", which is the usual English-language [[Translation#Equivalence|equivalent]] of the expression.  In this particular context, \"Homeland\" may be the most natural rendering.}}\n\nThe Constitution of 3 May 1791 combined a [[monarchy|monarchic]] [[republic]] with a clear division of executive, legislative, and judiciary powers.

Yet variations between democratic institutions are very large across countries which constrains meaningful comparisons using statistical approaches. Since democracy is typically measured aggregately as a macro variable using a single observation for each country and each year, studying democracy faces a range of econometric constraints and is limited to basic correlations.

Under a parliamentary democracy, government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review, checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people.<ref>Keen, Benjamin, A History of Latin America. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1980.</ref><ref>Kuykendall, Ralph, Hawaii: A History. New York: Prentice Hall, 1948.</ref><ref>Brown, Charles H., The Correspondents' War.

Chicago: Rand McNally & Company, 1963</ref>\n\nParliamentary systems have the right to dismiss a Prime Minister at any point in time that they feel he or she is not doing their job to the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office by a majority support for his or her dismissal.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\">O'Neil, Patrick H. Essentials of Comparative Politics. 3rd ed. New York: W.W. Norton 2010. Print</ref> In some countries, the Prime Minister can also call an election whenever he or she so chooses, and typically the Prime Minister will hold an election when he or she knows that they are in good favour with the public as to get re-elected. In other parliamentary democracies, extra elections are virtually never held, a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the \"loyal opposition\". The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party (or coalition) opposes the governing party (or coalition), while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles.\n\n=====Presidential=====\n{{Main|Presidential system}}\nPresidential Democracy is a system where the public elects the president through free and fair elections. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. Elections typically have a fixed date and aren't easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet, specifically appointing the cabinet members.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\"/>\n\nThe president cannot be easily removed from office by the legislature, but he or she cannot remove members of the legislative branch any more easily. This provides some measure of [[separation of powers]]. In consequence, however, the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties, allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas, Africa, and Central and Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\"/>\n\nA [[semi-presidential system]] is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country.<ref name=\"O'Neil, Patrick H 2010\"/>\n\n====Hybrid or semi-direct====\n{{See also|Politics of Switzerland|Voting in Switzerland}}\nSome modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic.

This creates a hybrid form of government, with a local [[direct democracy]] and a representative state government. For example, most [[Vermont]] towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected, budgets for the town and schools are voted on, and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.state.vt.us/townmeeting/citizens_guide.html |title=A Citizen's Guide To Vermont Town Meeting |date=July 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805023214/http://www.sec.state.vt.us/TownMeeting/citizens_guide.html |archivedate=5 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Variants===\n\n====Constitutional monarchy====\n{{main|Constitutional monarchy}}\n[[File:Elizabeth II greets NASA GSFC employees, May 8, 2007 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Queen [[Elizabeth II]], a constitutional monarch]]\n\nMany countries such as the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian countries]], [[Thailand]], [[Japan]] and [[Bhutan]] turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs with limited or, often gradually, merely symbolic roles. For example, in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom, constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and passage of the [[Bill of Rights 1689]].<ref name= Kopstein2014/><ref name=refNARoP />\n\nIn other countries, the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system (as in France, China, Russia, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Greece and Egypt). An elected president, with or without significant powers, became the head of state in these countries.\n\nElite upper houses of legislatures, which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure, were common in many nations. Over time, these either had their powers limited (as with the British [[House of Lords]]) or else became elective and remained powerful (as with the [[Australian Senate]]).\n\n====Republic====\n{{Main|Republicanism}}\nThe term ''[[republic]]'' has many different meanings, but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected [[head of state]], such as a [[President (government title)|president]], serving for a limited term, in contrast to states with a hereditary [[monarch]] as a head of state, even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed [[head of government]] such as a [[Prime Minister|prime minister]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/republic |title=Republic \u2013 Definition from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher=M-W.com |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] rarely praised and often criticised democracy, which in their time tended to specifically mean direct democracy, often without the protection of a constitution enshrining basic rights; [[James Madison]] argued, especially in [[Federalist No. 10|''The Federalist'' No. 10]], that what distinguished a direct ''democracy'' from a ''republic'' was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction, whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure.\n\nWhat was critical to American values, [[John Adams]] insisted,<ref>Novanglus, no. 7. 6 March 1775</ref> was that the government be \"bound by fixed laws, which the people have a voice in making, and a right to defend.\" As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the U.S. constitution, a woman asked him \"Well, Doctor, what have we got\u2014a republic or a monarchy?\". He replied \"A republic\u2014if you can keep it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch18I.html |title=''The Founders' Constitution: Volume 1, Chapter 18, Introduction'', \"Epilogue: Securing the Republic\" |publisher=Press-pubs.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Liberal democracy====\n{{main|Liberal democracy}}\nA liberal democracy is a representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decision-making power is subject to the [[rule of law]], and moderated by a constitution or laws that emphasise the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities (see [[civil liberties]]).\n\nIn a liberal democracy, it is possible for some large-scale decisions to [[Emergent democracy|emerge]] from the many individual decisions that citizens are free to make. In other words, citizens can \"vote with their feet\" or \"vote with their dollars\", resulting in significant informal government-by-the-masses that exercises many \"powers\" associated with formal government elsewhere.\n\n====Socialist====\n{{See also|Democracy in Marxism}}\n\n[[Socialism|Socialist]] thought has several different views on democracy. [[Social democracy]], [[democratic socialism]], and the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (usually exercised through [[Soviet democracy]]) are some examples. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of [[participatory democracy|participatory]], [[industrial democracy|industrial]], [[economic democracy|economic]] and/or [[workplace democracy]] combined with a [[representative democracy]].\n\nWithin [[Democracy in Marxist theory|Marxist orthodoxy]] there is a hostility to what is commonly called \"liberal democracy\", which is simply referred to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature. Because of orthodox Marxists' desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism, [[Marxism|Marxists]], [[Leninism|Leninists]] and [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of [[commune (Socialism)|communes]] (which are sometimes called [[Soviet (council)|soviets]]). This system ultimately manifests itself as council democracy and begins with workplace democracy.\n\n{{quote|Democracy cannot consist solely of elections that are nearly always fictitious and managed by rich landowners and professional politicians.|[[Che Guevara]]|Speech, Uruguay, 1961<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1961/08/08.htm \"Economics Cannot be Separated from Politics\"] speech by Che Guevara to the ministerial meeting of the Inter-American Economic and Social Council (CIES), in Punta del Este, Uruguay on August 8, 1961</ref>}}\n\n====Anarchist====\n[[Anarchism|Anarchists]] are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a [[Tyranny of the majority|majority-rule is tyrannic or not]].  To many anarchists, the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy. [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.<ref>Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. ''General Idea of the Revolution'' See also commentary by [[Robert Graham (historian)|Graham, Robert]]. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANARCHIST_ARCHIVES/proudhon/grahamproudhon.html ''The General Idea of Proudhon's Revolution'']</ref> However, [[anarcho-communist]] [[Murray Bookchin]] criticised [[individualist anarchists]] for opposing democracy,<ref>Bookchin, Murray.

[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bookchin/soclife.html Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm]</ref>\n\nSome anarcho-communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and opt-in favour of a non-majoritarian form of [[consensus democracy]], similar to Proudhon's position on direct democracy.<ref>Graeber, David and Grubacic, Andrej. ''Anarchism, Or The Revolutionary Movement Of The Twenty-first Century''</ref> [[Henry David Thoreau]], who did not self-identify as an anarchist but argued for \"a better government\"<ref name=\"disobedience\">Thoreau, H.D. ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/71/71.txt On the Duty of Civil Disobedience]''</ref> and is cited as an inspiration by some anarchists, argued that people should not be in the position of ruling others or being ruled when there is no consent.\n\n====Sortition====\n{{Main|Sortition}}\nSometimes called \"democracy without elections\", [[sortition]] chooses decision makers via a random process. The intention is that those chosen will be representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large, and be more fair and impartial than an elected official. The technique was in widespread use in [[Athenian Democracy]] and [[Republic of Florence|Renaissance Florence]]<ref name=\"Imprint Academic\">{{cite book|last1=Dowlen|first1=Oliver|title=The Political Potential of Sortition: A study of the random selection of citizens for public office|date=2008|publisher=Imprint Academic}}</ref> and is still used in modern [[jury selection]].\n\n====Consociational====\n{{Main|Consociational democracy}}\nA consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethno-religious constituencies, and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them.\n\n====Consensus democracy====\n{{Main| Consensus democracy}}\nA consensus democracy, in contrast, would not be dichotomous. Instead, decisions would be based on a multi-option approach, and policies would be enacted if they gained sufficient support, either in a purely verbal agreement or via a consensus vote\u2014a multi-option preference vote. If the threshold of support were at a sufficiently high level, minorities would be as it were protected automatically. Furthermore, any voting would be ethno-colour blind.\n\n====Supranational====\n[[Qualified majority voting]] is designed by the [[Treaty of Rome]] to be the principal method of reaching decisions in the [[European Council of Ministers]]. This system allocates votes to member states in part according to their population, but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. This might be seen as a form of representative democracy, but representatives to the Council might be appointed rather than directly elected.\n\n====Inclusive====\n{{Youth rights sidebar}}\n{{Main|Inclusive democracy}}\nInclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for [[direct democracy]] in all fields of social life: political democracy in the form of face-to-face assemblies which are confederated, [[economic democracy]] in a [[Stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy, democracy in the social realm, i.e. [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] in places of work and education, and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher [[Takis Fotopoulos]] in \"Towards An Inclusive Democracy\" and was further developed in the journal ''[[Democracy & Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''.\n\nThe basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. An inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.\n\nThe citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker. Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example, to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle, by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.\n\n====Participatory politics====\n{{Main|Participatory politics}}\nA [[Parpolity]] or Participatory Polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a [[Parpolity|Nested Council]] structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decision making power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25\u201350 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them, and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council.\n\nA council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the [[tyranny of the majority]], and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of most lower-level councils, however, not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a [[participatory economy]].\n\n====Cosmopolitan====\n{{Main|Cosmopolitan democracy}}\nCosmopolitan democracy, also known as ''Global democracy'' or ''World Federalism'', is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale, either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who, by definition, cannot vote. By contrast, in a cosmopolitan democracy, the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |title=Article on Cosmopolitan democracy by Daniele Archibugi |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220629/http://www.danielearchibugi.org/downloads/papers/CD_and_critics_A_review.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to its supporters, any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy, including the rule of law; the non-violent resolution of conflicts; and equality among citizens, beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented, this would require reforming existing [[international organisations]], e.g. the [[United Nations]], as well as the creation of new institutions such as a [[World Parliament]], which ideally would enhance public control over, and accountability in, international politics.\n\nCosmopolitan Democracy has been promoted, among others, by physicist Albert Einstein,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |title=letter by Einstein \u2013 \"To the General Assembly of the United Nations\" |accessdate=2 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510174259/http://neutrino.aquaphoenix.com/un-esa/ws1997-letter-einstein.html |archive-date=10 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}, first published in United Nations World New York, Oct 1947, pp. 13\u201314</ref> writer Kurt Vonnegut, columnist [[George Monbiot]], and professors [[David Held]] and [[Daniele Archibugi]].<ref>Daniele Archibugi & David Held, eds., ''Cosmopolitan Democracy.

Toward Cosmopolitan Democracy''], Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2008</ref> The creation of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy.\n\n====Creative democracy====\n{{Main|Creative democracy}}\nCreative Democracy is advocated by American philosopher [[John Dewey]]. The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of \"Creative Democracy: The Task Before Us\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212175652/http://pages.uoregon.edu/koopman/courses_readings/dewey/dewey_creative_democracy.pdf |archive-date=12 February 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and an experience built on faith in human nature, faith in human beings, and faith in working with others. Democracy, in Dewey's view, is a [[Morality|moral ideal]] requiring actual effort and work by people; it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. \"The task of democracy\", Dewey concludes, \"is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute\".\n\n====Guided democracy====\n{{Main|Guided democracy}}\nGuided democracy is a form of democracy which incorporates regular popular elections, but which often carefully \"guides\" the choices offered to the electorate in a manner which may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them.  Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority.  Russian-style democracy has often been referred to as a \"Guided democracy.\"<ref>[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/17149/pdf Ten Years After the Soviet Breakup: From Democratization to \"Guided Democracy\"] Journal of Democracy.

Many [[non-governmental organisation]]s decide policy and leadership by voting. Most [[trade union]]s and [[cooperative]]s are governed by democratic elections. [[Corporation]]s are controlled by [[shareholder]]s on the principle of [[one share, one vote]]\u2014sometimes supplemented by [[workplace democracy]]. [[Amitai Etzioni]] has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with [[sharia law]], termed ''islamocracy''.<ref>\nCompare:\n{{cite book\n|last1= Tibi|first1= Bassam\n|title= The Sharia State: Arab Spring and Democratization\n|date= 2013|page= 161\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uXAdAAAAQBAJ\n|isbn= 978-1-135-92468-3\n}}\n</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Theory<!--'Democratic theory' redirects here-->==\n[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|upright|A marble statue of [[Aristotle]]]]\n\n===Aristotle===\n[[Aristotle]] contrasted rule by the many (democracy/[[timocracy]]), with rule by the few ([[oligarchy]]/[[aristocracy]]), and with rule by a single person ([[tyranny]] or today [[autocracy]]/[[absolute monarchy]]). He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system (he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.8.viii.html |title=Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Book VIII, Chapter 10 (1160a.31-1161a.9) |publisher=Internet Classics Archive |date= |accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/aristotl.htm|title=Aristotle |encyclopedia= Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>\n\nFor Aristotle, the underlying principle of democracy is freedom, since only in a democracy can the citizens have a share in freedom. In essence, he argues that this is what every democracy should make its aim. There are two main aspects of freedom: being ruled and ruling in turn, since everyone is equal according to number, not merit, and to be able to live as one pleases.\n\n{{quote|But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn; for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number, not worth,&nbsp;...

Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on [[voting]], where the policy with the most votes gets implemented.\n\nDifferent variants of aggregative democracy exist. Under ''minimalism'', democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not \"rule\" because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] articulated this view most famously in his book ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''.<ref>[[Joseph Schumpeter]], (1950). ''Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy''. Harper Perennial. {{ISBN|0-06-133008-6}}.</ref> Contemporary proponents of minimalism include [[William H. Riker]], [[Adam Przeworski]], [[Richard Posner]].\n\nAccording to the theory of [[direct democracy]], on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socialises and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly, citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.\n\nGovernments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter\u2014with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. [[Anthony Downs]] suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''.<ref>[[Anthony Downs]], (1957). ''An Economic Theory of Democracy''. Harper Collins College. {{ISBN|0-06-041750-1}}.</ref>\n\n[[Robert A. Dahl]] argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term [[polyarchy]] to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open [[elections]] which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.<ref>[[Robert A. Dahl|Dahl, Robert]], (1989). ''Democracy and its Critics''. New Haven: Yale University Press. {{ISBN|0-300-04938-2}}</ref> Similarly, [[Ronald Dworkin]] argues that \"democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.\"<ref>Dworkin, Ronald (2006). ''Is Democracy Possible Here?'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-13872-5}}, p. 134.</ref>\n\n====Deliberative====\n''[[Deliberative democracy]]'' is based on the notion that democracy is government by [[deliberation]]. Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. ''Authentic deliberation'' is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.<ref>Gutmann, Amy, and Dennis Thompson (2002). ''Why Deliberative Democracy?'' Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-12019-5}}</ref><ref>Joshua Cohen, \"Deliberation and Democratic Legitimacy\" in Essays on Reason and Politics: Deliberative Democracy Ed.

Democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes.\n\n==Criticism==\n{{Main|Criticism of democracy}}\n[[File:2011 Wisconsin Budget Protests 1 JO.jpg|thumb|Protests]]\n\n===Inefficiencies===\n\nSome economists have criticized the efficiency of democracy, citing the premise of the irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information in order to make a truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to go forward with a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Is Democracy a Pre-Condition in Economic Growth? A Perspective from the Rise of Modern China|url=https://unchronicle.un.org/article/democracy-pre-condition-economic-growth-perspective-rise-modern-china|website=UN Chronicle|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, [[Socrates]] believed that democracy without educated masses (educated in the more broader sense of being knowledgeable and responsible) would only lead to populism being the criteria to become an elected leader and not competence. This would ultimately lead to a demise of the nation.

Dutton & Co. Inc.), 558-C.</ref> In his work, Plato lists [[Plato's five regimes|5 forms of government]] from best to worst. Assuming that ''the Republic'' was intended to be a serious critique of the political thought in Athens, Plato argues that only Kallipolis, an aristocracy led by the unwilling philosopher-kings (the wisest men), is a just form of government.<ref>The contrast between Plato's theory of philosopher-kings, arresting change, and Aristotle's embrace of change is the historical tension espoused by [[Karl Raimund Popper]] in his WWII treatise, ''The Open Society and its Enemies'' (1943).</ref>\n\n[[James Madison]] critiqued direct democracy (which he referred to simply as \"democracy\") in [[Federalist No. 10]], arguing that representative democracy\u2014which he described using the term \"republic\"\u2014is a preferable form of government, saying: \"...&nbsp;democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.\" Madison offered that republics were superior to democracies because republics safeguarded against [[tyranny of the majority]], stating in [[Federalist No. 10]]: \"the same advantage which a republic has over a democracy, in controlling the effects of faction, is enjoyed by a large over a small republic\".\n\n===Political instability===\n\nMore recently, democracy is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected on and off there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline-grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are often enough to force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that democracy is undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7671283.stm | work=BBC News | title=Head to head: African democracy | date=16 October 2008 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThis opportunist alliance not only has the handicap of having to cater to too many ideologically opposing factions, but it is usually short-lived since any perceived or actual imbalance in the treatment of coalition partners, or changes to leadership in the coalition partners themselves, can very easily result in the coalition partner withdrawing its support from the government.\n\nBiased media has been accused of causing political instability, resulting in the obstruction of democracy, rather than its promotion.<ref>''The Review of Policy Research, Volume 22, Issues 1\u20133'', Policy Studies Organization, Potomac Institute for Policy Studies.
