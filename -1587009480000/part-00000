The two share a single, conscious mind, and her personality is a blending of the characteristics of both the host and the symbiont. As such, Jadzia has access to all the skills and memories of the symbiont's seven previous hosts. Jadzia holds academic degrees in [[Astrobiology|exobiology]], [[zoology]], [[astrophysics]] and [[Xenoarchaeology|exoarchaeology]], all of which she earned before the joining.\n\nJadzia Dax is the station's chief science officer, and is close friends with commander [[Benjamin Sisko]] and Bajoran first officer [[Kira Nerys]]. Later in the series, she becomes involved with the [[Klingon]] character [[Worf]], and they marry during the sixth season of the show. Her character is killed by [[Dukat (Star Trek)|Gul Dukat]] during the sixth-season finale (due to Farrell's desire for a reduced role so that she could have time for other things, which producer Rick Berman refused to allow). The character of Dax re-emerges in the seventh-season premiere in the form of [[Ezri Dax]].\n\n==Development==\n===Make-up===\nWhen selecting the characters for ''Deep Space Nine'', the production staff knew that they'd have humans, [[Bajoran]]s, and a changeling; for other characters they wanted to pick \"a species that had already been established\" on ''TNG''. They decided on a Trill, as seen in the form of Odan in the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode \"The Host\".\nAlthough Michael Westmore's alterations to make the Odan headpiece more feminine was as good as all of his work, the writers simply did not like it. Apparently, after she had put on the Odan forehead appliance, [[Rick Berman]] looked at Terry Farrell and said to Westmore, \"What did you do to her head, she used to be beautiful?\" Instead of changing species, as they'd already come to like the idea of an \"old man\", a person with centuries of experience to guide Sisko, Westmore suggested to \"just give her spots like we gave [[Famke Janssen|Famke]]\", who played a Kriosian in ''TNG'': \"The Perfect Mate\". This make-up was used on all Trill afterwards, comprising lines of dark spots that run from the temples and down both sides of the head, neck, and body.\n\n===Characterization===\nWhen the show began, the writers had difficulty defining the character of Dax. Michael Piller explained, \"Having a Trill seemed like a really, really good idea at the time, but it was the most difficult character for us to define. Jadzia Dax escaped us. At first we thought she was going to be ethereal, a [[Grace Kelly]]/[[Audrey Hepburn]] kind of goddess, and ultimately I think [[Ira Behr]] really figured it out, probably not until the second season, when he really made her a smart-talking, wise-cracking tough cookie.\"<ref>\"New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine\", ''DS9'' Season 2 DVD special features</ref> In 2014, Farrell admitted she found the character initially frustrating. \"The writers didn't know what to do with the character they created,\" saying she was asked to portray the character as a cross between Grace Kelly and [[Yoda]]. She was also annoyed by a scene written where Dax gossiped about who was dating whom on the station, questioning \"Why would a 350-year-old person care about who you're going out with?\"<ref>https://trekmovie.com/2014/08/02/two-star-trek-deep-space-nine-panels-more-in-stlv-thursday-photos-wrap-up/</ref> Pillar explained, \"The more we've written her, the more we're finding that she is not what she appears to be. That underneath this placid exterior, there's all these various personalities that she's gone through that are in turmoil and there's a lot of inner conflict. You know all the voices we hear inside ourselves are all made up of different subpersonalities; well she's got them all screaming at her in a variety of different ways.\"\n\nIra Behr spoke further on the character, announcing that they had intentionally changed the character by ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''. He said, \"We changed Dax in year two. Originally, she was going to be the [[Spock]] character, the wise old owl, the wise old man. And then we realized that she could be the one who's ready to go out and kick anyone's butt, and go out and have an adventure and have fun, and be kind of witty and mercurial. And that turned out to be great. When we found that part of the character, we just ran with it.\"<ref name=crewdossier>Crew Dossier: Jadzia Dax, DS9 Season 2 DVD, special features</ref>\n\nSpeaking in 2002, Terry Farrell said of playing Dax, \"It was a character who had lived seven lifetimes, been a man and a woman. Before I walked in and actually met everybody, I felt a little bit intimidated about this, I thought 'Oh my God, I need to meet them so they're going to tell me what I need to know.' And when I actually got here and spoke to everyone, they kind of didn't really know. And I was twenty-eight, and they kind of wanted me to be wiser than my years, just have the physicality of a twenty-eight-year-old, but have a three-hundred-and-fifty-year-old wise person inside me. They tried to find what they wanted in adjusting me here and there, and I think really what happened was surrender to that it was all new for this Dax, Jadzia Dax, this experience of the seven lifetimes, and Michael Piller made the decision that she was trying to come to terms with all of these entities, all of these memories that were inside of herself. And I think that helped me a lot as an actress to try to assimilate the job, period, and in a lot of ways, made me feel a little lost and uncomfortable as Terry, which got played out as Jadzia, so it was okay that she slowly felt more comfortable, so did I, and by the time they decided to make me a little bit more roguish in the second or third season, I felt much more comfortable about the dialogue and the other actors, and my lack of stage experience. And when I had to start doing action sequences, and work with Michael Dorn, I felt a lot more comfortable. I had my own voice.\"\n\nWhen asked how she would like Jadzia Dax to be remembered, Terry Farrell said, \"wisely mischievous.\"<ref name=crewdossier/>\n\n===Scrapped ideas===\nFollowing the confirmation of Farrell's departure and plans to kill the character off, Michael Piller wanted to add a couple of lines to ''Star Trek: Insurrection'' (which was still in development) acknowledging Jadzia's death and the impact it had on Worf. Rick Berman eventually overruled this, arguing that this would confuse film audience members who didn't follow the show regularly.\n\nEarly in the run of ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'', Michael McGreevey pitched a story to the writers that featured Jadzia and Bashir falling in love. McGreevey commented \"It was a love story, a simple concept. I don't know why they didn't want to do it. The symbiont inside Dax becomes ill, making her ill, and Dr. Bashir must separate them in order to treat the symbiont. We would come to see the personality of Jadzia, which of course is different from Dax. Bashir falls in love with her, and she feels for him, too. But the most important thing in life is to be joined with the symbiont. Bashir realizes that the only way to save the symbiont is to put it back into Jadzia, and thereby lose the girl he loves\".\n\n==Joined nature==\n{{See also|Dax (Star Trek)}}\nJadzia Dax is a joined [[Trill (Star Trek)|Trill]]. \"Jadzia\" is the name of the young Trill woman, while \"Dax\" refers to a slug-like symbiont that resides in her abdomen; Jadzia's actual family name was never revealed on the show. In the novels, her original name is said to be '''Jadzia Idaris'''. While Jadzia is 28 years old at the beginning of the series, the creature Dax is roughly 300 years old, having previously been hosted by seven other Trill. As a result, Dax may be considered the oldest crewmate on Deep Space Nine.\n\nPrior to Jadzia, the Dax symbiont had been hosted by Lela, Tobin, Emony, Audrid, Torias, Joran, and Curzon.\n\nThe burden of seven lifetimes' worth of memories is not always a positive one; several episodes of ''Deep Space Nine'' focus on Dax's struggle with her dual nature:\n* In the extended pilot episode, when Jadzia touches an Orb, a brief scene shows the symbiont being removed from Curzon and being placed into Jadzia.\n* In the first-season episode \"[[Dax (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode)|Dax]]\", the previous host Curzon Dax is accused of murder. This leads to an [[extradition]] hearing to determine whether Jadzia can be held responsible for crimes committed during another lifetime. While the moral question remains unanswered, the legal issue is resolved when evidence arises of Curzon's innocence.\n* In the second-season episode \"[[Invasive Procedures (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Invasive Procedures]]\", an unjoined Trill named Verad attempts to steal the Dax symbiont. Verad is upset that his application for a joining has been rejected by the [[Trill Symbiosis Commission]], and he plans to steal the Dax symbiont and escape into the [[Galactic quadrant (Star Trek)#Gamma Quadrant|Gamma quadrant]]. He manages to remove the Dax symbiont from Jadzia and partially join with it before his escape is thwarted.\n* Later that season, Dax mentors a Trill initiate in the episode \"[[Playing God (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Playing God]]\". Dax is responsible for training the young Trill, and for evaluating his suitability for joining. During the episode, Jadzia and Sisko discuss her own training under Curzon Dax, as well as the role that joining plays in Trill society.\n* In the third-season episode \"[[Equilibrium (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Equilibrium]]\", Dax begins to experience unsettling mental problems. She travels back to Trill to discover the source of the problems. On her homeworld, she visits the \"Caves of Mak'ala\", a place on Trill where unjoined symbionts swim in pools carefully and lovingly tended by Trill Guardians. Eventually, she learns that Dax had previously been joined with an unsuitable host known as [[Joran Dax|Joran]], and that her memories of this trauma had been suppressed. Her mental problems subside after the other Trill help her to regain these memories.\n* Later that season in the episode \"[[Facets (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Facets]]\", Jadzia encounters each of Dax's previous hosts in the Trill \"rite of closure\", including the insane Joran. This episode reveals much of the back story for the Dax character, and explores the relationship between Jadzia Dax, Curzon Dax, and Benjamin Sisko.\n* In the fourth-season episode \"[[Rejoined]]\", Jadzia Dax encounters Lenara Kahn, the current host of the symbiont Kahn, who had been previously joined to Nilani Kahn, the wife of Torias Dax. Because Torias died suddenly, Dax's relationship with Kahn through its previous host was never resolved, and the two current hosts struggle in the episode with their feelings towards one another. This is complicated by a taboo in Trill culture against romantic relationships with partners of previous hosts. This episode features one of the first [[Lesbian kiss episode|televised kisses between two female characters]].\n\n==Portrayal==\nAt the beginning of the series, Jadzia has just recently been joined with the symbiont [[Dax (Star Trek)|Dax]] after the natural death of the previous host, [[Curzon Dax]]. Curzon had been a friend and mentor to station Commander [[Benjamin Sisko]], and as Jadzia Dax, they continue this friendship despite the change in circumstances. Throughout the series, Sisko refers to Jadzia Dax by the affectionate nickname \"Old Man.\" She begins the series at the rank of Lieutenant; at the start of the fourth season, she becomes a Lieutenant Commander and remains one until her death in the sixth-season finale.\n\nDuring the first few seasons, Jadzia Dax is pursued romantically by Dr. [[Julian Bashir]]. Dax consistently but politely rebuffs him, though she later admits that she somewhat enjoyed the attention (cf. \"[[Starship Down]]\"). After Jadzia's death, Dax's new host [[Ezri Dax|Ezri]] begins dating Bashir.\n\nDuring the first season of the show, Jadzia Dax is often portrayed as somewhat reserved and aloof. In the early second-season episode \"[[The Siege (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Siege]]\", she is ill-at-ease in the spider-filled caverns of a [[Bajor]]an moon, and is later disoriented by [[Kira Nerys|Kira]]'s reckless piloting of a Bajoran starfighter. The writers' portrayal of the character begins to change in the second season, as they emphasize Jadzia Dax's gusto for life and extensive knowledge of other cultures:\n* The second-season episode \"[[Rules of Acquisition (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rules of Acquisition]]\" begins with a scene in which Jadzia Dax plays [[tongo (Star Trek)|tongo]] with a group of [[Ferengi]]. She seems surprisingly at home in this setting, calmly ignoring their sexist overtures and showing considerable skill at the game. Later in the episode, she remarks that the Ferengi are among the most interesting races she has encountered.\n* Later that season, Jadzia Dax joins a group of Klingons in a revenge quest (\"[[Blood Oath (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Blood Oath]]\"). In this episode, it is revealed the Curzon Dax was a Federation diplomat to the Klingon Empire, and swore a blood oath against \"the Albino\" with the Klingons [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]], [[Koloth]], and [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]]. Jadzia takes up the blood oath, and against Sisko's wishes she travels to the Albino's planet and participates in the revenge killing of the Albino and his minions.\nJadzia Dax's connection to the Klingon culture would become increasingly important as the series progressed, especially after the fourth-season arrival of [[Worf]]. In the episode \"[[The Sword of Kahless]]\", Dax joins Worf and [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]] in the search for the titular Klingon artifact. In \"[[Sons of Mogh]]\", she becomes aware of and subsequently warns Captain Sisko of Worf's attempt to kill his brother [[Kurn]], and in \"[[Soldiers of the Empire]]\" she and Worf go on a tense mission aboard a Klingon ship. Jadzia Dax would eventually marry Worf and join him as a member of the Klingon House of [[Martok]].\n\n==Sexuality==\nTerry Farrell was happy with the story line, saying that it made sense for Dax to have this issue because the symbiont had been in both male and female hosts, adding that \"Gender wasn't the issue. For the worm/symbiont, it was a matter of the being it was embodied in.\"<ref name=sbjinterview>{{cite web|last1=Krug|first1=Kurt Anthony|title=Terry Farrell Reflects on Her Career and 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'|url=http://www.showbizjunkies.com/tv/terry-farrell-interview/|publisher=Showbiz Junkies|accessdate=June 4, 2015|date=May 27, 2015|archivedate=October 11, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011044224/http://www.showbizjunkies.com/tv/terry-farrell-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref> She was pleased to be able to \"stand up\" for the [[LGBT community]].<ref name=sbjinterview/> A similar story had been approached during the first appearance of the Trill in ''The Next Generation'' episode \"[[The Host (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Host]]\". In this story, however, when the symbiont is transferred from a male to a female host, the Trill is rejected by the character who was the Trill's female partner, [[Beverly Crusher]]. The subplot featuring Kahn's artificial wormhole was described as a \"[[MacGuffin]]\" by Moore, and simply a way to get the character into \"Rejoined\".<ref name=erdmann280>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 280</ref> This was not the first subplot to be considered for the episode, with the main plot from \"[[Bar Association (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Bar Association]]\" originally thought of as being suitable to appear in either \"Rejoined\" or \"[[Crossfire (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Crossfire]]\". Instead, the plot, which involved [[Rom (Star Trek)|Rom]] forming a [[trade union]], was expanded into the main plot of its own episode.<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: pp. 314 \u2013 315</ref>\n\nThe episode was directed by main cast member Avery Brooks, who played Benjamin Sisko in the series, who later said that \"Rejoined\" was his favourite of the episodes he directed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title='DS9' Actor at Helm of Arts Project|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-56840397|accessdate=June 3, 2015|work=The Washington Times|date=July 21, 1996|url-access=subscription |via=[[Questia Online Library]]}}</ref> He said that the episode was about love, and the choices that result from that, and that it was an extraordinary story about losing someone you love and having that person restored to you some time afterward.<ref name=erdmann279/> Following the death of Jadzia in the [[List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|sixth-season]] finale, \"[[Tears of the Prophets]]\", Farrell suggested that the symbiont could be moved to a male character resulting in a similar situation as \"Rejoined\" between the new Dax host and [[Worf (Star Trek)|Worf]], as the two were in a relationship at that point.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title=The Death of Dax|journal=Starlog|date=September 1998|volume=1|issue=254|pages=19\u201323|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-254/254#page/n22/mode/1up|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> Instead, the symbiont was placed in a new female host called [[Ezri Dax|Ezri]], as the producers did not want Kira Nerys to be the only female main character.<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 592</ref> The prejudice against re-association first highlighted in \"Rejoined\" was mentioned in the [[List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|seventh-season]] episodes such as \"[[Afterimage (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Afterimage]]\".<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 604</ref>\n\nWriters on ''Deep Space Nine'' had previously hinted at a potential same-sex relationship in the [[List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|first-season]] episode \"[[Dax (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Dax]]\", when Jadzia Dax says goodbye to Enina Tandro, a former lover of Dax's previous male host, Curzon. The first take of the scene resulted in a situation in which it was unclear whether Dax and Enina were about to kiss. It was decided at the time that it was not appropriate, although the writers had hoped that there would be a time when the viewers would accept such a relationship. This theme was eventually realised in \"Rejoined\".<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 33</ref> Allen Kwan has argued that ''Deep Space Nine'' is the only series of ''Star Trek'' that resists the [[heteronormativity]] typical of the franchise, citing both \"Rejoined\" and the [[Mirror Universe]] episodes as examples, even if the presented [[bisexuality]] is [[problematization|problematized]].<ref>[[#kwan2007|Kwan (2007)]]: p. 63</ref>\n\nDuring that 1995/96 television season there had been an increase in the number of homosexual characters appearing in major television series, and so the same-sex kiss in \"Rejoined\" was reviewed in this context. An article published by the [[Associated Press]] suggested that the kiss in ''Deep Space Nine'' was not truly a same-sex kiss due to \"extenuating circumstances\"; namely, one of the characters was an \"alien who used to be a man\".<ref>{{cite news|title=TV makes room for more gay characters|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2543468//|accessdate=June 3, 2015|work=The Daily News|date=January 14, 1996|page=31|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}</ref> A similar opinion was offered by Jan Johnson-Smith, author of ''American Science Fiction TV'', who said that the situation was \"ambiguous\" as, despite presenting a same-sex kiss, the episode was clear that Jadzia was \"actually kissing the symbiont who has the memories of the former host, her male lover [sic], not the current female host\".<ref>[[#johnson2005|Johnson-Smith (2005)]]: p. 90</ref> (In actuality, Dax was the male-bodied husband while married to Kahn, who was then in a female host.)\n\nFor [[film studies]] scholar Jean Bruce, the ambiguity of the kiss is foreshadowed in an early scene revolving around a magic trick. On the one hand, the magic trick produces a \"pleasurable surprise\", while, on the other, this mirrors the deception necessary, due to Trill norms, in the reacquaintance of the characters. At the same time, the juxtaposition of very different shots serves to \"convey physical distance and the desire to bridge it\", which mirrors the fact that the Trills' love for one another transcends gender, identity and death. Though the kiss is \"informed by the fact that Dax was a man in her past life\", once it occurs, it can \"never be taken back\", and remains the [[queer]] image of two women kissing.<ref name=\"Bruce117\">[[#bruce2010|Bruce (2010)]]: p. 117</ref>\n\nNonetheless, \"Rejoined\" was still considered controversial because of its subject matter, which depicts two women who engage in a same-sex romantic relationship, and included one of the first [[Lesbian kiss episode|televised lesbian kisses]].<ref name=erdmann279>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 279</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ramsey|first1=Nick|title=Superheroes and sci-fi: Is there really a lack of diversity in science fiction?|url=http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/superheroes-and-sci-fi-there-really|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=June 3, 2015|date=February 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626130301/http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/superheroes-and-sci-fi-there-really|archivedate=June 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> During the course of the episode, no characters register concern about Dax being involved with a woman, only that she was an ex-spouse.<ref name=erdmann279/> David Greven, literary critic and author of ''Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek'', said that \"Rejoined\" was one of the better-received episodes of ''Star Trek'' that dealt with homosexuality as a theme, but that the franchise overall had typically avoided LGBT issues.<ref>[[#greven2009|Greven (2009)]]: p. 93</ref> [[Bryan Fuller]], who also wrote for ''Deep Space Nine'', said that the franchise had usually avoided those story lines because of the paranoia of the studio regarding homosexuality.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=Jeffrey|title=Dead Like He|journal=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|date=July 2003|pages=23\u201324|volume= 12|issue=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02IEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=%22star+trek%22+lesbian+kiss&source=bl&ots=nSlObk1zcJ&sig=4J1sRLbqeNxxQH_Xy8JbucqdXHk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zV1vVZqPHcvxUqfngpgP&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAziMAQ#v=onepage&q=%22star%20trek%22%20lesbian%20kiss&f=false|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> Dale Palmer, in an essay on gender and sexual politics, suggested that the choice was made to have a female same-sex kiss on screen because a male one would have alienated the main viewer demographic for the series.<ref>[[#eiss2014|Palmer (2014)]]: p. 107</ref>\n\n==Romantic interests==\nJadzia Dax was initially pursued by Dr. [[Julian Bashir]] aboard the station. The Ferengi bar owner, Quark, also has a special affection for the Trill scientist, even after the Dax symbiont was transferred to Ezri. However, her most notable and serious suitors include:\n* Deral, played by [[Brett Cullen]], a prominent member of the recurring planet Meridian (\"[[Meridian (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Meridian]]\")\n* Dr. [[Lenara Kahn]], played by [[Susanna Thompson]], a Trill theoretical quantum physicist and the current host of the symbiont Kahn, who was previously joined to Nilani, the widow of Torias Dax (\"[[Rejoined (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rejoined]]\").\n* Lt. Commander Worf, a Klingon. Dax and Worf connected over their mutual love of Klingon traditions, including Klingon Opera and martial arts. Their intimate relationship began in \"[[Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places]],\" and in \"[[You Are Cordially Invited...]]\" they were married and Jadzia Dax formally joined the House of [[Martok]]. Their attempts at parenthood (despite the difficulties faced by biological incompatibilities between Klingons and Trills) were cut short when Jadzia Dax was murdered.\n* Captain Boday. An unseen former lover of Jadzia's who is occasionally referenced. Boday is a Gallamite and like all Gallamites has a transparent skull. Worf becomes angry with Jadzia when he learns she had lunch with Boday.\n\n===Relationship with Worf===\nIn the fourth season, [[Michael Dorn]] joins the cast of ''Deep Space Nine'' as the [[Klingon]] character [[Worf]]. Perhaps because of her past interactions with Klingons, Dax is fairly flirtatious with Worf. Worf appears at first to be oblivious to this attention, and in the fifth-season episode \"[[Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places]]\" he becomes enamored with a female Klingon named Grilka. This is resolved by the end of the episode, with [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] ironically winning the heart of Grilka, and Worf becoming romantically involved with Dax.\n\nIn the beginning, their relationship is very sexual, with the strong implication that their encounters are somewhat rough (the above episode ends with Worf and Dax visiting the infirmary with various bruises and other injuries). In the season 5 finale \"[[Call to Arms (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Call to Arms]]\", the station is overrun by [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] forces, and Dax and Worf are assigned to different starships for the [[Dominion War]]. Near the end of the episode, they agree to get married after the war is over. Worf and Dax's marriage is the centerpiece of season 6 episode \"[[You Are Cordially Invited...]]\". During the episode, Dax must obtain permission from the lady Sirella to join the House of [[Martok]]. At first Dax is loath to pay Sirella the required respect, and the lady is unwilling to accede to Dax's request. The situation is resolved by the conclusion, with Sirella admitting during the ceremony that nothing can stand between \"the beating of two Klingon hearts\".\n\n==Death==\nJadzia is murdered in \"[[Tears of the Prophets (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode)|Tears of the Prophets]]\", the finale of the sixth season. She and Worf had been trying to conceive, despite the doubts of Dr. Bashir that such a pregnancy was possible. After Major Kira tells Jadzia she has been praying for a conception, Jadzia receives encouraging test results from Julian, and goes to the station's temple to thank the [[Prophet (Star Trek)|Prophets]]. It now appears a pregnancy will be possible. The Cardassian [[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]] arrives, possessed by a Pah-wraith, with the intention of destroying the orb-like [[Bajoran]] artifacts known as the \"Tears of the Prophets\". Jadzia is no match for Dukat while he is infused with the Pah-wraith. He mortally wounds her and destroys the orbs. Upon her death in the infirmary, a distraught Worf screams out a Klingon wail of sorrow for his beloved and to let the Klingon afterworld know a warrior was on the way (\"[[Heart of Glory]]\"). Her death shakes the crew to its core: by the beginning of season 7, Sisko has left the station in despair and Worf has been risking his life on increasingly dangerous missions.\n\nThough the host Jadzia is dead, the symbiont Dax survives and is implanted in a Trill named Ezri Tigan. The resulting joined Trill, [[Ezri Dax]], becomes a main character during the seventh and last season of the series.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2016, [[Screen Rant]] rated Jadzia Dax as the 19th-best character in ''Star Trek'' overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/best-star-trek-characters-ever/|title=The 20 Best Characters In Star Trek History|date=2016-11-19|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> In 2018, ''[[TheWrap]]'' placed Jadzia Dax as 26th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the ''Star Trek'' franchise prior to ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/all-39-star-trek-main-characters-ranked-from-spock-to-wesley-photos/|title=All 39 'Star Trek' Main Characters Ranked|date=2018-03-21|website=TheWrap|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-22}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/902941972 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/902940716 cite #43 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

Though she appears to be a young woman, Jadzia lives in [[symbiosis]] with a wise and long-lived creature, known as a [[Symbiosis|symbiont]], named [[Dax (Star Trek)|Dax]]. The two share a single, conscious mind, and her personality is a blending of the characteristics of both the host and the symbiont. As such, Jadzia has access to all the skills and memories of the symbiont's seven previous hosts. Jadzia holds academic degrees in [[Astrobiology|exobiology]], [[zoology]], [[astrophysics]] and [[Xenoarchaeology|exoarchaeology]], all of which she earned before the joining.\n\nJadzia Dax is the station's chief science officer, and is close friends with commander [[Benjamin Sisko]] and Bajoran first officer [[Kira Nerys]]. Later in the series, she becomes involved with the [[Klingon]] character [[Worf]], and they marry during the sixth season of the show. Her character is killed by [[Dukat (Star Trek)|Gul Dukat]] during the sixth-season finale (due to Farrell's desire for a reduced role so that she could have time for other things, which producer Rick Berman refused to allow). The character of Dax re-emerges in the seventh-season premiere in the form of [[Ezri Dax]].\n\n==Development==\n===Make-up===\nWhen selecting the characters for ''Deep Space Nine'', the production staff knew that they'd have humans, [[Bajoran]]s, and a changeling; for other characters they wanted to pick \"a species that had already been established\" on ''TNG''. They decided on a Trill, as seen in the form of Odan in the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode \"The Host\".\nAlthough Michael Westmore's alterations to make the Odan headpiece more feminine was as good as all of his work, the writers simply did not like it. Apparently, after she had put on the Odan forehead appliance, [[Rick Berman]] looked at Terry Farrell and said to Westmore, \"What did you do to her head, she used to be beautiful?\" Instead of changing species, as they'd already come to like the idea of an \"old man\", a person with centuries of experience to guide Sisko, Westmore suggested to \"just give her spots like we gave [[Famke Janssen|Famke]]\", who played a Kriosian in ''TNG'': \"The Perfect Mate\". This make-up was used on all Trill afterwards, comprising lines of dark spots that run from the temples and down both sides of the head, neck, and body.\n\n===Characterization===\nWhen the show began, the writers had difficulty defining the character of Dax. Michael Piller explained, \"Having a Trill seemed like a really, really good idea at the time, but it was the most difficult character for us to define. Jadzia Dax escaped us. At first we thought she was going to be ethereal, a [[Grace Kelly]]/[[Audrey Hepburn]] kind of goddess, and ultimately I think [[Ira Behr]] really figured it out, probably not until the second season, when he really made her a smart-talking, wise-cracking tough cookie.\"<ref>\"New Frontiers: The Story of Deep Space Nine\", ''DS9'' Season 2 DVD special features</ref> In 2014, Farrell admitted she found the character initially frustrating. \"The writers didn't know what to do with the character they created,\" saying she was asked to portray the character as a cross between Grace Kelly and [[Yoda]]. She was also annoyed by a scene written where Dax gossiped about who was dating whom on the station, questioning \"Why would a 350-year-old person care about who you're going out with?\"<ref>https://trekmovie.com/2014/08/02/two-star-trek-deep-space-nine-panels-more-in-stlv-thursday-photos-wrap-up/</ref> Pillar explained, \"The more we've written her, the more we're finding that she is not what she appears to be. That underneath this placid exterior, there's all these various personalities that she's gone through that are in turmoil and there's a lot of inner conflict. You know all the voices we hear inside ourselves are all made up of different subpersonalities; well she's got them all screaming at her in a variety of different ways.\"\n\nIra Behr spoke further on the character, announcing that they had intentionally changed the character by ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''. He said, \"We changed Dax in year two. Originally, she was going to be the [[Spock]] character, the wise old owl, the wise old man. And then we realized that she could be the one who's ready to go out and kick anyone's butt, and go out and have an adventure and have fun, and be kind of witty and mercurial. And that turned out to be great. When we found that part of the character, we just ran with it.\"<ref name=crewdossier>Crew Dossier: Jadzia Dax, DS9 Season 2 DVD, special features</ref>\n\nSpeaking in 2002, Terry Farrell said of playing Dax, \"It was a character who had lived seven lifetimes, been a man and a woman. Before I walked in and actually met everybody, I felt a little bit intimidated about this, I thought 'Oh my God, I need to meet them so they're going to tell me what I need to know.' And when I actually got here and spoke to everyone, they kind of didn't really know. And I was twenty-eight, and they kind of wanted me to be wiser than my years, just have the physicality of a twenty-eight-year-old, but have a three-hundred-and-fifty-year-old wise person inside me. They tried to find what they wanted in adjusting me here and there, and I think really what happened was surrender to that it was all new for this Dax, Jadzia Dax, this experience of the seven lifetimes, and Michael Piller made the decision that she was trying to come to terms with all of these entities, all of these memories that were inside of herself. And I think that helped me a lot as an actress to try to assimilate the job, period, and in a lot of ways, made me feel a little lost and uncomfortable as Terry, which got played out as Jadzia, so it was okay that she slowly felt more comfortable, so did I, and by the time they decided to make me a little bit more roguish in the second or third season, I felt much more comfortable about the dialogue and the other actors, and my lack of stage experience. And when I had to start doing action sequences, and work with Michael Dorn, I felt a lot more comfortable. I had my own voice.\"\n\nWhen asked how she would like Jadzia Dax to be remembered, Terry Farrell said, \"wisely mischievous.\"<ref name=crewdossier/>\n\n===Scrapped ideas===\nFollowing the confirmation of Farrell's departure and plans to kill the character off, Michael Piller wanted to add a couple of lines to ''Star Trek: Insurrection'' (which was still in development) acknowledging Jadzia's death and the impact it had on Worf. Rick Berman eventually overruled this, arguing that this would confuse film audience members who didn't follow the show regularly.\n\nEarly in the run of ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'', Michael McGreevey pitched a story to the writers that featured Jadzia and Bashir falling in love. McGreevey commented \"It was a love story, a simple concept. I don't know why they didn't want to do it. The symbiont inside Dax becomes ill, making her ill, and Dr. Bashir must separate them in order to treat the symbiont. We would come to see the personality of Jadzia, which of course is different from Dax. Bashir falls in love with her, and she feels for him, too. But the most important thing in life is to be joined with the symbiont. Bashir realizes that the only way to save the symbiont is to put it back into Jadzia, and thereby lose the girl he loves\".\n\n==Joined nature==\n{{See also|Dax (Star Trek)}}\nJadzia Dax is a joined [[Trill (Star Trek)|Trill]]. \"Jadzia\" is the name of the young Trill woman, while \"Dax\" refers to a slug-like symbiont that resides in her abdomen; Jadzia's actual family name was never revealed on the show. In the novels, her original name is said to be '''Jadzia Idaris'''. While Jadzia is 28 years old at the beginning of the series, the creature Dax is roughly 300 years old, having previously been hosted by seven other Trill. As a result, Dax may be considered the oldest crewmate on Deep Space Nine.\n\nPrior to Jadzia, the Dax symbiont had been hosted by Lela, Tobin, Emony, Audrid, Torias, Joran, and Curzon.\n\nThe burden of seven lifetimes' worth of memories is not always a positive one; several episodes of ''Deep Space Nine'' focus on Dax's struggle with her dual nature:\n* In the extended pilot episode, when Jadzia touches an Orb, a brief scene shows the symbiont being removed from Curzon and being placed into Jadzia.\n* In the first-season episode \"[[Dax (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode)|Dax]]\", the previous host Curzon Dax is accused of murder. This leads to an [[extradition]] hearing to determine whether Jadzia can be held responsible for crimes committed during another lifetime. While the moral question remains unanswered, the legal issue is resolved when evidence arises of Curzon's innocence.\n* In the second-season episode \"[[Invasive Procedures (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Invasive Procedures]]\", an unjoined Trill named Verad attempts to steal the Dax symbiont. Verad is upset that his application for a joining has been rejected by the [[Trill Symbiosis Commission]], and he plans to steal the Dax symbiont and escape into the [[Galactic quadrant (Star Trek)#Gamma Quadrant|Gamma quadrant]]. He manages to remove the Dax symbiont from Jadzia and partially join with it before his escape is thwarted.\n* Later that season, Dax mentors a Trill initiate in the episode \"[[Playing God (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Playing God]]\". Dax is responsible for training the young Trill, and for evaluating his suitability for joining. During the episode, Jadzia and Sisko discuss her own training under Curzon Dax, as well as the role that joining plays in Trill society.\n* In the third-season episode \"[[Equilibrium (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Equilibrium]]\", Dax begins to experience unsettling mental problems. She travels back to Trill to discover the source of the problems. On her homeworld, she visits the \"Caves of Mak'ala\", a place on Trill where unjoined symbionts swim in pools carefully and lovingly tended by Trill Guardians. Eventually, she learns that Dax had previously been joined with an unsuitable host known as [[Joran Dax|Joran]], and that her memories of this trauma had been suppressed. Her mental problems subside after the other Trill help her to regain these memories.\n* Later that season in the episode \"[[Facets (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Facets]]\", Jadzia encounters each of Dax's previous hosts in the Trill \"rite of closure\", including the insane Joran. This episode reveals much of the back story for the Dax character, and explores the relationship between Jadzia Dax, Curzon Dax, and Benjamin Sisko.\n* In the fourth-season episode \"[[Rejoined]]\", Jadzia Dax encounters Lenara Kahn, the current host of the symbiont Kahn, who had been previously joined to Nilani Kahn, the wife of Torias Dax. Because Torias died suddenly, Dax's relationship with Kahn through its previous host was never resolved, and the two current hosts struggle in the episode with their feelings towards one another. This is complicated by a taboo in Trill culture against romantic relationships with partners of previous hosts. This episode features one of the first [[Lesbian kiss episode|televised kisses between two female characters]].\n\n==Portrayal==\nAt the beginning of the series, Jadzia has just recently been joined with the symbiont [[Dax (Star Trek)|Dax]] after the natural death of the previous host, [[Curzon Dax]]. Curzon had been a friend and mentor to station Commander [[Benjamin Sisko]], and as Jadzia Dax, they continue this friendship despite the change in circumstances. Throughout the series, Sisko refers to Jadzia Dax by the affectionate nickname \"Old Man.\" She begins the series at the rank of Lieutenant; at the start of the fourth season, she becomes a Lieutenant Commander and remains one until her death in the sixth-season finale.\n\nDuring the first few seasons, Jadzia Dax is pursued romantically by Dr. [[Julian Bashir]]. Dax consistently but politely rebuffs him, though she later admits that she somewhat enjoyed the attention (cf. \"[[Starship Down]]\"). After Jadzia's death, Dax's new host [[Ezri Dax|Ezri]] begins dating Bashir.\n\nDuring the first season of the show, Jadzia Dax is often portrayed as somewhat reserved and aloof. In the early second-season episode \"[[The Siege (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|The Siege]]\", she is ill-at-ease in the spider-filled caverns of a [[Bajor]]an moon, and is later disoriented by [[Kira Nerys|Kira]]'s reckless piloting of a Bajoran starfighter. The writers' portrayal of the character begins to change in the second season, as they emphasize Jadzia Dax's gusto for life and extensive knowledge of other cultures:\n* The second-season episode \"[[Rules of Acquisition (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rules of Acquisition]]\" begins with a scene in which Jadzia Dax plays [[tongo (Star Trek)|tongo]] with a group of [[Ferengi]]. She seems surprisingly at home in this setting, calmly ignoring their sexist overtures and showing considerable skill at the game. Later in the episode, she remarks that the Ferengi are among the most interesting races she has encountered.\n* Later that season, Jadzia Dax joins a group of Klingons in a revenge quest (\"[[Blood Oath (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Blood Oath]]\"). In this episode, it is revealed the Curzon Dax was a Federation diplomat to the Klingon Empire, and swore a blood oath against \"the Albino\" with the Klingons [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]], [[Koloth]], and [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]]. Jadzia takes up the blood oath, and against Sisko's wishes she travels to the Albino's planet and participates in the revenge killing of the Albino and his minions.\nJadzia Dax's connection to the Klingon culture would become increasingly important as the series progressed, especially after the fourth-season arrival of [[Worf]]. In the episode \"[[The Sword of Kahless]]\", Dax joins Worf and [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]] in the search for the titular Klingon artifact. In \"[[Sons of Mogh]]\", she becomes aware of and subsequently warns Captain Sisko of Worf's attempt to kill his brother [[Kurn]], and in \"[[Soldiers of the Empire]]\" she and Worf go on a tense mission aboard a Klingon ship. Jadzia Dax would eventually marry Worf and join him as a member of the Klingon House of [[Martok]].\n\n==Sexuality==\nTerry Farrell was happy with the story line, saying that it made sense for Dax to have this issue because the symbiont had been in both male and female hosts, adding that \"Gender wasn't the issue. For the worm/symbiont, it was a matter of the being it was embodied in.\"<ref name=sbjinterview>{{cite web|last1=Krug|first1=Kurt Anthony|title=Terry Farrell Reflects on Her Career and 'Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'|url=http://www.showbizjunkies.com/tv/terry-farrell-interview/|publisher=Showbiz Junkies|accessdate=June 4, 2015|date=May 27, 2015|archivedate=October 11, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011044224/http://www.showbizjunkies.com/tv/terry-farrell-interview/|url-status=live}}</ref> She was pleased to be able to \"stand up\" for the [[LGBT community]].<ref name=sbjinterview/> A similar story had been approached during the first appearance of the Trill in ''The Next Generation'' episode \"[[The Host (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Host]]\". In this story, however, when the symbiont is transferred from a male to a female host, the Trill is rejected by the character who was the Trill's female partner, [[Beverly Crusher]]. The subplot featuring Kahn's artificial wormhole was described as a \"[[MacGuffin]]\" by Moore, and simply a way to get the character into \"Rejoined\".<ref name=erdmann280>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 280</ref> This was not the first subplot to be considered for the episode, with the main plot from \"[[Bar Association (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Bar Association]]\" originally thought of as being suitable to appear in either \"Rejoined\" or \"[[Crossfire (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Crossfire]]\". Instead, the plot, which involved [[Rom (Star Trek)|Rom]] forming a [[trade union]], was expanded into the main plot of its own episode.<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: pp. 314 \u2013 315</ref>\n\nThe episode was directed by main cast member Avery Brooks, who played Benjamin Sisko in the series, who later said that \"Rejoined\" was his favourite of the episodes he directed.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title='DS9' Actor at Helm of Arts Project|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-56840397|accessdate=June 3, 2015|work=The Washington Times|date=July 21, 1996|url-access=subscription |via=[[Questia Online Library]]}}</ref> He said that the episode was about love, and the choices that result from that, and that it was an extraordinary story about losing someone you love and having that person restored to you some time afterward.<ref name=erdmann279/> Following the death of Jadzia in the [[List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|sixth-season]] finale, \"[[Tears of the Prophets]]\", Farrell suggested that the symbiont could be moved to a male character resulting in a similar situation as \"Rejoined\" between the new Dax host and [[Worf (Star Trek)|Worf]], as the two were in a relationship at that point.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spelling|first1=Ian|title=The Death of Dax|journal=Starlog|date=September 1998|volume=1|issue=254|pages=19\u201323|url=https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-254/254#page/n22/mode/1up|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> Instead, the symbiont was placed in a new female host called [[Ezri Dax|Ezri]], as the producers did not want Kira Nerys to be the only female main character.<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 592</ref> The prejudice against re-association first highlighted in \"Rejoined\" was mentioned in the [[List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|seventh-season]] episodes such as \"[[Afterimage (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Afterimage]]\".<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 604</ref>\n\nWriters on ''Deep Space Nine'' had previously hinted at a potential same-sex relationship in the [[List of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|first-season]] episode \"[[Dax (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Dax]]\", when Jadzia Dax says goodbye to Enina Tandro, a former lover of Dax's previous male host, Curzon. The first take of the scene resulted in a situation in which it was unclear whether Dax and Enina were about to kiss. It was decided at the time that it was not appropriate, although the writers had hoped that there would be a time when the viewers would accept such a relationship. This theme was eventually realised in \"Rejoined\".<ref>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 33</ref> Allen Kwan has argued that ''Deep Space Nine'' is the only series of ''Star Trek'' that resists the [[heteronormativity]] typical of the franchise, citing both \"Rejoined\" and the [[Mirror Universe]] episodes as examples, even if the presented [[bisexuality]] is [[problematization|problematized]].<ref>[[#kwan2007|Kwan (2007)]]: p. 63</ref>\n\nDuring that 1995/96 television season there had been an increase in the number of homosexual characters appearing in major television series, and so the same-sex kiss in \"Rejoined\" was reviewed in this context. An article published by the [[Associated Press]] suggested that the kiss in ''Deep Space Nine'' was not truly a same-sex kiss due to \"extenuating circumstances\"; namely, one of the characters was an \"alien who used to be a man\".<ref>{{cite news|title=TV makes room for more gay characters|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2543468//|accessdate=June 3, 2015|work=The Daily News|date=January 14, 1996|page=31|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{open access}}</ref> A similar opinion was offered by Jan Johnson-Smith, author of ''American Science Fiction TV'', who said that the situation was \"ambiguous\" as, despite presenting a same-sex kiss, the episode was clear that Jadzia was \"actually kissing the symbiont who has the memories of the former host, her male lover [sic], not the current female host\".<ref>[[#johnson2005|Johnson-Smith (2005)]]: p. 90</ref> (In actuality, Dax was the male-bodied husband while married to Kahn, who was then in a female host.)\n\nFor [[film studies]] scholar Jean Bruce, the ambiguity of the kiss is foreshadowed in an early scene revolving around a magic trick. On the one hand, the magic trick produces a \"pleasurable surprise\", while, on the other, this mirrors the deception necessary, due to Trill norms, in the reacquaintance of the characters. At the same time, the juxtaposition of very different shots serves to \"convey physical distance and the desire to bridge it\", which mirrors the fact that the Trills' love for one another transcends gender, identity and death. Though the kiss is \"informed by the fact that Dax was a man in her past life\", once it occurs, it can \"never be taken back\", and remains the [[queer]] image of two women kissing.<ref name=\"Bruce117\">[[#bruce2010|Bruce (2010)]]: p. 117</ref>\n\nNonetheless, \"Rejoined\" was still considered controversial because of its subject matter, which depicts two women who engage in a same-sex romantic relationship, and included one of the first [[Lesbian kiss episode|televised lesbian kisses]].<ref name=erdmann279>[[#erdmannblock2000|Erdmann & Block (2000)]]: p. 279</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ramsey|first1=Nick|title=Superheroes and sci-fi: Is there really a lack of diversity in science fiction?|url=http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/superheroes-and-sci-fi-there-really|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=June 3, 2015|date=February 10, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626130301/http://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/superheroes-and-sci-fi-there-really|archivedate=June 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> During the course of the episode, no characters register concern about Dax being involved with a woman, only that she was an ex-spouse.<ref name=erdmann279/> David Greven, literary critic and author of ''Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek'', said that \"Rejoined\" was one of the better-received episodes of ''Star Trek'' that dealt with homosexuality as a theme, but that the franchise overall had typically avoided LGBT issues.<ref>[[#greven2009|Greven (2009)]]: p. 93</ref> [[Bryan Fuller]], who also wrote for ''Deep Space Nine'', said that the franchise had usually avoided those story lines because of the paranoia of the studio regarding homosexuality.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=Jeffrey|title=Dead Like He|journal=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|date=July 2003|pages=23\u201324|volume= 12|issue=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=02IEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=%22star+trek%22+lesbian+kiss&source=bl&ots=nSlObk1zcJ&sig=4J1sRLbqeNxxQH_Xy8JbucqdXHk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zV1vVZqPHcvxUqfngpgP&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAziMAQ#v=onepage&q=%22star%20trek%22%20lesbian%20kiss&f=false|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> Dale Palmer, in an essay on gender and sexual politics, suggested that the choice was made to have a female same-sex kiss on screen because a male one would have alienated the main viewer demographic for the series.<ref>[[#eiss2014|Palmer (2014)]]: p. 107</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, Terry Farrell confirmed that Jadzia was [[pansexual]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Weekes|first1=Princess|title=Things We Saw Today: Terry Farrell Confirms Jadzia Dax Was Pansexual on Deep Space Nine|url=https://www.themarysue.com/jadzia-dax-pansexual-deep-space-nine/|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=August 5, 2019|date=August 2, 2019|archivedate=August 3, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803013613/https://www.themarysue.com/jadzia-dax-pansexual-deep-space-nine/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Stone|first1=Sam|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Jadzia Dax's Pansexuality Confirmed|url=https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-deep-space-nine-jadzia-daxs-pansexual/|publisher=CBR|accessdate=August 5, 2019|date=August 5, 2019|archivedate=August 5, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190805222327/https://www.cbr.com/star-trek-deep-space-nine-jadzia-daxs-pansexual/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Romantic interests==\nJadzia Dax was initially pursued by Dr. [[Julian Bashir]] aboard the station. The Ferengi bar owner, Quark, also has a special affection for the Trill scientist, even after the Dax symbiont was transferred to Ezri. However, her most notable and serious suitors include:\n* Deral, played by [[Brett Cullen]], a prominent member of the recurring planet Meridian (\"[[Meridian (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Meridian]]\")\n* Dr. [[Lenara Kahn]], played by [[Susanna Thompson]], a Trill theoretical quantum physicist and the current host of the symbiont Kahn, who was previously joined to Nilani, the widow of Torias Dax (\"[[Rejoined (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rejoined]]\").\n* Lt. Commander Worf, a Klingon. Dax and Worf connected over their mutual love of Klingon traditions, including Klingon Opera and martial arts. Their intimate relationship began in \"[[Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places]],\" and in \"[[You Are Cordially Invited...]]\" they were married and Jadzia Dax formally joined the House of [[Martok]]. Their attempts at parenthood (despite the difficulties faced by biological incompatibilities between Klingons and Trills) were cut short when Jadzia Dax was murdered.\n* Captain Boday. An unseen former lover of Jadzia's who is occasionally referenced. Boday is a Gallamite and like all Gallamites has a transparent skull. Worf becomes angry with Jadzia when he learns she had lunch with Boday.\n\n===Relationship with Worf===\nIn the fourth season, [[Michael Dorn]] joins the cast of ''Deep Space Nine'' as the [[Klingon]] character [[Worf]]. Perhaps because of her past interactions with Klingons, Dax is fairly flirtatious with Worf. Worf appears at first to be oblivious to this attention, and in the fifth-season episode \"[[Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places]]\" he becomes enamored with a female Klingon named Grilka. This is resolved by the end of the episode, with [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] ironically winning the heart of Grilka, and Worf becoming romantically involved with Dax.\n\nIn the beginning, their relationship is very sexual, with the strong implication that their encounters are somewhat rough (the above episode ends with Worf and Dax visiting the infirmary with various bruises and other injuries). In the season 5 finale \"[[Call to Arms (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Call to Arms]]\", the station is overrun by [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] forces, and Dax and Worf are assigned to different starships for the [[Dominion War]]. Near the end of the episode, they agree to get married after the war is over. Worf and Dax's marriage is the centerpiece of season 6 episode \"[[You Are Cordially Invited...]]\". During the episode, Dax must obtain permission from the lady Sirella to join the House of [[Martok]]. At first Dax is loath to pay Sirella the required respect, and the lady is unwilling to accede to Dax's request. The situation is resolved by the conclusion, with Sirella admitting during the ceremony that nothing can stand between \"the beating of two Klingon hearts\".\n\n==Death==\nJadzia is murdered in \"[[Tears of the Prophets (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode)|Tears of the Prophets]]\", the finale of the sixth season. She and Worf had been trying to conceive, despite the doubts of Dr. Bashir that such a pregnancy was possible. After Major Kira tells Jadzia she has been praying for a conception, Jadzia receives encouraging test results from Julian, and goes to the station's temple to thank the [[Prophet (Star Trek)|Prophets]]. It now appears a pregnancy will be possible. The Cardassian [[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]] arrives, possessed by a Pah-wraith, with the intention of destroying the orb-like [[Bajoran]] artifacts known as the \"Tears of the Prophets\". Jadzia is no match for Dukat while he is infused with the Pah-wraith. He mortally wounds her and destroys the orbs. Upon her death in the infirmary, a distraught Worf screams out a Klingon wail of sorrow for his beloved and to let the Klingon afterworld know a warrior was on the way (\"[[Heart of Glory]]\"). Her death shakes the crew to its core: by the beginning of season 7, Sisko has left the station in despair and Worf has been risking his life on increasingly dangerous missions.\n\nThough the host Jadzia is dead, the symbiont Dax survives and is implanted in a Trill named Ezri Tigan. The resulting joined Trill, [[Ezri Dax]], becomes a main character during the seventh and last season of the series.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2016, [[Screen Rant]] rated Jadzia Dax as the 19th-best character in ''Star Trek'' overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/best-star-trek-characters-ever/|title=The 20 Best Characters In Star Trek History|date=2016-11-19|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-20}}</ref> In 2018, ''[[TheWrap]]'' placed Jadzia Dax as 26th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the ''Star Trek'' franchise prior to ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/all-39-star-trek-main-characters-ranked-from-spock-to-wesley-photos/|title=All 39 'Star Trek' Main Characters Ranked|date=2018-03-21|website=TheWrap|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-22}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/902941972 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/902940716 cite #43 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

{"title_page": "Referendums in New Zealand", "text_new": "{{Politics of New Zealand}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n[[Referendum]]s (or referenda) are held only occasionally by the Government of [[New Zealand]]. Referendums may be government-initiated or held in accordance with the [[Electoral Act 1993]] or the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993]. Ten [[referendum]]s have been held so far (excluding referendums on alcohol licensing, which were held triennially between 1894 and 1989). Seven were government-led, and three were indicative citizen initiatives.\n\n==Government referendums==\nThe government of New Zealand may, at any time, call for a referendum on any issue. This requires enabling legislation to determine whether the outcome will be binding on the government or merely indicative. This allows parliamentary scrutiny of the issue and wording of the question. There is no constraint on whether an issue is to be decided by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] or by the public, except for where the reserved provisions of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] are engaged. [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310495.html Section 268] of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] protects some of the provisions of the Act from amendment except in accordance with s 268(2) which requires a majority vote in a referendum of a 75% majority of Members of Parliament.<ref>Electoral Act 1993, s 268.</ref> The protected provisions include, ''inter alia'', the term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], the voting age and the voting method. The provision itself is not protected from ordinary amendment or repeal.\n\nThis has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, as there is in other countries like [[Australia]] or [[Switzerland]] that have codified [[constitution]]s.\n\nRecent examples are the [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag referendums]] held across 2015 and 2016, conducted by postal vote.\n\n===Constitutional referendums===\nThere is no requirement for a referendum to enact constitutional change in New Zealand. Referendums were held in 1992 and 1993 to decide the nature of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]]. Many groups advocate approval of constitutional reforms by referendums; the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|Republican Movement]] supports a referendum on whether [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand should become a republic]].\n\nThere are frequent calls for the use of referendums to decide other constitutional matters, rather than by regular Acts of Parliament. In 2003 the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] replaced the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] as New Zealand's highest court of appeal with a new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]], despite calls from [[New Zealand First]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] for a referendum to be held on the issue. In 1950 the abolition of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] was done by Act of Parliament; with additional members of the Legislative Council (MLC) appointed to ensure approval by the upper house, the ''suicide squad''.\n\n{{See also|Constitution of New Zealand}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''Turnout''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || 69.7 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 68.1% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 27 October 1990 || 85.2 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 69.3% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 19 September 1992 || 55.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 84.7% for change, 70.5% to MMP\n|-\n| 6 November 1993 || 85.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 53.9% for MMP\n|-\n| 26 November 2011 || 73.5 || [[2011 New Zealand voting method referendum|Voting system]] || 57.8% for keeping MMP\n|}\n\n===Liquor licensing referendums===\nIn New Zealand, alcohol licensing has historically been decided by referendum. The first of these were compulsory local licensing referendums, held in 1894 and then with each main parliamentary election between 1896 and 1914. Local licensing referendums were eliminated after 1914, apart from 'local restoration polls' to legalise liquor sales in 'dry' districts. In 1910 a referendum on national prohibition of alcohol was introduced, and held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1987 inclusive (except [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] and [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). An extra referendum on prohibition was held on 10 April 1919. From 17 December 1919 the additional option of ''state purchase and control'' of liquor (i.e. nationalisation) was added to the ballot. The Sale of Liquor Act 1989 abolished the national liquor referendum. Local restoration polls were still held in areas that were still 'dry', but the last three, [[Mount Eden]], [[Mount Roskill, New Zealand|Mount Roskill]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], all became 'wet' in 1999. There have been two referendums on [[pub]] closing times.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Three-to-one majority to retain\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Two-to-one majority for later opening\n|}\n\n===Other referendums===\nThe government may call referendums on any issues on which it wishes. These will usually be on issues on which the government is split. For the 1997 referendum on retirement savings, the decision to hold it was part of the coalition agreement between [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand First]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || 54.3 || Allow off-course [[betting]] || 68.0% in favour\n|-\n| 3 August 1949 || 63.5 || [[Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand|Compulsory military training]] || 77.9% in favour\n|-\n| 5 September 1997 || 80.3 || Compulsory [[Retirement plan|Retirement Savings]] Scheme || 91.8% against\n|-\n| 20 November \u2013 11 December 2015 || 48.2 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], first stage || 50.58% for [[File:NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White & Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg|25px|border]] [[Lockwood silver fern flag|Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue)]] after 4 counts\n|-\n| 3\u201324 March 2016 || 67.8 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], second stage || 56.6% for retaining the existing [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|}\n\n==Citizens Initiated Referenda==\n{{anchor|Citizens initiated referendums|Citizens-initiated referenda||Citizens-initiated referendums}}\nThe [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993] allows for citizens to propose a [[Initiative|referendum]]. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months. There were [http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/2017-general-election-results/voter-turnout-statistics 3,298,009 voters enrolled] for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], so at least 329,801 signatures would be required at a rate of approximately 904 signatures per day. In reality, more signatures would be required to account for variances in electoral roll numbers, duplicate signatures and signatures that cannot be matched to a registered elector.\n\nThere are procedural requirements governing this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/seek-a-referendum/|title=Seek a referendum|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> It costs [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500 to file a petition asking for a referendum with the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Clerk formally determines the wording of the question, which may be quite different from the original. Once the Clerk receives the completed petition, the number of signatures is initially counted, followed by sample groups of signatures being taken and the signatories' names and addresses checked against the electoral roll. The sampling of signatures is used to estimate the number of valid signatures for the whole petition with confidence, and if the lower confidence interval is more than ten percent of the electoral roll, the petition is presented to the House of Representatives.\n\nWithin one month of the petition's presentation to the House, a date for the poll must be determined. The poll must be held within 12 months of the petition's presentation, unless 75 percent of MPs vote to delay the poll for one year. There is also a $50,000 spending limit on promoting the petition.\n\nNew Zealand, [[Italy]], and [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)#Federal popular initiative|Switzerland]] are among countries whose laws allow for citizen-initiated referendums (CIRs) nationally. Its defenders view it as a form of \"direct democracy\". However, the Citizens Initiated Referendum 1993 went against the advice of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] 1986. The Commission stated, speaking about referenda more broadly, \"In general, initiatives and referendums are blunt and crude devices.... [that] would blur the lines of accountability and responsibility of Governments\".<ref>Royal Commission on the Electoral System \"Towards a Better Democracy\" [1986\u20131987] IX AJHR H3 at [7.30].</ref>\n\nA total of 33 petitions have been launched since 1993 on a wide range of topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Only five (one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009, one in 2013) have come to a vote. The other petitions failed to gain enough signatures to force a referendum. Achieving the target number of signatures is a requirement for forcing a vote on an initiative proposed by citizens.\n\n===Firefighters===\nThe first citizens initiated referendum was held on 2 December 1995. The question \"Should the number of professional fire-fighters employed full-time in the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] be reduced below the number employed on 1 January 1995?\" aimed to elicit a \"no\" response{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Turnout was low as the referendum was not held in conjunction with a general election. Just over 12% voted \"Yes\" and almost 88% voted \"No\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1995.electionresults.govt.nz/1995_citizens_referenda/|format=PDF|title=Return of Citizens Initiated Referendum Poll Votes|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]}}</ref>\n\n===1999 election===\nAt the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] two referendums were put before voters. One was on whether the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced from 120 to 99. Electors overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal, with 81.47% voting for this proposal. However, there were no moves to amend the [[Electoral Act 1993]] in line with this result until 2006 when a bill was introduced by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Barbara Stewart]] to reduce the size of Parliament to 100. The bill passed its first reading, 61 votes to 60 and was referred to Select Committee. The Select Committee returned recommending the bill to not be passed, citing reasons including public misconception on the MMP voting system, population growth, and international comparability.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/067094C5-47A4-43AA-AE7F-5D7C15B55D3E/36327/DBSCH_SCR_3542_3576.pdf |title= Electoral (Reduction in Number of Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill: Report of the Justice and Electoral Committee |year= 2006 |accessdate= 15 August 2012}}</ref> The bill was subsequently voted down 112 to 9 at its second reading.\n\nThe other referendum held in 1999 asked \"Should there be a reform of our Justice system placing greater emphasis on the needs of victims, providing restitution and compensation for them and imposing minimum sentences and hard labour for all serious violent offences?\". This measure passed by 91.78%. There was some debate over the phrasing of the referendum, as the question actually contains five separate questions; voters could agree with some, but not with others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/_2001/publications_2001/Massey_News/February/Feb_26/stories/referendum.html|title=Referendum Confuses Voters|year=2007|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Parental corporal punishment===\n{{main|2009 New Zealand corporal punishment referendum}}\nFollowing the submission of a petition on 22 August 2008, the Clerk of the House verified to Parliament that the threshold for a CIR had been reached.

[[ACT New Zealand]], [[Family First New Zealand]], the [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] and [[Kiwi Party]] all advocate binding referendums.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, [[Kiwi Party]] President [[Larry Baldock]] failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]] and its leader, [[Colin Craig]].\n\nBy contrast, [[GayNZ.com]] has run articles strongly critical of the CIR lobby, as well as expressing concerns that CIRs could be abused to strip vulnerable minorities of their legislative protections, as has occurred frequently with referendums against [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] and similar proposals that target [[illegal immigrants]] in that country. In some New Zealand media outlets, the [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland]] has also been cited as one current example of anti-minoritarian abuse of the 'citizens' referendum process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/31/article_8116.php |title=The case against Citizens Initiated Referenda |publisher=Gaynz.com |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"3News_131865\">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Swiss-ban-mosque-minarets-in-surprise-vote/tabid/417/articleID/131865/cat/268/Default.aspx |title=Swiss ban mosque minarets in surprise vote |date=30 November 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Joanne Black: \"Heidi Ho\": New Zealand Listener: 12.12.09: 94</ref>\n\nEven amongst conservatives, the issue has become contentious. The [[Maxim Institute]] has announced its opposition to binding citizens referendums, citing the adverse fiscal management consequences that have ensued in the state of [[California]] in a recent paper from Richard Ekins, a [[University of Auckland]] legal academic.<ref>Richard Ekins: \"A Government for the People: The Value of Representative Democracy\": http://www.maxim.org.nz/files/pdf/a_government_for_the_people.pdf</ref> Former New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] also opposes binding referendums on fiscal grounds, noting that California's contradictory tax cap and public spending referendums have made state fiscal management chaotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Binding-referenda-not-a-good-idea---Key/tabid/419/articleID/130818/Default.aspx |title=New Zealand's latest news, sport, entertainment, politics, business |publisher=3 News |date= |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> However, a key problem with that argument is that ballot initiatives only make up 2% of the Californian state budget, once Proposition 98 is removed from the equation (Proposition 98 locks in education spending which probably would have been spent anyways and had always occupied about one-third of the Californian budget).<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=476443</ref>\n\nDuring 2009, there was additional criticism from prominent New Zealand legal academics, such as Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton at [[Otago University]]. They argue that CIRs are no substitute for more deliberative processes within the existing framework of [[representative democracy]], such as joining political parties, protest marches, voting within general elections and parliamentary select committee submissions.<ref>Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton: \"Citizens Initiated Referenda\" New Zealand Law Journal (October 2009): 334-6</ref>\n\n===Table

Referendums may be government-initiated or held in accordance with the [[Electoral Act 1993]] or the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993]. Ten [[referendum]]s have been held so far (excluding referendums on alcohol licensing, which were held triennially between 1894 and 1989). Seven were government-led, and three were indicative citizen initiatives.\n\n==Government referendums==\nThe government of New Zealand may, at any time, call for a referendum on any issue. This requires enabling legislation to determine whether the outcome will be binding on the government or merely indicative. This allows parliamentary scrutiny of the issue and wording of the question. There is no constraint on whether an issue is to be decided by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] or by the public, except for where the reserved provisions of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] are engaged. [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310495.html Section 268] of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] protects some of the provisions of the Act from amendment except in accordance with s 268(2) which requires a majority vote in a referendum of a 75% majority of Members of Parliament.<ref>Electoral Act 1993, s 268.</ref> The protected provisions include, ''inter alia'', the term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], the voting age and the voting method. The provision itself is not protected from ordinary amendment or repeal.\n\nThis has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, as there is in other countries like [[Australia]] or [[Switzerland]] that have codified [[constitution]]s.\n\nRecent examples are the [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag referendums]] held across 2015 and 2016, conducted by postal vote.\n\n===Constitutional referendums===\nThere is no requirement for a referendum to enact constitutional change in New Zealand. Referendums were held in 1992 and 1993 to decide the nature of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]]. Many groups advocate approval of constitutional reforms by referendums; the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|Republican Movement]] supports a referendum on whether [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand should become a republic]].\n\nThere are frequent calls for the use of referendums to decide other constitutional matters, rather than by regular Acts of Parliament. In 2003 the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] replaced the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] as New Zealand's highest court of appeal with a new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]], despite calls from [[New Zealand First]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] for a referendum to be held on the issue. In 1950 the abolition of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] was done by Act of Parliament; with additional members of the Legislative Council (MLC) appointed to ensure approval by the upper house, the ''suicide squad''.\n\n{{See also|Constitution of New Zealand}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''Turnout''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || 69.7 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 68.1% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 27 October 1990 || 85.2 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 69.3% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 19 September 1992 || 55.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 84.7% for change, 70.5% to MMP\n|-\n| 6 November 1993 || 85.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 53.9% for MMP\n|-\n| 26 November 2011 || 73.5 || [[2011 New Zealand voting method referendum|Voting system]] || 57.8% for keeping MMP\n|}\n\n===Liquor licensing referendums===\nIn New Zealand, alcohol licensing has historically been decided by referendum. The first of these were compulsory local licensing referendums, held in 1894 and then with each main parliamentary election between 1896 and 1914. Local licensing referendums were eliminated after 1914, apart from 'local restoration polls' to legalise liquor sales in 'dry' districts. In 1910 a referendum on national prohibition of alcohol was introduced, and held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1987 inclusive (except [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] and [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). An extra referendum on prohibition was held on 10 April 1919. From 17 December 1919 the additional option of ''state purchase and control'' of liquor (i.e. nationalisation) was added to the ballot. The Sale of Liquor Act 1989 abolished the national liquor referendum. Local restoration polls were still held in areas that were still 'dry', but the last three, [[Mount Eden]], [[Mount Roskill, New Zealand|Mount Roskill]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], all became 'wet' in 1999. There have been two referendums on [[pub]] closing times.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Three-to-one majority to retain\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Two-to-one majority for later opening\n|}\n\n===Other referendums===\nThe government may call referendums on any issues on which it wishes. These will usually be on issues on which the government is split. For the 1997 referendum on retirement savings, the decision to hold it was part of the coalition agreement between [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand First]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || 54.3 || Allow off-course [[betting]] || 68.0% in favour\n|-\n| 3 August 1949 || 63.5 || [[Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand|Compulsory military training]] || 77.9% in favour\n|-\n| 5 September 1997 || 80.3 || Compulsory [[Retirement plan|Retirement Savings]] Scheme || 91.8% against\n|-\n| 20 November \u2013 11 December 2015 || 48.2 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], first stage || 50.58% for [[File:NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White & Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg|25px|border]] [[Lockwood silver fern flag|Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue)]] after 4 counts\n|-\n| 3\u201324 March 2016 || 67.8 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], second stage || 56.6% for retaining the existing [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|}\n\n==Citizens Initiated Referenda==\n{{anchor|Citizens initiated referendums|Citizens-initiated referenda||Citizens-initiated referendums}}\nThe [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993] allows for citizens to propose a [[Initiative|referendum]]. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months. There were [http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/2017-general-election-results/voter-turnout-statistics 3,298,009 voters enrolled] for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], so at least 329,801 signatures would be required at a rate of approximately 904 signatures per day. In reality, more signatures would be required to account for variances in electoral roll numbers, duplicate signatures and signatures that cannot be matched to a registered elector.\n\nThere are procedural requirements governing this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/seek-a-referendum/|title=Seek a referendum|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> It costs [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500 to file a petition asking for a referendum with the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Clerk formally determines the wording of the question, which may be quite different from the original. Once the Clerk receives the completed petition, the number of signatures is initially counted, followed by sample groups of signatures being taken and the signatories' names and addresses checked against the electoral roll. The sampling of signatures is used to estimate the number of valid signatures for the whole petition with confidence, and if the lower confidence interval is more than ten percent of the electoral roll, the petition is presented to the House of Representatives.\n\nWithin one month of the petition's presentation to the House, a date for the poll must be determined. The poll must be held within 12 months of the petition's presentation, unless 75 percent of MPs vote to delay the poll for one year. There is also a $50,000 spending limit on promoting the petition.\n\nNew Zealand, [[Italy]], and [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)#Federal popular initiative|Switzerland]] are among countries whose laws allow for citizen-initiated referendums (CIRs) nationally. Its defenders view it as a form of \"direct democracy\". However, the Citizens Initiated Referendum 1993 went against the advice of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] 1986. The Commission stated, speaking about referenda more broadly, \"In general, initiatives and referendums are blunt and crude devices.... [that] would blur the lines of accountability and responsibility of Governments\".<ref>Royal Commission on the Electoral System \"Towards a Better Democracy\" [1986\u20131987] IX AJHR H3 at [7.30].</ref>\n\nA total of 33 petitions have been launched since 1993 on a wide range of topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Only five (one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009, one in 2013) have come to a vote. The other petitions failed to gain enough signatures to force a referendum. Achieving the target number of signatures is a requirement for forcing a vote on an initiative proposed by citizens.\n\n===Firefighters===\nThe first citizens initiated referendum was held on 2 December 1995. The question \"Should the number of professional fire-fighters employed full-time in the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] be reduced below the number employed on 1 January 1995?\" aimed to elicit a \"no\" response{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Turnout was low as the referendum was not held in conjunction with a general election. Just over 12% voted \"Yes\" and almost 88% voted \"No\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1995.electionresults.govt.nz/1995_citizens_referenda/|format=PDF|title=Return of Citizens Initiated Referendum Poll Votes|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]}}</ref>\n\n===1999 election===\nAt the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] two referendums were put before voters. One was on whether the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced from 120 to 99. Electors overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal, with 81.47% voting for this proposal. However, there were no moves to amend the [[Electoral Act 1993]] in line with this result until 2006 when a bill was introduced by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Barbara Stewart]] to reduce the size of Parliament to 100. The bill passed its first reading, 61 votes to 60 and was referred to Select Committee.

The only clear cases of non-implementation are the 99MP and smacking CIRs----> of successful referendums has led to calls for such referendums to be made binding on the government of the day, similar to the direct democracy said to exist in [[Swiss#Direct democracy|Switzerland]]. [[ACT New Zealand]], [[Family First New Zealand]], the [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] and [[Kiwi Party]] all advocate binding referendums.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, [[Kiwi Party]] President [[Larry Baldock]] failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]] and its leader, [[Colin Craig]].\n\nBy contrast, [[GayNZ.com]] has run articles strongly critical of the CIR lobby, as well as expressing concerns that CIRs could be abused to strip vulnerable minorities of their legislative protections, as has occurred frequently with referendums against [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] and similar proposals that target [[illegal immigrants]] in that country. In some New Zealand media outlets, the [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland]] has also been cited as one current example of anti-minoritarian abuse of the 'citizens' referendum process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/31/article_8116.php |title=The case against Citizens Initiated Referenda |publisher=Gaynz.com |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"3News_131865\">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Swiss-ban-mosque-minarets-in-surprise-vote/tabid/417/articleID/131865/cat/268/Default.aspx |title=Swiss ban mosque minarets in surprise vote |date=30 November 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Joanne Black: \"Heidi Ho\": New Zealand Listener: 12.12.09: 94</ref>\n\nEven amongst conservatives, the issue has become contentious. The [[Maxim Institute]] has announced its opposition to binding citizens referendums, citing the adverse fiscal management consequences that have ensued in the state of [[California]] in a recent paper from Richard Ekins, a [[University of Auckland]] legal academic.<ref>Richard Ekins: \"A Government for the People: The Value of Representative Democracy\": http://www.maxim.org.nz/files/pdf/a_government_for_the_people.pdf</ref> Former New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] also opposes binding referendums on fiscal grounds, noting that California's contradictory tax cap and public spending referendums have made state fiscal management chaotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Binding-referenda-not-a-good-idea---Key/tabid/419/articleID/130818/Default.aspx |title=New Zealand's latest news, sport, entertainment, politics, business |publisher=3 News |date= |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> However, a key problem with that argument is that ballot initiatives only make up 2% of the Californian state budget, once Proposition 98 is removed from the equation (Proposition 98 locks in education spending which probably would have been spent anyways and had always occupied about one-third of the Californian budget).<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=476443</ref>\n\nDuring 2009, there was additional criticism from prominent New Zealand legal academics, such as Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton at [[Otago University]]. They argue that CIRs are no substitute for more deliberative processes within the existing framework of [[representative democracy]], such as joining political parties, protest marches, voting within general elections and parliamentary select committee submissions.<ref>Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton: \"Citizens Initiated Referenda\" New Zealand Law Journal (October 2009): 334-6</ref>\n\n===Table

At the same time, he started climbing with fellow student Steven Vincent.\n\n==Expeditions==\nHe visited Everest in 1979, climbed [[Mount McKinley]], Alaska, in 1980, and [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in 1981.\n\nIn 1984, he successfully completed a solo expedition to the [[Magnetic North Pole]] without dogs, snow mobiles or air supplies. Also he led the first team in 1992 to walk unsupported to the [[North Pole#Geomagnetic North Pole|Geomagnetic North Pole]].{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=what is difference from Magnetic North Pole (which is mentioned before), if any}} This was described in the book ''A Race Against Time''. In 1996, he completed a solo unsupported expedition to the South Pole on 5 January, sailed to the [[South Magnetic Pole]] on 19 February, and led a team of novices to ski to the Magnetic North Pole on 15 May. The book ''Toughing it Out'' describes David's first 20 years of adventuring.\n\nIn 1998 he joined Norwegian [[Rune Gjeldnes]] in an attempt to reach the [[North Pole#Geographic North Pole|Geographical North Pole]], the final leg of his Grand Slam attempt, which he described in a book called ''Walking on Thin Ice''. He also became the first man to fly a balloon over the North Pole in 2000, a trip that emulated the ill-fated attempt by [[Salomon August Andr\u00e9e]], a Swede, to fly to the North Pole in the 19th century and which he also described in a book called ''At The Mercy of the Wind''.\n\nHe has made thirty Arctic expeditions and has reached the various Poles a record 14 times.\n\nOn 22 September 2003 he became the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean in an open wicker basket [[rozier balloon]]. The journey was from [[New Brunswick]], Canada to north of [[Blackpool]], UK.\n\nIn July 2004 he and co-pilot Lorne White flew a single engine [[Cessna]] from [[Cape Columbia]] in the north of Canada to [[Cape Horn]] at the southern tip of South America, covering 11,060 miles and arriving on 23 July after 12 days. In June 2005, Hempleman-Adams staged the world's \"highest\" formal dinner party. Hempleman-Adams, Alan Veal, and fellow adventurer [[Bear Grylls]] ascended to 24,262 feet in a [[hot air balloon]]. Grylls and Veal, wearing formal attire, then climbed down to a dinner table suspended 40 feet below the balloon and dined on asparagus, salmon, and summer fruits, and finally parachuted down to earth. His daughter [[Alicia Hempleman-Adams|Alicia Hempleman Adams]], at aged 8, became the youngest person to stand at the North Pole and in April 2005 aged 15 she became the youngest person to traverse [[Baffin Island]]. In January 2007, Hempleman-Adams broke the quarter-century old world small sized hot air balloon altitude record, by ascending to 9,906 meters over [[Alberta, Canada]]; beating the previous record of 9,537 metres set by [[Carol Rymer Davis|Carol Davis]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/cp/Oddities/070113/K011302AU.html |title=British adventurer sets hot-air balloon altitude record in central Alberta |access-date=14 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118191632/http://www.cbc.ca/cp/Oddities/070113/K011302AU.html |archive-date=18 January 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2007 Hempleman-Adams crossed the Atlantic in the smallest [[helium balloon]] to break the record for that particular class of balloon flying this distance. His aim was to land the balloon in Ireland but he was blown over to England by strong winds. See [http://www.toshibachallenge.com/ Toshiba Challenge website].\n\nIn September 2009 he broke the endurance record for a flight using the smallest man-carrying helium balloon. He flew 200 miles from [[Butler, Missouri]], to [[Cherokee, Oklahoma]], in 14 hours and 15 minutes using the class AA-01 balloon.
