It is the third of five collaborations between Castle and writer [[Robb White]], and stars [[Vincent Price]], [[Darryl Hickman]], [[Patricia Cutts]], [[Pamela Lincoln]], [[Philip Coolidge]], and [[Judith Evelyn]].\n\nThe film tells the story of a scientist who discovers a parasite in human beings, called a \"tingler\", which feeds on fear. The creature earned its name by making the spine of its host \"tingle\" when the host is frightened. In line with other Castle horror films, including ''[[Macabre (1958 film)|Macabre]]'' (1958) and ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1959), Castle used gimmicks to sell the film. ''The Tingler'' remains most well known for a gimmick called \"Percepto!\", a vibrating device in some theater chairs which activated with the onscreen action.\n\n''The Tingler'' received mixed reviews and is generally considered a [[Camp (style)|camp]] [[cult film|cult]] [[cult following|classic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/movie-spotlight/Content?oid=1184927|title=Movie Spotlight: The Tingler|publisher=IndyWeek.com|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/179085%7C179087/William-Castle-Profile.html|title=William Castle Profile|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/07/entertainment/et-castlelewton7|title=Scare-masters; horror times 2|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA [[pathologist]], Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a \"tingler\", a parasite attached to the human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming.\n\nMovie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), is deaf and mute, and therefore cannot scream. She dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events appear in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes a tingler from her spine.\n\nAfter they contain the tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The [[centipede]]-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it and is released into Higgins' theater. The tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room, where they find the tingler and capture it.\n\nGuessing that the only way to neutralize the tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door slams shut and locks itself and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death. The tingler causes the body of Martha to rise from the bed, staring at her husband. Higgins is so terrified that he is unable to scream. The screen fades, and Dr. Chapin's voice says, \"Ladies and gentlemen, just a word of warning. If any of you are not convinced that you have a tingler of your own, the next time you are frightened in the dark ... don't scream\".\n\n===Film prologue===\nIn a similar manner as [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931), Castle opened the film with an on-screen warning to the audience:\n:\"I am William Castle, the director of the motion picture you are about to see. I feel obligated to warn you that some of the sensations\u2014some of the physical reactions which the actors on the screen will feel\u2014will also be experienced, for the first time in motion picture history, by certain members of this audience. I say 'certain members' because some people are more sensitive to these mysterious electronic impulses than others. These unfortunate, sensitive people will at times feel a strange, tingling sensation; other people will feel it less strongly. But don't be alarmed\u2014you can protect yourself. At any time you are conscious of a tingling sensation, you may obtain immediate relief by screaming. Don't be embarrassed about opening your mouth and letting rip with all you've got, because the person in the seat right next to you will probably be screaming too. And remember\u2014a scream at the right time may save your life.\"<ref name=\"Murray\">{{cite journal |last=Leeder |first=Murray |author-link= |title=Collective Screams: William Castle and the Gimmick Film |journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]] |volume=44 |issue=4 |page=773-74, 785 |publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc. |location= |date=2011 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1531466/_Collective_Screams_William_Castle_and_the_Gimmick_Film_ |url-access=registration |issn=0033-3840 |access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Dr. Warren Chapin\n* [[Judith Evelyn]] as Mrs. Martha Ryerson Higgins\n* [[Darryl Hickman]] as Dave Morris\n* [[Patricia Cutts]] as Isabel Stevens Chapin\n* [[Pamela Lincoln]] as Lucy Stevens\n* [[Philip Coolidge]] as Oliver \"Ollie\" Higgins\n\n==Production==\nThe financial success of ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' was reason enough for [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] to produce ''The Tingler''. Price was on board again, with Hickman playing his assistant and newcomer Lincoln playing his sister-in-law. Cutts played Price's unfaithful wife Isabel.\n\nCastle convinced Hickman, who was Lincoln's real-life fianc\u00e9, to join the cast as her fianc\u00e9 in the film. At first Hickman declined, but agreed after Castle convinced him it would help Lincoln's career. According to Hickman, Castle did such a good job of convincing him it would help Lincoln that he worked for no salary. Hickman, who was 5'10\", was required to wear lifts for the scenes with 6'4\" Vincent Price to offset the disparity of their heights.\n\nEvelyn was hired at the request of Price, who had worked with her on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. She also received attention in another prominent \"non-speaking role\" as the suicidal \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" in [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954). [[Dal McKennon]], the projectionist (uncredited in the film), had a successful career as the voice of many screen and TV characters, including \"Buzz Buzzard\" in the [[Woody Woodpecker]] cartoons and \"[[Gumby]]\" in the TV clay animation series. Jack Dusick, make-up artist for ''The Tingler'', was the father of singer/actress [[Michele Lee]].\n\nWhite, the story author, was partly inspired by his encounter with a [[centipede]] while living in the British Virgin Islands.<ref>[https://horrornews.net/80498/film-review-tingler-1959/ Film Review: ''The Tingler'' (1959)] at horrornews.net</ref>\n\nWhite had experimented with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] after hearing about it from [[Aldous Huxley]] and decided to work it into the script.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/185034%7C0/Insider-Info-The-Tingler.html TCM Behind the Scenes: ''The Tingler'']</ref> It is the first depiction of LSD use in a major motion picture.<ref name=\"Murray\"/> At the time, the drug was legal. The title of the book that Vincent Price's character reads before taking LSD\u2014''Fright Effects Induced by Injection of Lysergic Acid LSD25''\u2014is printed on the back of the book, not the front. This was done for a better shot of the expositional title of the book, explaining the effects of LSD to the audience.\n\n''The Tingler'' was Price's second and final film with Castle and the fifth performance that would ultimately brand him as \"The Master of Menace\".\n\nThe movie playing in the theater when the tingler escapes was the 1921 silent film ''[[Tol'able David]]''.\n\n==Analysis==\nA subplot of the film involves the fates of a movie theater specializing in [[silent film]]s and its owners. According to Kevin Heffernan, this reflects the conditions of the movie theater industry in the late 1950s. There were many [[discount theater]]s trying to establish their own market niche by showing older films. For the owners of these small theaters, it was a thankless and poorly paid job, as described in the trade journals of this period. When Ollie describes at length the work load involved in cleaning the building, he echoes real-life complaints.<ref name=\"Heffernan\">Heffernan (2004), p. 100-104</ref> This provides the motive for his murder, as he is trying to escape a hopeless life.<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/>\n\nAnother subplot involves dysfunctional married lives. Most prominent is that of Warren to Isabelle, who is clearly unfaithful to him. She stays out until the early hours of the morning and is seen giving her lover a farewell kiss. In another scene, Warren enters through the front door of his house and hears the back door slam. He then discovers two used glasses of wine and a forgotten tie clip.<ref name=\"Brottman\">Brottman (2004), p. 273</ref> In an argument between them, she does not deny her unfaithfulness, but counters by accusing her husband of neglecting her. While spending so many hours in his laboratory, he has lost contact with living people, leaving her no choice but to seek human affection elsewhere.<ref name=\"Brottman\">Brottman (2004), p. 273</ref> The marriage of Ollie and Martha is also an unhappy one. He claims that Martha would have killed him if she could.<ref name=\"Brottman\">Brottman (2004), p. 273</ref>\n\nMartha is depicted as a woman with a whole range of obsessive and phobic traits. She even communicates in a neurotic pantomime. [[Tim Lucas]] has described her as a silent film character in a [[sound film]].<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/> The idea of a terrified, mute woman was not fully original. According to Heffernan, it was probably inspired by ''[[The Spiral Staircase (1946 film)|The Spiral Staircase]]'' (1946).<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/>\n\nThe scene with the LSD trip offers a display of \"stylized and exaggerated performance\". The eyes of Warren shift from side to side, gazing suspiciously at his environment, while describing feelings of unease and apprehension. He loosens his tie, when he thinks himself unable to breathe. He opens a window while insisting that it is nailed shut. He sees a hanging skeleton as a moving figure, and describes the walls of the room as closing in on him. Finally he visibly struggles with the urge to scream, and succumbs to it.<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/>\n\n==Gimmicks==\nWilliam Castle was famous for his movie [[William Castle|gimmicks]], and ''The Tingler'' featured one of his best: \"Percepto!\". Previously, he had offered a $1,000 life insurance policy against \"Death by Fright\" for ''[[Macabre (1958 film)|Macabre]]'' (1958) and sent a skeleton flying above the audiences' heads in the auditorium in ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1959).\n\n===Percepto: \"Scream for your lives!\"===\n\"Percepto!\" was a gimmick where Castle attached electrical \"buzzers\" to the underside of some seats in theaters where ''The Tingler'' was screened.<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1887720_1887723_1887727,00.html|title=The Great Gatsby in 3D: Top 10 Movie Gimmicks|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=Jan 12, 2011|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref> The buzzers were small surplus airplane wing [[De-ice|deicing]] motors left from [[World War II]]. The cost of this equipment added $250,000 to the film's budget. It was used predominantly in larger theaters.\n\nDuring the climax of the film, ''The Tingler'' was unleashed in the movie theater, while the audience watched ''[[Tol'able David]]'' (1921), in which a young woman escapes the unwanted advances of her boyfriend and is targeted. In the real-life theater, a woman screamed and then pretended to faint; she was then taken away in a stretcher, all part of the show arranged by Castle.<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/> From the screen, the voice of Price mentioned the fainted lady and asked the rest of the audience to remain seated. The film-within-a-film resumed and was interrupted again. The projected film appeared to break as the silhouette of the tingler moved across the projection beam. The image of the film went dark, all lights in the auditorium (except fire exit signs) went off, and Price's voice warned the audience, \"Ladies and gentlemen, please ''do not'' panic. But scream! Scream for your lives! The tingler is loose in ''this'' theater!\"<ref>Browne (2001), p. 144</ref> This cued the theater projectionist to activate the Percepto! buzzers, giving some audience members an unexpected jolt, followed by a highly visible physical reaction. The voices of scared patrons were heard from the screen, replaced by the voice of Price, who explained that the tingler was paralyzed and the danger was over. At this point, the film resumed its normal format, which was used for its epilogue.<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/>\n\nAn alternate warning was recorded for [[drive-in theater]]s; this warning advised the audience the tingler was loose in the drive-in. Castle's voice was substituted for Price's in this version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dvd-the-tingler-vincent-price/3626196#productInfoTabs |title=The Tingler |website=barnesandnoble.com|access-date=April 27, 2017| quote = \"Also included is \"William Castle's Drive-In Scream! Scene,\" which is an additional scene created for the drive-in market and features Castle's own voice replacing that of Vincent Price.\"}}</ref>\n\nCastle's autobiography, ''Step Right Up!: I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America'', erroneously stated that \"Percepto!\" delivered electric shocks to the theater seats.<ref>Castle (1976)</ref>\n\nTwo [[Joe Dante]] films contain scenes which reference the \"Percepto!\" gimmick: ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'' (1990) and ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' (1993).\n\n===Fainting customers and medical assistance===\nTo enhance the climax even more, Castle hired fake \"screamers and fainters\" planted in the audience.<ref name=\"time\"/> There were fake nurses stationed in the foyer and an ambulance outside of the theater. The \"fainters\" would be carried out on a gurney and whisked away in the ambulance, to return for the next showing.\n\n===The \"Bloody Bathtub\" scene===\nAlthough ''The Tingler'' was filmed in black-and-white, a short color sequence was spliced into the film. It showed a sink (in black-and-white) with bright-red \"blood\" flowing from the taps and a black-and-white Evelyn watching a bloody red hand rising from a bathtub, likewise filled with the bright red \"blood\".

It is the third of five collaborations between Castle and writer [[Robb White]], and stars [[Vincent Price]], [[Darryl Hickman]], [[Patricia Cutts]], [[Pamela Lincoln]], [[Philip Coolidge]], and [[Judith Evelyn]].\n\nThe film tells the story of a scientist who discovers a parasite in human beings, called a \"tingler\", which feeds on fear. The creature earned its name by making the spine of its host \"tingle\" when the host is frightened. In line with other Castle horror films, including ''[[Macabre (1958 film)|Macabre]]'' (1958) and ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1959), Castle used gimmicks to sell the film. ''The Tingler'' remains most well known for a gimmick called \"Percepto!\", a vibrating device in some theater chairs which activated with the onscreen action.\n\n''The Tingler'' received mixed reviews and is generally considered a [[Camp (style)|camp]] [[cult classic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/movie-spotlight/Content?oid=1184927|title=Movie Spotlight: The Tingler|publisher=IndyWeek.com|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/179085%7C179087/William-Castle-Profile.html|title=William Castle Profile|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/07/entertainment/et-castlelewton7|title=Scare-masters; horror times 2|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA [[pathologist]], Dr. Warren Chapin (Price), discovers that the tingling of the spine in states of extreme fear is due to the growth of a creature that every human being seems to have, called a \"tingler\", a parasite attached to the human spine. It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming.\n\nMovie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), is deaf and mute, and therefore cannot scream. She dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events appear in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes a tingler from her spine.\n\nAfter they contain the tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The [[centipede]]-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it and is released into Higgins' theater. The tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room, where they find the tingler and capture it.\n\nGuessing that the only way to neutralize the tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door slams shut and locks itself and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death. The tingler causes the body of Martha to rise from the bed, staring at her husband. Higgins is so terrified that he is unable to scream. The screen fades, and Dr. Chapin's voice says, \"Ladies and gentlemen, just a word of warning. If any of you are not convinced that you have a tingler of your own, the next time you are frightened in the dark ... don't scream\".\n\n===Film prologue===\nIn a similar manner as [[Universal Studios|Universal]]'s ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931), Castle opened the film with an on-screen warning to the audience:\n:\"I am William Castle, the director of the motion picture you are about to see. I feel obligated to warn you that some of the sensations\u2014some of the physical reactions which the actors on the screen will feel\u2014will also be experienced, for the first time in motion picture history, by certain members of this audience. I say 'certain members' because some people are more sensitive to these mysterious electronic impulses than others. These unfortunate, sensitive people will at times feel a strange, tingling sensation; other people will feel it less strongly. But don't be alarmed\u2014you can protect yourself. At any time you are conscious of a tingling sensation, you may obtain immediate relief by screaming. Don't be embarrassed about opening your mouth and letting rip with all you've got, because the person in the seat right next to you will probably be screaming too. And remember\u2014a scream at the right time may save your life.\"<ref name=\"Murray\">{{cite journal |last=Leeder |first=Murray |author-link= |title=Collective Screams: William Castle and the Gimmick Film |journal=[[The Journal of Popular Culture]] |volume=44 |issue=4 |page=773-74, 785 |publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc. |location= |date=2011 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1531466/_Collective_Screams_William_Castle_and_the_Gimmick_Film_ |url-access=registration |issn=0033-3840 |access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vincent Price]] as Dr. Warren Chapin\n* [[Judith Evelyn]] as Mrs. Martha Ryerson Higgins\n* [[Darryl Hickman]] as Dave Morris\n* [[Patricia Cutts]] as Isabel Stevens Chapin\n* [[Pamela Lincoln]] as Lucy Stevens\n* [[Philip Coolidge]] as Oliver \"Ollie\" Higgins\n\n==Production==\nThe financial success of ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' was reason enough for [[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]] to produce ''The Tingler''. Price was on board again, with Hickman playing his assistant and newcomer Lincoln playing his sister-in-law. Cutts played Price's unfaithful wife Isabel.\n\nCastle convinced Hickman, who was Lincoln's real-life fianc\u00e9, to join the cast as her fianc\u00e9 in the film. At first Hickman declined, but agreed after Castle convinced him it would help Lincoln's career. According to Hickman, Castle did such a good job of convincing him it would help Lincoln that he worked for no salary. Hickman, who was 5'10\", was required to wear lifts for the scenes with 6'4\" Vincent Price to offset the disparity of their heights.\n\nEvelyn was hired at the request of Price, who had worked with her on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. She also received attention in another prominent \"non-speaking role\" as the suicidal \"Miss Lonelyhearts\" in [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954). [[Dal McKennon]], the projectionist (uncredited in the film), had a successful career as the voice of many screen and TV characters, including \"Buzz Buzzard\" in the [[Woody Woodpecker]] cartoons and \"[[Gumby]]\" in the TV clay animation series. Jack Dusick, make-up artist for ''The Tingler'', was the father of singer/actress [[Michele Lee]].\n\nWhite, the story author, was partly inspired by his encounter with a [[centipede]] while living in the British Virgin Islands.<ref>[https://horrornews.net/80498/film-review-tingler-1959/ Film Review: ''The Tingler'' (1959)] at horrornews.net</ref>\n\nWhite had experimented with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] after hearing about it from [[Aldous Huxley]] and decided to work it into the script.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/185034%7C0/Insider-Info-The-Tingler.html TCM Behind the Scenes: ''The Tingler'']</ref> It is the first depiction of LSD use in a major motion picture.<ref name=\"Murray\"/> At the time, the drug was legal. The title of the book that Vincent Price's character reads before taking LSD\u2014''Fright Effects Induced by Injection of Lysergic Acid LSD25''\u2014is printed on the back of the book, not the front. This was done for a better shot of the expositional title of the book, explaining the effects of LSD to the audience.\n\n''The Tingler'' was Price's second and final film with Castle and the fifth performance that would ultimately brand him as \"The Master of Menace\".\n\nThe movie playing in the theater when the tingler escapes was the 1921 silent film ''[[Tol'able David]]''.\n\n==Analysis==\nA subplot of the film involves the fates of a movie theater specializing in [[silent film]]s and its owners. According to Kevin Heffernan, this reflects the conditions of the movie theater industry in the late 1950s. There were many [[discount theater]]s trying to establish their own market niche by showing older films. For the owners of these small theaters, it was a thankless and poorly paid job, as described in the trade journals of this period. When Ollie describes at length the work load involved in cleaning the building, he echoes real-life complaints.<ref name=\"Heffernan\">Heffernan (2004), p. 100-104</ref> This provides the motive for his murder, as he is trying to escape a hopeless life.<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/>\n\nAnother subplot involves dysfunctional married lives. Most prominent is that of Warren to Isabelle, who is clearly unfaithful to him. She stays out until the early hours of the morning and is seen giving her lover a farewell kiss. In another scene, Warren enters through the front door of his house and hears the back door slam. He then discovers two used glasses of wine and a forgotten tie clip.<ref name=\"Brottman\">Brottman (2004), p. 273</ref> In an argument between them, she does not deny her unfaithfulness, but counters by accusing her husband of neglecting her. While spending so many hours in his laboratory, he has lost contact with living people, leaving her no choice but to seek human affection elsewhere.<ref name=\"Brottman\">Brottman (2004), p. 273</ref> The marriage of Ollie and Martha is also an unhappy one. He claims that Martha would have killed him if she could.<ref name=\"Brottman\">Brottman (2004), p. 273</ref>\n\nMartha is depicted as a woman with a whole range of obsessive and phobic traits. She even communicates in a neurotic pantomime. [[Tim Lucas]] has described her as a silent film character in a [[sound film]].<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/> The idea of a terrified, mute woman was not fully original. According to Heffernan, it was probably inspired by ''[[The Spiral Staircase (1946 film)|The Spiral Staircase]]'' (1946).<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/>\n\nThe scene with the LSD trip offers a display of \"stylized and exaggerated performance\". The eyes of Warren shift from side to side, gazing suspiciously at his environment, while describing feelings of unease and apprehension. He loosens his tie, when he thinks himself unable to breathe. He opens a window while insisting that it is nailed shut. He sees a hanging skeleton as a moving figure, and describes the walls of the room as closing in on him. Finally he visibly struggles with the urge to scream, and succumbs to it.<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/>\n\n==Gimmicks==\nWilliam Castle was famous for his movie [[William Castle|gimmicks]], and ''The Tingler'' featured one of his best: \"Percepto!\". Previously, he had offered a $1,000 life insurance policy against \"Death by Fright\" for ''[[Macabre (1958 film)|Macabre]]'' (1958) and sent a skeleton flying above the audiences' heads in the auditorium in ''[[House on Haunted Hill]]'' (1959).\n\n===Percepto: \"Scream for your lives!\"===\n\"Percepto!\" was a gimmick where Castle attached electrical \"buzzers\" to the underside of some seats in theaters where ''The Tingler'' was screened.<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1887720_1887723_1887727,00.html|title=The Great Gatsby in 3D: Top 10 Movie Gimmicks|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=Jan 12, 2011|accessdate=May 6, 2011}}</ref> The buzzers were small surplus airplane wing [[De-ice|deicing]] motors left from [[World War II]]. The cost of this equipment added $250,000 to the film's budget. It was used predominantly in larger theaters.\n\nDuring the climax of the film, ''The Tingler'' was unleashed in the movie theater, while the audience watched ''[[Tol'able David]]'' (1921), in which a young woman escapes the unwanted advances of her boyfriend and is targeted. In the real-life theater, a woman screamed and then pretended to faint; she was then taken away in a stretcher, all part of the show arranged by Castle.<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/> From the screen, the voice of Price mentioned the fainted lady and asked the rest of the audience to remain seated. The film-within-a-film resumed and was interrupted again. The projected film appeared to break as the silhouette of the tingler moved across the projection beam. The image of the film went dark, all lights in the auditorium (except fire exit signs) went off, and Price's voice warned the audience, \"Ladies and gentlemen, please ''do not'' panic. But scream! Scream for your lives! The tingler is loose in ''this'' theater!\"<ref>Browne (2001), p. 144</ref> This cued the theater projectionist to activate the Percepto! buzzers, giving some audience members an unexpected jolt, followed by a highly visible physical reaction. The voices of scared patrons were heard from the screen, replaced by the voice of Price, who explained that the tingler was paralyzed and the danger was over. At this point, the film resumed its normal format, which was used for its epilogue.<ref name=\"Heffernan\"/>\n\nAn alternate warning was recorded for [[drive-in theater]]s; this warning advised the audience the tingler was loose in the drive-in. Castle's voice was substituted for Price's in this version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dvd-the-tingler-vincent-price/3626196#productInfoTabs |title=The Tingler |website=barnesandnoble.com|access-date=April 27, 2017| quote = \"Also included is \"William Castle's Drive-In Scream! Scene,\" which is an additional scene created for the drive-in market and features Castle's own voice replacing that of Vincent Price.\"}}</ref>\n\nCastle's autobiography, ''Step Right Up!: I'm Gonna Scare the Pants off America'', erroneously stated that \"Percepto!\" delivered electric shocks to the theater seats.<ref>Castle (1976)</ref>\n\nTwo [[Joe Dante]] films contain scenes which reference the \"Percepto!\" gimmick: ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]'' (1990) and ''[[Matinee (1993 film)|Matinee]]'' (1993).\n\n===Fainting customers and medical assistance===\nTo enhance the climax even more, Castle hired fake \"screamers and fainters\" planted in the audience.<ref name=\"time\"/> There were fake nurses stationed in the foyer and an ambulance outside of the theater. The \"fainters\" would be carried out on a gurney and whisked away in the ambulance, to return for the next showing.\n\n===The \"Bloody Bathtub\" scene===\nAlthough ''The Tingler'' was filmed in black-and-white, a short color sequence was spliced into the film. It showed a sink (in black-and-white) with bright-red \"blood\" flowing from the taps and a black-and-white Evelyn watching a bloody red hand rising from a bathtub, likewise filled with the bright red \"blood\". Castle used color film for the effect. The scene was accomplished by painting the set white, black and gray and applying gray makeup to the actress to simulate monochrome.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heffernan|first=Kevin|year=2004|title=Ghouls, Gimmicks and Gold: Horror Films and the American Movie Business, 1953-1968|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3215-9}}</ref> Some claim that the scene is actually filmed black and white and that they only paint the \"blood\" red on the film.

Just like the settlement of Ba-i, Tabuco had large plain area and rich forestry, and the climate was suited to farm crops.

There were many trees of [[Kaffir lime|kabuyaw]] growing around the area. The fruit of kabuyaw was used as shampoo. So, when the priest asked for the name of the place, the native females readily answered \"'''kabuyaw'''\", thinking that the priest was asking for the name of the trees growing around the wharf.

These Malays were attracted to the progress of [[Manila|Maynila]] which was the center of commerce/trade by the natives coming around the lake of Ba-i which is known today as [[Laguna de Bay]].  This place was the exchanging point of commerce and trade between the natives and the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Arab people|Arabs]] and other [[Malay race]].  These foreign traders established their respective villages around the lake of Ba-i.\n\nOne of the biggest villages established in the western portion of the lake was \"Tabuko\" or \"Hangganang Ilog\" which means boundary in the native tongue.  The natives of this village came from [[Malay race]] of [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Indochina]].  Tabuko had no definite boundary except for natural landmarks such as the mountain, hills and lake.  It can be said that the boundary of \"Tabuko\" reached the mountain range of Sungay at the west, Mt. Makiling at the south, the lake of Ba-i at the east and the large track of quicksand at Tunasan it the north.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\">[http://www.cabuyao.gov.ph/history/50-historyofcabuyao Cabuyao Official Website \u2013 History]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Spanish Era===\nAfter the colonization of [[Manila]] by [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] in 1570, he instructed [[Juan de Salcedo|Captain Juan de Salcedo]] to conquer all settlements or barangays around the lake of Ba-i ([[Laguna de Bay]]).  The first settlement conquered by Capt. Juan de Salcedo was on the eastern portion of the lake, known today as [[Taytay, Rizal|Taytay]] and [[Cainta]] in the province of [[Rizal]].  Then, he crossed the lake of Ba-i and Acheron at Barangay Pinagsangahan, which is [[Pagsanjan, Laguna|Pagsanjan]] today, and continued inland and conquered other settlements, known today as [[Nagcarlan, Laguna|Nagcarlan]] and [[Majayjay, Laguna|Majayjay]]. Because the place was already mountainous, the party of Capt. Juan de Salcedo went back to the Lake of Ba-i and continued to conquer the settlements in the northern portion of Lake Ba-i, now called the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]]. In their journey, they anchored at the shore of Tabuko.  Just like the settlement of Ba-i, Tabuko had large plain area and rich forestry and the climate was suited to farm crops.  On January 16, 1571, it was announced by Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi that Tabuko be considered as \"[[encomienda]]\" or a town under Gaspar Ramirez.  And that the settlement or barangay Malabanan, [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] and [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]] be under the administration of Tabuko government.  This was the time that Tabuko had a definite boundary. The boundary at the north was Tunasan, south was Ba-i, west was Sungay and at the east was Lake Ba-i.\n\nThe town of Tabuko was located near the corner of a river and the lake of Ba-i which used bancas or raft as the common means of transportation going to Tabuko.  When Franciscan priests came to Tabuko under Father Velin, there were many native females doing their laundry chore near the wharf where the boat of the Franciscan priests docked.  There were many trees of \"[[Kaffir lime|Kabuyaw]]\", the fruit of which was used as shampoo, growing around the area.  When the priest asked for the name of the place, the native females readily answered \"Kabuyaw\" thinking that the priest was asking for the name of the trees growing around the wharf.  From then on, the priests and other Spanish officials called the town of Tabuko as Kabuyaw.\n\nThe Spaniards made Cabuyao as its center of government, which included the barangay of Malabanan, now the Cities of [[Bi\u00f1an]], [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]] and [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]].  Because the barangays became haciendas of the friars, the barangay was separated from Cabuyao one by one.\nThe first to be separated was barangay Calamba that was hacienda de San Juan Bautista then.  In 1689, barangay Malabanan was separated and became the town of [[Bi\u00f1an]] (now a city).  This was followed by barangay Santa Rosa de Lima.\n\nOn the summer of 1896, news spread over Cabuyao that the province of [[Cavite]] revolted against the Spanish government.  Anticipating the disorder it will bring to the community, Lt. Isabelo Virtucio readily organized a volunteer group who will fight against the Spanish government.  He coordinated with the different leaders of the revolutionary groups and his group joined the forces of [[Paciano Rizal|Gen. Paciano Rizal]], the brother of our national hero, [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal|Dr. Jose Rizal]].  The group adopted [[guerrilla]] warfare in fighting the Spaniards such as ambush, surprise attack and putting up traps on the roads used by the enemy.  It was almost two (2) years before the Spanish armed forces surrendered in 1898.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===American Era===\n[[File:Matang Tubig Cave.jpg|270px|thumb|A Matang Tubig Cave, American soldiers hiding at the cave during Japanese-American, World War II since 1932]]\nIt was not long before the residents of Cabuyao celebrated the independence of the [[Philippines]] from the Spanish government when the Americans arrived in 1899.  They thought that the Americans were allies and friends but learned later that the Americans were the next conqueror of the Philippines.\n\nImmediately, Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista organized a company of soldiers and fought the Americans who tried to conquer the town of Cabuyao.  On their first encounter, many died on the side of Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista because of inferior equipment used.  They retreated on the mountain called Kay Sili (which is [[Barangay Casile, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Casile]] today) at the western portion of the town of Cabuyao to prepare for another encounter.  However, the Americans continued conquering other towns and established their headquarters at the convent of the church.  The first American soldiers who arrived at Cabuyao were hostile to the residents of Cabuyao.  They feared most one Lt. Robert who was fearsome, giving penalty to those who were suspected as rebels.\n\nIn the early years of American occupation of Cabuyao, peace and order became a problem because of the frequent robbery made by the former Filipino soldiers who refused to surrender to the American forces.  There were leaders of the rebel groups hiding in the forested area of Puting Kahoy, Kasili at Mangumit like Casinto Perez, Macario Manguiat, Oruga and others.  Those who were suspected with association to these rebel leaders were arrested and tortured.\n\nDuring the height of the campaign for peace and order of the American forces of Cabuyao, its parish priest, Fr. Eulalio Mea, was arrested and imprisoned because he was suspected that he had knowledge of the disorder happening in Cabuyao.  Fortunately, Mr. Jose Batallones who knew how to speak [[English language|English]] negotiated for the freedom of those who were not really involved.\n\nThe first town mayor of Cabuyao was Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista after she peacefully surrendered to the Americans through the intervention of her nephew, Mr. Jose Ignacio BautiSanta But she was temporarily removed from office when she was suspected as part of the party that abducted Mr. Dominador Delfino and Mr. Jose Hemedes, prominent residents of Cabuyao in July 1904.  Commander Oruga, believed to be the leader of the group, was a former companion of Captain Krizia Ignacio BautiSanta Mr. Luis Bella, the vice mayor then of Capt. Bautista, was installed as the town mayor.\n\nOn August 29, 1904, Mr. Dominador Delfino and Jose Hemedes were released from their captivity without any harm incurred on them.  On September 7, 1904, Capt. Sotero Batallones, the friend of Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista reassumed her position as mayor of Cabuyao.\n\nDuring his term as mayor of Cabuyao, he accomplished many development projects.  He was instrumental in the construction of the school building at Bagong Kalsada, which is now Bonifacio Street.  This building is now the Cabuyao Central School.  On the same year, an artesian well was constructed at the town plaza and another at the new school site.\n\nMr. Agustin Dedicatoria replaced Sotero Battalones, which reassumed the position of Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista as mayor of Cabuyao and served from 1913 to 1916.  He was instrumental in the construction of the monument of [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal|Dr. Jose Rizal]] at the Cabuyao City Plaza and the establishment of the new municipal cemetery at the southwestern portions of the town somewhere the area of Puntod.\n\nMr. Jose Bella (1917\u20131919), who succeeded Mr. Agustin Dedicatoria, gave priority on the improvement of education and school buildings.  He was also instrumental in the planting of mango trees around the Cabuyao Town Plaza and construction of school building at [[Barangay Mamatid, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Mamatid]] and [[Barangay Pulo, Cabuyao, Laguna|Pulo]].\n\nIn 1920, Mr. Exequiel Alipit was elected as mayor of Cabuyao but he was questioned because of his age.  He was not of legal age when he was elected as required by law during that time.  However, he served as mayor because he insisted that the people elected him to the position and not on the technicality of law.  The case reached the Supreme Court which eventually decided on his disqualification from office.  Mr. Manuel Basa, his vice mayor, replaced him.  The case is included in the book of jurisprudence and is used as a reference in deciding cases of the same nature.\nDuring the term of Mayor Exequiel Alipit, he was able to improve the drainage canal and road at [[Barangay Bigaa, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Bigaa]] using the 200 prisoners he requested from the Bureau of Prison.\n\nThe program of Mr. Januario Virtucio, who succeeded Mr. Alipit as mayor, centered on the construction of additional classrooms, improvement and construction of roads, and vaccination of all residents of Cabuyao.\n\nMr. Simeon Batallones was elected after Mr. Virtucio.  He was commonly known as \"Bargat\" because he was brave enough to fight and control the cattle rustlers of the town.  Like Mayor Alipit, he was not in good terms with the members of the municipal council and as such, he was not able to complete his term of office.  Mr. Martin Alcasabas, his vice mayor, succeeded him.\n\nMr. Emilio Tanchico, who served from 1921 to 1931, was the first mayor elected from a poor family.  He used his good public relations and intellect as assets to be elected as mayor.  During his administration, he exerted efforts so that electricity can reach Cabuyao.  He also prepared the site where the public market that had been located near the church was transferred, Kamino Real, now called J.P. Rizal Avenue.\n\nThe next mayor, Dr. Alberto Carpena, was well loved by his townmates and became the only re-elected mayor of Cabuyao.  His main thrust of government was community hygiene; free medical services were conducted.  He was responsible for the construction of the Domestic Science Building located at the Central School of Cabuyao.  He was also responsible for widening the road going to the public cemetery and other improvements at the public market such as construction of its concrete fence.\n\nThere were so many national events that happened during the term of Dr. Alberto Carpena who served from 1932 to 1936.  It was during his term that the election for delegates to the Constitutional Assembly was held for the drafting of our constitution (June 10, 1934).  On December 14, 1935 women were given the right to vote ([[Women's suffrage]]).  The event most remembered was the bloodiest encountered between the government ([[Constabulary]]) and the Sakdalista of the town.  It happened on May 2\u20133, 1935 at the town plaza and compound of the church.\n\nThe next elected Mayor of Cabuyao was Mayor Nicolas Limcaoco who served from 1937 to 1940.  The original 3-year term was amended by the Constitution and made the new term of elected mayor to four (4) years.  His accomplishments included the construction of road from Poblacion to [[Barangay Marinig, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Marinig]] which shortened the travel time going to the different barangays along the coastal area of the town, and the installation of water line from Matang Tubig at [[Barangay Casile, Cabuyao, Laguna|Casile]] to Poblacion.  The project was completed in 1938 through the supervision of Jose L. Acu\u00f1a who was elected as mayor in 1941.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===Japanese Occupation===\nOn January 1, 1942, the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] arrived and conquered Cabuyao after they bombed [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]] on December 8, 1941.  The first group of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] came from the battleground of [[Mauban, Quezon]].  This was followed by a great number of Japanese soldiers who proceeded to [[Manila]] and [[Bataan]] where a fierce battle was fought.\n\nBecause of the cruelty of the Japanese Imperial Army, the people of Cabuyao joined secret organizations known as \"guerilla\".  The leaders of these groups were former [[USAFFE]]s who fought in [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor Island|Corregidor]].  There was the Markings Guerilla, [[Manuel L. Quezon|Pres. Manuel L. Quezon]]\u2019s Own Guerilla (PQOC), Hunters ROTC, Straught Fil-American Troops, III Army Corps, FAIT, Ansay Suicide Regiment and La Fabella Regiment.\n\nIn Cabuyao, there was no direct military confrontation between the Japanese soldiers and Filipinos.  Instead, it was between the [[Makapili]], a pro-Japanese group and the guerrillas. The known guerrilla leaders of Cabuyao were Col. Nicolas Soriano, Maj. Amado Garcia, Maj. Romulo Alcasabas, Maj. Raymundo Tanchico, Maj. Placido Aragon and Capt. Pablo Garcia to mention a few.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===Liberation period===\nOn the morning of September 21, 1944, the people of Cabuyao were surprised to hear the sound of American airplanes going to [[Manila]] for bombing operations.  It was on January 1, 1941 that American forces, part of the 7th Army Corps under Gen. Krueger, arrived at Cabuyao.  The first group of American soldiers was led by Capt. Brown, who made their camp at the church compound (Patio).\n\nBefore the arrival of joint American and [[Philippine Commonwealth]] army soldiers to Cabuyao, the town was under the control of guerrilla under the leadership of Col. Nicolas Soriano.  Thus, no military encounter occurred.  The Americans readily established provisionary government called the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU) where Mr. Enrique Hemedes was appointed as head.  The office was responsible for the distribution of food and clothing to the needy people of Cabuyao but with priority to the evacuees coming from nearby towns.\n\nWhen the arrival by the local Filipino troops of the 4th, 42nd and 47th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] in Cabuyao was taken from the town municipalities and aiding by the local guerrillas and the U.S. troops against the Japanese.\n\nMr. Emilio Tanchico replaced Mr. Enrique Hemedes.  Mr. Tanchico was responsible for restoring the operations of the municipal government of Cabuyao such as the Office of the Treasurer, Office of Police, Postal Office and Communication and other offices.  Mr. Nicolas Limcaoco then replaced him in the middle of 1946 and served until 1947.\n\nThe first thing Mr. Nicolas Limcaoco did was to establish peace and order in the locality.  There were so many loose firearms because of the recent war, which led to robberies, theft, killing and other criminal offenses.  He hired 10 \"terong\" (toughies) coming from the mountainous areas of Cabuyao and appointed them as policemen. Criminality was lessened and peace and order was maintained during that time in Cabuyao.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===Post World War II===\nWhen the [[Philippines]] gained its [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Independence]] on July 4, 1946, a presidential election preceded it where President [[Manuel Roxas]] was elected as the first president of the Third Republic.  The president appointed Mr. Jose L. Acu\u00f1a as mayor of Cabuyao.\n\nMayor Acu\u00f1a restored the organizational set up of the Municipal Government of Cabuyao.  He assisted the war veterans of Cabuyao in receiving their back pay, those whose properties were destroyed during the war in receiving war damage, and freed from jail people mistaken as [[Makapili]] or collaborators.\n\nIn 1947 local election, Mr. Lope B. Diamante was elected as mayor.  Mayor Mauro H. Alimagno served for three terms: 1952\u201355, 1956\u201359 and 1960\u201363.  Mr. Antonio Bailon served as mayor during the term 1964\u201367.\n\nMayor Alimagno again served during the period 1968\u201371, 1972\u201379 and 1980.  However, he failed to complete his last term as mayor in 1980 as he was gunned down in [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]]. Vice Mayor Nicanor Alcasabas succeeded as mayor and served the remaining term. After the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]], Mr. Isidro T. Hildawa was appointed mayor of Cabuyao.  However, he was later appointed as member of the Provincial Board of Laguna, so it was Mr. Constancio G. Alimagno, Jr. who was appointed as mayor on April 1, 1986.\n\nMayor Proceso Aguillo was elected mayor of Cabuyao in the 1988 local election.  Mayor Constancio G. Alimagno, Jr. served as mayor in 1992\u201395. Mayor Proceso Aguillo serves as mayor starting 1995 up to 2004. Mayor Nila G. Aguillo, wife of Proceso Aguillo, assumed office until 2007. Mayor Isidro Hemedes, Jr. a relative of then Mayor Enrique Hemedez, ascended into office from 2007 to 2016\n\nWhat is common to these elected mayors is their concern for the general welfare of their constituents and the continuous implementation of programs, projects and activities towards the attainment of their objective of a peaceful and progressive place. The legacy left by these chief executives of the old town paved the road towards its transformation into the status of a component city, a status it currently enjoys.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===Cityhood===\nDecember 6, 2012, when [[Legislative districts of Laguna#2nd District|Laguna 2nd District]] Representative [[Timmy Chipeco|Justin Marc S.B.

Just like the settlement of Ba-i, Tabuco had large plain area and rich forestry, and the climate was suited to farm crops.

There were many trees of [[Kaffir lime|kabuyaw]] growing around the area. The fruit of kabuyaw was used as shampoo. So, when the priest asked for the name of the place, the native females readily answered \"'''kabuyaw'''\", thinking that the priest was asking for the name of the trees growing around the wharf.

Juan de Salcedo went back to the Lake of Ba-i and continued to conquer the settlements in the northern portion of Lake Ba-i, now called the town of [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]]. In their journey, they anchored at the shore of Tabuko.  Just like the settlement of Ba-i, Tabuko had large plain area and rich forestry and the climate was suited to farm crops.  On January 16, 1571, it was announced by Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi that Tabuko be considered as \"[[encomienda]]\" or a town under Gaspar Ramirez.  And that the settlement or barangay Malabanan, [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] and [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]] be under the administration of Tabuko government.  This was the time that Tabuko had a definite boundary. The boundary at the north was Tunasan, south was Ba-i, west was Sungay and at the east was Lake Ba-i.\n\nThe town of Tabuko was located near the corner of a river and the lake of Ba-i which used bancas or raft as the common means of transportation going to Tabuko.  When Franciscan priests came to Tabuko under Father Velin, there were many native females doing their laundry chore near the wharf where the boat of the Franciscan priests docked.  There were many trees of \"[[Kaffir lime|Kabuyaw]]\", the fruit of which was used as shampoo, growing around the area.  When the priest asked for the name of the place, the native females readily answered \"Kabuyaw\" thinking that the priest was asking for the name of the trees growing around the wharf.  From then on, the priests and other Spanish officials called the town of Tabuko as Kabuyaw.\n\nThe Spaniards made Cabuyao as its center of government, which included the barangay of Malabanan, now the Cities of [[Bi\u00f1an]], [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]] and [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]].  Because the barangays became haciendas of the friars, the barangay was separated from Cabuyao one by one.\nThe first to be separated was barangay Calamba that was hacienda de San Juan Bautista then.  In 1689, barangay Malabanan was separated and became the town of [[Bi\u00f1an]] (now a city).  This was followed by barangay Santa Rosa de Lima.\n\nOn the summer of 1896, news spread over Cabuyao that the province of [[Cavite]] revolted against the Spanish government.  Anticipating the disorder it will bring to the community, Lt. Isabelo Virtucio readily organized a volunteer group who will fight against the Spanish government.  He coordinated with the different leaders of the revolutionary groups and his group joined the forces of [[Paciano Rizal|Gen. Paciano Rizal]], the brother of our national hero, [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal|Dr. Jose Rizal]].  The group adopted [[guerrilla]] warfare in fighting the Spaniards such as ambush, surprise attack and putting up traps on the roads used by the enemy.  It was almost two (2) years before the Spanish armed forces surrendered in 1898.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===American Era===\n[[File:Matang Tubig Cave.jpg|270px|thumb|A Matang Tubig Cave, American soldiers hiding at the cave during Japanese-American, World War II since 1932]]\nIt was not long before the residents of Cabuyao celebrated the independence of the [[Philippines]] from the Spanish government when the Americans arrived in 1899.  They thought that the Americans were allies and friends but learned later that the Americans were the next conqueror of the Philippines.\n\nImmediately, Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista organized a company of soldiers and fought the Americans who tried to conquer the town of Cabuyao.  On their first encounter, many died on the side of Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista because of inferior equipment used.  They retreated on the mountain called Kay Sili (which is [[Barangay Casile, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Casile]] today) at the western portion of the town of Cabuyao to prepare for another encounter.  However, the Americans continued conquering other towns and established their headquarters at the convent of the church.  The first American soldiers who arrived at Cabuyao were hostile to the residents of Cabuyao.  They feared most one Lt. Robert who was fearsome, giving penalty to those who were suspected as rebels.\n\nIn the early years of American occupation of Cabuyao, peace and order became a problem because of the frequent robbery made by the former Filipino soldiers who refused to surrender to the American forces.  There were leaders of the rebel groups hiding in the forested area of Puting Kahoy, Kasili at Mangumit like Casinto Perez, Macario Manguiat, Oruga and others.  Those who were suspected with association to these rebel leaders were arrested and tortured.\n\nDuring the height of the campaign for peace and order of the American forces of Cabuyao, its parish priest, Fr. Eulalio Mea, was arrested and imprisoned because he was suspected that he had knowledge of the disorder happening in Cabuyao.  Fortunately, Mr. Jose Batallones who knew how to speak [[English language|English]] negotiated for the freedom of those who were not really involved.\n\nThe first town mayor of Cabuyao was Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista after she peacefully surrendered to the Americans through the intervention of her nephew, Mr. Jose Ignacio BautiSanta But she was temporarily removed from office when she was suspected as part of the party that abducted Mr. Dominador Delfino and Mr. Jose Hemedes, prominent residents of Cabuyao in July 1904.  Commander Oruga, believed to be the leader of the group, was a former companion of Captain Krizia Ignacio BautiSanta Mr. Luis Bella, the vice mayor then of Capt. Bautista, was installed as the town mayor.\n\nOn August 29, 1904, Mr. Dominador Delfino and Jose Hemedes were released from their captivity without any harm incurred on them.  On September 7, 1904, Capt. Sotero Batallones, the friend of Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista reassumed her position as mayor of Cabuyao.\n\nDuring his term as mayor of Cabuyao, he accomplished many development projects.  He was instrumental in the construction of the school building at Bagong Kalsada, which is now Bonifacio Street.  This building is now the Cabuyao Central School.  On the same year, an artesian well was constructed at the town plaza and another at the new school site.\n\nMr. Agustin Dedicatoria replaced Sotero Battalones, which reassumed the position of Capt. Krizia Ignacio Bautista as mayor of Cabuyao and served from 1913 to 1916.  He was instrumental in the construction of the monument of [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal|Dr. Jose Rizal]] at the Cabuyao City Plaza and the establishment of the new municipal cemetery at the southwestern portions of the town somewhere the area of Puntod.\n\nMr. Jose Bella (1917\u20131919), who succeeded Mr. Agustin Dedicatoria, gave priority on the improvement of education and school buildings.  He was also instrumental in the planting of mango trees around the Cabuyao Town Plaza and construction of school building at [[Barangay Mamatid, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Mamatid]] and [[Barangay Pulo, Cabuyao, Laguna|Pulo]].\n\nIn 1920, Mr. Exequiel Alipit was elected as mayor of Cabuyao but he was questioned because of his age.  He was not of legal age when he was elected as required by law during that time.  However, he served as mayor because he insisted that the people elected him to the position and not on the technicality of law.  The case reached the Supreme Court which eventually decided on his disqualification from office.  Mr. Manuel Basa, his vice mayor, replaced him.  The case is included in the book of jurisprudence and is used as a reference in deciding cases of the same nature.\nDuring the term of Mayor Exequiel Alipit, he was able to improve the drainage canal and road at [[Barangay Bigaa, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Bigaa]] using the 200 prisoners he requested from the Bureau of Prison.\n\nThe program of Mr. Januario Virtucio, who succeeded Mr. Alipit as mayor, centered on the construction of additional classrooms, improvement and construction of roads, and vaccination of all residents of Cabuyao.\n\nMr. Simeon Batallones was elected after Mr. Virtucio.  He was commonly known as \"Bargat\" because he was brave enough to fight and control the cattle rustlers of the town.  Like Mayor Alipit, he was not in good terms with the members of the municipal council and as such, he was not able to complete his term of office.  Mr. Martin Alcasabas, his vice mayor, succeeded him.\n\nMr. Emilio Tanchico, who served from 1921 to 1931, was the first mayor elected from a poor family.  He used his good public relations and intellect as assets to be elected as mayor.  During his administration, he exerted efforts so that electricity can reach Cabuyao.  He also prepared the site where the public market that had been located near the church was transferred, Kamino Real, now called J.P. Rizal Avenue.\n\nThe next mayor, Dr. Alberto Carpena, was well loved by his townmates and became the only re-elected mayor of Cabuyao.  His main thrust of government was community hygiene; free medical services were conducted.  He was responsible for the construction of the Domestic Science Building located at the Central School of Cabuyao.  He was also responsible for widening the road going to the public cemetery and other improvements at the public market such as construction of its concrete fence.\n\nThere were so many national events that happened during the term of Dr. Alberto Carpena who served from 1932 to 1936.  It was during his term that the election for delegates to the Constitutional Assembly was held for the drafting of our constitution (June 10, 1934).  On December 14, 1935 women were given the right to vote ([[Women's suffrage]]).  The event most remembered was the bloodiest encountered between the government ([[Constabulary]]) and the Sakdalista of the town.  It happened on May 2\u20133, 1935 at the town plaza and compound of the church.\n\nThe next elected Mayor of Cabuyao was Mayor Nicolas Limcaoco who served from 1937 to 1940.  The original 3-year term was amended by the Constitution and made the new term of elected mayor to four (4) years.  His accomplishments included the construction of road from Poblacion to [[Barangay Marinig, Cabuyao, Laguna|Barangay Marinig]] which shortened the travel time going to the different barangays along the coastal area of the town, and the installation of water line from Matang Tubig at [[Barangay Casile, Cabuyao, Laguna|Casile]] to Poblacion.  The project was completed in 1938 through the supervision of Jose L. Acu\u00f1a who was elected as mayor in 1941.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===Japanese Occupation===\nOn January 1, 1942, the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] arrived and conquered Cabuyao after they bombed [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]] on December 8, 1941.  The first group of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] came from the battleground of [[Mauban, Quezon]].  This was followed by a great number of Japanese soldiers who proceeded to [[Manila]] and [[Bataan]] where a fierce battle was fought.\n\nBecause of the cruelty of the Japanese Imperial Army, the people of Cabuyao joined secret organizations known as \"guerilla\".  The leaders of these groups were former [[USAFFE]]s who fought in [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor Island|Corregidor]].  There was the Markings Guerilla, [[Manuel L. Quezon|Pres. Manuel L. Quezon]]\u2019s Own Guerilla (PQOC), Hunters ROTC, Straught Fil-American Troops, III Army Corps, FAIT, Ansay Suicide Regiment and La Fabella Regiment.\n\nIn Cabuyao, there was no direct military confrontation between the Japanese soldiers and Filipinos.  Instead, it was between the [[Makapili]], a pro-Japanese group and the guerrillas. The known guerrilla leaders of Cabuyao were Col. Nicolas Soriano, Maj. Amado Garcia, Maj. Romulo Alcasabas, Maj. Raymundo Tanchico, Maj. Placido Aragon and Capt. Pablo Garcia to mention a few.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===Liberation period===\nOn the morning of September 21, 1944, the people of Cabuyao were surprised to hear the sound of American airplanes going to [[Manila]] for bombing operations.  It was on January 1, 1941 that American forces, part of the 7th Army Corps under Gen. Krueger, arrived at Cabuyao.  The first group of American soldiers was led by Capt. Brown, who made their camp at the church compound (Patio).\n\nBefore the arrival of joint American and [[Philippine Commonwealth]] army soldiers to Cabuyao, the town was under the control of guerrilla under the leadership of Col. Nicolas Soriano.  Thus, no military encounter occurred.  The Americans readily established provisionary government called the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU) where Mr. Enrique Hemedes was appointed as head.  The office was responsible for the distribution of food and clothing to the needy people of Cabuyao but with priority to the evacuees coming from nearby towns.\n\nWhen the arrival by the local Filipino troops of the 4th, 42nd and 47th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 4th Constabulary Regiment of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] in Cabuyao was taken from the town municipalities and aiding by the local guerrillas and the U.S. troops against the Japanese.\n\nMr. Emilio Tanchico replaced Mr. Enrique Hemedes.  Mr. Tanchico was responsible for restoring the operations of the municipal government of Cabuyao such as the Office of the Treasurer, Office of Police, Postal Office and Communication and other offices.  Mr. Nicolas Limcaoco then replaced him in the middle of 1946 and served until 1947.\n\nThe first thing Mr. Nicolas Limcaoco did was to establish peace and order in the locality.  There were so many loose firearms because of the recent war, which led to robberies, theft, killing and other criminal offenses.  He hired 10 \"terong\" (toughies) coming from the mountainous areas of Cabuyao and appointed them as policemen. Criminality was lessened and peace and order was maintained during that time in Cabuyao.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===Post World War II===\nWhen the [[Philippines]] gained its [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Independence]] on July 4, 1946, a presidential election preceded it where President [[Manuel Roxas]] was elected as the first president of the Third Republic.  The president appointed Mr. Jose L. Acu\u00f1a as mayor of Cabuyao.\n\nMayor Acu\u00f1a restored the organizational set up of the Municipal Government of Cabuyao.  He assisted the war veterans of Cabuyao in receiving their back pay, those whose properties were destroyed during the war in receiving war damage, and freed from jail people mistaken as [[Makapili]] or collaborators.\n\nIn 1947 local election, Mr. Lope B. Diamante was elected as mayor.  Mayor Mauro H. Alimagno served for three terms: 1952\u201355, 1956\u201359 and 1960\u201363.  Mr. Antonio Bailon served as mayor during the term 1964\u201367.\n\nMayor Alimagno again served during the period 1968\u201371, 1972\u201379 and 1980.  However, he failed to complete his last term as mayor in 1980 as he was gunned down in [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]]. Vice Mayor Nicanor Alcasabas succeeded as mayor and served the remaining term. After the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]], Mr. Isidro T. Hildawa was appointed mayor of Cabuyao.  However, he was later appointed as member of the Provincial Board of Laguna, so it was Mr. Constancio G. Alimagno, Jr. who was appointed as mayor on April 1, 1986.\n\nMayor Proceso Aguillo was elected mayor of Cabuyao in the 1988 local election.  Mayor Constancio G. Alimagno, Jr. served as mayor in 1992\u201395. Mayor Proceso Aguillo serves as mayor starting 1995 up to 2004. Mayor Nila G. Aguillo, wife of Proceso Aguillo, assumed office until 2007. Mayor Isidro Hemedes, Jr. a relative of then Mayor Enrique Hemedez, ascended into office from 2007 to 2016\n\nWhat is common to these elected mayors is their concern for the general welfare of their constituents and the continuous implementation of programs, projects and activities towards the attainment of their objective of a peaceful and progressive place. The legacy left by these chief executives of the old town paved the road towards its transformation into the status of a component city, a status it currently enjoys.<ref name=\"CabuyaoHistory\"/>\n\n===Cityhood===\nDecember 6, 2012, when [[Legislative districts of Laguna#2nd District|Laguna 2nd District]] Representative [[Timmy Chipeco|Justin Marc S.B.

In Charles Hefling (Ed), \"Our Selves, Our Souls and Bodies\".  Cambridge, Mass: Cowley Publications.</ref> many of whom were at that time facing the challenges of the AIDS crisis.  He and his assistant priest, Neil Gray who became Crawley' successor (1991 - 2003), opened up the parish to the wider community and co-operated with other agencies like St Paul's Hospital<ref>The sharing of the name is quite coincidental.</ref> and AIDS Vancouver.<ref>Buck, Op.cit., page 73.</ref>  In reflecting upon this experience, Crawley later wrote: \"St Paul's had not so much found a mission as it had regained its soul\"<ref>Crawley, op.cit., page 207.</ref>\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Gray set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  \n\nThe result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion, meriting among other responses a rebuke from the then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey.  Ingham expressed his own position thus:\n\n<blockquote>\"In many places around the world homosexual people are still treated as criminals and even worse, and in some instances with the support of the church.  We regret this [. . . ] and express our sadness and disquiet at their suffering, and hope that our actions in this part of the world may bring comfort and relief to those millions of people who look to the church for safety and support instead of judgement and condemnation.\"<ref>Minutes of the 101st Diocesan Synod, 2003.  Synod Journal, 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2004, the then assistant priest, Dale Yardy, officiated at the first Blessing of a Covenanted Union of a same-sex couple in St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 84.</ref> \n\nIn 1995, St Paul's Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 12.</ref>\n\nSt Paul's played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth-walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a 13-metre, full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.  Very soon, the number of individual visits to the labyrinth exceeded four thousand a year, mostly by persons who were not members of St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 14.</ref>[[File:St Paul's Labyrinth, Vancouver.jpg|thumb|The way into the Labyrinth]]  \n\n=== Liturgical developments ===\n\nAs parish ministries were evolving, so also were liturgical practices.  At the principal Sunday morning service, the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer which was used for the last time in 1995.\n\nA contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used for the first time in 1981 and the Book of Common Prayer rite was used for the last time in 2014.\n\nGray's successor, Markus D\u00fcnzkofer (2004\u20132012), made regular use of a nave altar for celebrating Eucharist.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 58.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the then Bishop of New Westminster, David Somerville, ordained women as priests for the first time in the diocese.  In 1982, Barbara Blakely became the first woman priest to celebrate Eucharist at St Paul's.  Helen Patterson was the first woman to be appointed to staff, and she was succeeded as assistant priest by several other women.

He and his assistant priest, Neil Gray who became Crawley' successor (1991 - 2003), opened up the parish to the wider community and co-operated with other agencies like St Paul's Hospital<ref>The sharing of the name is quite coincidental.</ref> and AIDS Vancouver.<ref>Buck, Op.cit., page 73.</ref>  In reflecting upon this experience, Crawley later wrote: \"St Paul's had not so much found a mission as it had regained its soul\"<ref>Crawley, op.cit., page 207.</ref>\n  \nAs the AIDS crisis receded, Gray set about consolidating the positive response received from the LGBT community by advocating at the 1998 synod of the Diocese of New Westminster for permission to bless covenanted same-sex relationships.  The initiative achieved the immediate success of a favourable vote, but it was not sufficiently favourable to win the consent of Bishop Michael Ingham.  Permission was sought again in 2001, with an even more favourable outcome, leading in 2002 to episcopal consent.  \n\nThe result had repercussions throughout the international Anglican Communion, meriting among other responses a rebuke from the then Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey.  Ingham expressed his own position thus:\n\n<blockquote>\"In many places around the world homosexual people are still treated as criminals and even worse, and in some instances with the support of the church.  We regret this [. . . ] and express our sadness and disquiet at their suffering, and hope that our actions in this part of the world may bring comfort and relief to those millions of people who look to the church for safety and support instead of judgement and condemnation.\"<ref>Minutes of the 101st Diocesan Synod, 2003.  Synod Journal, 2004.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2004, the then assistant priest, Dale Yardy, officiated at the first Blessing of a Covenanted Union of a same-sex couple in St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 84.</ref> \n\nSt Paul's played a major role in the re-introduction of labyrinth-walking as a meditative technique.  In 1997, under the direction of the then assistant priest, April Stanley, a 13-metre, full-scale replica of the medieval labyrinth found at Chartres Cathedral in France was painted on the floor of the parish hall to become the first permanent indoor labyrinth in Canada.  Very soon, the number of individual visits to the labyrinth exceeded four thousand a year, mostly by persons who were not members of St Paul's.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 14.</ref>[[File:St Paul's Labyrinth, Vancouver.jpg|thumb|The way into the Labyrinth]]  \n\nIn 1995, St Paul's Advocacy Office was established to provide support and information for people facing problems associated with government benefits, tenancy disputes, immigration, and the like.<ref>Buck, op.cit., chapter 12.</ref>\n\n=== Liturgical developments ===\n\nAs parish ministries were evolving, so also were liturgical practices.  At the principal Sunday morning service, the Eucharist gradually displaced Morning Prayer which was used for the last time in 1995.\n\nA contemporary-language Eucharistic rite was used for the first time in 1981 and the Book of Common Prayer rite was used for the last time in 2014.\n\nGray's successor, Markus D\u00fcnzkofer (2004\u20132012), made regular use of a nave altar for celebrating Eucharist.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 58.</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the then Bishop of New Westminster, David Somerville, ordained women as priests for the first time in the diocese.  In 1982, Barbara Blakely became the first woman priest to celebrate Eucharist at St Paul's.  Helen Patterson was the first woman to be appointed to staff, and she was succeeded as assistant priest by several other women.  In 2013, Jessica Schaap (2013 \u2013 2017) became the first woman to be appointed rector.<ref>Buck, op.cit., page 45.\n</ref>[[File:Anglican woman priest with women acolytes.jpg|thumb|Jessica Schapp, assisted by two laywomen, celebrates Eucharist at an altar located at the head of the nave]] \n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://stpaulsanglican.bc.ca/ St. Paul's Anglican Church]\n\n{{coord|49.28321|N|123.13385|W|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Paul's Anglican Church (Vancouver)}}\n[[Category:Anglican church buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Heritage buildings in Vancouver]]\n[[Category:Churches completed in 1905]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1881]]\n", "name_user": "Elljaybee1929", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul%27s_Anglican_Church,_Vancouver"}
