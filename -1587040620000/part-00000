Jackson was drafted in the 12th round (323 overall) of the 1968 NFL Draft by the [[Los Angeles Rams]]. In 2014, Jackson was hired to serve as head coach at his alma mater [[Jackson State Tigers football|Jackson State]]. He was fired five games into the 2015 season.\n\n==Professional career==\nAfter appearing in only two games during his rookie season, he was traded to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and quickly emerged as one of the top receivers in the NFL, finishing the 1969 season with 65 receptions for a league-best 1,116 yards and 9 touchdowns. During his years with the Eagles, Jackson led the NFL in receptions in 1972 and in receiving yardage in both 1969 and 1972.\n\nPrior to the 1973 NFL season, the Eagles traded Jackson back to the Rams for quarterback [[Roman Gabriel]] (who was expendable as the Rams had acquired [[John Hadl]]). Jackson led the NFL in receiving touchdowns in 1973 with 13 and helped the Rams rebound from a 6\u20137\u20131 record the previous season to a 12\u20132 finish that won them the first of 7 straight [[NFC West]] Division Championships. Statistically, his greatest NFL game came against Dallas on October 14, 1973 when he caught 7 passes for 238 yards and 4 touchdowns (this came in the midst of a string of four games in which he caught a total of 13 passes for 422 yards for a 32.5-yard average with 8 touchdowns).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aramfan.tripod.com/index-3.html|title=HAROLD JACKSON|website=aramfan.tripod.com|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> During his career, Jackson was selected to play in the [[Pro Bowl]] five times. In 1972, he was named 2nd-team All-Pro by the Associated Press (AP), the [[Pro Football Writers Association]] (PFWA) and the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA) and was voted 1st-team All-NFC by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), ''[[The Sporting News]]'' and [[UPI]]. He was a consensus first-team [[All-Pro]] and All-NFC choice in [[1973 National Football League season|1973]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.hickoksports.com/history/allnfl02.shtml#1971 |title=hickoksports.com |access-date=2008-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192805/http://www.hickoksports.com/history/allnfl02.shtml#1971 |archive-date=2013-10-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was voted 2nd team All-NFC by UPI in 1976, 1st team All-NFC by The Sporting News and UPI in 1977 and 2nd team All-Pro by the NEA in 1977.\n\nIn 1978, Jackson was traded to the [[New England Patriots]]. Alongside [[Stanley Morgan]], Jackson helped form one of the NFL's best starting wide receiver duos of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Jackson became the NFL's active leader in receiving yards when [[Fred Biletnikoff]] retired after 1978, and remained the league leader for his remaining five seasons. At the time he was ranked 15th all-time, but would eventually reach second place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_career_1978.htm|title=NFL Career Receiving Yards Leaders Through 1978|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> In 1979, Jackson finished with 1,013 yards receiving, 7 touchdown receptions and was second in the NFL in yards-per-catch with an average of 22.5.  His teammate Morgan, who was nine years younger than Jackson, was the only one to finish with a higher average that season. Jackson finished his career by playing one season each for the [[Minnesota Vikings]] (1982) and the [[Seattle Seahawks]] (1983).\n\nDuring his career, Jackson had 29 career 100-yard games and three 1,000-yard seasons. At the time of his retirement, only [[Don Maynard]] had more career receiving yards than Jackson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.profootballweekly.com/|title=NFL football news, rumors, analysis|website=www.profootballweekly.com|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> He currently ranks 26th in league history in career receiving yardage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_career.htm|title=NFL Receiving Yards Career Leaders|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref><ref name=\"baylorbears.cstv.com\">[http://baylorbears.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/jackson_harold00.html baylorbears.cstv.com baylorbears.cstv.com]</ref>  For the decade of the 1970s, Jackson ranked first in receptions (432),<ref>[http://www.nfluk.com/usersession_new.php?board=1;action=display;threadid=23670 nfluk.com]</ref> yards (7,724) and receiving touchdowns (61).\nDespite this, Jackson was not one of the wide receivers selected to the [[National Football League 1970s All-Decade Team|NFL's All-Decade Team]] for the 1970s and he has yet to be elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].\n\nIn 2011, the [[Professional  Football Researchers Association]] named Jackson to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2011 <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.com/hall-of-very-good-2011.htm |title=Hall of Very Good Class of 2011 |accessdate=November 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180902011938/http://www.profootballresearchers.com/hall-of-very-good-2011.htm |archive-date=September 2, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Pro football statistics===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|-\n!colspan=3 | !! colspan=5 | Receiving !! colspan=3 | Rushing\n|-\n!Year !!

Statistically, his greatest NFL game came against Dallas on October 14, 1973 when he caught 7 passes for 238 yards and 4 touchdowns (this came in the midst of a string of four games in which he caught a total of 13 passes for 422 yards for a 32.5-yard average with 8 touchdowns).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aramfan.tripod.com/index-3.html|title=HAROLD JACKSON|website=aramfan.tripod.com|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> During his career, Jackson was selected to play in the [[Pro Bowl]] five times. In 1972, he was named 2nd-team All-Pro by the Associated Press (AP), the [[Pro Football Writers Association]] (PFWA) and the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA) and was voted 1st-team All-NFC by the [[Associated Press]] (AP), ''[[The Sporting News]]'' and [[UPI]].

Alongside [[Stanley Morgan]], Jackson helped form one of the NFL's best starting wide receiver duos of the late 1970s and early 1980s. Jackson became the NFL's active leader in receiving yards when [[Fred Biletnikoff]] retired after 1978, and remained the league leader for his remaining five seasons. At the time he was ranked 15th all-time, but would eventually reach second place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_career_1978.htm|title=NFL Career Receiving Yards Leaders Through 1978|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> In 1979, Jackson finished with 1,013 yards receiving, 7 touchdown receptions and was second in the NFL in yards-per-catch with an average of 22.5.  His teammate Morgan, who was nine years younger than Jackson, was the only one to finish with a higher average that season. Jackson finished his career by playing one season each for the [[Minnesota Vikings]] (1982) and the [[Seattle Seahawks]] (1983).\n\nDuring his career, Jackson had 29 career 100-yard games and three 1,000-yard seasons.
