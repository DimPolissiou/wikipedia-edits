A capital is typically a [[city]] that physically encompasses the government's offices and meeting places; the status as capital is often designated by its law or [[constitution]]. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official ([[constitution]]al) capital and the seat of government, which is [[List of countries with multiple capitals|in another place]].\n\nCapital cities that also serve as the prime economic, population, cultural, or intellectual centres of a nation or an empire are sometimes referred to as [[Primate city|primate cities]]. Examples are [[Athens]], [[Bangkok]], [[Brussels]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Cairo]], [[London]], [[Mexico City]], [[Paris]], [[Lima]], [[Seoul]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\nNews media often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there, as a form of [[metonymy]]. For example, \"relations between Washington and London\" refer to \"[[United Kingdom\u2013United States relations|relations]] between the United States and the United Kingdom\".\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe word ''capital'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''caput'' (genitive ''capitis''), meaning '[[head]]'.\n\nIn several English-speaking states, the terms [[county town]] and [[county seat]] are also used in [[Subnational administrative division|lower]] subdivisions. In some [[Unitary state|unitary states]], subnational capitals may be known as 'administrative centres'. The capital is often the [[List of capitals and largest cities by country|largest city]] of its constituent, though not always.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Tavares.Forum.Romanum.redux.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Roman Forum]] was surrounded by many government buildings as the capital of [[Ancient Rome]]]]\nHistorically, the major economic centre of a state or region often becomes the focal point of political power, and becomes a capital through [[Conquest (military)|conquest]] or [[federation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kinooze.com/what-does-a-capital-city-mean/|title=What does a Capital City Mean?|date=5 December 2012|accessdate=9 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531161615/http://kinooze.com/what-does-a-capital-city-mean/|archivedate=31 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (The modern capital city has, however, not always existed: in medieval Western Europe, an [[itinerant court|itinerant (wandering) government]] was common.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/capital-city-relocation-1435389|title=Where Next: The Reasons Why (Some) Countries Move Their Capitals|accessdate=9 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010151019/https://www.thoughtco.com/capital-city-relocation-1435389|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Examples are [[Babylon|Ancient Babylon]], [[Baghdad#History|Abbasid Baghdad]], [[Ancient Athens]], [[Rome]], [[Constantinople]], [[Chang'an]], [[Cusco|Ancient Cusco]], [[Madrid]], [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Moscow]], [[Beijing]], [[Tokyo]], [[Vienna]], [[Lisbon]] and [[Berlin]].

Traditional capitals may be economically eclipsed by provincial rivals, e.g. [[Nanking]] by [[Shanghai]], [[Quebec City]] by [[Montreal]], and numerous [[US state capitals]].

They are recognised as capitals as a matter of convention, and because all or almost all the country's central political institutions, such as government departments, supreme court, legislature, embassies, etc., are located in or near them.\n\n== Modern capitals ==\n[[File:Capital not largest city.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[List of countries whose capital is not their largest city|Countries whose capital is not their largest city]]]]\n[[File:Capitales con y sin mar.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|{{legend|#1E90FF|Countries whose capital is on the coast}}\n{{legend|#B22222|Countries whose capital is not on the coast}}\n{{legend|#8B0000|[[landlocked country|Countries without a coast]]}}]]\n[[File:Countries with multiple capitals map.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|\n{{legend|#FF0000|[[List of countries with multiple capitals|Countries that currently have multiple capital cities]]}}\n{{legend|#D78991|[[List of countries with multiple capitals#More than one capital in the past|Countries that had had multiple capital cities in the past]]}}]]\n[[File:Aerial View of Tehran 26.11.2008 04-35-03.JPG|thumb|[[Tehran]], capital and largest city of [[Iran]], and the capital of the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] empires in the last two centuries]]\n\n[[Counties of the United Kingdom|Counties]] in the [[United Kingdom]] have historic county towns, which are often not the largest settlement within the county and often are no longer administrative centres, as many historical counties are now only ceremonial, and administrative boundaries are different.\n\nIn [[Canada]], there is a [[Ottawa|federal capital]], while the ten [[provinces of Canada|provinces]] and three [[Territories of Canada#Territories|territories]] all have capital cities. The states of such countries as [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]] (including the famous cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], capitals of their respective states), and [[Australia]] all have capital cities. For example, the six state capitals of Australia are [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Hobart]], [[Melbourne]], [[Perth]], and [[Sydney]]. In Australia, the term \"capital cities\" is regularly used to refer to the aforementioned state capitals plus the federal capital [[Canberra]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], the capital of the [[Northern Territory]]. [[Abu Dhabi]] is the capital city of the [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] overall.\n\nIn unitary states which consist of multiple constituent nations, such as the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], each will usually have its own capital city. Unlike in [[federation]]s, there is usually not a separate national capital, but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall, such as [[London]], which is the capital of [[England]] and the United Kingdom. Similarly, each of the [[autonomous communities of Spain]] and [[regions of Italy]] has a capital city, such as [[Seville]] or [[Naples]], while [[Madrid]] is the capital of the [[Community of Madrid]] and the [[Kingdom of Spain]] as a whole and [[Rome]] is the capital of [[Italy]] and the region of [[Lazio]].\n\nIn the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], each of its constituent [[Federated state|state]]s (or [[States of Germany|''L\u00e4nder'']] - plural of ''Land'') has its own capital city, such as [[Dresden]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Mainz]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Stuttgart]], and [[Munich]], as do all of the republics of the [[Russian Federation]]. The national capitals of Germany and Russia: the [[City-state#Non-sovereign city-states|Stadtstaat]] of [[Berlin]] and the [[Federal cities of Russia|Federal City]] of [[Moscow]], are also constituent states of both countries in their own right. Each of the [[States of Austria]] and [[Cantons of Switzerland]] also have their own capital cities. [[Vienna]], the national capital of [[Austria]], is also one of the states, while [[Bern]] is the (''de facto'') capital of both [[Switzerland]] and the [[Canton of Bern]].\n\nMany national capitals are also the largest city in their respective countries, but in many countries this is not the case.\n\n== Planned capitals ==\n[[File:L'Enfant plan.jpg|thumb|The [[L'Enfant Plan]] for [[Washington, D.C.]], the capital of the [[United States]]]]\nGoverning entities sometimes plan, design and build new capital cities to house the seat of government of a [[polity]] or of a subdivision.

There have been various reasons for this, including overcrowding in that major metropolitan area, and the desire to place the capital city in a location with a better climate (usually a less tropical one).\n# A town that was chosen as a compromise among two or more cities (or other political divisions), none of which was willing to concede to the other(s) the privilege of being the capital city. Usually, the new capital is geographically located roughly equidistant between the competing population centres.\n\n[[File:Parliamenthouse2.jpg|thumb|The [[Australian Parliament]] opened in the small town of [[Canberra]] in 1927 as a compromise between the largest cities, [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].]]\nSome examples of the second situation (compromise locations) include:\n* [[Canberra]], Australia, chosen as a compromise located between Melbourne and Sydney.\n*[[Washington, D.C.]], United States, founded as a compromise between more urbanized [[Northern United States|Northern states]] and agrarian [[Southern United States|Southern]] \"[[Slave states and free states|slave states]]\" to share national power.

The ''[[Palacio Quemado]]'', the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly|national congress]] and [[Plurinational Electoral Organ|national electoral court]] are located in [[La Paz, Bolivia|La Paz]], making it the seat of government.\n* [[Ivory Coast]]: [[Yamoussoukro]] was designated the national capital in 1983, but most government offices and embassies are still located in [[Abidjan]].\n* [[Netherlands]]: [[Amsterdam]] is the constitutional national capital even though the [[Cabinet of the Netherlands|Dutch government]], the [[States General of the Netherlands|parliament]], the [[Hoge Raad der Nederlanden|supreme court]], the [[Council of State of the Netherlands|Council of State]], and the [[Noordeinde Palace|work palace]] of the [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|King]] are all located in [[The Hague]], as are all the embassies. (''For more details see: [[Capital of the Netherlands]]''.)\n\nSome historical examples of similar arrangements, where the recognized capital was not the official seat of government:\n* [[Kingdom of England]]: The traditional capital was the [[City of London]], while [[Westminster]], outside of the boundaries of the City of London, was the seat of government. They are both today part of the urban core of [[Greater London]].\n* [[Kingdom of France]]: The traditional capital was [[Paris]], though from 1682-1789 the seat of government was at the [[Palace of Versailles]], located in a rural area southwest of Paris.\n\n=== Disputed capitals ===\n* [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]]: Both [[Israel]]<ref>See [[Jerusalem Law]]</ref> and the [[Palestinian Authority]]<ref>[http://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/basic-law/2003-amended-basic-law 2003 Basic Law of Palestine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211183132/http://www.palestinianbasiclaw.org/basic-law/2003-amended-basic-law |date=11 February 2016 }}, Title One: Article 3</ref> claim [[Jerusalem]] as capital.

Unlike [[medieval]] capitals, which were declared wherever a [[monarch]] held his or her court, the selection, relocation, founding, or capture of a modern capital city is an emotional event. For example:\n\n* The ruined and almost uninhabited [[Athens]] was made capital of [[Independence of Greece|newly independent]] [[Greece]] in 1834, four years after the country gained its independence, with the [[Romanticism|romantic]] notion of reviving the glory of [[Ancient Greece]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greece.greekreporter.com/2018/09/18/september-18-1834-athens-becomes-the-capital-of-greece/|title=September 18, 1834: Athens Becomes the Capital of Greece {{!}} GreekReporter.com|last=Chrysopoulos|first=Philip|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref> Similarly, following the [[Cold War]] and [[German reunification]], [[Berlin]] is now once again the capital of Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.introducingberlin.com/history-of-berlin|title=History of Berlin - Past and present of Berlin|website=www.introducingberlin.com|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref> Other restored capital cities include [[Moscow]] after the [[October Revolution]].\n* A symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either [[economic geography|economic]] or [[military geography|strategic]] reasons (sometimes known as a '''forward capital''' or spearhead capital). [[Peter the Great]] moved his government from [[Moscow]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] to give the [[Russian Empire]] a [[Western world|western]] orientation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityvision2000.com/history/peterthe.htm|title=History of St. Petersburg, Russia: Peter the Great (short biography)|website=www.cityvision2000.com|access-date=2019-01-07}}</ref> The economically significant city of [[Nafplion]] became the first capital of [[Greece]], when Athens was an unimportant village.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mikellides|first=Byron|date=2001-06-01|title=The Creation of Modern Athens, Planning the Myth|journal=URBAN DESIGN International|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=119|doi=10.1057/palgrave.udi.9000029|issn=1468-4519}}</ref> The [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] emperors moved their capital to [[Peking]] from the more central [[Nanking]] to help supervise the border with the Mongols. During the 1857 rebellion, [[India|Indian rebels]] considered [[Delhi]] their capital, and [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] was proclaimed emperor, but the ruling [[British India|British]] had their capital in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. In 1877, the British formally held a '[[Delhi Durbar|Durbar]]' in Delhi, proclaiming [[Queen Victoria]] as '[[Empress of India]]'. Delhi finally became the colonial capital after the [[Delhi Durbar|Coronation Durbar]] of King-Emperor [[George V]] in 1911, continuing as independent India's capital from 1947. Other examples include [[Abuja]], [[Astana]], [[Bras\u00edlia]], [[Helsinki]], [[Islamabad]], [[Naypyidaw]] and [[Yamoussoukro]].\n* The selection or founding of a \"neutral\" capital city, one unencumbered by regional or political identities, was meant to represent the unity of a new state when [[Ankara]], [[Bern]], [[Canberra]], [[Madrid]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] became capital cities. Sometimes, the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate squabbling or possible squabbling between various entities, such as in the cases of Canberra, Ottawa, Washington, Wellington and Managua.\n* The British-built town of [[New Delhi]] represented a simultaneous break and continuity with the past, the location of Delhi being where many imperial capitals were built (Indraprastha, Dhillika, and Shahjahanabad) but the actual capital being the new British-built town designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]]. Wellington, on the southwestern tip of the [[North Island of New Zealand]], replaced the much more northerly city of [[Auckland]] to place the national capital close to the [[South Island]] and hence to placate its residents, many of whom had sympathies with separatism.\n* During the [[American Civil War]], tremendous resources were expended to defend Washington, D.C., which bordered on the [[Confederate States of America]] (with the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]]), from Confederate attack even though the relatively small federal government could easily have been moved elsewhere. Likewise, great resources were expended by the Confederacy in defending the Confederate capital from attack by the Union, in its exposed location of [[Richmond, Virginia]], barely {{convert|100|mi}} south of Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/washington-capital-of-the-union.html|title=Washington: Capital of the Union - Essential Civil War Curriculum|website=www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com|access-date=2019-01-07}}</ref>\n\n== Capitals in military strategy ==\n[[File:Fall-of-constantinople-22.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], was the final part of the empire to fall to the [[Ottoman Turks]] due to its strong defences.]]\nThe capital city is usually but not always a primary target in a war, as capturing it usually guarantees capture of much of the enemy government, victory for the attacking forces, or at the very least demoralization for the defeated forces.\n\nIn ancient [[China]], where governments were massive centralized bureaucracies with little flexibility on the provincial level, a [[Chinese Dynasties|dynasty]] could easily be toppled with the fall of its capital. In the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, both [[Shu Han|Shu]] and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] fell when their respective capitals of [[Chengdu]] and [[Jianye District|Jianye]] fell. The [[Ming dynasty]] relocated its capital from [[Nanjing]] to [[Beijing]], where they could more effectively control the generals and troops guarding the borders from [[Mongols]] and [[Manchus]]. The Ming was destroyed when [[Li Zicheng]] took their seat of power, and this pattern repeats itself in Chinese history, until the fall of the traditional [[Confucian]] monarchy in the 20th century. After the [[Qing dynasty]]'s collapse, decentralization of authority and improved transportation and communication technologies allowed both the [[Chinese Nationalists]] and [[Chinese Communists]] to rapidly relocate capitals and keep their leadership structures intact during the great crisis of [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]].\n\nNational capitals were arguably less important as military objectives in other parts of the world, including the West, because of socioeconomic trends toward localized authority, a strategic modus operandi especially popular after the development of [[feudalism]] and reaffirmed by the development of democratic and capitalistic philosophies. In 1204, after the Latin [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]] captured the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] capital, [[Constantinople]], Byzantine forces were able to regroup in several provinces; provincial noblemen managed to reconquer the capital after 60 years and preserve the empire for another 200 years after that. The [[British Empire|British]] forces sacked various [[United States|American]] capitals repeatedly during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and [[War of 1812]], but American forces could still carry on fighting from the countryside, where they enjoyed support from local governments and the traditionally independent civilian frontiersmen. Exceptions to these generalizations include highly centralized states such as [[France]], whose centralized bureaucracies could effectively coordinate far-flung resources, giving the state a powerful advantage over less coherent rivals, but risking utter ruin if the capital were taken.\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Capitals}}\n*[[Capital region]]\n*[[List of capital cities by altitude]]\n*[[List of national capitals and largest cities by country]]\n*[[List of capitals outside the territories they serve]]\n*[[List of former national capitals]]\n*[[List of national capitals in alphabetical order]]\n*[[Temporary capital]]\n*[[List of national capitals]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Terms for types of administrative territorial entities}}\n{{Cities}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Types of country subdivisions]]\n[[Category:Capitals| ]]\n<!-- start of StopAd injection -->\n\n<!-- end of StopAd injection -->\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Primary governing city of a top-level (country) or first-level subdivision (country, state, province, etc) political entity}}\n{{redirect|Capital cities|capital city of a county|County seat|other uses|Capital City (disambiguation)}}\n{{multiple image\n|width=250\n|direction=vertical\n|image1=The City of Tegucigalpa, in the central region of Honduras.jpg\n|alt1=An aerial photo of a Central America city\n|caption1=[[Tegucigalpa]], the capital of [[Honduras]]\n|image2=Palace of Westminster from the dome on Methodist Central Hall.jpg\n|alt2=A panorama of an European city\n|caption2=[[London]], the capital of [[England]] and the [[United Kingdom]]\n|image3= India Gate seen from Raisina Hill.jpg\n|caption3= [[New Delhi]], the capital of [[India]]\n|image4=Taipei_Skyline_2016.jpg\n|caption4=[[Taipei]], the capital of [[Taiwan]]\n|image5=Capital_of_Russia,_MoscowSkyline.jpg\n|caption5=[[Moscow]], the capital of [[Russia]]\n|image6=Bukchon-seoul-tower.jpg\n|caption6=[[Seoul]], the capital of [[South Korea]]\n|image7=Planalto Central.jpg\n|alt7=A panorama of a South American city\n|caption7=[[Bras\u00edlia]], the capital of [[Brazil]]\n}}\n\nA '''capital''' or '''capital city''' is the [[municipality]] exercising primary status in a [[country]], [[Constituent state|state]], [[province]], or other [[administrative region]], usually as its [[seat of government]]. A capital is typically a [[city]] that physically encompasses the government's offices and meeting places; the status as capital is often designated by its law or [[constitution]]. In some [[jurisdiction]]s, including several countries, the different branches of government are located in different settlements. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official ([[constitution]]al) capital and the seat of government, which is [[List of countries with multiple capitals|in another place]].\n\nCapital cities that also serve as the prime economic, population, cultural, or intellectual centres of a nation or an empire are sometimes referred to as [[Primate city|primate cities]]. Examples are [[Athens]], [[Bangkok]], [[Brussels]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Cairo]], [[London]], [[Mexico City]], [[Paris]], [[Lima]], [[Seoul]] and [[Tokyo]].\n\nNews media often use the name of a capital city as an alternative name for the country of which it is the capital or of the government that is seated there, as a form of [[metonymy]]. For example, \"relations between Washington and London\" refer to \"[[United Kingdom\u2013United States relations|relations]] between the United States and the United Kingdom\".\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe word ''capital'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''caput'' (genitive ''capitis''), meaning '[[head]]'.\n\nIn several English-speaking states, the terms [[county town]] and [[county seat]] are also used in [[Subnational administrative division|lower]] subdivisions. In some [[Unitary state|unitary states]], subnational capitals may be known as 'administrative centres'. The capital is often the [[List of capitals and largest cities by country|largest city]] of its constituent, though not always.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Tavares.Forum.Romanum.redux.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Roman Forum]] was surrounded by many government buildings as the capital of [[Ancient Rome]]]]\nHistorically, the major economic centre of a state or region often becomes the focal point of political power, and becomes a capital through [[Conquest (military)|conquest]] or [[federation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kinooze.com/what-does-a-capital-city-mean/|title=What does a Capital City Mean?|date=5 December 2012|accessdate=9 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531161615/http://kinooze.com/what-does-a-capital-city-mean/|archivedate=31 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> (The modern capital city has, however, not always existed: in medieval Western Europe, an [[itinerant court|itinerant (wandering) government]] was common.)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/capital-city-relocation-1435389|title=Where Next: The Reasons Why (Some) Countries Move Their Capitals|accessdate=9 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010151019/https://www.thoughtco.com/capital-city-relocation-1435389|archivedate=10 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Examples are [[Babylon|Ancient Babylon]], [[Baghdad#History|Abbasid Baghdad]], [[Ancient Athens]], [[Rome]], [[Constantinople]], [[Chang'an]], [[Cusco|Ancient Cusco]], [[Madrid]], [[Paris]], [[London]], [[Moscow]], [[Beijing]], [[Tokyo]], [[Vienna]], [[Lisbon]] and [[Berlin]].

They are recognised as capitals as a matter of convention, and because all or almost all the country's central political institutions, such as government departments, supreme court, legislature, embassies, etc., are located in or near them.\n\n== Modern capitals ==\n[[File:Capital not largest city.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[List of countries whose capital is not their largest city|Countries whose capital is not their largest city]]]]\n[[File:Capitales con y sin mar.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|{{legend|#1E90FF|Countries whose capital is on the coast}}\n{{legend|#B22222|Countries whose capital is not on the coast}}\n{{legend|#8B0000|[[landlocked country|Countries without a coast]]}}]]\n[[File:Countries with multiple capitals map.PNG|thumb|upright=1.35|\n{{legend|#FF0000|[[List of countries with multiple capitals|Countries that currently have multiple capital cities]]}}\n{{legend|#D78991|[[List of countries with multiple capitals#More than one capital in the past|Countries that had had multiple capital cities in the past]]}}]]\n[[File:Aerial View of Tehran 26.11.2008 04-35-03.JPG|thumb|[[Tehran]], capital and largest city of [[Iran]], and the capital of the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] empires in the last two centuries]]\n\n[[Counties of the United Kingdom|Counties]] in the [[United Kingdom]] have historic county towns, which are often not the largest settlement within the county and often are no longer administrative centres, as many historical counties are now only ceremonial, and administrative boundaries are different.\n\nIn [[Canada]], there is a [[Ottawa|federal capital]], while the ten [[provinces of Canada|provinces]] and three [[Territories of Canada#Territories|territories]] all have capital cities. The states of such countries as [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]] (including the famous cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], capitals of their respective states), and [[Australia]] all have capital cities. For example, the six state capitals of Australia are [[Adelaide]], [[Brisbane]], [[Hobart]], [[Melbourne]], [[Perth]], and [[Sydney]]. In Australia, the term \"capital cities\" is regularly used to refer to the aforementioned state capitals plus the federal capital [[Canberra]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], the capital of the [[Northern Territory]]. [[Abu Dhabi]] is the capital city of the [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]] overall.\n\nIn unitary states which consist of multiple constituent nations, such as the [[United Kingdom]] or the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], each will usually have its own capital city. Unlike in [[federation]]s, there is usually not a separate national capital, but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall, such as [[London]], which is the capital of [[England]] and the United Kingdom. Similarly, each of the [[autonomous communities of Spain]] and [[regions of Italy]] has a capital city, such as [[Seville]] or [[Naples]], while [[Madrid]] is the capital of the [[Community of Madrid]] and the [[Kingdom of Spain]] as a whole and [[Rome]] is the capital of [[Italy]] and the region of [[Lazio]].\n\nIn the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], each of its constituent [[Federated state|state]]s (or [[States of Germany|''L\u00e4nder'']] - plural of ''Land'') has its own capital city, such as [[Dresden]], [[Wiesbaden]], [[Mainz]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], [[Stuttgart]], and [[Munich]], as do all of the republics of the [[Russian Federation]]. The national capitals of Germany and Russia: the [[City-state#Non-sovereign city-states|Stadtstaat]] of [[Berlin]] and the [[Federal cities of Russia|Federal City]] of [[Moscow]], are also constituent states of both countries in their own right. Each of the [[States of Austria]] and [[Cantons of Switzerland]] also have their own capital cities. [[Vienna]], the national capital of [[Austria]], is also one of the states, while [[Bern]] is the (''de facto'') capital of both [[Switzerland]] and the [[Canton of Bern]].\n\nMany national capitals are also the largest city in their respective countries, but in many countries this is not the case.\n\n== Planned capitals ==\n[[File:L'Enfant plan.jpg|thumb|The [[L'Enfant Plan]] for [[Washington, D.C.]], the capital of the [[United States]]]]\nGoverning entities sometimes plan, design and build new capital cities to house the seat of government of a [[polity]] or of a subdivision.

There have been various reasons for this, including overcrowding in that major metropolitan area, and the desire to place the capital city in a location with a better climate (usually a less tropical one).\n# A town that was chosen as a compromise among two or more cities (or other political divisions), none of which was willing to concede to the other(s) the privilege of being the capital city. Usually, the new capital is geographically located roughly equidistant between the competing population centres.\n\n[[File:Parliamenthouse2.jpg|thumb|The [[Australian Parliament]] opened in the small town of [[Canberra]] in 1927 as a compromise between the largest cities, [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].]]\nSome examples of the second situation (compromise locations) include:\n* [[Canberra]], Australia, chosen as a compromise located between Melbourne and Sydney.\n*[[Washington, D.C.]], United States, founded as a compromise between more urbanized [[Northern United States|Northern states]] and agrarian [[Southern United States|Southern]] \"[[Slave states and free states|slave states]]\" to share national power.

Unlike [[medieval]] capitals, which were declared wherever a [[monarch]] held his or her court, the selection, relocation, founding, or capture of a modern capital city is an emotional event. For example:\n\n* The ruined and almost uninhabited [[Athens]] was made capital of [[Independence of Greece|newly independent]] [[Greece]] in 1834, four years after the country gained its independence, with the [[Romanticism|romantic]] notion of reviving the glory of [[Ancient Greece]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greece.greekreporter.com/2018/09/18/september-18-1834-athens-becomes-the-capital-of-greece/|title=September 18, 1834: Athens Becomes the Capital of Greece {{!}} GreekReporter.com|last=Chrysopoulos|first=Philip|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref> Similarly, following the [[Cold War]] and [[German reunification]], [[Berlin]] is now once again the capital of Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.introducingberlin.com/history-of-berlin|title=History of Berlin - Past and present of Berlin|website=www.introducingberlin.com|access-date=2018-12-21}}</ref> Other restored capital cities include [[Moscow]] after the [[October Revolution]].\n* A symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either [[economic geography|economic]] or [[military geography|strategic]] reasons (sometimes known as a '''forward capital''' or spearhead capital).

During the 1857 rebellion, [[India|Indian rebels]] considered [[Delhi]] their capital, and [[Bahadur Shah Zafar]] was proclaimed emperor, but the ruling [[British India|British]] had their capital in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. In 1877, the British formally held a '[[Delhi Durbar|Durbar]]' in Delhi, proclaiming [[Queen Victoria]] as '[[Empress of India]]'. Delhi finally became the colonial capital after the [[Delhi Durbar|Coronation Durbar]] of King-Emperor [[George V]] in 1911, continuing as independent India's capital from 1947. Other examples include [[Abuja]], [[Astana]], [[Bras\u00edlia]], [[Helsinki]], [[Islamabad]], [[Naypyidaw]] and [[Yamoussoukro]].\n* The selection or founding of a \"neutral\" capital city, one unencumbered by regional or political identities, was meant to represent the unity of a new state when [[Ankara]], [[Bern]], [[Canberra]], [[Madrid]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] became capital cities. Sometimes, the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate squabbling or possible squabbling between various entities, such as in the cases of Canberra, Ottawa, Washington, Wellington and Managua.\n* The British-built town of [[New Delhi]] represented a simultaneous break and continuity with the past, the location of Delhi being where many imperial capitals were built (Indraprastha, Dhillika, and Shahjahanabad) but the actual capital being the new British-built town designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]]. Wellington, on the southwestern tip of the [[North Island of New Zealand]], replaced the much more northerly city of [[Auckland]] to place the national capital close to the [[South Island]] and hence to placate its residents, many of whom had sympathies with separatism.\n* During the [[American Civil War]], tremendous resources were expended to defend Washington, D.C., which bordered on the [[Confederate States of America]] (with the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]]), from Confederate attack even though the relatively small federal government could easily have been moved elsewhere. Likewise, great resources were expended by the Confederacy in defending the Confederate capital from attack by the Union, in its exposed location of [[Richmond, Virginia]], barely {{convert|100|mi}} south of Washington, D.C.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/washington-capital-of-the-union.html|title=Washington: Capital of the Union - Essential Civil War Curriculum|website=www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com|access-date=2019-01-07}}</ref>\n\n== Capitals in military strategy ==\n[[File:Fall-of-constantinople-22.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constantinople]], the capital of the [[Byzantine Empire]], was the final part of the empire to fall to the [[Ottoman Turks]] due to its strong defences.]]\nThe capital city is usually but not always a primary target in a war, as capturing it usually guarantees capture of much of the enemy government, victory for the attacking forces, or at the very least demoralization for the defeated forces.\n\nIn ancient [[China]], where governments were massive centralized bureaucracies with little flexibility on the provincial level, a [[Chinese Dynasties|dynasty]] could easily be toppled with the fall of its capital. In the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, both [[Shu Han|Shu]] and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] fell when their respective capitals of [[Chengdu]] and [[Jianye District|Jianye]] fell. The [[Ming dynasty]] relocated its capital from [[Nanjing]] to [[Beijing]], where they could more effectively control the generals and troops guarding the borders from [[Mongols]] and [[Manchus]]. The Ming was destroyed when [[Li Zicheng]] took their seat of power, and this pattern repeats itself in Chinese history, until the fall of the traditional [[Confucian]] monarchy in the 20th century. After the [[Qing dynasty]]'s collapse, decentralization of authority and improved transportation and communication technologies allowed both the [[Chinese Nationalists]] and [[Chinese Communists]] to rapidly relocate capitals and keep their leadership structures intact during the great crisis of [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]].\n\nNational capitals were arguably less important as military objectives in other parts of the world, including the West, because of socioeconomic trends toward localized authority, a strategic modus operandi especially popular after the development of [[feudalism]] and reaffirmed by the development of democratic and capitalistic philosophies. In 1204, after the Latin [[Fourth Crusade|Crusaders]] captured the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] capital, [[Constantinople]], Byzantine forces were able to regroup in several provinces; provincial noblemen managed to reconquer the capital after 60 years and preserve the empire for another 200 years after that. The [[British Empire|British]] forces sacked various [[United States|American]] capitals repeatedly during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and [[War of 1812]], but American forces could still carry on fighting from the countryside, where they enjoyed support from local governments and the traditionally independent civilian frontiersmen. Exceptions to these generalizations include highly centralized states such as [[France]], whose centralized bureaucracies could effectively coordinate far-flung resources, giving the state a powerful advantage over less coherent rivals, but risking utter ruin if the capital were taken.\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Capitals}}\n*[[Capital region]]\n*[[List of capital cities by altitude]]\n*[[List of national capitals and largest cities by country]]\n*[[List of capitals outside the territories they serve]]\n*[[List of former national capitals]]\n*[[List of national capitals in alphabetical order]]\n*[[Temporary capital]]\n*[[List of national capitals]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Terms for types of administrative territorial entities}}\n{{Cities}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Types of country subdivisions]]\n[[Category:Capitals| ]]\n<!-- start of StopAd injection -->\n\n<!-- end of StopAd injection -->\n", "name_user": "BellaYunita", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlanned capitals", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_city"}

In 2003\u20132004, the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] investigated anecdotal reports of declining insect populations in the UK by asking drivers to affix a postcard-sized PVC rectangle, called a \"splatometer\", to the front of their cars.<ref name=Splatometer2003>{{cite news |title='Splatometer' to count bug life |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3032476.stm |date=30 June 2003 |publisher=BBC News }}</ref> Almost 40,000 drivers took part, and the results found one squashed insect for every {{convert|5|mi}} driven.

He found two insects killed on the license-plate area for every {{convert|10|km}} driven. This implies about 1.6 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] insect deaths by cars per year in the [[Netherlands]], and about 32.5 trillion deaths in the United States if the figures are extrapolated there.<ref name=Messenger2011>{{cite news |last1=Messenger|first1=Stephen|title=Trillions of Insects Killed by Cars Every Year, Says Study |url=http://www.treehugger.com/cars/trillions-of-insects-killed-by-cars-every-year-says-study.html |accessdate=22 June 2014 |agency=TreeHugger |date=10 Jul 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Scavengers===\nOne rarely considered positive aspect of roadkill is the regular availability of [[carrion]] it provides for [[scavenger]] species such as [[vultures]], [[crows]], [[foxes]], [[Virginia opossum]]s and a wide variety of carnivorous insects. Areas with robust scavenger populations tend to see roadkilled animal corpses being quickly carried off, sometimes within minutes of being struck. This can skew data and cause a lower estimation of the number of roadkill animals per year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Santos |first1=Sara M. |last2=Carvalho |first2=Filipe |last3=Mira |first3=Ant\u00f3nio |title=How Long Do the Dead Survive on the Road?

However, such scavengers are at greater risk of becoming roadkill themselves, and are subject to [[evolutionary pressure]] to be alert to traffic hazards.\n\nIn contrast, areas where scavengers have been driven out (such as many urban areas) often see roadkill rotting in place indefinitely on the roadways and being further macerated by [[traffic]]. The remains must be manually removed by dedicated disposal personnel and disposed of via [[Cremation|sanitary cremation]]; this greatly increases the public nuisance inherent to roadkill, unnecessarily complicates its disposal, and consumes additional public money, time and fuel that could be spent on other roadway maintenance projects.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Research==\n===Roadkill observation projects===\nThe study of roadkill has proven highly amenable to the application of [[citizen science]] observation methods. Since 2009, statewide roadkill observation systems have been started in the US, enrolling hundreds of observers in reporting roadkill on a website. The observers, who are usually naturalists or professional scientists, provide identification, location, and other information about the observations. The data are then displayed on a website for easy visualization and made available for studies of proximate causes of roadkill, actual wildlife distributions, wildlife movement, and other studies. Roadkill observation system websites are available for the US states of California,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/california |title=wildlifecrossing.net/california |publisher=Wildlifecrossing.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> Maine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/maine |title=wildlifecrossing.net/maine |publisher=Wildlifecrossing.net |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> and Idaho.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fishandgame.idaho.gov/roadkill/ |title=Roadkill \u2014 Wildlife Collision Mortalities &#124; IFWIS |publisher=Fishandgame.idaho.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}</ref> In each case, index roads are used to help quantify total impact of vehicle collisions on specific vertebrate taxa.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \u2018Project Splatter\u2019 was started by [[Cardiff University]] in 2012, with the aim of estimating the impact of roads and motoring on British wildlife.<ref>[http://projectsplatter.co.uk/ \u2018Project Splatter\u2019 roadkill observation project] in the United Kingdom</ref> Since then it has gathered data on its website, and on several social media platforms including [[Facebook]]<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/SplatterProject13?fref=ts 'Project Splatter' page on Facebook]</ref> and [[Twitter]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/projectsplatter \u2018Project Splatter\u2019 page on Twitter]</ref>\n\nIn India, the project \"'''P'''rovide '''A'''nimals Safe '''T'''ransit on '''H'''ighways\" (PATH) was initiated by the [[Environment Conservation Group]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecgwild.org/|title=Environment Conservation Group (ECG) -|publisher=|accessdate=23 November 2016}}</ref> in 2015, to study the impact of roads on Indian wildlife.<ref>[http://www.ecgwild.org/path 'PATH' roadkill observation project] in India</ref> A team of five wildlife conservationists led by Mr. R.

Primary methods focus on changing driver attitude by increasing public awareness and helping people understand that reducing roadkill will benefit their community. The second potential way is to make people aware of specific hazardous areas by use of signage, [[rumble strip]]s or lighting. The third potential way is to slow traffic physically or psychologically, using [[chicane]]s or [[speed bump]]s.\n\nThere are three categories of altering wildlife behavior. Primary methods discourage wildlife from loitering on roadsides by reducing food and water resources, or by making the road surfaces lighter in color which may make wildlife feel more exposed on the roadway. Second are methods of discouraging wildlife from crossing roads, at least when cars are present, using equipment such as ultrasonic whistles, reflectors, and fencing. Third are mechanisms to provide safe crossing like [[overpass]], [[underpass]]es and escape routes.\n\n===Large animals===\n[[File:Moosecrossingkenaiak.JPG|thumb|Moose crossing sign with kill counter, [[Kenai, Alaska]].

However, such scavengers are at greater risk of becoming roadkill themselves, and are subject to [[evolutionary pressure]] to be alert to traffic hazards.\n\nIn contrast, areas where scavengers have been driven out (such as many urban areas) often see roadkill rotting in place indefinitely on the roadways and being further macerated by [[traffic]]. The remains must be manually removed by dedicated disposal personnel and disposed of via [[Cremation|sanitary cremation]]; this greatly increases the public nuisance inherent to roadkill, unnecessarily complicates its disposal, and consumes additional public money, time and fuel that could be spent on other roadway maintenance projects.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Research==\n===Roadkill observation projects===\nThe study of roadkill has proven highly amenable to the application of [[citizen science]] observation methods. Since 2009, statewide roadkill observation systems have been started in the US, enrolling hundreds of observers in reporting roadkill on a website. The observers, who are usually naturalists or professional scientists, provide identification, location, and other information about the observations. The data are then displayed on a website for easy visualization and made available for studies of proximate causes of roadkill, actual wildlife distributions, wildlife movement, and other studies.

The third potential way is to slow traffic physically or psychologically, using [[chicane]]s or [[speed bump]]s.\n\nThere are three categories of altering wildlife behavior. Primary methods discourage wildlife from loitering on roadsides by reducing food and water resources, or by making the road surfaces lighter in color which may make wildlife feel more exposed on the roadway.

There are four \"Vedic\" Samhitas: the [[Rigveda|Rig-Veda]], [[Samaveda|Sama-Veda]], [[Yajurveda|Yajur-Veda]], and [[Atharvaveda|Atharva-Veda]], most of which are available in several [[recension]]s (''{{IAST|\u015b\u0101kh\u0101}}''). In some contexts, the term ''Veda'' is used to refer to these Samhitas. This is the oldest layer of Vedic texts, apart from the Rigvedic hymns, which were probably essentially complete by 1200 BCE, dating to c. the 12th to 10th centuries BCE. The complete corpus of Vedic mantras as collected in [[Maurice Bloomfield|Bloomfield]]'s ''Vedic Concordance'' (1907) consists of some 89,000 [[pada (Hindu mythology)|padas]] ([[Foot (prosody)|metrical feet]]), of which 72,000 occur in the four Samhitas.<ref>37,575 are Rigvedic. Of the remaining, 34,857 appear in the other three Samhitas, and 16,405 are known only from Brahmanas, Upanishads or Sutras</ref>\n* The [[Brahmana]]s are prose texts that comment and explain the solemn rituals as well as expound on their meaning and many connected themes. Each of the Brahmanas is associated with one of the Samhitas or its recensions.<ref>Klaus Klostermaier (1994), A Survey of Hinduism, Second Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421093}}, pp. 67\u201369</ref><ref name=\"ebri\"/> The Brahmanas may either form separate texts or can be partly integrated into the text of the Samhitas. They may also include the Aranyakas and Upanishads.\n* The [[Aranyaka]]s, \"wilderness texts\" or \"forest treaties\", were composed by people who meditated in the woods as recluses and are the third part of the Vedas. The texts contain discussions and interpretations of ceremonies, from ritualistic to symbolic meta-ritualistic points of view.<ref name=\"jago\"/> It is frequently read in secondary literature.\n* Older [[Mukhya Upanishads]] ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|{{IAST|B\u1e5bhad\u0101ra\u1e47yaka}}]], [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chandogya]], [[Katha Upanishad|{{IAST|Ka\u1e6dha}}]], [[Kena Upanishad|Kena]], [[Aitareya Upanishad|Aitareya]], and others).<ref name=\"Michaels 2004 51\">{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=51}}.</ref><ref name=\"Flood 2003 69\">Witzel, Michael, \"Vedas and {{IAST|Upani\u1e63ads}}\", in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|p=69}}.</ref>\n\nThe Vedas (sruti) are different from Vedic era texts such as [[Shrauta Sutras]] and [[Kalpa (Vedanga)#Gryhasutras|Gryha Sutras]], which are smriti texts.

Its scope extends to about 400 texts, including the entire Vedic Sanskrit corpus besides some \"sub-Vedic\" texts. Volume I: Samhitas, Volume II: Brahmanas and Aranyakas, Volume III: Upanishads, Volume IV: Vedangas; A revised edition, extending to about 1800 pages, was published in 1973\u20131976.</ref>\n\nWhile production of Brahmanas and Aranyakas ceased with the end of the Vedic period, additional Upanishads were composed after the end of the Vedic period.<ref>{{Harvnb|Flood|2003|pp=100\u2013101}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Brahmana]]s, [[Aranyaka]]s, and [[Upanishads]], among other things, interpret and discuss the [[Samhitas]] in philosophical and metaphorical ways to explore abstract concepts such as the Absolute ([[Brahman]]), and the soul or the self ([[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|Atman]]), introducing [[Vedanta]] philosophy, one of the major trends of later [[Hinduism]]. In other parts, they show evolution of ideas, such as from actual sacrifice to symbolic sacrifice, and of spirituality in the Upanishads. This has inspired later Hindu scholars such as [[Adi Shankara]] to classify each Veda into ''karma-kanda'' (\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0916\u0923\u094d\u0921, action/ritual-related sections) and ''jnana-kanda'' (\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0916\u0923\u094d\u0921, knowledge/spirituality-related sections).<ref name=ab/><ref>Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction}} to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'' at pp. 1\u20135; Quote: \"The Vedas are divided in two parts, the first is the karma-kanda, the ceremonial part, also (called) purva-kanda, and treats on ceremonies; the second part is the jnana kanda, the part which contains knowledge, also named uttara-kanda or posterior part, and unfolds the knowledge of Brahma or the universal soul.\"</ref>\n\n===Shruti literature===\n{{Main article|\u015aruti}}\nThe texts considered \"Vedic\" in the sense of \"corollaries of the Vedas\" is less clearly defined, and may include numerous post-Vedic texts such as the later [[Upanishads]] and the [[S\u016btra|Sutra literature]]. Texts not considered to be ''shruti'' are known as ''[[smriti]]'' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|sm\u1e5bti}}''; \"the remembered\"), or texts of remembered traditions.  This indigenous system of categorization was adopted by [[Max M\u00fcller]] and, while it is subject to some debate, it is still widely used. As Axel Michaels explains:<ref name=\"Michaels 2004 51\"/>\n<blockquote>\nThese classifications are often not tenable for linguistic and formal reasons: There is not only ''one'' collection at any one time, but rather several handed down in separate Vedic schools; Upani\u015fads ... are sometimes not to be distinguished from {{IAST|\u0100ra\u1e47yakas}}...; {{IAST|Br\u0101hma\u1e47as}} contain older strata of language attributed to the {{IAST|Sa\u1e43hit\u0101s}}; there are various dialects and locally prominent traditions of the Vedic schools. Nevertheless, it is advisable to stick to the division adopted by Max M\u00fcller because it follows the Indian tradition, conveys the historical sequence fairly accurately, and underlies the current editions, translations, and monographs on Vedic literature.\"<ref name=\"Michaels 2004 51\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Upanishads]] are largely philosophical works, some in dialogue form.

Some of these texts have survived, most lost or yet to be found.

There are four \"Vedic\" Samhitas: the [[Rigveda|Rig-Veda]], [[Samaveda|Sama-Veda]], [[Yajurveda|Yajur-Veda]], and [[Atharvaveda|Atharva-Veda]], most of which are available in several [[recension]]s (''{{IAST|\u015b\u0101kh\u0101}}''). In some contexts, the term ''Veda'' is used to refer to these Samhitas. This is the oldest layer of Vedic texts, apart from the Rigvedic hymns, which were probably essentially complete by 1200 BCE, dating to c. the 12th to 10th centuries BCE. The complete corpus of Vedic mantras as collected in [[Maurice Bloomfield|Bloomfield]]'s ''Vedic Concordance'' (1907) consists of some 89,000 [[pada (Hindu mythology)|padas]] ([[Foot (prosody)|metrical feet]]), of which 72,000 occur in the four Samhitas.<ref>37,575 are Rigvedic. Of the remaining, 34,857 appear in the other three Samhitas, and 16,405 are known only from Brahmanas, Upanishads or Sutras</ref>\n* The [[Brahmana]]s are prose texts that comment and explain the solemn rituals as well as expound on their meaning and many connected themes. Each of the Brahmanas is associated with one of the Samhitas or its recensions.<ref>Klaus Klostermaier (1994), A Survey of Hinduism, Second Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421093}}, pp. 67\u201369</ref><ref name=\"ebri\"/> The Brahmanas may either form separate texts or can be partly integrated into the text of the Samhitas.

In other parts, they show evolution of ideas, such as from actual sacrifice to symbolic sacrifice, and of spirituality in the Upanishads. This has inspired later Hindu scholars such as [[Adi Shankara]] to classify each Veda into ''karma-kanda'' (\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e \u0916\u0923\u094d\u0921, action/ritual-related sections) and ''jnana-kanda'' (\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0916\u0923\u094d\u0921, knowledge/spirituality-related sections).<ref name=ab/><ref>Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction}} to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'' at pp. 1\u20135; Quote: \"The Vedas are divided in two parts, the first is the karma-kanda, the ceremonial part, also (called) purva-kanda, and treats on ceremonies; the second part is the jnana kanda, the part which contains knowledge, also named uttara-kanda or posterior part, and unfolds the knowledge of Brahma or the universal soul.\"</ref>\n\n===Shruti literature===\n{{Main article|\u015aruti}}\nThe texts considered \"Vedic\" in the sense of \"corollaries of the Vedas\" is less clearly defined, and may include numerous post-Vedic texts such as the later [[Upanishads]] and the [[S\u016btra|Sutra literature]]. Texts not considered to be ''shruti'' are known as ''[[smriti]]'' (Sanskrit: ''{{IAST|sm\u1e5bti}}''; \"the remembered\"), or texts of remembered traditions.  This indigenous system of categorization was adopted by [[Max M\u00fcller]] and, while it is subject to some debate, it is still widely used. As Axel Michaels explains:<ref name=\"Michaels 2004 51\"/>\n<blockquote>\nThese classifications are often not tenable for linguistic and formal reasons: There is not only ''one'' collection at any one time, but rather several handed down in separate Vedic schools; Upani\u015fads ... are sometimes not to be distinguished from {{IAST|\u0100ra\u1e47yakas}}...; {{IAST|Br\u0101hma\u1e47as}} contain older strata of language attributed to the {{IAST|Sa\u1e43hit\u0101s}}; there are various dialects and locally prominent traditions of the Vedic schools. Nevertheless, it is advisable to stick to the division adopted by Max M\u00fcller because it follows the Indian tradition, conveys the historical sequence fairly accurately, and underlies the current editions, translations, and monographs on Vedic literature.\"<ref name=\"Michaels 2004 51\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Upanishads]] are largely philosophical works, some in dialogue form.

Some of these texts have survived, most lost or yet to be found.

Reading had been garrisoned by the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] in November 1642, and held 3,300 soldiers under the command of [[Arthur Aston (English Army officer)|Sir Arthur Aston]]. On 14 April 1643, [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] brought a [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] army of 19,000 men to lay siege to the town, and began [[Bombardment|bombarding]] the town two days later.\n\nDuring the siege, Aston was wounded and command of the garrison passed to [[Richard Feilding]]. On 25 April, Feilding requested a truce in order to negotiate the town's surrender. Despite a relief force commanded by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] arriving the following day, Feilding held to the truce, and Essex's army was able to repel the relieving army. The surrender terms were agreed on 26 April, and the next day the Royalists left the town for [[Oxford]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Map of Redding by John Speed, 1611.jpg|thumb|right|A map of Reading from 1611]]\nIn August 1642, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] raised his [[Royal standards of England|royal standard]] in [[Nottingham]] and declared the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], and by extension Parliament, to be traitors, marking the start of the [[First English Civil War]].{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|pp=344\u2013348}}\n\nIn October 1642, [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] returned to [[Oxford]] from the indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]]. He then proceeded cautiously towards London, going via [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/civil-war/campainpageview.asp?pageid=400 |title=Consequences of the battle of Edgehill |website=UK Battlefields Resource Centre |publisher=The Battlefields Trust |accessdate=27 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810084342/http://battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/civil-war/campainpageview.asp?pageid=400 |archive-date=10 August 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> After being repelled from London, he retired back through Reading, where he left a [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] garrison of 2,000 soldiers under [[Arthur Aston (army officer)|Sir Arthur Aston]], who was appointed as governor.{{sfn|Doran|1836|p=22}} Aston was unimpressed with the soldiers available to him, writing to [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] that he \"could never have a greater affliction light on me than to be put in command of them\".{{sfn|Morgan|2004}} \n\nReading, located on the main route between London and Oxford, was strategically significant both due to its location as a 'frontier' between these two military strongholds, and the fact that it was located at a crossing point of the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Morgan|2004}}{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=10}} Prior to the war, the town had minimal defences, and Aston realised that to have any chance of holding the town, these needed to be improved. Over the winter months, Aston oversaw the creation of a defensive line; a [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] with a raised earthen [[Rampart (fortification)|rampart]] linking a series of [[bastions]]. This form of fortification was known as a \"continuous bastioned enceinte\", and was common for Royalist defences during the Civil War.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|pp=10\u201312}} The ramparts were topped with stone from [[Reading Abbey]], where they destroyed the church's [[nave]] specifically for the purpose. For the construction of the defences, Aston forced civilians from the town to work alongside his soldiers, and was described by Basil Morgan, his biographer in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', as \"bullying his soldiers and the citizenry alike\".{{sfn|Morgan|2004}} Aston maintained strict discipline over his troops, and had several hanged for not meeting his standards.{{sfn|Morgan|2004}} \n\nAside from the forced labour, the Royalist garrison presented other difficulties for the town: at the time Reading had a population of around 5,000, upon which space had to be found to [[Billet|house]] the 2,000 Royalist soldiers.{{sfn|Yarrow|1952|p=73}} Furthermore, the building of the fortifications and the army's expenses were charged to the town. Amongst these expenses were Aston's salary, which was so large that he loaned money back to the town with [[interest]]. In Stuart Hylton's 2017 ''A\u2013Z of Reading: Places\u2013People\u2013History'', he claims that: \"In any list of unpopular figures in Reading's history, Sir Arthur Aston... must surely feature near the top.\"{{sfn|Hylton|2017|p=8}}\n\n==Prelude==\nIn January 1643, the Parliamentarians learnt that Reading was poorly defended, so [[John Hampden]] and [[John Urry (soldier)|John Urry]] led a small force across the [[Chiltern Hills]] to scout the town. They only managed to get as far as the [[River Kennet]], which they were unable to cross as it was so swollen.{{sfn|Venning|2015|p=67}}\n\nOver the winter, there were growing calls for peace, particularly on the Parliamentary side, and a compromise was presented to King Charles at Oxford in February 1643. Although the proposals were far less demanding than previously made by parliament, the King was unconvinced and responded with demands of his own for the return of his income and military assets. Further discussion ensued, in which the King demanded more and more, and in early April parliament withdrew from the negotiation process.{{sfn|Cust|2007|p=371}}\n\n==Siege==\n[[File:Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, by Henry Thomas Ryall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] army which besieged Reading was led by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].]]\nThe [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], commander-in-chief of the Parliamentarian army, marched an army of over 19,000 men (16,000 [[Infantry|foot soldiers]], 3,000 [[cavalry]] plus [[artillery]]) from [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], and arrived at Reading on 14 April.{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=25}}{{sfn|Gentles|2014|p=100}} Essex bluffed the Reading garrison, making as though to continue onto Oxford, before he established his army to the south and west of the town, where the defensive works were the weakest, and captured [[Caversham Bridge]], cutting Reading off from the main Royalist forces in Oxford.{{sfn|Gentles|2014|p=169}}{{sfn|Coates|1802|p=25}} The Parliamentarians held a council of war, in which Essex sought advice on whether to attempt to storm the town, or to be more cautious and lay siege to it. While the cavalry officers favoured an aggressive approach, the infantry commanders preferred the more cautious path. Essex agreed to be cautious, aware that he could not afford to lose many men, as he would need them for his planned subsequent attack on Oxford.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=43}} Essex demanded that the town surrender, and in response, Aston said that he would rather \"starve and die\" than give up Reading.{{sfn|Fletcher|1839|p=17}} Accordingly, the Parliamentarians [[blockade]]d Reading, and Essex established his headquarters in [[Southcote, Berkshire|Southcote]].{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|pp=342\u2013364}}\n\nBy 16 April, the Parliamentarians had set up their artillery, and began to [[Bombardment|bombard]] the town.<ref name=\"bcw\">{{cite web |url=http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/southern-england/reading-chalgrove |title=The Siege of Reading & Chalgrove Field, 1643 |work=BCW Project |last=Plant |first=David |date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621222200/http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/southern-england/reading-chalgrove |archive-date=21 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Two days later, around 700 Royalist musketeers commanded by Lieutenant General Wilmot managed to reinforce Reading via [[Sonning]], to the east of the town. The blockade was subsequently tightened, surrounding the town on all sides.{{sfn|Doran|1836|p=24}}{{sfn|Emberton|1997|p=61}} During the bombardment, falling debris struck Aston and apparently rendered him unable to speak. The Royalist historian, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]] suggested that the affliction might not have been genuine, but rather a way of maintaining his reputation in a lost cause.{{sfn|Morgan|2004}} Command of the garrison passed to Aston's second-in-command, Colonel [[Richard Feilding]], on the basis that he was the most senior of Aston's colonels.{{sfn|Baxter|2016|p=156}} \n\nOn the morning of 25 April, Feilding displayed a [[white flag]] from the town walls, and established a truce in which to negotiate the town's surrender. The same day, a relief force commanded by King Charles and Prince Rupert attacked the Parliamentarian army at Caversham Bridge, but Feilding held to the truce, and the garrison did not join the battle. Feilding was pressured by some of his officers to break the truce and aid the relief force, but he refused, saying that it would be dishonourable, and that he would refuse, even \"if the king himself should come and knock at the gate, and command him to do it.\"{{sfn|Coates|1802|p=27}} Essex's army was able to repel the attack, and the relief force retreated.{{sfn|Coates|1802|p=27}} Feilding negotiated generous terms of surrender; he and his men were granted safe passage to Oxford with flying colours.{{sfn|Baxter|2016|p=156}} On 27 April the Royalist soldiers marched from the town to Oxford; despite the promise of safe passage, some of the Royalist soldiers were robbed and disarmed, though Essex had tried to prevent such action by promising his men a reward. {{sfn|Coates|1802|p=27}} According to Morgan, Aston regained his ability to speak during the journey.{{sfn|Morgan|2004}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn 29 April, two days after leaving Reading, Feilding was [[court-martial]]led; charged with \"several foul suspicious passages\".{{sfn|Hopper|2012|p=185}} At this early stage of the war, siege warfare in Britain was largely ineffective; methods that had been developed and refined in the European wars were applied without the skill and experience required. This led to additional suspicion being placed on commanders who surrendered while under siege.{{sfn|Burke|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Feilding's trial lasted for two days, after which he was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was reprieved twice on the [[Scaffold (execution site)|scaffold]] before the intervention of Prince Rupert led the King to pardon him.

Reading had been garrisoned by the [[Cavaliers|Royalists]] in November 1642, and held 3,300 soldiers under the command of [[Arthur Aston (English Army officer)|Sir Arthur Aston]]. On 14 April 1643, [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] brought a [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] army of 19,000 men to lay siege to the town, and began [[Bombardment|bombarding]] the town two days later.\n\nDuring the siege, Aston was wounded and command of the garrison passed to [[Richard Feilding]]. On 25 April, Feilding requested a truce in order to negotiate the town's surrender. Despite a relief force commanded by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] arriving the following day, Feilding held to the truce, and Essex's army was able to repel the relieving army. The surrender terms were agreed on 26 April, and the next day the Royalists left the town for [[Oxford]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Map of Redding by John Speed, 1611.jpg|thumb|right|A map of Reading from 1611]]\nIn August 1642, [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] raised his [[Royal standards of England|royal standard]] in [[Nottingham]] and declared the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], and by extension Parliament, to be traitors, marking the start of the [[First English Civil War]].{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|pp=344\u2013348}}\n\nIn October 1642, [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] returned to [[Oxford]] from the indecisive [[Battle of Edgehill]]. He then proceeded cautiously towards London, going via [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/civil-war/campainpageview.asp?pageid=400 |title=Consequences of the battle of Edgehill |website=UK Battlefields Resource Centre |publisher=The Battlefields Trust |accessdate=27 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810084342/http://battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/civil-war/campainpageview.asp?pageid=400 |archive-date=10 August 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> After being repelled from London, he retired back through Reading, where he left a [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] garrison of 2,000 soldiers under [[Arthur Aston (army officer)|Sir Arthur Aston]], who was appointed as governor.{{sfn|Doran|1836|p=22}} Aston was unimpressed with the soldiers available to him, writing to [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] that he \"could never have a greater affliction light on me than to be put in command of them\".{{sfn|Morgan|2004}} \n\nReading, located on the main route between London and Oxford, was strategically significant both due to its location as a 'frontier' between these two military strongholds, and the fact that it was located at a crossing point of the [[River Thames]].{{sfn|Morgan|2004}}{{sfn|Barratt|2009|p=10}} Prior to the war, the town had minimal defences, and Aston realised that to have any chance of holding the town, these needed to be improved. Over the winter months, Aston oversaw the creation of a defensive line; a [[Ditch (fortification)|ditch]] with a raised earthen [[Rampart (fortification)|rampart]] linking a series of [[bastions]]. This form of fortification was known as a \"continuous bastioned enceinte\", and was common for Royalist defences during the Civil War.{{sfn|Barratt|2009|pp=10\u201312}} The ramparts were topped with stone from [[Reading Abbey]], where they destroyed the church's [[nave]] specifically for the purpose. For the construction of the defences, Aston forced civilians from the town to work alongside his soldiers, and was described by Basil Morgan, his biographer in the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', as \"bullying his soldiers and the citizenry alike\".{{sfn|Morgan|2004}} Aston maintained strict discipline over his troops, and had several hanged for not meeting his standards.{{sfn|Morgan|2004}} \n\nAside from the forced labour, the Royalist garrison presented other difficulties for the town: at the time Reading had a population of around 5,000, upon which space had to be found to [[Billet|house]] the 2,000 Royalist soldiers.{{sfn|Yarrow|1952|p=73}} Furthermore, the building of the fortifications and the army's expenses were charged to the town. Amongst these expenses were Aston's salary, which was so large that he loaned money back to the town with [[interest]]. In Stuart Hylton's 2017 ''A\u2013Z of Reading: Places\u2013People\u2013History'', he claims that: \"In any list of unpopular figures in Reading's history, Sir Arthur Aston... must surely feature near the top.\"{{sfn|Hylton|2017|p=8}}\n\n==Prelude==\nIn January 1643, the Parliamentarians learnt that Reading was poorly defended, so [[John Hampden]] and [[John Urry (soldier)|John Urry]] led a small force across the [[Chiltern Hills]] to scout the town. They only managed to get as far as the [[River Kennet]], which they were unable to cross as it was so swollen.{{sfn|Venning|2015|p=67}}\n\nOver the winter, there were growing calls for peace, particularly on the Parliamentary side, and a compromise was presented to King Charles at Oxford in February 1643. Although the proposals were far less demanding than previously made by parliament, the King was unconvinced and responded with demands of his own for the return of his income and military assets. Further discussion ensued, in which the King demanded more and more, and in early April parliament withdrew from the negotiation process.{{sfn|Cust|2007|p=371}}\n\n==Siege==\n[[File:Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, by Henry Thomas Ryall.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Roundheads|Parliamentarian]] army which besieged Reading was led by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]].]]\nThe [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], commander-in-chief of the Parliamentarian army, marched an army of over 19,000 men (16,000 [[Infantry|foot soldiers]], 3,000 [[cavalry]] plus [[artillery]]) from [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], and arrived at Reading on 14 April.{{sfn|Baker|1986|p=25}}{{sfn|Gentles|2014|p=100}} Essex bluffed the Reading garrison, making as though to continue onto Oxford, before he established his army to the south and west of the town, where the defensive works were the weakest, and captured [[Caversham Bridge]], cutting Reading off from the main Royalist forces in Oxford.{{sfn|Gentles|2014|p=169}}{{sfn|Coates|1802|p=25}} The Parliamentarians held a council of war, in which Essex sought advice on whether to attempt to storm the town, or to be more cautious and lay siege to it. While the cavalry officers favoured an aggressive approach, the infantry commanders preferred the more cautious path. Essex agreed to be cautious, aware that he could not afford to lose many men, as he would need them for his planned subsequent attack on Oxford.{{sfn|Johnson|2012|p=43}} Essex demanded that the town surrender, and in response, Aston said that he would rather \"starve and die\" than give up Reading.{{sfn|Fletcher|1839|p=17}} Accordingly, the Parliamentarians [[blockade]]d Reading, and Essex established his headquarters in [[Southcote, Berkshire|Southcote]].{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|pp=342\u2013364}}\n\nBy 16 April, the Parliamentarians had set up their artillery, and began to [[Bombardment|bombard]] the town.<ref name=\"bcw\">{{cite web |url=http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/southern-england/reading-chalgrove |title=The Siege of Reading & Chalgrove Field, 1643 |work=BCW Project |last=Plant |first=David |date=23 March 2006 |accessdate=9 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621222200/http://bcw-project.org/military/english-civil-war/southern-england/reading-chalgrove |archive-date=21 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Two days later, around 700 Royalist musketeers commanded by Lieutenant General Wilmot managed to reinforce Reading via [[Sonning]], to the east of the town. The blockade was subsequently tightened, surrounding the town on all sides.{{sfn|Doran|1836|p=24}}{{sfn|Emberton|1997|p=61}} During the bombardment, falling debris struck Aston and apparently rendered him unable to speak. The Royalist historian, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon]] suggested that the affliction might not have been genuine, but rather a way of maintaining his reputation in a lost cause.{{sfn|Morgan|2004}} Command of the garrison passed to Aston's second-in-command, Colonel [[Richard Feilding]], on the basis that he was the most senior of Aston's colonels.{{sfn|Baxter|2016|p=156}} \n\nOn the morning of 25 April, Feilding displayed a [[white flag]] from the town walls, and established a truce in which to negotiate the town's surrender. The same day, a relief force commanded by King Charles and Prince Rupert attacked the Parliamentarian army at Caversham Bridge, but Feilding held to the truce, and the garrison did not join the battle. Feilding was pressured by some of his officers to break the truce and aid the relief force, but he refused, saying that it would be dishonourable, and that he would refuse, even \"if the king himself should come and knock at the gate, and command him to do it.\"{{sfn|Coates|1802|p=27}} Essex's army was able to repel the attack, and the relief force retreated.{{sfn|Coates|1802|p=27}} Feilding negotiated generous terms of surrender; he and his men were granted safe passage to Oxford with flying colours.{{sfn|Baxter|2016|p=156}} On 27 April the Royalist soldiers marched from the town to Oxford; despite the promise of safe passage, some of the Royalist soldiers were robbed and disarmed, though Essex had tried to prevent such action by promising his men a reward. {{sfn|Coates|1802|p=27}} According to Morgan, Aston regained his ability to speak during the journey.{{sfn|Morgan|2004}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn 29 April, two days after leaving Reading, Feilding was [[court-martial]]led; charged with \"several foul suspicious passages\".{{sfn|Hopper|2012|p=185}} At this early stage of the war, siege warfare in Britain was largely ineffective; methods that had been developed and refined in the European wars were applied without the skill and experience required. This led to additional suspicion being placed on commanders who surrendered while under siege.{{sfn|Burke|1990|pp=2\u20133}} Feilding's trial lasted for two days, after which he was found guilty and sentenced to death. He was reprieved twice on the [[Scaffold (execution site)|scaffold]] before the intervention of Prince Rupert led the King to pardon him. Despite his pardon, Feilding was still stripped of his regiment and position, and had thereafter had to fight as a volunteer.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=223}}\n\nThe capture of Reading meant the Parliamentarians could challenge Oxford directly, but Essex and [[William Waller]] were unable to coordinate their forces for an attack.<ref name=\"bcw\"/> Reading was held by the Parliamentarians until October, when they evacuated the town and it was retaken by the Royalists, but they in turn evacuated in the face of a Parliamentarian army the following May, and the town remained in the hands of Parliament for the remainder of the war.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/blog/place-strongly-fortified |title=Reading, its Abbey and the Civil War |last=Marsh |first=Simon |date=26 July 2018 |publisher=Reading Museum |accessdate=11 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191011093025/https://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/blog/place-strongly-fortified |archive-date=11 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |title=A Battlefield Atlas of the English Civil War |last=Baker |first=Anthony |year=1986 |location=London |publisher=Ian Allan Publishing |oclc=567989133}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |title=Sieges of the English Civil Wars |last=Barratt |first=John |year=2009 |location=Barnsley |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |isbn=978-1-84415-832-4}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |title=The Royal Abbey of Reading |last=Baxter |first=Ron |year=2016 |location=Woodbridge |publisher=The Boydell Press |isbn=978-1-78327-084-2}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hNSEAgAAQBAJ |title=The Civil Wars Experienced: Britain and Ireland, 1638\u20131661 |last=Bennett |first=Martyn |year=2005 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London |isbn=0-203-98180-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/artshumanitiesth00edwa |chapter=The English Civil Wars |title=Arts and Humanities Through the Eras |volume=5: The Age of the Baroque and Enlightenment 1600\u20131800 |editor1-last=Bleiberg |editor1-first=Edward |editor2-last=Soergel |editor2-first=Philip |collaboration=true |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |year=2005 |location=[[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] |isbn=978-0-787-65697-3 |ref=harv |url-access=registration }}\n* {{cite journal |ref=harv |title=The New Model Army and the Problems of Siege Warfare, 1648\u201351 |last=Burke |first=James |year=1990 |journal=Irish Historical Studies |volume=27 |issue=105 |pages=1\u201329 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |jstor=30008799}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |title=The History and Antiquities of Reading |last=Coates |first=Charles |year=1802 |location=London |publisher=Charles Coates |oclc=44593739}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |title=Charles I: A Political Life |last=Cust |first=Richard |year=2007 |origyear=2005 |location=Abingdon |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-4058-5903-5}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |chapter=The Borough of Reading: The Borough |chapter-url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/berks/vol3/pp342-364 |title=A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 3 |editor1-last=Ditchfield |editor1-first=P.

He has been ITV's senior football commentator since the retirement of [[Brian Moore (commentator)|Brian Moore]] following the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final|1998 World Cup final]]. In that role, he has led the ITV commentary team at the subsequent four World Cups and four European Championships, and been lead commentator on the last 17 UEFA Champions League finals as well as taking the microphone at nine FA Cup finals for ITV. He won the prestigious Royal Television Society Sports Commentator of the Year in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2005, and was voted the Sony Radio Awards' Sports Broadcaster of the Year in 1983. \n\n==Career==\nTyldesley was born in [[Radcliffe, Greater Manchester|Radcliffe]], [[Lancashire]], and was educated at [[Bury Grammar School]], [[Kirkham Grammar School]] and the [[University of Nottingham]]. He obtained an honours degree in Industrial Economics, but always wanted to pursue a career in sports commentating. In June 1975, he began his broadcast career straight from university with Radio Trent in Nottingham, where he became their regular Nottingham Forest reporter. In April 1977, he joined Radio City in Liverpool and remained there for the next 12 years. After succeeding [[Elton Welsby]] as City's sports editor, he covered the successes of Everton and Liverpool through the late 1970s and 1980s. Tyldesley was on-air at the scene of the Heysel disaster in 1985, but did not attend [[Hillsborough disaster|Liverpool's tragic FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough in 1989]]. He was heavily involved in City's coverage of the aftermath of the disaster. A teenage Liverpool fan that Clive had met and encouraged in his ambition to become a commentator, Ian Whelan, was among the 96 victims.\n\n==Early ITV career==\nFor much of his radio career, Tyldesley had contributed match reports to ITV's World of Sport programme. In 1987, he began to work on \"Sportsweek\", a late night Granada Television sports programme featuring Welsby and Robert McCaffrey. During the next two years, Tyldesley began to split his working time between Radio City and Granada, who he eventually joined full-time in 1989. He became their main football commentator and also worked as a reporter and occasional presenter on their ''Kick Off'' and ''Granada Soccer Night'' programmes. Tyldesley's first television commentary was in August 1989, Liverpool v Manchester City on the opening day of the season. He became ITV's rugby league commentator in the north-west alongside Hull FC coach Brian Smith, and worked with Martin Tyler and Fred Trueman as a cricket commentator on Granada's coverage of Roses matches. Tyldesley's commentaries were now being broadcast on ITV network programmes, and he was chosen to be part of their commentary team at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy. From 1989, he also became a regular reporter on 'Saint and Greavsie'.\n\n==BBC (1992\u20131996)==\nTyldesley received an offer to join the BBC's sports department in London in the summer of 1992. BBC's partnership with BSkyB enabled them to obtain highlights rights for the new Premier League in the spring of 1992, and they added Tyldesley to their established commentary team of John Motson, Barry Davies and Tony Gubba. For four years he contributed commentaries, voice-overs and film reports to ''Match of the Day'' and ''Sportsnight'', working at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] and the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996 European Championships]] as a BBC commentator. Because of the pre-eminence of Motson and Davies, he only commentated on 4 live matches in as many years with the BBC and in 1996 he was offered a chance to return to ITV. Tyldesley's final weeks with the BBC were spent commentating on the [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics|basketball tournaments]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympic Games]] in Atlanta.\n\n==Return to ITV (1996\u2013present)==\nTyldesley rejoined ITV in August 1996 as an understudy to Moore, who he often cites with Motson and Reg Gutteridge as the greatest influences on his commentary career. When Moore retired in 1998, Tyldesley became the network's lead football commentator. During his first season in that role, he commentated alongside Ron Atkinson on all of Manchester United's games in their successful Champions League campaign in addition to their FA Cup final victory in that treble season of 1999. His most famous commentary lines came during the dramatic climax of the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final of that year]] when he asked, \"Can Manchester United score? They always score\" moments before their equalizing goal. \"Name on the trophy\", \"Solskjaer has won it\" and \"Manchester United have reached the Promised Land\" are other phrases from his commentary fondly remembered by United fans.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maume|first=Chris|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sport-on-tv-tyldesleys-silence-proves-he-can-live-with-the-best-1096638.html|title=Tyldesley's silence proves he can live with the best|date=28 May 1999|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>\nHe has commentated on every Champions League final since 1998 for ITV, including dramatic successes for Liverpool and Chelsea as well as Manchester United. Tyldesley has been ITV's lead commentator at each European Championships since 2000 and World Cup since 2002. His regular co-commentators since Atkinson's resignation in 2004 have been David Pleat, Jim Beglin, Andy Townsend and Glenn Hoddle. On 27 June 2016 Tyldesley was the ITV commentator for the English national team's shocking 2-1 loss to Iceland in the Round of 16 at the UEFA European Championship. \"It's another wretched night for England at a major tournament.  It's difficult to think of anything quite as humbling as this defeat, certainly in living memory,\" said Tyldesley after the final whistle.  \"This is the most abject failure that I can recall.\"  He admits that football commentary is the only job he has ever really wanted to do since he was a child and regularly volunteers to speak to sports broadcast students at universities and colleges. Tyldesley says his only career disappointments were three unsuccessful interviews for BBC Radio Sport during the 1980s. He has the three rejection letters framed. He says his own personal favourite sports commentators are Pat Summerall and Brian Johnston.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Video games==\nHe has provided and written scripts for the sound commentary on [[EA Sports]] computer games since 2005-2011 along with [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]] (PS2 & PSP (''[[FIFA 06]]'' to ''[[FIFA 11]]''), PC (''[[FIFA 06]]'' to ''[[FIFA 10]]''), Android & iOS (''[[FIFA 11]]'' only) and Wii (''[[FIFA 08]]'' to ''[[FIFA 11]]'')) and 2011-2017 along with [[Andy Townsend]] mostly (PS2 and PSP (Only ''[[FIFA 12]]'' to ''[[FIFA 14]]''), PC, PS3 & PS4 - International Friendly (''FIFA 12'' - ''[[FIFA 17]]''), Wii, 3DS, iOS and Android (''[[FIFA 12]]'' - ''[[FIFA 15]]'')) who was also appeared before in the DS version of ''[[FIFA 11]]'',  ''[[2006 FIFA World Cup (video game)|FIFA World Cup 2006]]'',  ''[[UEFA Champions League 2006\u20132007]]'', ''[[UEFA Euro 2008 (video game)|UEFA Euro 2008]]'', ''[[2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa (video game)|2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa]]'', ''[[UEFA Euro 2012 (video game)|UEFA Euro 2012]]'' and ''[[2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil (video game)|2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil]]'' and options in commentary for ''[[FIFA 12]]'' to ''[[FIFA 13]]''. He also provided commentary for ''[[Championship Manager 2]]'', the last in the franchise to feature verbal analysis, and the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] video games ''[[This is Football]]'' and ''FA Premier League Stars 2001''. Tyldesley has been host of the International Electronic Games Conference as part of the Edinburgh Festival on two occasions. He also delivered the Roscoe Lecture at St George's Hall, Liverpool in 2008. He also became as commentator alongside Andy Townsend in the patch version of ''Pro Evolution Soccer'' (only 2011, 2012 and 2013). He also provided commentary in the DS version of ''[[FIFA 07]]'' to ''[[FIFA 10]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nTyldesley was married for the second time in July 2013 and lives near [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] with his wife Susan and their four children.

His most famous commentary lines came during the dramatic climax of the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final of that year]] when he asked, \"Can Manchester United score? They always score\" moments before their equalizing goal. \"Name on the trophy\", \"Solskjaer has won it\" and \"Manchester United have reached the Promised Land\" are other phrases from his commentary fondly remembered by United fans.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maume|first=Chris|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/sport-on-tv-tyldesleys-silence-proves-he-can-live-with-the-best-1096638.html|title=Tyldesley's silence proves he can live with the best|date=28 May 1999|accessdate=11 January 2018|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>\nHe has commentated on every Champions League final since 1998 for ITV, including dramatic successes for Liverpool and Chelsea as well as Manchester United.

It's difficult to think of anything quite as humbling as this defeat, certainly in living memory,\" said Tyldesley after the final whistle.  \"This is the most abject failure that I can recall.\"  He admits that football commentary is the only job he has ever really wanted to do since he was a child and regularly volunteers to speak to sports broadcast students at universities and colleges.
