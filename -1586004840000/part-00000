It mostly collapsed during the [[Uganda\u2013Tanzania War]], but remnants continued to operate in exile from 1979. These pro-Amin rebel forces continued to be called the \"Uganda Army\" and maintained a semblance of cohesion until 1980, when they fully fractured into rival factions.\n\nFollowing Uganda's independence in 1962, colonial units were transformed into the country's first national military which became known as the \"Uganda Army\". The military suffered from increasing ethnic and political tensions until UA commander Idi Amin overthrew President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. The military was subsequently purged of perceived pro-Obote elements, resulting in a transformation of its setup and organization. Under Amin's rule, the UA became dominated by people of northwestern Ugandan, Sudanese, and Zairean origin, resulting in it being increasingly perceived as foreign mercenary force by most Ugandans. It was massively expanded and modernized, mostly with weaponry of [[Eastern Bloc]] origin, though Uganda's difficult international relations resulted in shortcomings in the supply of spare parts.\n\nTo maintain power, Amin used a complex patronage system with which he rewarded the Uganda Army's troops and maintained the soldiers' loyalty. As time went on, this system resulted in extreme corruption, growing indiscipline, and internal rivalries. Despite its numerical growth and good equipment, the Uganda Army consequently deteriorated in regard to its fighting capabilities. Regardless, it remained a powerful force, and defeated several uprisings, coup attempts, and one rebel invasion. In late 1978, parts of the Uganda Army invaded the neighboring country of Tanzania under unclear circumstances, resulting in the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War. The military proved to be ineffective and badly motivated during this conflict, and most soldiers defected, deserted or mutinied after March 1979. Loyalist elements of the Uganda Army managed to retreat into Sudan and Zaire, however, from where they prepared to retake Uganda. The Uganda Army's remnants launched two successful invasions in 1980, capturing most of the West Nile region. Thereafter conflicts between its commanders and different factions resulted in a complete fragmentation of the remaining Uganda Army troops. One of these successor groups, the so-called [[Former Uganda National Army]], maintained to be the continuation of the Uganda Army.\n\n== History ==\n=== Establishment of Uganda's armed forces ===\n[[File:Uganda Army OT-64 APC.jpg|thumb|A Uganda Army [[OT-64 SKOT]] [[armoured personnel carrier]] during a military parade in Kampala in the late 1960s]]\nAfter Uganda was granted independence from the United Kingdom in 1962,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=5}} 4th Battalion,  [[King's African Rifles]], at [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]],<ref name=Bruce-Lockhart>{{cite web| url = https://humanities.utoronto.ca/blog/becoming-amins-soldiers| title = Becoming \"Amin's Soldiers\"| last = Bruce-Lockhart| first = Katherine| date = 7 March 2018| work = University of Toronto: Jackman Humanities Institute| access-date = 1 March 2020}}</ref> was transformed into the country's first military force, the Uganda Rifles.

In the decades since Amin's downfall, the term maintained a negative connotation in much of Uganda due to the Uganda Army's indiscipline, brutal conduct, and corruption. \"Amin's soldiers\" were stereotypically believed to be uneducated northerners who had only joined the military to maintain Amin's power, despite the existence of many veterans who did not correspond to this image. This negative perception affected their attempted reintegration into civilian communities; their military service was seen as a \"shame\", they were monitored by authorities, and many were not granted their full pensions. There were also differences between the veterans, as some of those who had peacefully surrendered after the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War became outcasts, whereas those who had joined rebel groups were later \"welcomed back to Uganda\".<ref name=Bruce-Lockhart/>\n\nMany issues also remained unresolved in regard to questions of guilt. Victims of Amin's regime believe that many soldiers who had committed human rights violations essentially walked free. This problem is exacerbated by the reconciliation policies of the NRM government that governs Uganda since 1986. Since the 1990s, many Uganda Army veterans have also begun to lobby for their cause, and publicly criticised their stereotypical perception as perpetrators, arguing that they should not be generally blamed for Amin's crimes.<ref name=Bruce-Lockhart/> In the early 2000s veterans of the army from the 1960s and 1970s formed the Uganda Army Service Men Development Association and sued the government, demanding to be properly compensated for their service.

People wielded influence in accordance to their connection to Amin, and a junior officer who was liked by the President could easily circumvent or even command a senior officer who was less well connected.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=61}} The power of individuals was also tied to the ability to provide economic resources to supporters.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=97}}\n\nThe army's headquarters was located in Republic House in Kampala.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} The military was factually controlled by the Defence Council which mostly consisted of Amin's inner circle.

In general, tribal identities were of great importance to determine a soldier's standing,{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} though this was a complex issue. Amin's regime actually wanted to reduce the ethnic and religious lines of division in the country which would have helped to keep its rule stable.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=91}} The President himself was known for his repeated criticism of tribalism, and pledged to combat it.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=142}}{{sfn|Hansen|2013|pp=88\u201389, 91}} A few of his appointments of officers did reflect this intention to defuse ethnic tensions.<ref name=lubega2/> At the same time, Amin's government mostly \"acted within ethnic categories\"{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=91}} and ultimately fueled ethnic favoritism. This paradox resulted from the regime's most important concern, namely to ensure its survival. Certain ethnic groups were judged to be simply more loyal than others due to familial and economic circumstances. As result, they were empowered, but this increased factionalism and in turn led to more strife, necessitating even more reliance on trusted elements. Amin's government was never able to solve this problem, and many of its initiatives were driven by the anxiety of losing control.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=91}} In addition, ethnic affiliation and tribalism were problematic issues in Uganda.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} This was due to Ugandan \"tribes\" being often ill-defined and changeable, as no firm tribal structures existed among many West Nile peoples,{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}} while intermarriage also occurred.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=142}} Amin himself was of mixed ethnic origin.{{efn|His father was a Kakwa and his mother a Lugbara.<ref name=Keatley/> Regardless, some sources also describe him as being of mixed Kakwa-Nubian origin.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=85}} }} In fact, the Nubians were \"an extremely fluid category\"{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} and Amin himself stated that members of different tribes could become Nubians.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}}{{efn|The Nubians are often portrayed as descendants of [[Emin Pasha]]'s mostly Muslim soldiers who fled to Uganda after being defeated by [[Mahdist State|Mahdist Sudanese forces]] in the 1880s. Regarded as martial people, they were consequently recruited into British colonial units; as a result, West Nile people who wanted to join the military often claimed to be Nubians. This led to the paradoxical situation that the Nubians were both \"detribalised\" yet had also a distinct identity intimately linked to the West Nile region, to Islam, and to military service.{{sfn|Leopold|2005|p=60}}{{sfn|Hansen|1977|pp=79\u201380}} }}\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=Tribalism is the biggest enemy in Africa today.

Tribes are here to stay.|source=\u2014President [[Idi Amin]]{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=142}} }}\nBesides ethnicity and security concerns, favoritism in the military was also determined by the political relations of the Ugandan government. When Amin began to forge strong links with various Muslim Arab powers, religion grew in importance and Muslims became more favored in the Uganda Army. As result, members of traditionally favored tribes who identified as Christians became marginalized, resulting in strife. In the end, Amin could not even rely on members of his own tribe, the Kakwa, to always stay loyal. Most prominently, Charles Arube was a Kakwa{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} yet attempted a coup when he was marginalized by another officer, Hussein Malera.<ref name=\"arube\"/> Overall, ethnicity was less important than personal connections in Amin's military. Fort example, one of the President's most important security agencies was led by a Lango by 1976.{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=312}} Some ranking officers who were Christian or did not belong to the favored tribes also remained in the Uganda Army up until Amin's regime collapsed.<ref name=lubega2/> Overall, the military remained a diverse force whose troops had a wide variety of backgrounds and accordingly different views on the character of their service. A large number continued to regard themselves as \"career military professionals\".<ref name=Bruce-Lockhart/>\n\nAs result of all these factors, the factions in the military and its ethnic makeup changed significantly in course of Amin's presidency. After the 1971 coup, Amin initially preferred to recruit and promote Kakwa, Nubians, Madi, Lugbara, and Alur,<ref name= Kironde/>{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|pp=111\u2013112}} while members of other ethnic groups were gradually removed from the Uganda Army, as they were suspected of being disloyal.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=6}} By 1973, about 35\u201350% of the military was made up of West Nile tribesmen;{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=108}} almost half of these were Lugbara.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=115}} As result of repeated coup attempts and other factors, the Lugbara, Madi, and Alur also came under suspicion and were partially purged by 1973,{{sfn|Hansen|2013|pp=96\u201397}} leaving just the Kakwa and Nubians as core faction of the Uganda Army.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|pp=97\u201398}} At the same time, the growing number of Nubian soldiers also resulted from the blurring lines of tribal identities in the West Nile. Muslim and Kakwa troops were increasingly regarded as Nubians regardless of ethnic origin.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|pp=108\u2013110}} By 1973, the Nubians constituted about 25\u201330% of the army.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=108}} Despite the repeated purges, however, many Madi, Lugbara, and Alur soldiers remained in the army, though their influence was greatly reduced.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=117}}\n\nEven the Nubians and Kakwa remained a potential threat, so that Amin increasingly opted to rely on foreigners to keep the military loyal to his regime.{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}} The Uganda Army's foreign members were recruited from various neighboring countries, most importantly Sudan and Zaire. They were \"lifted above both the ethnic pattern and religious affiliation\".{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=97}} These troops were often ex-members of rebel groups with whom Amin had forged good relations{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=234}} such as the Anyanya from southern Sudan.{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|p=111}}<ref name= Kironde/> They acted as ''de facto'' mercenaries.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}}{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=110}} According to researcher Holger Bernt Hansen, the mercenary role of the Sudanese recruits was especially evident as the Anyanya rebels had fought against Islamization in their home areas, yet supported Amin's regime that favored Muslims.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=110}} Amin believed the foreigners to be more dependent and therefore more loyal than most native Ugandans.{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}}{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=97}} By 1973, about 20\u201325% of the Uganda Army were foreigners, most being ex-Anyanya.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=108}} Researcher Paul Nugent estimated that as much as three quarters of the military eventually consisted of foreigners.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=234}} Even though the foreigners often claimed membership in the same tribes to which the native Ugandan troops belonged,<ref name=\"arube\"/>{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}}{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=94}} the latter saw them as outsiders and often held them in low regard.<ref name=\"arube\"/>{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}} For example, Ugandan Nubians in [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]], [[Kitgum, Uganda|Kitgum]], and [[Gulu]] resented the foreign Nubians as ruthless mercenaries.{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}} Accordingly, the foreigners were \"seen as an instrument to neutralize the predominance of the ethnic factor\" by Amin, though ultimately they did not ease ethnic tensions.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=97}} Instead, rivaleries developed between the foreign and native troops of the Uganda Army.{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=1}}\n\n=== Military justice ===\nA system of courts and [[military justice]] was established by the Armed Forces Act of 1964. Further broad guarantees of the [[right to a fair trial]] were assured by Uganda's succession of constitutions in the 1960s. Tribunals convened by Amin during his rule frequently ignored constitutional and legal prescriptions. Most men called to serve on the panels were selected on the basis of their loyalty to the President and their willingness to convict political opponents of the regime; many were illiterate and had no understanding of Ugandan law. Defendants were often presumed to be [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] at the start of proceedings and were usually denied legal counsel. Most persons found guilty of an offence by a military tribunal were executed via firing squad.{{sfn|Naluwairo|2018|p=66}} Many cases were prosecuted in secret and in some instances without the knowledge of the accused party.{{sfn|Human Rights Violations|1978|p=4}} Though upon taking power Amin declared that he would subject soldiers accused of offences to tribunals, in practice many were killed without any legal process.{{sfn|Uganda under Military Rule|1973|p=14}}\n\nIn 1973 Amin issued a decree expanding the reach of military tribunals to include the trial of civilians accused of committing capital offences. He also empowered himself to convene such tribunals for civilians believed to have been acting in a fashion to bring the government or army into disrepute.{{sfn|Naluwairo|2018|p=67}} The President further expanded their jurisdiction into non-civilian matters with another decree in 1975.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/12-executed-as-Amin-introduces-trial-civilians-military-courts/689844-5131640-onaekdz/index.html| title = 12 executed as Amin introduces trial of civilians in military| last = Mugabe| first = Faustin| date = 26 May 2019| website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 3 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Strength ===\nThe strength of the Uganda Army is not known for certain during the 1971\u20131979 period. As result of massive recruitment drives, coupled with regular purges, the number of military personnel fluctuated greatly.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|pp=96\u201397}}{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=107}} Accordingly, there exist estimates ranging from about 10,000{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=107}}<ref name= vision/> to more than 40,000 troops.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=226}} One Ugandan officer claimed that the TPDF outnumbered the Uganda Army \"by 3-1 ratio\" during the war with Tanzania.<ref name= mugabe>{{cite news| url = https://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/Uganda-annexes-Tanzanian-territory-after-Kagera-Bridge-victory/689844-3162012-1laywm/index.html| title = Uganda annexes Tanzanian territory after Kagera Bridge victory| last = Mugabe| first = Faustin| date = 17 April 2016| newspaper = Daily Monitor| access-date = 21 December 2019}}</ref> It is often estimated that about 20,000 troops served in the Uganda Army on average during Amin's rule.<ref name= darnton3/>{{sfn|Paxton|2016|p=1198}}{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=107}}\n\n=== Structure ===\nThe Uganda Army consisted of its ground forces and the Uganda Army Air Force.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=18}} It had no official navy.

Uganda received 16 [[T-55A]] tanks and 62 APCS from the Soviets, as well as 16 [[Alvis Saracen]] armoured cars from Libya in 1973 and 1974. Thereafter, relations with the Soviet Union worsened, resulting in the reduction of military aid and supplies.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=18}} Libya also gifted Uganda ten [[T-34 variants|T-34/85]] tanks in 1976.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} By 1978, the Uganda Army's ground forces possessed 10 T-34, 15 [[T-54/T-55]], and 10 M-4 tanks, 250 Alvis Saracen armoured cars, and a unspecified number of [[BRDM]] amphibious vehicles, OT-64 APCs, as well as Ferret, [[BTR-40]], and [[BTR-152]] armoured cars.{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=8}}\n\nThe Uganda Army's artillery included 76 mm and 122 mm cannons, 82 mm and 120 mmm mortars, [[9M14 Malyutka|Sagger anti-tank missiles]], and fifty 40 mm [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]] by 1978.{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=8}}\n\nThe Uganda Army Air Force was also expanded during Amin's presidency. By 1979, it had access to several dozen fighter and [[trainer aircraft|trainer]] aircraft, though the exact number remains unclear.

It mostly collapsed during the [[Uganda\u2013Tanzania War]], but remnants continued to operate in exile from 1979. These pro-Amin rebel forces continued to be called the \"Uganda Army\" and maintained a semblance of cohesion until 1980, when they fully fractured into rival factions.\n\nFollowing Uganda's independence in 1962, colonial units were transformed into the country's first national military which became known as the \"Uganda Army\". The military suffered from increasing ethnic and political tensions until UA commander Idi Amin overthrew President [[Milton Obote]] in 1971. The military was subsequently purged of perceived pro-Obote elements, resulting in a transformation of its setup and organization. Under Amin's rule, the UA became dominated by people of northwestern Ugandan, Sudanese, and Zairean origin, resulting in it being increasingly perceived as foreign mercenary force by most Ugandans. It was massively expanded and modernized, mostly with weaponry of [[Eastern Bloc]] origin, though Uganda's difficult international relations resulted in shortcomings in the supply of spare parts.\n\nTo maintain power, Amin used a complex patronage system with which he rewarded the Uganda Army's troops and maintained the soldiers' loyalty. As time went on, this system resulted in extreme corruption, growing indiscipline, and internal rivalries. Despite its numerical growth and good equipment, the Uganda Army consequently deteriorated in regard to its fighting capabilities. Regardless, it remained a powerful force, and defeated several uprisings, coup attempts, and one rebel invasion. In late 1978, parts of the Uganda Army invaded the neighboring country of Tanzania under unclear circumstances, resulting in the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War. The military proved to be ineffective and badly motivated during this conflict, and most soldiers defected, deserted or mutinied after March 1979. Loyalist elements of the Uganda Army managed to retreat into Sudan and Zaire, however, from where they prepared to retake Uganda. The Uganda Army's remnants launched two successful invasions in 1980, capturing most of the West Nile region. Thereafter conflicts between its commanders and different factions resulted in a complete fragmentation of the remaining Uganda Army troops. One of these successor groups, the so-called [[Former Uganda National Army]], maintained to be the continuation of the Uganda Army.\n\n== History ==\n=== Establishment of Uganda's armed forces ===\n[[File:Uganda Army OT-64 APC.jpg|thumb|A Uganda Army [[OT-64 SKOT]] [[armoured personnel carrier]] during a military parade in Kampala in the late 1960s]]\nAfter Uganda was granted independence from the United Kingdom in 1962,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=5}} 4th Battalion,  [[King's African Rifles]], at [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]],<ref name=Bruce-Lockhart>{{cite web| url = https://humanities.utoronto.ca/blog/becoming-amins-soldiers| title = Becoming \"Amin's Soldiers\"| last = Bruce-Lockhart| first = Katherine| date = 7 March 2018| work = University of Toronto: Jackman Humanities Institute| access-date = 1 March 2020}}</ref> was transformed into the country's first military force, the Uganda Rifles. The Uganda Rifles later became the Uganda Army.

It became dominated by people from northern Uganda such as the [[Acholi people|Acholi]], [[Lango people|Langi]], and West Nile tribal people.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Hansen|1977|pp=78\u201379}} In course of the [[Mengo Crisis]] of 1966, Prime Minister [[Milton Obote]] and his ''prot\u00e9g\u00e9'', Uganda Army commander [[Idi Amin]], used the military to oust the country's President [[Mutesa II of Buganda]] and establish a ''de facto'' dictatorship.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=84}} This event marked the full entry of the military into the political arena,{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=85}} and the start of ethnic purges in the Uganda Army, as many [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] and [[Teso people|Teso]] troops were ousted from the ranks.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=85}} Obote subsequently assumed the presidency and Amin was appointed head of the Uganda Army, but rifts soon emerged between the two allies.

An Israeli firm was contracted to build two new army bases and several airfields. New mechanised battalions were established, as well as a paratrooper unit. Portions of the Uganda Army Air Force were redeployed from its main installation in [[Entebbe]] to the new airfields. Foreign equipment was ordered and procured with the assistance of France, Egypt and various Arab states, though the acquisitions depleted Uganda's foreign exchange reserves.{{sfn|Uganda under Military Rule|1973|p=20}}\n\n[[File:West Nile subregion.png|thumb|left|After [[Idi Amin]] assumed power, he filled the Uganda Army's ranks with soldiers from the [[West Nile sub-region|West Nile District]] (dark red) ]]\n\nAmin actually promised reforms in the army to make it more ethnically representative and improve its discipline.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|pp=88\u201389}} Despite these pledges, he first moved to systematically purge the Uganda Army of Acholi, Langi, and Teso soldiers.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=6}}{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=310}} Hundreds of them were massacred in the coup's immediate aftermath\u2014including chief of staff [[Suleiman Hussein]]{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|pp=249\u2013251}}\u2014and about 5,000 Acholi and Langi soldiers were killed or [[Forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]] in the next months.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=6}} Journalist Patrick Keatley estimated that as much as two thirds of the original military personnel were killed within a year.<ref name=Keatley/> The most severe purges took place in July 1971,{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=105}} when fighting broke out at the military barracks of [[Mbarara]], Jinja and [[Moroto Town|Moroto]].{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=125}} The Ugandan government maintained that pro-Obote guerrillas had attacked the barracks,{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=96}} whereas a pro-opposition source stated that the fighting had erupted due to tribal rivalries and 900 Acholi as well as Lango troops being massacred by Amin's supporters.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=125}} Many Acholi and Langi troops responded to the purges by fleeing the country.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=6}}{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|p=111}}<ref name= lubega1>{{cite web| url = https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/Tanzanians-found-Amin---men-weak---Col-Kisuule/688342-2325484-yc2hibz/index.html| title = Tanzanians found Amin men weak - Col Kisuule| last = Lubega| first = Henry| date = 25 May 2014| website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 23 January 2019| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190124102143/https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/Tanzanians-found-Amin---men-weak---Col-Kisuule/688342-2325484-yc2hibz/index.html| archive-date = 24 January 2019| url-status = live| df = dmy-all}}</ref> A large number of these exiles joined Obote's \"People Army\" and \"[[Kikosi Maalum]]\" force which aimed at overthrowing Amin.{{sfn|Golooba-Mutebi|2008|p=11}} These insurgents found a haven in Tanzania which opposed Amin's seizure of power, causing tensions that resulted in border clashes in August 1971.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=104}}<ref name=lubega2>{{cite news| last = Lubega| first = Henry| title = Lt Col Abdu Kisuule: Uganda did not invade Tanzania, they provoked us| newspaper = Daily Monitor| date = 24 May 2014| url = https://www.monitor.co.ug/SpecialReports/Lt-Col-Abdu-Kisuule--Uganda-did-not-invade-Tanzania/688342-2324550-tuqxmn/index.html |access-date= 29 February 2020 }}</ref> In August 1971, [[Front for National Salvation|FRONASA]] rebels attempted to set up a guerrilla base on [[Mount Elgon]], but they were quickly discovered and mostly arrested by Ugandan security forces.{{sfn|Clapham|1998|p=93}}\n\nIn order to replace the purged troops and consolidate his power, Amin enlisted tribesmen belonging to ethnic groups that lived in the West Nile District, Sudan, Zaire,{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|p=111}} Kenya,<ref name= Kironde>{{cite news| last = Kironde| first = Erisa| title = Rebuilding Uganda After Amin| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 21| date = 8 April 1979| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1979/04/08/archives/rebuilding-uganda-after-amin.html| access-date = 18 February 2020}}</ref> and Rwanda.<ref name=\"arube\">{{cite news| url = http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/Insight/Brig-Arube-failed-coup-plan/688338-2927172-ymdmg4z/index.html | title = Brig Arube's failed coup plan| last = Mugabe| first = Faustin| newspaper = Daily Monitor| date = 24 October 2015 | access-date = 14 October 2018}}</ref> These tribes such as the [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]], Nubians (or Nubi), [[Madi people|Madi]], [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]], and [[Alur people|Alur]] were believed to be more loyal to Amin, and their fortunes were tied to the survival of his regime.{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|pp=111\u2013112}}<ref name= Kironde/> In addition, ex-[[Simba rebellion|Simba]]{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=110}}{{sfn|Glentworth|Hancock|1973|p=251}} and ex-[[Anyanya]] rebels became an important force among the restructured Uganda Army.{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|p=111}}<ref name= Kironde/> Most promotions were granted to Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Uganda under Military Rule|1973|p=21}} In the course of 1971, Amin recruited 19,742 new soldiers, nominally increasing the Uganda Army to 27,000.

This negative perception affected their attempted reintegration into civilian communities; their military service was seen as a \"shame\", they were monitored by authorities, and many were not granted their full pensions. There were also differences between the veterans, as some of those who had peacefully surrendered after the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War became outcasts, whereas those who had joined rebel groups were later \"welcomed back to Uganda\".<ref name=Bruce-Lockhart/>\n\nMany issues also remained unresolved in regard to questions of guilt.

This problem is exacerbated by the reconciliation policies of the NRM government that governs Uganda since 1986.

Taken together with the President's own system of favors, the military developed a patronage system in which high-ranking military men combined \"military, political, administrative, commercial, and agricultural operations into composite fiefs\", becoming autonomous warlords.{{sfn|Southall|1980|p=642}} To keep these officers from becoming too powerful, Amin allowed and even encouraged lower-ranks to ignore their commanders' orders and take orders directly from himself.{{sfn|Southall|1980|pp=642\u2013643}} Troops were also allowed to bend rules and disregard many laws.{{sfn|Southall|1980|p=643}} As result, many soldiers also acted as bandits, were willing to loan or sell their weapons to civilians, and operated as guns for hire.{{sfn|Southall|1980|p=642}} Soldiers also frequently engaged in poaching in national parks and game reserves, dramatically decreasing wildlife populations in the country.<ref>{{cite news| last = King| first = Christabel| title = Hungry Tanzanian troops join poachers in Uganda's game parks| newspaper = The Sunday Telegraph| date = 8 July 1979}}</ref> As they were generally more wealthy and had better access to various goods, clinics, and schools, soldiers were among the most eligible men in the country for marriage.{{sfn|Southall|1980|p=643}} In general, service in the Uganda Army provided great economic and social incentives, providing military men with wealth and power in an increasingly dysfunctional country.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=105}}{{sfn|Southall|1980|pp=642\u2013643}} Military service was especially attractive to West Nile people due to their home area's poverty. Amin did little to actually help West Nile's development during his rule, and the Uganda Army remained one of the few actual employment opportunities for locals. Researcher Mark Leopold consequently described the West Nile soldiers during Amin's rule as \"[[Lumpenproletariat#Imitations|lumpen militariat]]\", a term originally developed by [[Ali Mazrui]] based on the [[Marxism|Marxist]] concept of ''[[Lumpenproletariat]]''.{{sfn|Leopold|2005|p=65}} \n\nEven though this patronage system succeeded to keep much of the military somewhat loyal,<ref name= schlange/> it negatively affected the Uganda Army's ability to function.

He responded by reducing his following,{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|pp=111\u2013112}} promoting factionalism in the military and repeatedly purging senior ranks, thereby making concentrated actions against his regime unlikely.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} The factionalism in the military further reduced the Uganda Army's cohesion, and caused violent infighting.<ref name= darnton3/> By 1978, many troops were discontent due to the lack of proper uniforms and delays in pay<ref name= darnton3/> which resulted in soldiers regularly robbing shopkeepers during \"foraging expeditions\".{{sfn|Southall|1980|p=639}} When the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War erupted the British authorities also stopped the \"whisky run\".

In addition, the military was affected by factional infighting and regular purges,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=12}} and many officers whom Amin promoted were completely unqualified and corrupt.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137, 12}} Their rise in the ranks was attributed to their loyalty to the President and their ethnicity.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} In fact, the formal chain of command ceased to function and the ranks of officers gradually became meaningless. People wielded influence in accordance to their connection to Amin, and a junior officer who was liked by the President could easily circumvent or even command a senior officer who was less well connected.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=61}} The power of individuals was also tied to the ability to provide economic resources to supporters.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=97}}\n\nThe army's headquarters was located in Republic House in Kampala.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} The military was factually controlled by the Defence Council which mostly consisted of Amin's inner circle. As the President was illterate, he issued orders to officers personally or via telephone.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=11}}\n\n=== Factionalism and ethnicity ===\nThe Uganda Army was highly factionalised under Idi Amin's rule, with different groups and people rising and then falling from power. In general, tribal identities were of great importance to determine a soldier's standing,{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} though this was a complex issue. Amin's regime actually wanted to reduce the ethnic and religious lines of division in the country which would have helped to keep its rule stable.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=91}} The President himself was known for his repeated criticism of tribalism, and pledged to combat it.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=142}}{{sfn|Hansen|2013|pp=88\u201389, 91}} A few of his appointments of officers did reflect this intention to defuse ethnic tensions.<ref name=lubega2/> At the same time, Amin's government mostly \"acted within ethnic categories\"{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=91}} and ultimately fueled ethnic favoritism. This paradox resulted from the regime's most important concern, namely to ensure its survival. Certain ethnic groups were judged to be simply more loyal than others due to familial and economic circumstances. As result, they were empowered, but this increased factionalism and in turn led to more strife, necessitating even more reliance on trusted elements. Amin's government was never able to solve this problem, and many of its initiatives were driven by the anxiety of losing control.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=91}} In addition, ethnic affiliation and tribalism were problematic issues in Uganda.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} This was due to Ugandan \"tribes\" being often ill-defined and changeable, as no firm tribal structures existed among many West Nile peoples,{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}} while intermarriage also occurred.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=142}} Amin himself was of mixed ethnic origin.{{efn|His father was a Kakwa and his mother a Lugbara.<ref name=Keatley/> Regardless, some sources also describe him as being of mixed Kakwa-Nubian origin.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=85}} }} In fact, the Nubians were \"an extremely fluid category\"{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} and Amin himself stated that members of different tribes could become Nubians.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}}{{efn|The Nubians are often portrayed as descendants of [[Emin Pasha]]'s mostly Muslim soldiers who fled to Uganda after being defeated by [[Mahdist State|Mahdist Sudanese forces]] in the 1880s. Regarded as martial people, they were consequently recruited into British colonial units; as a result, West Nile people who wanted to join the military often claimed to be Nubians. This led to the paradoxical situation that the Nubians were both \"detribalised\" yet had also a distinct identity intimately linked to the West Nile region, to Islam, and to military service.{{sfn|Leopold|2005|p=60}}{{sfn|Hansen|1977|pp=79\u201380}} }}\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote=Tribalism is the biggest enemy in Africa today.

Tribes are here to stay.|source=\u2014President [[Idi Amin]]{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=142}} }}\nBesides ethnicity and security concerns, favoritism in the military was also determined by the political relations of the Ugandan government. When Amin began to forge strong links with various Muslim Arab powers, religion grew in importance and Muslims became more favored in the Uganda Army. As result, members of traditionally favored tribes who identified as Christians became marginalized, resulting in strife. In the end, Amin could not even rely on members of his own tribe, the Kakwa, to always stay loyal. Most prominently, Charles Arube was a Kakwa{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=233}} yet attempted a coup when he was marginalized by another officer, Hussein Malera.<ref name=\"arube\"/> Overall, ethnicity was less important than personal connections in Amin's military. Fort example, one of the President's most important security agencies was led by a Lango by 1976.{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=312}} Some ranking officers who were Christian or did not belong to the favored tribes also remained in the Uganda Army up until Amin's regime collapsed.<ref name=lubega2/> Overall, the military remained a diverse force whose troops had a wide variety of backgrounds and accordingly different views on the character of their service. A large number continued to regard themselves as \"career military professionals\".<ref name=Bruce-Lockhart/>\n\nAs result of all these factors, the factions in the military and its ethnic makeup changed significantly in course of Amin's presidency. After the 1971 coup, Amin initially preferred to recruit and promote Kakwa, Nubians, Madi, Lugbara, and Alur,<ref name= Kironde/>{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|pp=111\u2013112}} while members of other ethnic groups were gradually removed from the Uganda Army, as they were suspected of being disloyal.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=6}} By 1973, about 35\u201350% of the military was made up of West Nile tribesmen;{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=108}} almost half of these were Lugbara.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=115}} As result of repeated coup attempts and other factors, the Lugbara, Madi, and Alur also came under suspicion and were partially purged by 1973,{{sfn|Hansen|2013|pp=96\u201397}} leaving just the Kakwa and Nubians as core faction of the Uganda Army.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|pp=97\u201398}} At the same time, the growing number of Nubian soldiers also resulted from the blurring lines of tribal identities in the West Nile. Muslim and Kakwa troops were increasingly regarded as Nubians regardless of ethnic origin.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|pp=108\u2013110}} By 1973, the Nubians constituted about 25\u201330% of the army.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=108}} Despite the repeated purges, however, many Madi, Lugbara, and Alur soldiers remained in the army, though their influence was greatly reduced.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=117}}\n\nEven the Nubians and Kakwa remained a potential threat, so that Amin increasingly opted to rely on foreigners to keep the military loyal to his regime.{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}} The Uganda Army's foreign members were recruited from various neighboring countries, most importantly Sudan and Zaire. They were \"lifted above both the ethnic pattern and religious affiliation\".{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=97}} These troops were often ex-members of rebel groups with whom Amin had forged good relations{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=234}} such as the Anyanya from southern Sudan.{{sfn|Kasozi|1994|p=111}}<ref name= Kironde/> They acted as ''de facto'' mercenaries.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|pp=233\u2013234}}{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=110}} According to researcher Holger Bernt Hansen, the mercenary role of the Sudanese recruits was especially evident as the Anyanya rebels had fought against Islamization in their home areas, yet supported Amin's regime that favored Muslims.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=110}} Amin believed the foreigners to be more dependent and therefore more loyal than most native Ugandans.{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}}{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=97}} By 1973, about 20\u201325% of the Uganda Army were foreigners, most being ex-Anyanya.{{sfn|Hansen|1977|p=108}} Researcher Paul Nugent estimated that as much as three quarters of the military eventually consisted of foreigners.{{sfn|Nugent|2012|p=234}} Even though the foreigners often claimed membership in the same tribes to which the native Ugandan troops belonged,<ref name=\"arube\"/>{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}}{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=94}} the latter saw them as outsiders and often held them in low regard.<ref name=\"arube\"/>{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}} For example, Ugandan Nubians in [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]], [[Kitgum, Uganda|Kitgum]], and [[Gulu]] resented the foreign Nubians as ruthless mercenaries.{{sfn|Otunnu|2016|p=311}} Accordingly, the foreigners were \"seen as an instrument to neutralize the predominance of the ethnic factor\" by Amin, though ultimately they did not ease ethnic tensions.{{sfn|Hansen|2013|p=97}} Instead, rivaleries developed between the foreign and native troops of the Uganda Army.{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=1}}\n\n=== Military justice ===\nA system of courts and [[military justice]] was established by the Armed Forces Act of 1964. Further broad guarantees of the [[right to a fair trial]] were assured by Uganda's succession of constitutions in the 1960s. Tribunals convened by Amin during his rule frequently ignored constitutional and legal prescriptions. Most men called to serve on the panels were selected on the basis of their loyalty to the President and their willingness to convict political opponents of the regime; many were illiterate and had no understanding of Ugandan law. Defendants were often presumed to be [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] at the start of proceedings and were usually denied legal counsel. Most persons found guilty of an offence by a military tribunal were executed via firing squad.{{sfn|Naluwairo|2018|p=66}} Many cases were prosecuted in secret and in some instances without the knowledge of the accused party.{{sfn|Human Rights Violations|1978|p=4}} Though upon taking power Amin declared that he would subject soldiers accused of offences to tribunals, in practice many were killed without any legal process.{{sfn|Uganda under Military Rule|1973|p=14}}\n\nIn 1973 Amin issued a decree expanding the reach of military tribunals to include the trial of civilians accused of committing capital offences. He also empowered himself to convene such tribunals for civilians believed to have been acting in a fashion to bring the government or army into disrepute.{{sfn|Naluwairo|2018|p=67}} The President further expanded their jurisdiction into non-civilian matters with another decree in 1975.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.monitor.co.ug/Magazines/PeoplePower/12-executed-as-Amin-introduces-trial-civilians-military-courts/689844-5131640-onaekdz/index.html| title = 12 executed as Amin introduces trial of civilians in military| last = Mugabe| first = Faustin| date = 26 May 2019| website = Daily Monitor| access-date = 3 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Strength ===\nThe strength of the Uganda Army is not known for certain during the 1971\u20131979 period.

Therefore, Thomson's partner [[Maurice Grosser]] devised a scenario to facilitate staging the opera. Though Grosser stated that other scenarios were equally possible, his scenario is published in the printed score; this synopsis is based on it.\n\n===Act 1===\n\n''Scene 1''. Susan B. Anthony and her devoted companion Anne are shown at home. Anne is knitting; Susan B. is pasting clippings into a scrapbook. Gertrude S. and Virgil T. also appear as narrators.\n\n''Scene 2''. A political meeting takes place, at which Webster, Johnson, Adams, Grant, Comstock, and Stevens are all present. Jo the Loiterer and Chris the Citizen also appear, mocking the politicians' solemnity.  Susan B. introduces herself to the assembly, and she and Daniel Webster debate.\n\n''Scene 3''. A public square in front of Susan B. Anthony's house. Thaddeus Stevens argues with Andrew Johnson; there is a flowery love scene between John Adams and Constance Fletcher. Jenny Reefer begins waltzing with Herman Atlan, and everyone joins in the dance.\n\n''Scene 4''. Susan B. Anthony meditates on the difficulties of her mission.\n\n''Scene 5''. Jo the Loiterer and Indiana Elliot are to be married. As the wedding party gathers, various episodes unfold. John Adams courts Constance Fletcher, Daniel Webster (who is to perform the ceremony) addresses Angel More in sentimental language. Indiana's brother bursts in, wishing to prevent the marriage, and Susan B. explains what marriage means to women.  General Grant calls for order, and Jo teases him for his pomposity. It seems that the wedding is all but forgotten, but finally Daniel Webster blesses the couple and Susan B. foretells that all of their children, men and women, will have the vote.\n\n===Act 2===\n\n''Scene 1''. Susan B.'s home. Susan B. is doing housework when she learns that she will be asked to address a political meeting. Jo the Loiterer complains that Indiana Elliot refuses to take his last name. When Susan B. is invited to speak, she declines, then agrees, hesitates again, but finally goes off to the meeting.\n\n''Scene 2''. The meeting has taken place and Susan B. returns home triumphantly. She has spoken so convincingly that the politicians, now afraid of the women's suffrage movement, have written the word \"male\" into the Constitution in order to make it impossible for women to vote. \nIndiana Elliot has decided to take Jo's last name, and he will take hers; they will become Jo Elliot and Indiana Loiterer. Everyone congratulates Susan B. for her leadership.\n\n''Scene 3 (Epilogue)''. Some years later, a statue of Susan B. Anthony is to be unveiled at the  U. S. Capitol. The characters gather for the ceremony, with Anne as guest of honor. Susan B. enters as a ghost, though Anne does not see her. Constance Fletcher appears, now almost blind. Other characters talk about women's suffrage, or burst in tipsily. The ceremony threatens to get out of hand. Suddenly, Virgil T. unveils the statue. The women lay wreaths at the base of the pedestal. All slowly depart. Alone, Susan B. Anthony (as the statue) sings of the struggles and lessons of her long life.\n\n==Recordings==\n*'''[[Virgil Thomson]]:''' '''''The Mother of Us All'''''  &ndash; [[Mignon Dunn]], [[Philip Booth (bass)|Philip Booth]], Karen Beck, Sondra Stowe, Jimmie Lu Null, [[William Lewis (tenor)|William Lewis]], Steven Loewengart, Thomas Parker, Marla McDaniels, D'Artagnan Petty, Stephen Bryant, Ashley Putnam, et al.; Conductor: [[Raymond Leppard]]; [[Santa Fe Opera]] Orchestra and Chorus.

Though Grosser stated that other scenarios were equally possible, his scenario is published in the printed score; this synopsis is based on it.\n\n===Act 1===\n\n''Scene 1''. Susan B. Anthony and her devoted companion Anne are shown at home. Anne is knitting; Susan B. is pasting clippings into a scrapbook. Gertrude S. and Virgil T. also appear as narrators.\n\n''Scene 2''. A political meeting takes place, at which Webster, Johnson, Adams, Grant, Comstock, and Stevens are all present. Jo the Loiterer and Chris the Citizen also appear, mocking the politicians' solemnity.  Susan B. introduces herself to the assembly, and she and Daniel Webster debate.\n\n''Scene 3''. A public square in front of Susan B. Anthony's house. Thaddeus Stevens argues with Andrew Johnson; there is a flowery love scene between John Adams and Constance Fletcher. Jenny Reefer begins waltzing with Herman Atlan, and everyone joins in the dance.\n\n''Scene 4''. Susan B. Anthony meditates on the difficulties of her mission.\n\n''Scene 5''. Jo the Loiterer and Indiana Elliot are to be married. As the wedding party gathers, various episodes unfold. John Adams courts Constance Fletcher, Daniel Webster (who is to perform the ceremony) addresses Angel More in sentimental language. Indiana's brother bursts in, wishing to prevent the marriage, and Susan B. explains what marriage means to women.  General Grant calls for order, and Jo teases him for his pomposity. It seems that the wedding is all but forgotten, but finally Daniel Webster blesses the couple and Susan B. foretells that all of their children, men and women, will have the vote.\n\n===Act 2===\n\n''Scene 1''. Susan B.'s home. Susan B. is doing housework when she learns that she will be asked to address a political meeting. Jo the Loiterer complains that Indiana Elliot refuses to take his last name. When Susan B. is invited to speak, she declines, then agrees, hesitates again, but finally goes off to the meeting.\n\n''Scene 2''. The meeting has taken place and Susan B. returns home triumphantly. She has spoken so convincingly that the politicians, now afraid of the women's suffrage movement, have written the word \"male\" into the Constitution in order to make it impossible for women to vote. \nIndiana Elliot has decided to take Jo's last name, and he will take hers; they will become Jo Elliot and Indiana Loiterer. Everyone congratulates Susan B. for her leadership.\n\n''Scene 3 (Epilogue)''. Some years later, a statue of Susan B. Anthony is to be unveiled at the  U. S. Capitol. The characters gather for the ceremony, with Anne as guest of honor. Susan B. enters as a ghost, though Anne does not see her. Constance Fletcher appears, now almost blind. Other characters talk about women's suffrage, or burst in tipsily. The ceremony threatens to get out of hand. Suddenly, Virgil T. unveils the statue. The women lay wreaths at the base of the pedestal. All slowly depart. Alone, Susan B. Anthony (as the statue) sings of the struggles and lessons of her long life.\n\n==Recordings==\n*'''[[Virgil Thomson]]:''' '''''The Mother of Us All'''''  &ndash; [[Mignon Dunn]], [[Philip Booth (bass)|Philip Booth]], Karen Beck, Sondra Stowe, Jimmie Lu Null, [[William Lewis (tenor)|William Lewis]], Steven Loewengart, Thomas Parker, Marla McDaniels, D'Artagnan Petty, Stephen Bryant, Ashley Putnam, et al.; Conductor: [[Raymond Leppard]]; [[Santa Fe Opera]] Orchestra and Chorus.

They were produced by a group of amateur animators known as Daicon Film, who would later go on to form the animation studio [[Gainax]]. The films are known for their unusually high production values for amateur works and for including numerous references to [[otaku]] culture, as well as its unauthorized appropriations of both the [[Playboy Bunny]] costume and the 1981 song \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\" by the English [[rock music|rock]] band [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]].\n\n''Daicon III'' was made by [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Hiroyuki Yamaga]] and [[Takami Akai]] and ''Daicon IV'' credits twelve people, including Yamaga as the director and Anno and Akai as animation supervisors. Despite the questionable legal status of the works, the production of ''Daicon III'' resulted in debts that were repaid by selling video tapes and 8mm reels of the production, the profits of which went to the production of ''Daicon IV''. In 2001, the anime magazine ''[[Animage]]'' ranked the ''Daicon'' animations as the 35th of the \"Top 100\" anime of all time.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===''Daicon III Opening Animation''===\nThe Jet VTOL ship from ''[[Ultraman]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Science Patrol descends out of the sky toward Earth, as a school girl, carrying her ''[[randoseru]]'', observes from behind a tree. The Science Patrol offer the girl a cup of water and ask her to deliver it to \"DAICON\". The girl salutes and races away, but she quickly experiences trouble as ''Punk Dragon'' blocks her path. He summons a [[mecha]] from ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and it and the girl begin battling. The girl tosses the mecha aside and [[Gomora (Ultra monster)|Gomora]] rises from the earth. Using a booster concealed in her backpack, the girl flies up into the sky and evades Gomora's blast, with the mecha flying after her. They continue their battle in mid-air. A blow from the mecha sends the girl falling, imperiling her cup of water. At the last moment, she has a vision of the Science Patrol and regains consciousness. She snatches the cup before it crashes to the ground. Resuming her battle with the mecha, she catches one of its missiles and hurls it back at the mecha, causing a huge explosion. The destroyed mecha launches a rocket, summoning [[Godzilla]] with the [[Space Runaway Ideon|Ideon]] symbol. With [[King Ghidorah]] and [[Gamera]] chasing her, the girl flies through the air with her jet-propelled backpack. A [[Star Destroyer]], a [[TIE fighter]], and [[Fighting machine (The War of the Worlds)|Martian fighting machines]] from the film ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953) cross the background. Reaching into her backpack, the girl pulls out a bamboo ruler, which magically becomes a [[lightsaber]]. After slicing an [[Alien Baltan]] in half, the girl launches a number of miniature missiles from her backpack. Hit by one of the missiles, a Maser Tank from [[Godzilla (franchise)|the ''Godzilla'' series]] catches fire. The ''[[Atragon]]'' breaks in two as the ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'', the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS Enterprise]]'', an [[X-wing fighter]] and [[Daimajin]] explode in complete chaos. The girl pours her cup of water on a shriveled [[daikon]] buried in the ground. As the daikon absorbs the water, it turns into the spaceship ''Daicon''. Bathed in light, and now wearing a naval uniform, the girl boards the ship, where the film's producers, [[Toshio Okada]] and [[Yasuhiro Takeda]], sit at the controls. As the landing gear retracts, ''Daicon'' departs for the far reaches of the universe.\n\n===''Daicon IV Opening Animation''===\nThe ''Daicon IV Opening Animation'' begins with an abridged, 90-second retelling of the ''Daicon III Opening Animation'' set to \"Noah's Ark\" by [[Kitar\u014d]] from the album, ''Silver Cloud''.{{Not in citation|date=April 2018}} After this, \"Prologue\" by [[Electric Light Orchestra]] is heard, while the lyrics appear against a starfield and an outline of the spaceship ''Daicon'' passes in the background. The film proper begins as \"Prologue\" segues into \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\", the song which follows it on the album ''[[Time (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Time]]''.<ref name=LittleB/>\n\nThe girl from the previous animation is now an adult, wearing a [[Playboy bunny|bunny costume]]. She fights off a multitude of sci-fi monsters{{ref label|fight|a|}} and [[Gundam|mobile suits]] then jumps into a throng of Metron Seijin and tosses them aside.{{ref label|aside|b|}} She is then in a lightsaber duel with [[Darth Vader]], with [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]] sitting in the background and the [[Death Star]] enshrined in one corner. From atop a cliff, a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] with artificial legs, wielding the [[Discovery One]], knocks the girl down with an energy burst and the [[Dynaman]] robot (Dyna Robo) attempts to crush her. The girl lifts Dyna Robo off her with superhuman strength and smashes it against a cliff. The [[Stormbringer]] suddenly appears in the sky, and the girl jumps on it, riding it like a surfboard. A few scenes unconnected to the main plot are shown, such as [[Yoda]] as ''Y\u016b Ida'' given a Japanese comedy routine with various characters in the audience.{{ref label|audience|c|}} The girl is still riding the Stormbringer when she runs into a formation of Ultrahawk 1's. Then the ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'', the ''[[Arcadia of My Youth|Arcadia]]'' attached to the transformed [[SDF-1 Macross]] appear, along with an exploding [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] [[variable fighter]] from ''[[Macross]]'' armed with a [[Mobile Suit Gundam|''Gundam'']]-style beam saber. An air battle unfolds in an ''otaku'' coffee shop. The girl is then seen in a world filled with American comic superheroes.{{ref label|superheroes|d|}} A host of machines and characters (from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]]'', ''[[Dragonriders of Pern|Pern]]'', and others) fly past her into space, including a [[Klingon]] battle cruiser, the moon ship from [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[First Men in the Moon]]'', the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', ''[[The White Dragon (novel)|Lord Jaxom]]'' and the [[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]].{{ref label|space|e|}} Once back on land, the girl jumps off the Stormbringer and it splits into seven parts, which fly though the sky spewing smoke in seven colors. A sequence of famous spaceships crashing into each other is shown.<!----At the foot of [[Mt.

After watching the film, Tezuka remarked \"Well, there certainly were a lot of characters in the film.&nbsp;... [T]here were also some that weren't in the film\". Akai and Yamaga later realized the omission of Tezuka's characters; they were subsequently used in the ''Daicon IV'' animation.<ref name=nm />{{rp|54}} According to Toshio Okada, the theme of water in the opening represented \"opportunity\" and Lawrence Eng, an [[otaku]] researcher, describes the theme as, \"...&nbsp;making the best use of one's opportunities while fighting against those who would seek to steal such opportunity away.\"<ref name=\"ta\" />\n\n===''Daicon IV''===\nThe production facility for ''Daicon IV'' was in a dedicated studio in a building called the ''Hosei Kaikan'' that was owned by a textile union.<ref name=nm />{{rp|80}} Takeda defined it as a literal anime sweatshop, the building was shutdown at 9:00 pm and a majority of the staff would be locked inside and working through the night without air conditioning.<ref name=nm />{{rp|81}} The ''Daicon IV'' film officially credits a production crew of twelve people.

They were produced by a group of amateur animators known as Daicon Film, who would later go on to form the animation studio [[Gainax]]. The films are known for their unusually high production values for amateur works and for including numerous references to [[otaku]] culture, as well as its unauthorized appropriations of both the [[Playboy Bunny]] costume and the 1981 song \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\" by the English [[rock music|rock]] band [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]].\n\n''Daicon III'' was made by [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Hiroyuki Yamaga]] and [[Takami Akai]] and ''Daicon IV'' credits twelve people, including Yamaga as the director and Anno and Akai as animation supervisors. Despite the questionable legal status of the works, the production of ''Daicon III'' resulted in debts that were repaid by selling video tapes and 8mm reels of the production, the profits of which went to the production of ''Daicon IV''. In 2001, the anime magazine ''[[Animage]]'' ranked the ''Daicon'' animations as the 35th of the \"Top 100\" anime of all time.\n\n==Summary==\n\n===''Daicon III Opening Animation''===\nThe Jet VTOL ship from ''[[Ultraman]]''<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Science Patrol descends out of the sky toward Earth, as a school girl, carrying her ''[[randoseru]]'', observes from behind a tree. The Science Patrol offer the girl a cup of water and ask her to deliver it to \"DAICON\". The girl salutes and races away, but she quickly experiences trouble as ''Punk Dragon'' blocks her path. He summons a [[mecha]] from ''[[Starship Troopers]]'', and it and the girl begin battling. The girl tosses the mecha aside and [[Gomora (Ultra monster)|Gomora]] rises from the earth. Using a booster concealed in her backpack, the girl flies up into the sky and evades Gomora's blast, with the mecha flying after her. They continue their battle in mid-air. A blow from the mecha sends the girl falling, imperiling her cup of water. At the last moment, she has a vision of the Science Patrol and regains consciousness. She snatches the cup before it crashes to the ground. Resuming her battle with the mecha, she catches one of its missiles and hurls it back at the mecha, causing a huge explosion. The destroyed mecha launches a rocket, summoning [[Godzilla]] with the [[Space Runaway Ideon|Ideon]] symbol. With [[King Ghidorah]] and [[Gamera]] chasing her, the girl flies through the air with her jet-propelled backpack. A [[Star Destroyer]], a [[TIE fighter]], and Martian fighting machines from the film ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953) cross the background. Reaching into her backpack, the girl pulls out a bamboo ruler, which magically becomes a [[lightsaber]]. After slicing an [[Alien Baltan]] in half, the girl launches a number of miniature missiles from her backpack. Hit by one of the missiles, a Maser Tank from [[Godzilla (franchise)|the ''Godzilla'' series]] catches fire. The ''[[Atragon]]'' breaks in two as the ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'', the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS Enterprise]]'', an [[X-wing fighter]] and [[Daimajin]] explode in complete chaos. The girl pours her cup of water on a shriveled [[daikon]] buried in the ground. As the daikon absorbs the water, it turns into the spaceship ''Daicon''. Bathed in light, and now wearing a naval uniform, the girl boards the ship, where the film's producers, [[Toshio Okada]] and [[Yasuhiro Takeda]], sit at the controls. As the landing gear retracts, ''Daicon'' departs for the far reaches of the universe.\n\n===''Daicon IV Opening Animation''===\nThe ''Daicon IV Opening Animation'' begins with an abridged, 90-second retelling of the ''Daicon III Opening Animation'' set to \"Noah's Ark\" by [[Kitar\u014d]] from the album, ''Silver Cloud''.{{Not in citation|date=April 2018}} After this, \"Prologue\" by [[Electric Light Orchestra]] is heard, while the lyrics appear against a starfield and an outline of the spaceship ''Daicon'' passes in the background. The film proper begins as \"Prologue\" segues into \"[[Twilight (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Twilight]]\", the song which follows it on the album ''[[Time (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Time]]''.<ref name=LittleB/>\n\nThe girl from the previous animation is now an adult, wearing a [[Playboy bunny|bunny costume]]. She fights off a multitude of sci-fi monsters{{ref label|fight|a|}} and [[Gundam|mobile suits]] then jumps into a throng of Metron Seijin and tosses them aside.{{ref label|aside|b|}} She is then in a lightsaber duel with [[Darth Vader]], with [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|Stormtroopers]] sitting in the background and the [[Death Star]] enshrined in one corner. From atop a cliff, a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|xenomorph]] with artificial legs, wielding the [[Discovery One]], knocks the girl down with an energy burst and the [[Dynaman]] robot (Dyna Robo) attempts to crush her. The girl lifts Dyna Robo off her with superhuman strength and smashes it against a cliff. The [[Stormbringer]] suddenly appears in the sky, and the girl jumps on it, riding it like a surfboard. A few scenes unconnected to the main plot are shown, such as [[Yoda]] as ''Y\u016b Ida'' given a Japanese comedy routine with various characters in the audience.{{ref label|audience|c|}} The girl is still riding the Stormbringer when she runs into a formation of Ultrahawk 1's. Then the ''[[Space Battleship Yamato (fictional spacecraft)|Yamato]]'', the ''[[Arcadia of My Youth|Arcadia]]'' attached to the transformed [[SDF-1 Macross]] appear, along with an exploding [[VF-1 Valkyrie]] [[variable fighter]] from ''[[Macross]]'' armed with a [[Mobile Suit Gundam|''Gundam'']]-style beam saber. An air battle unfolds in an ''otaku'' coffee shop. The girl is then seen in a world filled with American comic superheroes.{{ref label|superheroes|d|}} A host of machines and characters (from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Conan the Barbarian (comics)|Conan]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]]'', ''[[Dragonriders of Pern|Pern]]'', and others) fly past her into space, including a [[Klingon]] battle cruiser, the moon ship from [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[First Men in the Moon]]'', the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', ''[[The White Dragon (novel)|Lord Jaxom]]'' and the [[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]].{{ref label|space|e|}} Once back on land, the girl jumps off the Stormbringer and it splits into seven parts, which fly though the sky spewing smoke in seven colors. A sequence of famous spaceships crashing into each other is shown.<!----At the foot of [[Mt.
