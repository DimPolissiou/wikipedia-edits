The mill was powered by the water of the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]], using [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]]. It could be said that the company was doomed from the start. Needham, in particular, had sunk most of his assets into the venture. The valley was particularly isolated and transport for the raw material and finished goods was poor. Moreover, they had difficulty in attracting a workforce.\n\nThe early spinners, such as [[Richard Arkwright|Arkwright]] and  [[Jedediah Strutt|Strutt]], had been able to attract the families of [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] and [[Stocking frame|framework knitters]], so-called \"free labour\" meaning the employees were not indentured. Meanwhile, Evans at [[Darley Abbey]] could draw on a pool of labour from the town of [[Derby]]. In contrast, the area around Litton was sparsely populated by farming people who were scornful of the new cotton industry.\n\nBy 1786 the, barely profitable, mill was put up for sale. There were no buyers and Needham and Frith struggled on. Needham's money had gone and he was farming on rented land, while Frith left the partnership in 1799.\n\nThe [[Poor Law]] Act of 1601 had, among its provisions \"the putting out of children to be apprentices\". An agreement was made between the churchwarden and an employer, by means of an [[indenture]] sworn before a [[Justice of the Peace]], that the latter would provide for and give employment and training  to a pauper child. Often this worked for the benefit of the child but often it was seen by employers as a source of cheap labour and a way for a parish to relieve itself of responsibility. In the absence of any local labour, this was the course taken by Needham and Frith.\n\nIn the early 19th century there was a general depression in the industry, and the workforce was reduced by a half. There was a serious fire, and in 1811 the waterwheel broke and was out of action for a month. By 1815, Needham was bankrupt and had been given notice to quit. By 1828 he was a pauper. Frith fared somewhat better on his farm, and operating a small spinning mill near [[Tideswell]].\n\nThe mill was operated for a time by the Newtons of [[Cressbrook|Cressbrook Mill]]  but was destroyed by another fire in 1874. Very little remains of the original mill. Its replacement manufactures [[nylon]] yarn for [[hosiery]].\n\nIn 1893 Mr Matthew Dickie, a former [[Stockport]] mill owner, bought Litton Mill. Dickie began his business career as a spinner and manufacturer with his father Matthew Dickie Senior. When he took over Litton Mill he brought with him several families from Stockport. He set up a Litton & Cressbrook Mills Company and Cressbrook Mill was taken over.

The mill was powered by the water of the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]], using [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]]. It could be said that the company was doomed from the start. Needham, in particular, had sunk most of his assets into the venture. The valley was particularly isolated and transport for the raw material and finished goods was poor. Moreover, they had difficulty in attracting a workforce.\n\nThe early spinners, such as [[Richard Arkwright|Arkwright]] and  [[Jedediah Strutt|Strutt]], had been able to attract the families of [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] and [[Stocking frame|framework knitters]], so-called \"free labour\" meaning the employees were not indentured. Meanwhile, Evans at [[Darley Abbey]] could draw on a pool of labour from the town of [[Derby]]. In contrast, the area around Litton was sparsely populated by farming people who were scornful of the new cotton industry.\n\nBy 1786 the, barely profitable, mill was put up for sale. There were no buyers and Needham and Frith struggled on. Needham's money had gone and he was farming on rented land, while Frith left the partnership in 1799.\n\nThe [[Poor Law]] Act of 1601 had, among its provisions \"the putting out of children to be apprentices\". An agreement was made between the churchwarden and an employer, by means of an [[indenture]] sworn before a [[Justice of the Peace]], that the latter would provide for and give employment and training  to a pauper child. Often this worked for the benefit of the child but often it was seen by employers as a source of cheap labour and a way for a parish to relieve itself of responsibility. In the absence of any local labour, this was the course taken by Needham and Frith.\n\nIn the early 19th century there was a general depression in the industry, and the workforce was reduced by a half. There was a serious fire, and in 1811 the waterwheel broke and was out of action for a month. By 1815, Needham was bankrupt and had been given notice to quit. By 1828 he was a pauper. Frith fared somewhat better on his farm, and operating a small spinning mill near [[Tideswell]].\n\nThe mill was operated for a time by the Newtons of [[Cressbrook|Cressbrook Mill]]  but was destroyed by another fire in 1874. Very little remains of the original mill. Its replacement manufactures [[nylon]] yarn for [[hosiery]].\n\nIn 1893 Mr Matthew Dickie, a former [[Stockport]] mill owner, bought Litton Mill. Dickie began his business career as a spinner and manufacturer with his father Matthew Dickie Senior. When he took over Litton Mill he brought with him several families from Stockport. He set up a Litton & Cressbrook Mills Company and Cressbrook Mill was taken over. To bring the two mills into closer touch, a road was made along the river by the Company and a toll in aid of local hospitals was charged for visitors who wished to use the road. This shortened the distance to Monsal Dale. Litton Mill was sold to a syndicate in 1934.\n\nMatthew Dickie had Ravenstor built in Miller's Dale as his family residence which was given to the National Trust in 1937 by Alderman J.G.Graves of Sheffield along with {{convert|64|acre|m2}} of land, which included a one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) stretch of the River Wye and Tideswell Dale, all of which are leased to the Youth Hostel Association and open all year round.\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Litton Mill}}\n*Cooper, B., (1983) ''Transformation of a Valley: The Derbyshire Derwent'' Heinemann, republished 1991 Cromford: Scarthin Books\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/childreno1.htm|title=Cotton Times: Child Labour|accessdate=2009-03-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430143222/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/childreno1.htm|archivedate=2009-04-30}}\n*{{cite book|last=Brown|first=John|title=Memoir of Robert Blincoe|editor=James R.

However, the cell must be able to differentiate between the template strand and the newly synthesized strand.

MutH binds hemimethylated GATC sites and when activated will selectively cleave the unmethylated daughter strand, allowing [[helicase]] and exonucleases to excise the nascent strand in the region surrounding the mismatch.<ref name=\"Barras\"/><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = L\u00f8bner-Olesen A, Skovgaard O, Marinus MG | title = Dam methylation: coordinating cellular processes | journal = Curr.

Part of this can be explained by the slow hydrolysis of ATP by DnaA, a protein that binds to repeats in the oriC to initiate replication.  Dam methylase also plays a role because the oriC has 11 5'-GATC-3' sequences (in ''E. coli'').  Immediately after DNA replication, the oriC is hemimethylated and sequestered for a period of time.  Only after this, the oriC is released and must be fully methylated by Dam methylase before DnaA binding occurs.\n\n==Role in regulation of protein expression==\n\nDam also plays a role in the promotion and repression of [[RNA transcription]]. In ''[[E. coli]]'' downstream GATC sequences are [[methylated]], promoting transcription. For example, [[pyelonephritis]]-associated [[pilus|pili]] (PAP) [[phase variation]] in [[uropathogenic]] ''E. coli'' is controlled by Dam through the methylation of the two GATC sites proximal and distal to the PAP [[promoter (biology)|promoter]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Casades\u00fas J, Low D  | title = Epigenetic gene regulation in the bacterial world | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 830\u2013856 |date=September 2006 | pmid = 16959970| doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00016-06 | url = | issn = | pmc=1594586}}</ref> Given its role of protein regulation in ''E. coli'', the Dam methylase gene is nonessential as a knockout of the gene still leaves the bacteria viable.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bale|first=Allen|last2=d'Alarcao|first2=Marc|last3=Marinus|first3=M.G.|title=Characterization of DNA adenine methylation mutants of Escherichia coli K12|journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis|volume=59|issue=2|pages=157\u2013165|doi=10.1016/0027-5107(79)90153-2|year=1979}}</ref> The retainment of viability despite a ''dam'' gene knockout is also seen in [[Salmonella]] and [[Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Brad|last2=Low|first2=David|date=2000-02-01|title=DNA methylation-dependent regulation of Pef expression in Salmonella typhimurium|journal=Molecular Microbiology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=728\u2013742|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01743.x|issn=1365-2958}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=H.|last2=Lippmann|first2=J.

Part of this can be explained by the slow hydrolysis of ATP by DnaA, a protein that binds to repeats in the oriC to initiate replication.  Dam methylase also plays a role because the oriC has 11 5'-GATC-3' sequences (in ''E. coli'').  Immediately after DNA replication, the oriC is hemimethylated and sequestered for a period of time.  Only after this, the oriC is released and must be fully methylated by Dam methylase before DnaA binding occurs.\n\n==Role in regulation of protein expression==\n\nDam also plays a role in the promotion and repression of [[RNA transcription]]. In ''[[E. coli]]'' downstream GATC sequences are [[methylated]], promoting transcription. For example, [[pyelonephritis]]-associated [[pilus|pili]] (PAP) [[phase variation]] in [[uropathogenic]] ''E. coli'' is controlled by Dam through the methylation of the two GATC sites proximal and distal to the PAP [[promoter (biology)|promoter]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Casades\u00fas J, Low D  | title = Epigenetic gene regulation in the bacterial world | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 70 | issue = 3 | pages = 830\u2013856 |date=September 2006 | pmid = 16959970| doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00016-06 | url = | issn = | pmc=1594586}}</ref> Given its role of protein regulation in ''E. coli'', the Dam methylase gene is nonessential as a knockout of the gene still leaves the bacteria viable.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bale|first=Allen|last2=d'Alarcao|first2=Marc|last3=Marinus|first3=M.G.|title=Characterization of DNA adenine methylation mutants of Escherichia coli K12|journal=Mutation Research/Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms of Mutagenesis|volume=59|issue=2|pages=157\u2013165|doi=10.1016/0027-5107(79)90153-2|year=1979}}</ref> The retainment of viability despite a ''dam'' gene knockout is also seen in [[Salmonella]] and [[Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=Brad|last2=Low|first2=David|date=2000-02-01|title=DNA methylation-dependent regulation of Pef expression in Salmonella typhimurium|journal=Molecular Microbiology|language=en|volume=35|issue=4|pages=728\u2013742|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01743.x|issn=1365-2958}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=H.|last2=Lippmann|first2=J.

It comprises [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]], [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]], and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] counties.\n\nThe diocese is led by an [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]] [[bishop]]; the bishop's [[cathedra]] is located at the [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]], the [[mother church]] of the diocese, in [[Monterey, California]]. The diocese serves close to 200,000 Catholics in 46 parishes and 18 schools.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the Catholic Church in Monterey began with the establishment on the shores of [[Monterey Bay]] of [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo]] in 1770 by Saint [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. Father Serra moved the mission to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] the next year, which served as the headquarters of the chain of [[Spanish missions in California]].\n\nWith the [[papal bull]] ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem'' of 27 April 1840, Pope [[Gregory XVI]] set up a new [[episcopal see]], to which he gave the name of '''[[California (titular see)|Diocese of California]]'''. He assigned to it a vast territory taken from that of the [[Diocese of Sonora]], now the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Archdiocese of Hermosillo]] in Mexico. It included [[Alta California]] (corresponding to the present-day states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], western [[Colorado]] and southwestern [[Wyoming]]) and the [[Baja California Territory]] (the modern Mexican states of [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]). He set the episcopal residence at [[San Diego]] and made the diocese a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Mexico City]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/iurispontificii01martgoog#page/n6/mode/1up The Papal Bull ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem''], in Raffaele de Martinis, ''Iuris pontificii de propaganda fide. Pars prima'', Tomus V, Romae 1890, pp. 233\u2013235]</ref>\n\nThe first bishop of the diocese was [[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. [[Mission Santa Barbara]] served as the [[pro-cathedral]].\n\nIn 1848 Alta California was ceded to the [[United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and the government of [[Mexico]] objected to a United States-based bishop having jurisdiction over parishes in Mexican Baja California. The [[Holy See]] divided the diocese into American and Mexican sections and, on 20 November 1849, with the episcopal residence moved to Monterey, a more central position for the new diocese, the American section became the Diocese of Monterey. The [[Royal Presidio Chapel]] in Monterey served as the pro-cathedral of the American diocese. In 1853 the diocese was split again, when [[Pope Pius IX]] created the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]], and Monterey was transferred to be a suffragan of the new [[archdiocese]].\n\nIn 1859, the diocese's name was changed to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles|Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles]], due to the growth of the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]]. The diocese was split in 1922 to form the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Fresno|Monterey-Fresno]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego|Los Angeles-San Diego]]. In 1936 the diocese again changed [[metropolitan bishop]]s, becoming a suffragan of the newly erected [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archdiocese of Los Angeles]]. The latest territorial change for the diocese came in 1967, when it was split again, to form the present dioceses of Monterey and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno|Fresno]]. The diocese remains as a suffragen diocese of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\n\n==Bishops==\nThe lists of Bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishop of the Two Californias===\n#[[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]] (1840\u20131846)\n(Father [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Gonz\u00e1lez R\u00fabio]], O.F.M. was administrator, 1846-1849.)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey===\n# [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], [[Dominican Order|OP]] (1850\u20131853), appointed [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thaddeus Amat y Brusi]], [[Congregation of the Mission|CM]] (1853\u20131859)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey-Los Angeles===\n# Thaddeus Amat y Brusi,  CM (1859\u20131878)\n# [[Francisco Mora y Borrell]] (1878\u20131896), created [[Archbishop]] (ad personam) upon retirement in 1896\n# [[George Thomas Montgomery]] (1896\u20131902), appointed [[Archdiocese of San Francisco|Coadjutor Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thomas James Conaty]] (1903\u20131915)\n# [[John Joseph Cantwell]] (1917\u20131922), appointed [[Archbishop of Los Angeles]]\n([[Peter Muldoon|Peter J.

It comprises [[Monterey County, California|Monterey]], [[San Benito County, California|San Benito]], [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo]], and [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] counties.\n\nThe diocese is led by an [[Ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]] [[bishop]]; the bishop's [[cathedra]] is located at the [[Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo]], the [[mother church]] of the diocese, in [[Monterey, California]]. The diocese serves close to 200,000 Catholics in 46 parishes and 18 schools.\n\n==History==\nThe history of the Catholic Church in Monterey began with the establishment on the shores of [[Monterey Bay]] of [[Mission San Carlos Borromeo]] in 1770 by Saint [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. Father Serra moved the mission to [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel]] the next year, which served as the headquarters of the chain of [[Spanish missions in California]].\n\nWith the [[papal bull]] ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem'' of 27 April 1840, Pope [[Gregory XVI]] set up a new [[episcopal see]], to which he gave the name of '''[[California (titular see)|Diocese of California]]'''. He assigned to it a vast territory taken from that of the [[Diocese of Sonora]], now the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hermosillo|Archdiocese of Hermosillo]] in Mexico. It included [[Alta California]] (corresponding to the present-day states of [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], western [[Colorado]] and southwestern [[Wyoming]]) and the [[Baja California Territory]] (the modern Mexican states of [[Baja California (state)|Baja California]] and [[Baja California Sur]]). He set the episcopal residence at [[San Diego]] and made the diocese a [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Mexico City]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/iurispontificii01martgoog#page/n6/mode/1up The Papal Bull ''Apostolicam sollicitudinem''], in Raffaele de Martinis, ''Iuris pontificii de propaganda fide. Pars prima'', Tomus V, Romae 1890, pp. 233\u2013235]</ref>\n\nThe first bishop of the diocese was [[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]]. [[Mission Santa Barbara]] served as the [[pro-cathedral]].\n\nIn 1848 Alta California was ceded to the [[United States]] after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], and the government of [[Mexico]] objected to a United States-based bishop having jurisdiction over parishes in Mexican Baja California. The [[Holy See]] divided the diocese into American and Mexican sections and, on 20 November 1849, with the episcopal residence moved to Monterey, a more central position for the new diocese, the American section became the Diocese of Monterey. The [[Royal Presidio Chapel]] in Monterey served as the pro-cathedral of the American diocese. In 1853 the diocese was split again, when [[Pope Pius IX]] created the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco|Archdiocese of San Francisco]], and Monterey was transferred to be a suffragan of the new [[archdiocese]].\n\nIn 1859, the diocese's name was changed to the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles|Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles]], due to the growth of the [[Los Angeles, California|City of Los Angeles]]. The diocese was split in 1922 to form the Dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey-Fresno|Monterey-Fresno]] and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Los Angeles-San Diego|Los Angeles-San Diego]]. In 1936 the diocese again changed [[metropolitan bishop]]s, becoming a suffragan of the newly erected [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archdiocese of Los Angeles]]. The latest territorial change for the diocese came in 1967, when it was split again, to form the present dioceses of Monterey and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno|Fresno]]. The diocese remains as a suffragen diocese of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\n\n==Bishops==\nThe lists of Bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishop of the Two Californias===\n#[[Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno]], [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]] (1840\u20131846)\n(Father [[Jos\u00e9 Maria Gonz\u00e1lez R\u00fabio]], O.F.M. was administrator, 1846-1849.)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey===\n# [[Joseph Sadoc Alemany]], [[Dominican Order|OP]] (1850\u20131853), appointed [[Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thaddeus Amat y Brusi]], [[Congregation of the Mission|CM]] (1853\u20131859)\n\n===Bishop of Monterey-Los Angeles===\n# Thaddeus Amat y Brusi,  CM (1859\u20131878)\n# [[Francisco Mora y Borrell]] (1878\u20131896), created [[Archbishop]] (ad personam) upon retirement in 1896\n# [[George Thomas Montgomery]] (1896\u20131902), appointed [[Archdiocese of San Francisco|Coadjutor Archbishop of San Francisco]]\n# [[Thomas James Conaty]] (1903\u20131915)\n# [[John Joseph Cantwell]] (1917\u20131922), appointed [[Archbishop of Los Angeles]]\n([[Peter Muldoon|Peter J.

Based on the revisions, a set of ''Normae'' was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, ''aeque personaliter'', was abolished. This applied to the diocese of Chiusi e Pienza. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under [[Pope John XXIII]] for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. On 30 September 1986, [[Pope John Paul II]] ordered that the dioceses of Montepulciano, Chiusi and Pienza be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title ''Dioecesis Montis Politiani-Clusina-Pientina''. The seat of the diocese was to be in Moontepulciano, and was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedrals in Chiusi and Pienza were to become co-cathedrals, and the cathedral Chapters were each to be a ''Capitulum Concathedralis''. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Montepulciano, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of  Chiusi and Pienza, and was suffragan to the archdiocese of Siena.<ref>''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 79 (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano 1987), pp. 750-752.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chiusi-Pienza]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n{{Catholic}}\n\n{{Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Siena-Colle Val d'Elsa-Montalcino}}\n\n{{coord|43.1000|N|11.7833|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Roman Catholic dioceses in Tuscany|Montepulciano]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic dioceses established in the 16th century|Montepulciano]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox diocese\n| jurisdiction      = Diocese<!-- Type of jurisdiction: i.e. Diocese or Archdiocese -->\n| name              = Montepulciano-Chiusi-Pienza\n| latin             = Dioecesis Montis Politiani-Clusina-Pientina\n| local             = <!-- Name in the native language --> \n| image             = MontepulcianoSantaMaria.JPG\n| image_size        =  \n| image_alt         = \n| caption           = [[Montepulciano]] Cathedral\n<!---- Locations ---->\n| country           = [[Italy]]\n| metropolitan      =  \n| territory         = \n| province          = [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Siena-Colle di Val d'Elsa-Montalcino|Siena-Colle di Val d'Elsa-Montalcino]]\n| coordinates       = <!-- Use {{coord}} --> \n<!---- Statistics ---->\n| area_km2          = 1,068\n| population        = 73,100\n| population_as_of  = 2004\n| catholics         = 70,100<!-- Number of Catholics in the diocese -->\n| catholics_percent = 95.9\n| parishes          = 46<!-- Number of parishes in the diocese -->\n| churches          = <!-- Number of churches in the diocese -->\n| congregations     = <!-- Number of congregations in the diocese -->\n| schools           = <!-- Number of church supported schools in the diocese -->\n| members           = <!-- Number of members in the diocese -->\n<!---- Information ---->\n| denomination      = [[Catholic Church]]\n| rite              = [[Roman Rite]]\n| established       = 10 November 1561\n| cathedral         = Cattedrale di S.

Based on the revisions, a set of ''Normae'' was issued on 15 November 1984, which was accompanied in the next year, on 3 June 1985, by enabling legislation. According to the agreement, the practice of having one bishop govern two separate dioceses at the same time, ''aeque personaliter'', was abolished. This applied to the diocese of Chiusi e Pienza. Instead, the Vatican continued consultations which had begun under [[Pope John XXIII]] for the merging of small dioceses, especially those with personnel and financial problems, into one combined diocese. On 30 September 1986, [[Pope John Paul II]] ordered that the dioceses of Montepulciano, Chiusi and Pienza be merged into one diocese with one bishop, with the Latin title ''Dioecesis Montis Politiani-Clusina-Pientina''. The seat of the diocese was to be in Moontepulciano, and was to serve as the cathedral of the merged diocese. The cathedrals in Chiusi and Pienza were to become co-cathedrals, and the cathedral Chapters were each to be a ''Capitulum Concathedralis''. There was to be only one diocesan Tribunal, in Montepulciano, and likewise one seminary, one College of Consultors, and one Priests' Council. The territory of the new diocese was to include the territory of the former dioceses of  Chiusi and Pienza, and was suffragan to the archdiocese of Siena.<ref>''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 79 (Citt\u00e0 del Vaticano 1987), pp. 750-752.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Chiusi-Pienza]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/> \n\n{{Catholic}}\n\n{{Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Siena-Colle Val d'Elsa-Montalcino}}\n\n{{coord|43.1000|N|11.7833|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Roman Catholic dioceses in Tuscany|Montepulciano]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic dioceses established in the 16th century|Montepulciano]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Montepulciano-Chiusi-Pienza"}
