Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, Japan was intent to [[Westernization|adopt Western ways]] in an attempt to join the West as an industrialized imperial power, but a lack of acceptance of the Japanese in the West complicated integration and assimilation.

As early as the late 19th century, Asian immigrants were subject to racial prejudice in the United States. Laws were passed that openly discriminated against Asians, and sometimes Japanese in particular. Many of these laws stated that Asians could not become citizens of the United States and could not hold basic rights, such as owning land. These laws were greatly detrimental to the newly arrived immigrants, since many of them were farmers and had little choice but to become migrant workers. Some cite the formation of the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] as the start of the anti-Japanese movement in California.<ref>{{Cite book\n|author=Brian Niiya\n|title=Japanese American history: an A-to-Z reference from 1868 to the present\n|edition=illustrated\n|publisher=Verlag f\u00fcr die Deutsche Wirtschaft AG\n|year=1993\n|isbn=978-0-8160-2680-7\n|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&pg=PA37#PRA1\u2013PA37,M1 37], [https://books.google.com/books?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&pg=RA1\u2013PA103 103\u2013104]\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C\n|ref=harv\n|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n====Early 20th century====\n[[File:San Francisco Chinatown Welcome.jpg|thumb|Young China Club warning to American visitors against buying Japanese goods in San Francisco's Chinatown c. 1940]]\n\nAnti-Japanese racism and [[Yellow Peril]] in California had intensified after the Japanese victory over the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. On 11 October 1906, the San Francisco, California Board of Education had passed a regulation whereby children of Japanese descent would be required to attend racially segregated separate schools. At the time, Japanese immigrants made up approximately 1% of the population of California; many of them had come under the treaty in 1894 which had assured free immigration from Japan.\n\nThe invasion of China in 1931 and the conquest of [[Manchuria]] was roundly criticized in the US. In addition, efforts by citizens outraged at Japanese atrocities, such as the [[Nanking Massacre]], led to calls for American economic intervention to encourage Japan to leave China; these calls played a role in shaping American foreign policy. As more and more unfavorable reports of Japanese actions came to the attention of the American government, embargoes on oil and other supplies were placed on Japan, out of concern for the Chinese populace and for American interests in the Pacific. Furthermore, the European American population became very pro-China and anti-Japan, an example being a grass-roots campaign for women to stop buying silk stockings, because the material was procured from Japan through its colonies.\n\nWhen the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, Western public opinion was decidedly pro-China, with eyewitness reports by Western journalists on atrocities committed against Chinese civilians further strengthening anti-Japanese sentiments. African American sentiments could be quite different than the mainstream, with organizations like the [[Pacific Movement of the Eastern World]] (PMEW) which promised equality and land distribution under Japanese rule. The PMEW had thousands of members hopefully preparing for liberation from white supremacy with the arrival of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]].\n\n====During World War II====\n[[File:Alaska Death Trap.jpg|left|upright|thumb|An American propaganda poster - \"Death-trap for the Jap.\"]]\n[[File:JapaneseAmericanGrocer1942.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A Japanese American unfurled this banner the day after the Pearl Harbor attack. The man was later detained nonetheless. This [[Dorothea Lange]] photograph was taken in March 1942, just prior to the [[Japanese American internment]].]]\n\nThe most profound cause of anti-Japanese sentiment outside of Asia had its beginning in the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese attack propelled the United States into World War II. The Americans were unified by the attack to fight against the [[Empire of Japan]] and its allies, the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nThe surprise attack at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] prior to a [[declaration of war]] was commonly regarded as an act of treachery and cowardice. Following the attack many non-governmental \"[[Jap hunts|Jap hunting]] licenses\" were circulated around the country. ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine published an article on how to tell a Japanese from a Chinese person by the shape of the nose and the stature of the body.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| editor-last =Luce\n| editor-first=Henry\n| editor-link =Henry Robinson Luce\n| date        = 22 December 1941\n| title       = How to tell Japs from the Chinese\n| journal     = Life\n| volume      = 11\n| issue       = 25\n| pages       = 81\u201382\n| publisher   = Time Inc.\n| location    = Chicago\n| url         = https://books.google.com/?id=Y04EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA11&dq=life%20magazine%20back%20issues%20Dec%2022%201941&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q=\n| accessdate  = 19 February 2010\n| ref =harv\n}}</ref> Japanese conduct during the war did little to quell anti-Japanese sentiment. Fanning the flames of outrage were the treatment of American and other [[POW|prisoners of war]] (POWs). Military-related outrages included the murder of POWs, the use of POWs as slave labor for Japanese industries, the [[Bataan Death March]], the [[kamikaze]] attacks on Allied ships, and atrocities committed on [[Wake Island]] and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. historian James J. Weingartner attributes the very low number of Japanese in U.S. POW compounds to two key factors: a Japanese reluctance to surrender and a widespread American \"conviction that the Japanese were 'animals' or 'subhuman' and unworthy of the normal treatment accorded to POWs.\"<ref name=Weingartner1992p55>{{harvnb|Weingartner|1992|p=55}}</ref> The latter reasoning is supported by [[Niall Ferguson]], who says that \"Allied troops often saw the Japanese in the same way that Germans regarded Russians [sic] &mdash; as [[Untermensch]]en.\"<ref>Niall Fergusson, \"Prisoner Taking and Prisoner Killing in the Age of Total War: Towards a Political Economy of Military Defeat\", ''War in History'', 2004, 11 (2): p.182</ref> Weingartner believes this explains the fact that a mere 604 Japanese captives were alive in Allied POW camps by October 1944.<ref name=Weingartner1992p54 />\nUlrich Straus, a U.S. [[Japanology|Japanologist]], believes that front line troops intensely hated Japanese military personnel and were \"not easily persuaded\" to take or protect prisoners, as they believed that Allied personnel who surrendered, got \"no mercy\" from the Japanese.<ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116>[https://books.google.com/books?id=x1dQwuiEU3UC&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=%22japanese+pows%22+american+hands&source=web&ots=Jy7xIG7C1S&sig=J2I027gBjV9cqjD7t3h1-FiQW3o#PPA116,M1 Ulrich Straus, ''The Anguish Of Surrender: Japanese POWs of World War II'' (excerpts)] Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003 {{ISBN|978-0-295-98336-3}}, p.116</ref> Allied soldiers believed that Japanese soldiers were inclined to feign surrender, in order to make surprise attacks.<ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/> Therefore, according to Straus, \"[s]enior officers opposed the taking of prisoners[,] on the grounds that it needlessly exposed American troops to risks&nbsp;...\"<ref name=Ulrich-Straus-116/>\n\n[[File:Salvage Scrap propaganda poster crop2.jpg|thumb|upright|An American propaganda poster from World War II produced under the [[Works Progress Administration]].]]\n\nAn estimated 112,000 to 120,000 Japanese migrants and [[Japanese American]]s from the West Coast were [[Japanese American internment|interned]] regardless of their attitude to the US or Japan.

Nowhere was this more visible than in the automobile industry, where the lethargic [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]) watched as their former customers bought Japanese imports from [[Honda]], [[Subaru]], [[Mazda]], and [[Nissan]], a consequence of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis]]. (When Japanese automakers were establishing their inroads into the USA and Canada. Isuzu, Mazda, and Mitsubishi had joint partnerships with a Big Three manufacturer (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) where its products were sold as [[captive import|captives]]). The anti-Japanese sentiment manifested itself in occasional public destruction of Japanese cars, and in the 1982 [[murder of Vincent Chin]], a [[Chinese American]] beaten to death when he was mistaken to be Japanese.\n\nOther highly symbolic deals \u2014 including the sale of famous American commercial and cultural symbols such as [[Columbia Records]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[7-Eleven]], and the [[Rockefeller Center]] building to Japanese firms \u2014 further fanned anti-Japanese sentiment.\n\nPopular culture of the period reflected American's growing distrust of Japan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Futuristic period pieces such as ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' frequently showed Americans as working precariously under Japanese superiors. The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' showed a futuristic Los Angeles clearly under Japanese domination (with a Japanese majority population and culture), perhaps a reference to the alternate world presented in ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' written by [[Philip K. Dick]], the same author on which the film was based, in which Japan had won World War II. Criticism was also lobbied in many novels of the day. Author [[Michael Crichton]] wrote ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'', a [[murder mystery]] (later made into a [[Rising Sun (film)|feature film]]) involving Japanese businessmen in the U.S. Likewise, in [[Tom Clancy]]'s book, ''[[Debt of Honor]]'', Clancy implies that Japan's prosperity is due primarily to unequal trading terms, and portrays Japan's business leaders acting in a power hungry cabal.\n\nAs argued by Marie Thorsten, however, Japanophobia mixed with Japanophilia during Japan's peak moments of economic dominance during the 1980s. The fear of Japan became a rallying point for techno-nationalism, the imperative to be first in the world in mathematics, science and other quantifiable measures of national strength necessary to boost technological and economic supremacy. Notorious \"Japan-bashing\" took place alongside the image of Japan as superhuman, mimicking in some ways the image of the [[Soviet Union]] after it launched the first [[Sputnik]] satellite in 1957: both events turned the spotlight on American education. American bureaucrats purposely pushed this analogy.

Japan's waning economic fortunes in the 1990s, known today as [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]], coupled with an upsurge in the U.S. economy as the Internet took off largely crowded anti-Japanese sentiment out of the popular media.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}\n[[File:Japanese-and-dogs-are-not-allowed statement from a restaurant in Higher Education Mega Center 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|Poster outside of a restaurant in [[Guangzhou]], China]]\nAnti-Japanese sentiment is felt very strongly in China and distrust, hostility and negative feelings towards Japan, Japanese people and culture is widespread in China. Anti-Japanese sentiment is a phenomenon that mostly dates back to modern times (post-1868). Like many Western powers during the era of imperialism, Japan negotiated treaties that often resulted in the annexation of land from China towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. Dissatisfaction with Japanese settlements and the [[Twenty-One Demands]] by the Japanese government led to a serious [[boycott of Japanese products]] in China.\n\nToday, bitterness in China persists<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25411700 China and Japan: Seven decades of bitterness]\". BBC News, 13 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014</ref> over the atrocities of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and Japan's post-war actions, particularly the perceived lack of a straightforward acknowledgment of such atrocities, Japanese government employment of known past war criminals, and Japanese historic revisionism in textbooks. From elementary school, children are taught about Japanese war crimes in detail, for example, thousands of children are brought to the [[Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression]] in Beijing by their elementary schools to view photos of war atrocities, such as exhibits of records of Japanese military forcing Chinese workers into wartime labour,<ref>\"[http://www.1937china.org.cn/wmskz/shaiww/wwshiliao/20140407/20516.shtml]\"</ref> the [[Nanking Massacre]],<ref>\"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2014-02/27/c_133147912.htm People visit Museum of War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing]\". Xinhuanet, 27 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014</ref> and the issues of [[comfort women]]. After viewing the museum, the children's hatred of the Japanese people was reported to increase significantly. Despite the time that has passed since the end of the Second World War, discussions about the Japanese conduct can still evoke powerful emotions today, in part because most Japanese are aware of what happened but their society has never engaged in the type of introspection common in Germany after the Holocaust.<ref>Matthew Forney, \"[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1139759,00.html Why China Loves to Hate Japan]\".

Nearly every Filipino family was hurt by the war on some level. Most notably in the city of [[Candaba, Pampanga|Mapanique]], survivors recount the Japanese occupation with Filipino men being massacred and dozens of women being herded to be used as comfort women. Today, the Philippines is considered to have un-antagonistic relations with Japan. In addition, Filipinos are generally not as offended as Chinese or Koreans are about the claim from some quarters that these atrocities are given little, if any, attention in Japanese classrooms. It is the result of the huge Japanese aid sent to the country during the 1960s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/12/world/asia/12iht-phils.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Carlos H. | last=Conde | title=Letter from the Philippines: Long afterward, war still wears onFilipinos | date=13 August 2005}}</ref>\n\n[[Davao Region|Davao]] in [[Mindanao]] had a large population of Japanese immigrants who acted as a fifth column, welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II.

Nevertheless, a significant numbers of Japanese immigrants did arrive in Australia prior to 1900 (perhaps most significantly in the town of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]]). By the late 1930s, Australians feared that Japanese military strength might lead to expansion in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, perhaps even [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|an invasion of Australia itself]]. This resulted in a ban on [[iron ore]] exports to the Empire of Japan, from 1938. During World War II atrocities were frequently committed to Australians who surrendered (or attempted to surrender) to Japanese soldiers, most famously the ritual beheading of [[Leonard Siffleet]], which was photographed, as well as incidents of cannibalism and the shooting down of ejected pilots' parachutes. Anti-Japanese feelings were particularly provoked by the sinking of the unarmed [[AHS Centaur|Hospital Ship ''Centaur'']] (painted white and with [[Red Cross]] markings), with 268 dead. Treatment of Australians prisoners of war was also a factor, with over 2,800 Australian POWs dying on the [[Burma Railway]] alone.\n\n===Russian Empire and Soviet Union===\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], the Japanese victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905 halted Imperial Russia's ambitions in the East, leaving them humiliated. Later, during the [[Russian Civil War]], Japan was part of the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied interventionist forces]] that helped to occupy [[Vladivostok]] until October 1922 with a puppet White government under [[Grigory Semenov|Grigorii Semenov]]. At the end of World War II, the [[Red Army]] accepted the surrender of nearly 600,000 [[Japanese POWs in the Soviet Union|Japanese POWs]] after Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan on 15 August. Of these, 473,000 were repatriated, with 55,000 having died in Soviet captivity and the fate of the rest being unknown. Presumably, many were deported to China or North Korea to serve as forced laborers and soldiers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/04/01/japanesedied.shtml |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=23 February 2007 |title=Russia Acknowledges Sending Japanese Prisoners of War to North Korea |publisher=Mosnews.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061113081334/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/04/01/japanesedied.shtml |archivedate=13 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\n=== France ===\nJapan's public service broadcaster [[NHK]], which provides a list of overseas safety risks for traveling, in early 2020 listed anti-Japanese discrimination as a safety risk when traveling to France and some other European countries, possibly as a result of fears over the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] among other factors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/anzen/|title=\u6d77\u5916\u5b89\u5168\u60c5\u5831 - \u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u65e5\u672c|last=|first=|date=|website=NHK|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225213042/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/anzen/|archive-date=2020-02-25|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Signs of rising anti-Japanese sentiment in France include an increase in anti-Japanese incidents reported by Japanese nationals, such as being mocked on the street and refused taxi service, and least one Japanese restaurant has been vandalized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20200203-00010005-encount-ent|title=\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5973\u6027\u306b\u300c\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9!\u300d\u3068\u66b4\u8a00 \u5fd7\u3089\u304f\u304c\u4e0d\u5feb\u611f\u300c\u3069\u3053\u306e\u56fd\u3067\u3082\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u306e\u304c\u51fa\u3066\u304f\u308b\u300d\uff08ENCOUNT\uff09|website=Yahoo!\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9|language=ja|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fnn.jp/posts/00050082HDK/202002022118_RinaeIshii_HDK|title=\u300c\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u4eba\u306f\u6050\u6016\u300d\u65b0\u578b\u30a6\u30a3\u30eb\u30b9\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u4eba\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306f\u5dee\u5225\u304b\u81ea\u5df1\u9632\u885b\u304b|website=FNN.jp\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|language=ja|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204163118/https://www.fnn.jp/posts/00050082HDK/202002022118_RinaeIshii_HDK|archive-date=4 February 2020|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-sprayed-on-japanese-restaurant-in-paris|title='Coronavirus' sprayed on Japanese restaurant in Paris|last=hermesauto|date=2020-02-22|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> A group of Japanese students on a study tour in [[Paris]] received abuse by locals.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/18/national/coronavirus-outbreak-anti-asian-bigotry/|title=Coronavirus outbreak stokes anti-Asian bigotry worldwide|date=2020-02-18|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2020-02-18|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218081249/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/18/national/coronavirus-outbreak-anti-asian-bigotry/|archive-date=18 February 2020|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref>\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn a press release, the embassy of Japan in Indonesia stated that incidents of discrimination and harassment toward Japanese people had increased, possibly related to the [[coronavirus pandemic]] in 2020 among other factors, and announced they had set up a help center to assist Japanese residents dealing with these incidents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.id.emb-japan.go.jp/shingatahaien_seminar_.html|title=\u65b0\u578b\u80ba\u708e\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u30bb\u30df\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u65bd|website=www.id.emb-japan.go.jp|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref> In general, there have been reports of widespread anti-Japanese discrimination and harassment in the country, with hotels, stores, restaurants, taxi services and more refusing Japanese customers, and many Japanese people were no longer allowed in meetings and conferences.

The enshrinement of war criminals has greatly angered the people of various countries invaded by Imperial Japan. In addition, the shrine published a pamphlet stating that \"<nowiki>[war]</nowiki> was necessary in order for us to protect the independence of Japan and to prosper together with our Asian neighbors\" and that the war criminals were \"cruelly and unjustly tried as war criminals by a sham-like tribunal of the Allied forces\". While it is true that the fairness of these trials is disputed among jurists and historians in the West as well as in Japan, the former [[Prime Minister of Japan]], Junichiro Koizumi, has visited the shrine five times; every visit caused immense uproar in China and South Korea. His successor, Shinzo Abe, was also a regular visitor of Yasukuni. Some Japanese politicians have responded by saying that the shrine, as well as visits to it, is protected by the constitutional right of freedom of religion. [[Yasuo Fukuda]], chosen Prime Minister in September 2007, promised \"not to visit\" Yasukuni.<ref>Blaine Harden, \"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/23/AR2007092300112.html Party Elder To Be Japan's New Premier]\", ''Washington Post'', 24 September 2007</ref>\n\n==Derogatory terms==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThere are a variety of derogatory terms referring to Japan. Many of these terms are viewed as [[racism|racist]]. However, these terms do not necessarily refer to the Japanese race as a whole; they can also refer to specific policies, or specific time periods in history.\n\n===In English===\n*Especially prevalent during World War II, the word \"'''[[Jap]]'''\" or \"'''[[Nip]]'''\" (short for ''Nippon'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for \"Japan\") has been used in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] as a derogatory word for the Japanese. Tojo is also a racial slur from World War 2, but has since died out.\n\n===In Chinese===\n*'''''[[Riben guizi]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u9b3c\u5b50}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon gwaizi; [[Pinyin|Mandarin]]: R\u00ecb\u011bn gu\u01d0zi) \u2013 literally \"Japanese devils\" or \"Japanese monsters\". This is used mostly in the context of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when Japan invaded and occupied large areas of China. This is the title of [[Japanese Devils|a Japanese documentary on Japanese war crimes during WWII]]. Recently, some Japanese have taken the slur and reversed the negative connotations by transforming it into a cute female personification named [[Hinomoto Oniko]], which is an alternate reading in Japanese.\n*'''''[[Wokou]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u502d\u5bc7}}; {{lang-zh|p=w\u014dk\u00f2u}}) \u2013 originally referred to [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] and armed sea merchants who raided the Chinese coastline during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The term was adopted during the Second Sino-Japanese War to refer to invading Japanese forces (similarly to [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] being called \"[[Hun]]s\"). The word is today sometimes used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.\n*'''''[[Xiao Riben]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u5c0f\u65e5\u672c}}; {{lang-zh|p=xi\u01ceo R\u00ecb\u011bn}}) \u2013 literally \"puny Japan(ese)\", or literally \"little Japan(ese)\". This term is very common ([[Google]] Search returns 21,000,000 results as of August 2007). The term can be used to refer to either Japan or individual Japanese people.\n*'''''Riben zai''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u4ed4}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon zai; [[pinyin|Mandarin]]: R\u00ecb\u011bn z\u01cei) \u2013 this is the most common term in use by Cantonese speaking Chinese, having similar meaning to the English word \"Jap\". The term literally translates to \"Japan kid\". This term has become so common that it has little impact and does not seem to be too derogatory compared to other words below.\n*'''''Wo''''' ({{lang-zh|\u502d}}; {{lang-zh|p=w\u014d}}) \u2013 this was an ancient Chinese name for Japan, but was also adopted by the Japanese. Today, its usage in Mandarin is usually intended to give a negative connotation. The character is said to also mean \"dwarf\", although that meaning was not apparent when the name was first used. See [[Wa (Japan)#Etymology|Wa]].\n*'''''Riben gou''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u72d7}}; Cantonese: Yatboon gau; {{lang-zh|p=R\u00ecb\u011bn g\u01d2u}}) \u2013 \"Japanese dogs\". The word is used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.\n*'''''Da jiaopen zu''''' ({{lang-zh|\u5927\u8173\u76c6\u65cf}}; {{lang-zh|p=d\u00e0 ji\u01ceop\u00e9n z\u00fa}}) \u2013 \"big foot-basin race\". Ethnic slur towards Japanese used predominantly by Northern Chinese, mainly those from the city of [[Tianjin]].\n*'''''Huang jun''''' ({{lang-zh|\u9ec3\u8ecd}}; {{lang-zh|p=hu\u00e1ng j\u016bn}}) \u2013 \"Yellow Army\", a pun on \"\u7687\u8ecd\" (homophone ''hu\u00e1ng j\u016bn'', \"Imperial Army\"), used during World War II to represent [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese soldiers]] due to the colour of the uniform. Today, it is used negatively against all Japanese. Since the stereotype of Japanese soldiers are commonly portrayed in war-related TV series in China as short men, with a toothbrush moustache (and sometimes round glasses, in the case of higher ranks), ''huang jun'' is also often used to pull jokes on Chinese people with these characteristics, and thus \"appear like\" Japanese soldiers. Also, since the colour of yellow is often associated with pornography in modern Chinese, it is also a mockery of the Japanese [[comfort women|forcing women into prostitution]] during World War II.\n*'''''Zi wei dui''''' ({{lang-zh|\u81ea\u6170\u968a}}; Cantonese: zi wai dui; {{lang-zh|p=z\u00ec w\u00e8i du\u00ec}}) \u2013 a pun on the homophone \"\u81ea\u885b\u968a\" (same pronunciation, \"self-defense forces\", see [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]), the definition of \"\u6170\" (Cantonese: wai; pinyin: ''w\u00e8i'') used is \"to comfort\". This phrase is used to refer to Japanese (whose military force is known as \"\u81ea\u885b\u968a\") being [[Stereotypes of East Asians#Predators of white women|stereotypically hypersexual]], as \"\u81ea\u6170\u968a\" means \"self-comforting forces\", referring to [[masturbation]].\n*'''''Ga zai''''' / '''''Ga mui''''' ({{lang-zh|\u67b6\u4ed4 / \u67b6\u59b9}}; Cantonese: ga zai / ga mui) \u2013 used only by Cantonese speakers to call Japanese men / young girls. \"\u67b6\" (''ga'') came from the frequent use of simple vowels (''-a'' in this case) in Japanese language. \"\u4ed4\" (''jai'') means \"little boy(s)\", with relations to the stereotype of short Japanese men. \"\u59b9\" (''mui'') means \"young girl(s)\" (the speaker usually uses a lustful tone), with relations to the stereotype of disrespect to female in Japanese society. Sometimes, ''ga'' is used as an adjective to avoid using the proper word \"Japanese\".\n*'''''Law baak tau''''' ({{lang-zh|\u863f\u8514\u982d}}; Cantonese: law baak tau; {{lang-zh|p=luo bo tou}}) \u2013 \"[[daikon]] head\". Commonly used by the older people in the Cantonese-speaking world to call Japanese men.\n\n===In Korean===\n*'''''[[Jjokbari]]''''' ({{ko-hhrm|\ucabd\ubc1c\uc774}}) \u2013 translates as \"a person with cloven hoof-like feet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://krdic.naver.com/detail.nhn?docid=36450500|title=Definition of Jjokbari|publisher=Naver Korean Dictionary|quote=a derogatory term for Japanese.

The term is also used by [[Koreans in Japan|ethnic Koreans in Japan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Constantine|1992}}</ref>\n*'''''[[Seom-nara won-sung-i]]''''' ({{ko-hhrm|\uc12c\ub098\ub77c \uc6d0\uc22d\uc774}}) - literally \"island country monkey\", more often translated as simply \"island monkey\". Common derogatory term comparing Japanese to the [[Japanese macaque|Japanese macaque]] native to Japan.\n*'''''Wae-in''''' ({{ko-hhrm|\uc65c\uc778|\u502d\u4eba}}) \u2013 translates as \"small Japanese person\", although used with strong derogatory connotations. The term refers to the ancient name of [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] Japan, ''Wae'', on the basis of the stereotype that Japanese people were small (see [[Wa (Japan)#Etymology|Wa]]).\n*'''''Wae-nom''''' ({{ko-hhrm|\uc65c\ub188|\u502d\ub188}}) \u2013 translates as \"small Japanese bastard\". It is used more frequently by older Korean generations, derived from the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)]].\n*'''''[[Wokou|Wae-gu]]''''' ({{ko-hhrm|\uc65c\uad6c|\u502d\u5bc7}}) \u2013 originally referred to [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]], who frequently invaded Korea.

As early as the late 19th century, Asian immigrants were subject to racial prejudice in the United States. Laws were passed that openly discriminated against Asians, and sometimes Japanese in particular. Many of these laws stated that Asians could not become citizens of the United States and could not hold basic rights, such as owning land. These laws were greatly detrimental to the newly arrived immigrants, since many of them were farmers and had little choice but to become migrant workers. Some cite the formation of the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] as the start of the anti-Japanese movement in California.<ref>{{Cite book\n|author=Brian Niiya\n|title=Japanese American history: an A-to-Z reference from 1868 to the present\n|edition=illustrated\n|publisher=Verlag f\u00fcr die Deutsche Wirtschaft AG\n|year=1993\n|isbn=978-0-8160-2680-7\n|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&pg=PA37#PRA1\u2013PA37,M1 37], [https://books.google.com/books?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C&pg=RA1\u2013PA103 103\u2013104]\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QZg6Ft_jvJ0C\n|ref=harv\n|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\n====Early 20th century====\n[[File:San Francisco Chinatown Welcome.jpg|thumb|Young China Club warning to American visitors against buying Japanese goods in San Francisco's Chinatown c. 1940]]\n\nAnti-Japanese racism and [[Yellow Peril]] in California had intensified after the Japanese victory over the [[Russian Empire]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. On 11 October 1906, the San Francisco, California Board of Education had passed a regulation whereby children of Japanese descent would be required to attend racially segregated separate schools. At the time, Japanese immigrants made up approximately 1% of the population of California; many of them had come under the treaty in 1894 which had assured free immigration from Japan.\n\nThe invasion of China in 1931 and the conquest of [[Manchuria]] was roundly criticized in the US. In addition, efforts by citizens outraged at Japanese atrocities, such as the [[Nanking Massacre]], led to calls for American economic intervention to encourage Japan to leave China; these calls played a role in shaping American foreign policy. As more and more unfavorable reports of Japanese actions came to the attention of the American government, embargoes on oil and other supplies were placed on Japan, out of concern for the Chinese populace and for American interests in the Pacific. Furthermore, the European American population became very pro-China and anti-Japan, an example being a grass-roots campaign for women to stop buying silk stockings, because the material was procured from Japan through its colonies.\n\nWhen the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Second Sino-Japanese War]] broke out in 1937, Western public opinion was decidedly pro-China, with eyewitness reports by Western journalists on atrocities committed against Chinese civilians further strengthening anti-Japanese sentiments. African American sentiments could be quite different than the mainstream, with organizations like the [[Pacific Movement of the Eastern World]] (PMEW) which promised equality and land distribution under Japanese rule. The PMEW had thousands of members hopefully preparing for liberation from white supremacy with the arrival of the [[Japanese Imperial Army]].\n\n====During World War II====\n[[File:Alaska Death Trap.jpg|left|upright|thumb|An American propaganda poster - \"Death-trap for the Jap.\"]]\n[[File:JapaneseAmericanGrocer1942.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A Japanese American unfurled this banner the day after the Pearl Harbor attack.

The Japanese attack propelled the United States into World War II. The Americans were unified by the attack to fight against the [[Empire of Japan]] and its allies, the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nThe surprise attack at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] prior to a [[declaration of war]] was commonly regarded as an act of treachery and cowardice.

Fanning the flames of outrage were the treatment of American and other [[POW|prisoners of war]] (POWs). Military-related outrages included the murder of POWs, the use of POWs as slave labor for Japanese industries, the [[Bataan Death March]], the [[kamikaze]] attacks on Allied ships, and atrocities committed on [[Wake Island]] and elsewhere.\n\nU.S. historian James J.

Nowhere was this more visible than in the automobile industry, where the lethargic [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] ([[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]) watched as their former customers bought Japanese imports from [[Honda]], [[Subaru]], [[Mazda]], and [[Nissan]], a consequence of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis]]. (When Japanese automakers were establishing their inroads into the USA and Canada. Isuzu, Mazda, and Mitsubishi had joint partnerships with a Big Three manufacturer (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) where its products were sold as [[captive import|captives]]). The anti-Japanese sentiment manifested itself in occasional public destruction of Japanese cars, and in the 1982 [[murder of Vincent Chin]], a [[Chinese American]] beaten to death when he was mistaken to be Japanese.\n\nOther highly symbolic deals \u2014 including the sale of famous American commercial and cultural symbols such as [[Columbia Records]], [[Columbia Pictures]], [[7-Eleven]], and the [[Rockefeller Center]] building to Japanese firms \u2014 further fanned anti-Japanese sentiment.\n\nPopular culture of the period reflected American's growing distrust of Japan.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Futuristic period pieces such as ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' and ''[[RoboCop 3]]'' frequently showed Americans as working precariously under Japanese superiors. The film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' showed a futuristic Los Angeles clearly under Japanese domination (with a Japanese majority population and culture), perhaps a reference to the alternate world presented in ''[[The Man in the High Castle]]'' written by [[Philip K. Dick]], the same author on which the film was based, in which Japan had won World War II. Criticism was also lobbied in many novels of the day. Author [[Michael Crichton]] wrote ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'', a [[murder mystery]] (later made into a [[Rising Sun (film)|feature film]]) involving Japanese businessmen in the U.S. Likewise, in [[Tom Clancy]]'s book, ''[[Debt of Honor]]'', Clancy implies that Japan's prosperity is due primarily to unequal trading terms, and portrays Japan's business leaders acting in a power hungry cabal.\n\nAs argued by Marie Thorsten, however, Japanophobia mixed with Japanophilia during Japan's peak moments of economic dominance during the 1980s. The fear of Japan became a rallying point for techno-nationalism, the imperative to be first in the world in mathematics, science and other quantifiable measures of national strength necessary to boost technological and economic supremacy. Notorious \"Japan-bashing\" took place alongside the image of Japan as superhuman, mimicking in some ways the image of the [[Soviet Union]] after it launched the first [[Sputnik]] satellite in 1957: both events turned the spotlight on American education. American bureaucrats purposely pushed this analogy. In 1982, Ernest Boyer, a former U.S. Commissioner of Education, publicly declared that, \"What we need is another Sputnik\" to re-boot American education, and that \"maybe what we should do is get the Japanese to put a Toyota into orbit.\"<ref name=Thorsten2012p150>{{Harvnb|Thorsten|2012|p=150n1}}</ref> Japan was both a threat and a model for human resource development in education and the workforce, merging with the image of Asian-Americans as the \"model minority.\"\n\nBoth the animosity and super-humanizing which peaked in the 1980s, when the term \"Japan bashing\" became popular, had largely faded by the late 1990s. Japan's waning economic fortunes in the 1990s, known today as [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the Lost Decade]], coupled with an upsurge in the U.S. economy as the Internet took off largely crowded anti-Japanese sentiment out of the popular media.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Anti-Japanese sentiment in China}}\n[[File:Japanese-and-dogs-are-not-allowed statement from a restaurant in Higher Education Mega Center 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|Poster outside of a restaurant in [[Guangzhou]], China]]\nAnti-Japanese sentiment is felt very strongly in China and distrust, hostility and negative feelings towards Japan, Japanese people and culture is widespread in China. Anti-Japanese sentiment is a phenomenon that mostly dates back to modern times (post-1868). Like many Western powers during the era of imperialism, Japan negotiated treaties that often resulted in the annexation of land from China towards the end of the Qing Dynasty. Dissatisfaction with Japanese settlements and the [[Twenty-One Demands]] by the Japanese government led to a serious [[boycott of Japanese products]] in China.\n\nToday, bitterness in China persists<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25411700 China and Japan: Seven decades of bitterness]\". BBC News, 13 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014</ref> over the atrocities of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and Japan's post-war actions, particularly the perceived lack of a straightforward acknowledgment of such atrocities, Japanese government employment of known past war criminals, and Japanese historic revisionism in textbooks. From elementary school, children are taught about Japanese war crimes in detail, for example, thousands of children are brought to the [[Museum of the War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression]] in Beijing by their elementary schools to view photos of war atrocities, such as exhibits of records of Japanese military forcing Chinese workers into wartime labour,<ref>\"[http://www.1937china.org.cn/wmskz/shaiww/wwshiliao/20140407/20516.shtml]\"</ref> the [[Nanking Massacre]],<ref>\"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/photo/2014-02/27/c_133147912.htm People visit Museum of War of Chinese People's Resistance Against Japanese Aggression in Beijing]\". Xinhuanet, 27 February 2014, accessed 14 April 2014</ref> and the issues of [[comfort women]]. After viewing the museum, the children's hatred of the Japanese people was reported to increase significantly. Despite the time that has passed since the end of the Second World War, discussions about the Japanese conduct can still evoke powerful emotions today, in part because most Japanese are aware of what happened but their society has never engaged in the type of introspection common in Germany after the Holocaust.<ref>Matthew Forney, \"[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1139759,00.html Why China Loves to Hate Japan]\".

Nearly every Filipino family was hurt by the war on some level. Most notably in the city of [[Candaba, Pampanga|Mapanique]], survivors recount the Japanese occupation with Filipino men being massacred and dozens of women being herded to be used as comfort women. Today, the Philippines is considered to have un-antagonistic relations with Japan. In addition, Filipinos are generally not as offended as Chinese or Koreans are about the claim from some quarters that these atrocities are given little, if any, attention in Japanese classrooms. It is the result of the huge Japanese aid sent to the country during the 1960s and the 1970s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/12/world/asia/12iht-phils.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Carlos H. | last=Conde | title=Letter from the Philippines: Long afterward, war still wears onFilipinos | date=13 August 2005}}</ref>\n\n[[Davao Region|Davao]] in [[Mindanao]] had a large population of Japanese immigrants who acted as a fifth column, welcoming the Japanese invaders during World War II.

Nevertheless, a significant numbers of Japanese immigrants did arrive in Australia prior to 1900 (perhaps most significantly in the town of [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]]). By the late 1930s, Australians feared that Japanese military strength might lead to expansion in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, perhaps even [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|an invasion of Australia itself]]. This resulted in a ban on [[iron ore]] exports to the Empire of Japan, from 1938. During World War II atrocities were frequently committed to Australians who surrendered (or attempted to surrender) to Japanese soldiers, most famously the ritual beheading of [[Leonard Siffleet]], which was photographed, as well as incidents of cannibalism and the shooting down of ejected pilots' parachutes. Anti-Japanese feelings were particularly provoked by the sinking of the unarmed [[AHS Centaur|Hospital Ship ''Centaur'']] (painted white and with [[Red Cross]] markings), with 268 dead. Treatment of Australians prisoners of war was also a factor, with over 2,800 Australian POWs dying on the [[Burma Railway]] alone.\n\n===Russian Empire and Soviet Union===\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], the Japanese victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905 halted Imperial Russia's ambitions in the East, leaving them humiliated. Later, during the [[Russian Civil War]], Japan was part of the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied interventionist forces]] that helped to occupy [[Vladivostok]] until October 1922 with a puppet White government under [[Grigory Semenov|Grigorii Semenov]]. At the end of World War II, the [[Red Army]] accepted the surrender of nearly 600,000 [[Japanese POWs in the Soviet Union|Japanese POWs]] after Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan on 15 August. Of these, 473,000 were repatriated, with 55,000 having died in Soviet captivity and the fate of the rest being unknown. Presumably, many were deported to China or North Korea to serve as forced laborers and soldiers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/04/01/japanesedied.shtml |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=23 February 2007 |title=Russia Acknowledges Sending Japanese Prisoners of War to North Korea |publisher=Mosnews.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061113081334/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/04/01/japanesedied.shtml |archivedate=13 November 2006 }}</ref>\n\n=== France ===\nJapan's public service broadcaster [[NHK]], which provides a list of overseas safety risks for traveling, in early 2020 listed anti-Japanese discrimination as a safety risk when traveling to France and some other European countries, possibly as a result of fears over the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]] among other factors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/anzen/|title=\u6d77\u5916\u5b89\u5168\u60c5\u5831 - \u30e9\u30b8\u30aa\u65e5\u672c|last=|first=|date=|website=NHK|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225213042/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/anzen/|archive-date=2020-02-25|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Signs of rising anti-Japanese sentiment in France include an increase in anti-Japanese incidents reported by Japanese nationals, such as being mocked on the street and refused taxi service, and least one Japanese restaurant has been vandalized.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20200203-00010005-encount-ent|title=\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5973\u6027\u306b\u300c\u30a6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9!\u300d\u3068\u66b4\u8a00 \u5fd7\u3089\u304f\u304c\u4e0d\u5feb\u611f\u300c\u3069\u3053\u306e\u56fd\u3067\u3082\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u306e\u304c\u51fa\u3066\u304f\u308b\u300d\uff08ENCOUNT\uff09|website=Yahoo!\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9|language=ja|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fnn.jp/posts/00050082HDK/202002022118_RinaeIshii_HDK|title=\u300c\u30de\u30b9\u30af\u3092\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u4eba\u306f\u6050\u6016\u300d\u65b0\u578b\u30a6\u30a3\u30eb\u30b9\u306b\u5bfe\u3059\u308b\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u4eba\u306e\u5bfe\u5fdc\u306f\u5dee\u5225\u304b\u81ea\u5df1\u9632\u885b\u304b|website=FNN.jp\u30d7\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3|language=ja|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204163118/https://www.fnn.jp/posts/00050082HDK/202002022118_RinaeIshii_HDK|archive-date=4 February 2020|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-sprayed-on-japanese-restaurant-in-paris|title='Coronavirus' sprayed on Japanese restaurant in Paris|last=hermesauto|date=2020-02-22|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> A group of Japanese students on a study tour in [[Paris]] received abuse by locals.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/18/national/coronavirus-outbreak-anti-asian-bigotry/|title=Coronavirus outbreak stokes anti-Asian bigotry worldwide|date=2020-02-18|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2020-02-18|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218081249/https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/02/18/national/coronavirus-outbreak-anti-asian-bigotry/|archive-date=18 February 2020|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref>\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn a press release, the embassy of Japan in Indonesia stated that incidents of discrimination and harassment toward Japanese people had increased, possibly related to the [[coronavirus pandemic]] in 2020 among other factors, and announced they had set up a help center to assist Japanese residents dealing with these incidents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.id.emb-japan.go.jp/shingatahaien_seminar_.html|title=\u65b0\u578b\u80ba\u708e\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u30bb\u30df\u30ca\u30fc\u306e\u5b9f\u65bd|website=www.id.emb-japan.go.jp|access-date=2020-03-10}}</ref> In general, there have been reports of widespread anti-Japanese discrimination and harassment in the country, with hotels, stores, restaurants, taxi services and more refusing Japanese customers, and many Japanese people were no longer allowed in meetings and conferences.

It is the resting place of thousands of not only Japanese soldiers, but also Korean and Taiwanese soldiers killed in various wars, mostly in World War II. The shrine includes 13 [[crime against peace|Class A criminals]] such as [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[K\u014dki Hirota]], who were convicted and [[execution|executed]] for their roles in the Japanese invasions of China, Korea, and other parts of East Asia after the remission to them under [[Treaty of San Francisco]]. A total of 1,068 convicted war criminals are enshrined at the Yasukuni Shrine.\n\nIn recent years, the Yasukuni Shrine has become a sticking point in the relations of Japan and its neighbours. The enshrinement of war criminals has greatly angered the people of various countries invaded by Imperial Japan. In addition, the shrine published a pamphlet stating that \"<nowiki>[war]</nowiki> was necessary in order for us to protect the independence of Japan and to prosper together with our Asian neighbors\" and that the war criminals were \"cruelly and unjustly tried as war criminals by a sham-like tribunal of the Allied forces\". While it is true that the fairness of these trials is disputed among jurists and historians in the West as well as in Japan, the former [[Prime Minister of Japan]], Junichiro Koizumi, has visited the shrine five times; every visit caused immense uproar in China and South Korea. His successor, Shinzo Abe, was also a regular visitor of Yasukuni. Some Japanese politicians have responded by saying that the shrine, as well as visits to it, is protected by the constitutional right of freedom of religion. [[Yasuo Fukuda]], chosen Prime Minister in September 2007, promised \"not to visit\" Yasukuni.<ref>Blaine Harden, \"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/23/AR2007092300112.html Party Elder To Be Japan's New Premier]\", ''Washington Post'', 24 September 2007</ref>\n\n==Derogatory terms==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThere are a variety of derogatory terms referring to Japan. Many of these terms are viewed as [[racism|racist]]. However, these terms do not necessarily refer to the Japanese race as a whole; they can also refer to specific policies, or specific time periods in history.\n\n===In English===\n*Especially prevalent during World War II, the word \"'''[[Jap]]'''\" or \"'''[[Nip]]'''\" (short for ''Nippon'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]] for \"Japan\") has been used in the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] as a derogatory word for the Japanese. Tojo is also a racial slur from World War 2, but has since died out.\n\n===In Chinese===\n*'''''[[Riben guizi]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u9b3c\u5b50}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon gwaizi; [[Pinyin|Mandarin]]: R\u00ecb\u011bn gu\u01d0zi) \u2013 literally \"Japanese devils\" or \"Japanese monsters\". This is used mostly in the context of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], when Japan invaded and occupied large areas of China. This is the title of [[Japanese Devils|a Japanese documentary on Japanese war crimes during WWII]]. Recently, some Japanese have taken the slur and reversed the negative connotations by transforming it into a cute female personification named [[Hinomoto Oniko]], which is an alternate reading in Japanese.\n*'''''[[Wokou]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u502d\u5bc7}}; {{lang-zh|p=w\u014dk\u00f2u}}) \u2013 originally referred to [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]] and armed sea merchants who raided the Chinese coastline during the [[Ming dynasty]]. The term was adopted during the Second Sino-Japanese War to refer to invading Japanese forces (similarly to [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] being called \"[[Hun]]s\"). The word is today sometimes used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.\n*'''''[[Xiao Riben]]''''' ({{lang-zh|\u5c0f\u65e5\u672c}}; {{lang-zh|p=xi\u01ceo R\u00ecb\u011bn}}) \u2013 literally \"puny Japan(ese)\", or literally \"little Japan(ese)\". This term is very common ([[Google]] Search returns 21,000,000 results as of August 2007). The term can be used to refer to either Japan or individual Japanese people.\n*'''''Riben zai''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u4ed4}}; Cantonese: Yaatboon zai; [[pinyin|Mandarin]]: R\u00ecb\u011bn z\u01cei) \u2013 this is the most common term in use by Cantonese speaking Chinese, having similar meaning to the English word \"Jap\". The term literally translates to \"Japan kid\". This term has become so common that it has little impact and does not seem to be too derogatory compared to other words below.\n*'''''Wo''''' ({{lang-zh|\u502d}}; {{lang-zh|p=w\u014d}}) \u2013 this was an ancient Chinese name for Japan, but was also adopted by the Japanese. Today, its usage in Mandarin is usually intended to give a negative connotation. The character is said to also mean \"dwarf\", although that meaning was not apparent when the name was first used. See [[Wa (Japan)#Etymology|Wa]].\n*'''''Riben gou''''' ({{lang-zh|\u65e5\u672c\u72d7}}; Cantonese: Yatboon gau; {{lang-zh|p=R\u00ecb\u011bn g\u01d2u}}) \u2013 \"Japanese dogs\". The word is used to refer to all Japanese people in extremely negative contexts.\n*'''''Da jiaopen zu''''' ({{lang-zh|\u5927\u8173\u76c6\u65cf}}; {{lang-zh|p=d\u00e0 ji\u01ceop\u00e9n z\u00fa}}) \u2013 \"big foot-basin race\". Ethnic slur towards Japanese used predominantly by Northern Chinese, mainly those from the city of [[Tianjin]].\n*'''''Huang jun''''' ({{lang-zh|\u9ec3\u8ecd}}; {{lang-zh|p=hu\u00e1ng j\u016bn}}) \u2013 \"Yellow Army\", a pun on \"\u7687\u8ecd\" (homophone ''hu\u00e1ng j\u016bn'', \"Imperial Army\"), used during World War II to represent [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese soldiers]] due to the colour of the uniform. Today, it is used negatively against all Japanese. Since the stereotype of Japanese soldiers are commonly portrayed in war-related TV series in China as short men, with a toothbrush moustache (and sometimes round glasses, in the case of higher ranks), ''huang jun'' is also often used to pull jokes on Chinese people with these characteristics, and thus \"appear like\" Japanese soldiers. Also, since the colour of yellow is often associated with pornography in modern Chinese, it is also a mockery of the Japanese [[comfort women|forcing women into prostitution]] during World War II.\n*'''''Zi wei dui''''' ({{lang-zh|\u81ea\u6170\u968a}}; Cantonese: zi wai dui; {{lang-zh|p=z\u00ec w\u00e8i du\u00ec}}) \u2013 a pun on the homophone \"\u81ea\u885b\u968a\" (same pronunciation, \"self-defense forces\", see [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]), the definition of \"\u6170\" (Cantonese: wai; pinyin: ''w\u00e8i'') used is \"to comfort\".

However, in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] based [[wikisource:Translation:On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|a work on special relativity]] on two postulates:\n\n* The laws of physics are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] (i.e., identical) in all [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]] (i.e., non-accelerating frames of reference)\n* The [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.\n\nThe logical consequence of taking these postulates together is the inseparable joining together of the four dimensions\u2014hitherto assumed as independent\u2014of space and time. Many counterintuitive consequences emerge: in addition to being independent of the motion of the light source, the speed of light has the same speed regardless of the frame of reference in which it is measured; the distances and even temporal ordering of pairs of events change when measured in different [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames of reference]] (this is the [[relativity of simultaneity]]); and the linear additivity of velocities no longer holds true.\n\nEinstein framed his theory in terms of [[kinematics]] (the study of moving bodies). His theory was an advance over [[History of special relativity#Lorentz's 1904 model|Lorentz's 1904 theory of electromagnetic phenomena]] and [[History of special relativity#Poincar\u00e9's dynamics of the electron|Poincar\u00e9's electrodynamic theory]]. Although these theories included equations identical to those that Einstein introduced (i.e. the [[Lorentz transformation]]), they were essentially ad&nbsp;hoc models proposed to explain the results of various experiments\u2014including the famous [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment|Michelson\u2013Morley interferometer experiment]]\u2014that were extremely difficult to fit into existing paradigms.\n\nIn 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]]\u2014once one of the math professors of a young Einstein in Z\u00fcrich\u2014presented a geometric interpretation of special relativity that fused time and the three spatial dimensions of space into a single four-dimensional continuum now known as [[Minkowski space]]. A key feature of this interpretation is the formal definition of the spacetime interval. Although measurements of distance and time between [[Event (relativity)|events]] differ for measurements made in different reference frames, the spacetime interval is independent of the inertial frame of reference in which they are recorded.\n\nMinkowski's geometric interpretation of relativity was to prove vital to Einstein's development of his 1915 [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], wherein he showed how [[stress\u2013energy tensor|mass and energy]] [[Riemann curvature tensor|curve]] flat spacetime into a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].\n\n{{anchor|Contents}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{anchor|Introduction}}\n{{anchor|Definitions}}\n\n=== Definitions ===\n<!-- Note to future editors!!!

[[General relativity]] also provides an explanation of how [[gravitational fields]] can slow the passage of time for an object as seen by an observer outside the field.\n\nIn ordinary space, a position is specified by three numbers, known as [[dimension#In physics|dimensions]]. In the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], these are called x, y, and z. A position in spacetime is called an ''event'', and requires four numbers to be specified: the three-dimensional location in space, plus the position in time (Fig.&nbsp;1). Spacetime is thus [[Four-dimensional space|four dimensional]]. An event is something that happens instantaneously at a single point in spacetime, represented by a set of coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and ''t''.\n\nThe word \"event\" used in relativity should not be confused with the use of the word \"event\" in normal conversation, where it might refer to an \"event\" as something such as a concert, sporting event, or a battle. These are not mathematical \"events\" in the way the word is used in relativity, because they have finite durations and extents. Unlike the analogies used to explain events, such as firecrackers or lightning bolts, mathematical events have zero duration and represent a single point in spacetime.\n\nThe path of a particle through spacetime can be considered to be a succession of events. The series of events can be linked together to form a line which represents a particle's progress through spacetime. That line is called the particle's ''world line''.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|105}}\n\nMathematically, spacetime is a ''[[manifold]]'', which is to say, it appears locally \"flat\" near each point in the same way that, at small enough scales, a globe appears flat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowland |first1=Todd |title=Manifold |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Manifold.html |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref> An extremely large scale factor, <math>c</math> (conventionally called the ''speed-of-light'') relates distances measured in space with distances measured in time.

It was only with the advent of sensitive scientific measurements in the mid-1800s, such as the [[Fizeau experiment]] and the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]], that puzzling discrepancies began to be noted between observation versus predictions based on the implicit assumption of Euclidean space.<ref name=\"French\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=A.P.|title=Special Relativity|date=1968|publisher=CRC Press|location=[[Boca Raton, Florida]]|isbn=0748764224|pages=35\u201360}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Figure 1-1}}\n[[File:Observer in special relativity.svg|thumb|Figure 1-1.

The 'observer' synchronizes the clocks according to their own reference frame.]]\n\nIn special relativity, an observer will, in most cases, mean a frame of reference from which a set of objects or events is being measured. This usage differs significantly from the ordinary English meaning of the term. Reference frames are inherently nonlocal constructs, and according to this usage of the term, it does not make sense to speak of an observer as having a location. In Fig.&nbsp;1&#8209;1, imagine that the frame under consideration is equipped with a dense lattice of clocks, synchronized within this reference frame, that extends indefinitely throughout the three dimensions of space. Any specific location within the lattice is not important. The latticework of clocks is used to determine the time and position of events taking place within the whole frame. The term ''observer'' refers to the entire ensemble of clocks associated with one inertial frame of reference.<ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/spacetime_physics/|title=Spacetime Physics: Introduction to Special Relativity|last1=Taylor|first1=Edwin F.|last2=Wheeler|first2=John Archibald|date=1992|publisher=Freeman|isbn=071670336X|edition=2nd|location=San Francisco|pages=|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref>{{rp|17\u201322}} In this idealized case, every point in space has a clock associated with it, and thus the clocks register each event instantly, with no time delay between an event and its recording. A real observer, however, will see a delay between the emission of a signal and its detection due to the speed of light. To synchronize the clocks, in the [[data reduction]] following an experiment, the time when a signal is received will be corrected to reflect its actual time were it to have been recorded by an idealized lattice of clocks.\n\nIn many books on special relativity, especially older ones, the word \"observer\" is used in the more ordinary sense of the word. It is usually clear from context which meaning has been adopted.\n\nPhysicists distinguish between what one ''measures'' or ''observes'' (after one has factored out signal propagation delays), versus what one visually sees without such corrections. Failure to understand [[Special relativity#Measurement versus visual appearance|the difference between what one measures/observes versus what one sees]] is the source of much error among beginning students of relativity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scherr|first1=Rachel E.|last2=Shaffer|first2=Peter S.|last3=Vokos|first3=Stamatis|title=Student understanding of time in special relativity: Simultaneity and reference frames|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=July 2001|volume=69|issue=S1|pages=S24\u2013S35|doi=10.1119/1.1371254|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0207/0207109.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2017|bibcode = 2001AmJPh..69S..24S |arxiv=physics/0207109}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\n{{anchor|History}}\n{{main | History of special relativity|History of Lorentz transformations}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction         = vertical\n | width             = 220\n | image1            = Michelson-Morley experiment conducted with white light.png\n <!-- | caption1          = -->\n | image2            = MichelsonMorleyAnimationDE.gif\n | caption2          = Figure 1-2.

For example, the [[Fizeau experiment]] of 1851 demonstrated that the speed of light in flowing water was less than the sum of the speed of light in air plus the speed of the water by an amount dependent on the water's index of refraction. Among other issues, the dependence of the partial [[aether-dragging]] implied by this experiment on the index of refraction (which is dependent on wavelength) led to the unpalatable conclusion that aether ''simultaneously'' flows at different speeds for different colors of light.<ref name=Stachel>{{cite book |last=Stachel |first=John |editor1-last=Kox |editor1-first=A.

(No length changes occur in directions transverse to the direction of motion.)\n\nBy 1904, Lorentz had expanded his theory such that he had arrived at equations formally identical with those that Einstein were to derive later (i.e. the [[Lorentz transform]]), but with a fundamentally different interpretation. As a theory of [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] (the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion), his theory assumed actual physical deformations of the physical constituents of matter.<ref name=\"Pais\">{{cite book|last1=Pais|first1=Abraham|title=\"\"Subtle is the Lord-- \": The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein|date=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=019853907X|edition=11th|url=https://archive.org/details/subtleislordscie00pais}}</ref>{{rp|163\u2013174}} Lorentz's equations predicted a quantity that he called ''local time'', with which he could explain the [[aberration of light]], the Fizeau experiment and other phenomena.

The opening words of ''Space and Time'' include Minkowski's famous statement that \"Henceforth, space for itself, and time for itself shall completely reduce to a mere shadow, and only some sort of union of the two shall preserve independence.\" ''Space and Time'' included the first public presentation of spacetime diagrams (Fig.&nbsp;1&#8209;4), and included a remarkable demonstration that the concept of the ''invariant interval'' ([[#Spacetime in special relativity|discussed below]]), along with the empirical observation that the speed of light is finite, allows derivation of the entirety of special relativity.{{refn|group=note|''(In the following, the group'' '''''G''<sub>\u221e</sub>''' ''is the Galilean group and the group'' '''''G''<sub>c</sub>''' ''the Lorentz group.)'' \"With respect to this it is clear that the group '''''G''<sub>c</sub>''' in the limit for {{nowrap|1='''''c'' = &infin;'''}}, i.e. as group '''''G''<sub>\u221e</sub>''', exactly becomes the full group belonging to Newtonian Mechanics.

However, in order to complete his search for general relativity that started in 1907, the geometric interpretation of relativity proved to be vital, and in 1916, Einstein fully acknowledged his indebtedness to Minkowski, whose interpretation greatly facilitated the transition to general relativity.<ref name=\"Pais\"/>{{rp|151\u2013152}} Since there are other types of spacetime, such as the curved spacetime of general relativity, the spacetime of special relativity is today known as ''Minkowski spacetime.''\n\n== Spacetime in special relativity ==\n{{anchor|Spacetime interval}} <!-- This section is linked from [[Lorentz transformation]] -->\n\n=== Spacetime interval ===\nIn three-dimensions, the ''distance'' <math>\\Delta{d}</math> between two points can be defined using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\Delta{d}\\right)}^2 = {\\left(\\Delta{x}\\right)}^2 + {\\left(\\Delta{y}\\right)}^2 + {\\left(\\Delta{z}\\right)}^2</math>\nAlthough two viewers may measure the x,y, and z position of the two points using different coordinate systems, the distance between the points will be the same for both (assuming that they are measuring using the same units). The distance is \"invariant\".\n\nIn special relativity, however, the distance between two points is no longer the same if measured by two different observers when one of the observers is moving, because of [[Lorentz contraction]].  The situation is even more complicated if the two points are separated in time as well as in space. For example, if one observer sees two events occur at the same place, but at different times, a person moving with respect to the first observer will see the two events occurring at different places, because (from their point of view) they are stationary, and the position of the event is receding or approaching.  Thus, a different measure must be used to measure the effective \"distance\" between two events.\n\nIn four-dimensional spacetime, the analog to distance is the ''interval''.  Although time comes in as a fourth dimension, it is treated differently than the spatial dimensions. Minkowski space hence differs in important respects from [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional Euclidean space]]. The fundamental reason for merging space and time into spacetime is that space and time are separately not invariant, which is to say that, under the proper conditions, different observers will disagree on the length of time between two ''[[event (relativity)|events]]'' (because of [[time dilation]]) or the distance between the two events (because of [[length contraction]]). But special relativity provides a new invariant, called the ''spacetime interval'', which combines distances in space and in time. All observers who measure time and distance carefully will find the same spacetime interval between any two events. Suppose an observer measures two events as being separated in time by <math>\\Delta t</math> and a spatial distance <math>\\Delta x</math>. Then the spacetime interval <math>{\\left(\\Delta{s}\\right)}^2</math> between the two events that are separated by a distance <math>\\Delta{x}</math> in space and by <math>\\Delta{ct}= c\\Delta t</math> in the <math>ct</math>-coordinate is:\n\n:<math>(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta ct)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 </math>, or for three space dimensions, <math>(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta ct)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 - (\\Delta y)^2 - (\\Delta z)^2</math><ref>{{cite book |title=Differential Manifolds and Theoretical Physics |first1=W.

The spacetime interval is the quantity <math>s^2</math>, not <math>s</math> itself. The reason is that unlike distances in Euclidean geometry, intervals in Minkowski spacetime can be negative. Rather than deal with square roots of negative numbers, physicists customarily regard <math>s^2</math> as a distinct symbol in itself, rather than the square of something.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|217}}\n\nBecause of the minus sign, the spacetime interval between two distinct events can be zero. If <math>s^2</math> is positive, the spacetime interval is ''timelike'', meaning that two events are separated by more time than space. If <math>s^2</math> is negative, the spacetime interval is ''spacelike'', meaning that two events are separated by more space than time. Spacetime intervals are zero when <math>x = \\pm \\textrm{c} \\, t</math>.  In other words, the spacetime interval between two events on the world line of something moving at the speed of light is zero. Such an interval is termed ''lightlike'' or ''null''. A photon arriving in our eye from a distant star will not have aged, despite having (from our perspective) spent years in its passage.\n\nA spacetime diagram is typically drawn with only a single space and a single time coordinate. Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;1 presents a spacetime diagram illustrating the ''[[world lines]]'' (i.e. paths in spacetime) of two photons, A and B, originating from the same event and going in opposite directions. In addition, C illustrates the world line of a slower-than-light-speed object. The vertical time coordinate is scaled by <math>\\textrm{c}</math> so that it has the same units (meters) as the horizontal space coordinate. Since photons travel at the speed of light, their world lines have a slope of \u00b11. In other words, every meter that a photon travels to the left or right requires approximately 3.3 nanoseconds of time.\n\n'''Note on nomenclature:''' There are two sign conventions in use in the relativity literature:\n: <math>s^2 = (\\textrm{c} t)^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2</math>\n: and\n: <math>s^2 = - (\\textrm{c} t)^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2</math>\n\nThese sign conventions are associated with the ''[[metric signature]]s'' {{nowrap|(+&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;\u2212&thinsp;\u2212)}} and {{nowrap|(\u2212&thinsp;+&thinsp;+&thinsp;+).}} A minor variation is to place the time coordinate last rather than first.

With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. In Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;2, two [[Galilean reference frame]]s (i.e. conventional 3-space frames) are displayed in relative motion.

Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3b illustrates a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O. Since S and S\u2032 are in standard configuration, their origins coincide at times ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in frame S and ''t''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in frame S'. The ''ct''\u2032 axis passes through the events in frame S\u2032 which have ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. But the points with ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are moving in the ''x''-direction of frame S with velocity ''v'', so that they are not coincident with the ''ct'' axis at any time other than zero. Therefore, the ''ct''\u2032 axis is tilted with respect to the ''ct'' axis by an angle ''\u03b8'' given by\n\n: <math>\\tan\\ \\theta = v/c .</math>\n\nThe ''x''\u2032 axis is also tilted with respect to the ''x'' axis. To determine the angle of this tilt, we recall that the slope of the world line of a light pulse is always&nbsp;\u00b11. Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3c presents a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O\u2032. Event P represents the emission of a light pulse at ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''ct''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''a''. The pulse is reflected from a mirror situated a distance ''a'' from the light source (event Q), and returns to the light source at ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;''ct''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a'' (event R).\n\nThe same events P, Q, R are plotted in Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3b in the frame of observer O. The light paths have slopes&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and&nbsp;\u22121 so that \u25b3PQR forms a right triangle.

The frames are actually equivalent. The asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates can map onto a [[Cartesian plane]], and should be considered no stranger than the manner in which, on a [[Mercator projection]] of the Earth, the relative sizes of land masses near the poles (Greenland and Antarctica) are highly exaggerated relative to land masses near the Equator.\n\n{{anchor|Light cone}}\n\n=== Light cone ===\n{{main|light cone}}\n{{anchor|Figure 2-4}}\n[[File:ModernPhysicsSpaceTimeA.png|thumb|Figure 2-4. The light cone centered on an event divides the rest of spacetime into the future, the past, and \"elsewhere\"]]\nIn Fig. 2-4, event&nbsp;O is at the origin of a spacetime diagram, and the two diagonal lines represent all events that have zero spacetime interval with respect to the origin event. These two lines form what is called the ''light cone'' of the event&nbsp;O, since adding a second spatial dimension (Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;5) makes the appearance that of two [[cone|right circular cones]] meeting with their apices at&nbsp;O. One cone extends into the future (t>0), the other into the past (t<0).\n\n[[File:World line.png|thumb|Figure 2-5. Light cone in 2D space plus a time dimension]]\nA light (double) cone divides spacetime into separate regions with respect to its apex. The interior of the future light cone consists of all events that are separated from the apex by more ''time'' (temporal distance) than necessary to cross their ''spatial distance'' at lightspeed; these events comprise the ''timelike future'' of the event&nbsp;O. Likewise, the ''timelike past'' comprises the interior events of the past light cone. So in ''timelike intervals'' &Delta;''ct'' is greater than &Delta;''x'', making timelike intervals positive. The region exterior to the light cone consists of events that are separated from the event&nbsp;O by more ''space'' than can be crossed at lightspeed in the given ''time''. These events comprise the so-called ''spacelike'' region of the event&nbsp;O, denoted  \"Elsewhere\" in Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4. Events on the light cone itself are said to be ''lightlike'' (or ''null separated'') from&nbsp;O.  Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval, all observers will assign the same light cone to any given event, and thus will agree on this division of spacetime.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|220}}\n\nThe light cone has an essential role within the concept of [[causality]]. It is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of&nbsp;O to the position and time of D (Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4). It is hence possible for event&nbsp;O to have a causal influence on event&nbsp;D. The future light cone contains all the events that could be causally influenced by O. Likewise, it is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of A, to the position and time of O. The past light cone contains all the events that could have a causal influence on O. In contrast, assuming that signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, any event, like e.g.&nbsp;B or&nbsp;C, in the spacelike region (Elsewhere), cannot either affect event&nbsp;O, nor can they be affected by event&nbsp;O employing such signalling. Under this assumption any causal relationship between event&nbsp;O and any events in the spacelike region of a light cone is excluded.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Curiel|first1=Erik|last2=Bokulich|first2=Peter|title=Lightcones and Causal Structure|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-singularities/lightcone.html|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Relativity of simultaneity}}\n\n=== Relativity of simultaneity ===\n{{anchor|Figure 2-6}}\n[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity Animation.gif|thumb|Figure 2-6.

Likewise, for any given event, an event within the given event's past light cone occurs ''before'' the given event. The before-after relationship observed for timelike-separated events remains unchanged no matter what the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer, i.e. no matter how the observer may be moving. The situation is quite different for spacelike-separated events. [[#Figure 2-4|'''Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4''']] was drawn from the reference frame of an observer moving at {{nowrap|1=''v'' = 0.}} From this reference frame, event&nbsp;C is observed to occur after event&nbsp;O, and event&nbsp;B is observed to occur before event&nbsp;O. From a different reference frame, the orderings of these non-causally-related events can be reversed. In particular, one notes that if two events are simultaneous in a particular reference frame, they are ''necessarily'' separated by a spacelike interval and thus are noncausally related. The observation that simultaneity is not absolute, but depends on the observer's reference frame, is termed the [[relativity of simultaneity]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Savitt|first1=Steven|title=Being and Becoming in Modern Physics. 3.

Different world lines represent clocks moving at different speeds. A clock that is stationary with respect to the observer has a world line that is vertical, and the elapsed time measured by the observer is the same as the proper time. For a clock traveling at 0.3''c'', the elapsed time measured by the observer is 5.24 meters ({{val|1.75|e=\u22128|u=s}}), while for a clock traveling at 0.7''c'', the elapsed time measured by the observer is 7.00 meters ({{val|2.34|e=\u22128|u=s}}). This illustrates the phenomenon known as [[time dilation]]. Clocks that travel faster take longer (in the observer frame) to tick out the same amount of proper time, and they travel further along the x&ndash;axis within that proper time than they would have without time dilation.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|220\u2013221}} The measurement of time dilation by two observers in different inertial reference frames is mutual.

In the same way that each observer measures the other's clocks as running slow, each observer measures the other's rulers as being contracted.\n\nIn regards to mutual length contraction, [[#Figure 2-9|'''&nbsp;2&#8209;9''']] illustrates that the primed and unprimed frames are mutually [[Lorentz transformation#Coordinate transformation|rotated]] by a [[hyperbolic angle]] (analogous to ordinary angles in Euclidean geometry).<ref group=note>In a [[Cartesian plane]], ordinary rotation leaves a circle unchanged. In spacetime, hyperbolic rotation preserves the [[hyperbolic metric]].</ref> Because of this rotation, the projection of a primed meter-stick onto the unprimed x-axis is foreshortened, while the projection of an unprimed meter-stick onto the primed x\u2032-axis is likewise foreshortened.\n\n=== Mutual time dilation and the twin paradox ===\n{{main|Twin paradox}}\n\n==== Mutual time dilation ====\nMutual time dilation and length contraction tend to strike beginners as inherently self-contradictory concepts. If an observer in frame S measures a clock, at rest in frame S', as running slower than his', while S' is moving at speed ''v'' in S, then the principle of relativity requires that an observer in frame S' likewise measures a clock in frame S, moving at speed \u2212''v'' in S', as running slower than hers. How two clocks can run ''both slower'' than the other, is an important question that \"goes to the heart of understanding special relativity.\"<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|198}}\n\nBasically, this apparent contradiction stems from not correctly taking into account the different settings of the necessary, related measurements. These settings allow for a consistent explanation of the ''only apparent'' contradiction. It is not about the abstract ticking of two identical clocks, but about how to measure in one frame the temporal distance of two ticks of a moving clock. It turns out that in mutually observing the duration between ticks of clocks, each moving in the respective frame, different sets of clocks must be involved. In order to measure in frame S the tick duration of a moving clock W' (at rest in S'), one uses ''two'' additional, synchronized clocks W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub> at rest in two arbitrarily fixed points in S with the spatial distance ''d''.\n:<small>Two events can be defined by the condition \"two clocks are simultaneously at one place\", i.e., when W' passes each  W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>. For both events the two readings of the collocated clocks are recorded. The difference of the two readings of W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub> is the temporal distance of the two events in S, and their spatial distance is ''d''. The difference of the two readings of W' is the temporal distance of the two events in S'. In S' these events are only separated in time, they happen at the same place in S'. Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval spanned by these two events, and the nonzero spatial separation ''d'' in S, the temporal distance in S' must be smaller than the one in S: the ''smaller'' temporal distance between the two events, resulting from the readings of the moving clock W', belongs to the ''slower'' running clock W'.</small>\n\nConversely, for judging in frame S' the temporal distance of two events on a moving clock W (at rest in S), one needs two clocks at rest in S'.\n:<small>In this comparison the clock W is moving by with velocity -''v''. Recording again the four readings for the events, defined by \"two clocks simultaneously at one place\", results in the analogous temporal distances of the two events, now temporally and spatially separated in S', and only temporally separated but collocated in S. To keep the spacetime interval invariant, the temporal distance in S must be smaller than in S', because of the spatial separation of the events in S': now clock W is observed to run slower.</small>\n\nObviously, the necessary recordings for the two judgements, with \"one moving clock\" and \"two clocks at rest\" in respectively S or S', involves two different sets, each with three clocks. Since there are different sets of clocks involved in the measurements, there is no inherent necessity that the measurements be reciprocally \"consistent\" such that, if one observer measures the moving clock to be slow, the other observer measures the one's clock to be fast.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=250\n| image2 = Spacetime Diagrams of Mutual Time Dilation B.png  |width2=300|height2=300\n| image4 = Spacetime Diagrams of Mutual Time Dilation D.png  |width4=300|height4=300\n| footer = Figure 2-10. Mutual time dilation }}\nFig. 2-10 illustrates the previous discussion of mutual time dilation with Minkowski diagrams. The upper picture reflects the measurements as seen from frame S \"at rest\" with unprimed, rectangular axes, and frame S' \"moving with ''v'' > 0\", coordinatized by primed, oblique axes, slanted to the right; the lower picture shows frame S' \"at rest\" with primed, rectangular coordinates, and frame S \"moving with \u2212''v'' < 0\", with unprimed, oblique axes, slanted to the left.\n\nEach line drawn parallel to a spatial axis (''x'', ''x\u2032'') represents a line of simultaneity. All events on such a line have the same time value (''ct'', ''ct\u2032''). Likewise, each line drawn parallel to a temporal axis (''ct'', ''ct\u2032'') represents a line of equal spatial coordinate values (''x'', ''x\u2032'').\n\n:<small>One may designate in both pictures the origin ''O'' (= ''O\u2032'') as the event, where the respective \"moving clock\" is collocated with the \"first clock at rest\" in both comparisons. Obviously, for this event the readings on both clocks in both comparisons are zero. As a consequence, the worldlines of the  moving clocks are the slanted to the right ''ct\u2032''-axis (upper pictures, clock W') and the slanted to the left ''ct''-axes (lower pictures, clock W). The worldlines of W<sub>1</sub> and W'<sub>1</sub> are the corresponding vertical time axes (''ct'' in the upper pictures, and ''ct\u2032'' in the lower pictures).</small>\n\n:<small>In the upper picture the place for W<sub>2</sub> is taken to be ''A''<sub>''x''</sub> > 0, and thus the worldline (not shown in the pictures) of this clock intersects the worldline of the moving clock (the ''ct\u2032''-axis)  in the event labelled ''A'', where \"two clocks are simultaneously at one place\". In the lower picture the place for W'<sub>2</sub> is taken to be ''C''<sub>''x\u2032''</sub> < 0, and so in this measurement the moving clock W passes W'<sub>2</sub> in the event ''C''.</small>\n\n:<small>In the upper picture the ''ct''-coordinate ''A''<sub>''t''</sub> of the event ''A'' (the reading of W<sub>2</sub>) is labeled ''B'', thus giving the elapsed time between the two events, measured with W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>, as ''OB''. For a comparison, the length of the time interval ''OA'', measured with W', must be transformed to the scale of the ''ct''-axis. This is done by the invariant hyperbola (see also Fig. 2-8) through ''A'', connecting all events with the same spacetime interval from the origin as ''A''. This yields the event ''C'' on the ''ct''-axis, and obviously: ''OC'' < ''OB'', the \"moving\" clock W' runs slower.</small>\n\nTo show the mutual time dilation immediately in the upper picture, the event ''D'' may be constructed as the event at ''x\u2032'' = 0 (the location of clock W' in S'), that is simultaneous to ''C'' (''OC'' has equal spacetime interval as ''OA'') in S'. This shows that the time interval ''OD'' is longer than ''OA'', showing that the \"moving\" clock runs slower.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|124}}\n\nIn the lower picture the frame S is moving with velocity -''v'' in the frame S' at rest. The worldline of clock W is the ''ct''-axis (slanted to the left), the worldline of W'<sub>1</sub> is the vertical ''ct\u2032''-axis, and the worldline of W'<sub>2</sub> is the vertical through event ''C'', with ''ct\u2032''-coordinate ''D''. The invariant hyperbola through event ''C'' scales the time interval ''OC'' to ''OA'', which is shorter than ''OD''; also, ''B'' is constructed (similar to ''D'' in the upper pictures) as simultaneous to ''A'' in S, at ''x'' = 0. The result ''OB'' > ''OC'' corresponds again to above.\n\nThe word \"measure\" is important. In classical physics an observer cannot affect an observed object, but the object's state of motion ''can'' affect the observer's ''observations'' of the object.\n\n==== Twin paradox ====\nMany introductions to special relativity illustrate the differences between Galilean relativity and special relativity by posing a series of \"paradoxes\". These paradoxes are, in fact, ill-posed problems, resulting from our unfamiliarity with velocities comparable to the speed of light. The remedy is to solve many problems in special relativity and to become familiar with its so-called counter-intuitive predictions. The geometrical approach to studying spacetime is considered one of the best methods for developing a modern intuition.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\">{{cite book|last1=Schutz|first1=Bernard F.|title=A first course in general relativity|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0521277035|page=26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[twin paradox]] is a [[thought experiment]] involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket, returning home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin observes the other twin as moving, and so at first glance, it would appear that each should find the other to have aged less. The twin paradox sidesteps the justification for mutual time dilation presented above by avoiding the requirement for a third clock.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|207}} Nevertheless, the ''twin paradox'' is not a true paradox because it is easily understood within the context of special relativity.\n\nThe impression that a paradox exists stems from a misunderstanding of what special relativity states. Special relativity does not declare all frames of reference to be equivalent, only inertial frames. The traveling twin's frame is not inertial during periods when she is accelerating. Furthermore, the difference between the twins is observationally detectable: the traveling twin needs to fire her rockets to be able to return home, while the stay-at-home twin does not.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/><ref group=note>Even with no (de)acceleration i.e. using one inertial frame O for constant, high-velocity outward journey and another inertial frame I for constant, high-velocity inward journey - the sum of the elapsed time in those frames (O and I) is shorter than the elapsed time in the stationary inertial frame S. Thus acceleration and deceleration is not the cause of shorter elapsed time during the outward and inward journey. Instead the use of two different constant, high-velocity inertial frames for outward and inward journey is really the cause of shorter elapsed time total. Granted, if the same twin has to travel outward and inward leg of the journey and safely switch from outward to inward leg of the journey, the acceleration and deceleration is required. If the travelling twin could ride the high-velocity outward inertial frame and instantaneously switch to high-velocity inward inertial frame the example would still work. The point is that real reason should be stated clearly. The asymmetry is because of the comparison of sum of elapsed times in two different inertial frames (O and I) to the elapsed time in a single inertial frame S.</ref>  \n\n[[File:Introductory Physics fig 4.9.png|thumb|Figure 2-11. Spacetime explanation of the twin paradox]]\nDeeper analysis is needed before we can understand why these distinctions should result in a difference in the twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the [[Line integral|path integral]]) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.<ref name=\"Weiss\">{{cite web |last1=Weiss |first1=Michael |title=The Twin Paradox |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/TwinParadox/twin_paradox.html |website=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nComplications arise if the twin paradox is analyzed from the traveling twin's point of view.\n\nFor the rest of this discussion, we adopt Weiss's nomenclature, designating the stay-at-home twin as Terence and the traveling twin as Stella.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\nWe had previously noted that Stella is not in an inertial frame. Given this fact, it is sometimes stated that full resolution of the twin paradox requires general relativity. This is not true.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\n:<small>A pure SR analysis would be as follows: Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she fires her rockets for the turnaround, she experiences a pseudo force which resembles a gravitational force.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/> [[#Figure 2-6|'''Figs.&nbsp;2&#8209;6''']] and 2&#8209;11 illustrate the concept of lines (planes) of simultaneity: Lines parallel to the observer's x-axis (xy-plane) represent sets of events that are simultaneous in the observer frame. In Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;11, the blue lines connect events on Terence's world line which, ''from Stella's point of view'', are simultaneous with events on her world line. (Terence, in turn, would observe a set of horizontal lines of simultaneity.) Throughout both the outbound and the inbound legs of Stella's journey, she measures Terence's clocks as running slower than her own. ''But during the turnaround'' (i.e. between the bold blue lines in the figure), a shift takes place in the angle of her lines of simultaneity, corresponding to a rapid skip-over of the events in Terence's world line that Stella considers to be simultaneous with her own. Therefore, at the end of her trip, Stella finds that Terence has aged more than she has.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/></small>\n\nAlthough general relativity is not ''required'' to analyze the twin paradox, application of the [[Equivalence Principle]] of general relativity does provide some additional insight into the subject. We had previously noted that Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip.  When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence's clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing her as if she were in a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of [[gravitational time dilation]], his clock will appear to run fast, so much so that the net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/> As will be discussed in the forthcoming section [[#Curvature of time|'''Curvature of time''']], the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. ''Any'' theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence, including Newton's theory.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16}}\n{{anchor|Gravitation}}\n\n=== Gravitation ===\n<!-- Note to future editors!!!

The forwards and inverse transformations are trivially related to each other, since the ''S'' frame can only be moving forwards or reverse with respect to {{\u2032|''S''}}. So inverting the equations simply entails switching the primed and unprimed variables and replacing ''v'' with \u2212''v''.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|71\u201379}}\n\n<small>'''Example:''' Terence and Stella are at an Earth-to-Mars space race.

Derivation of Lorentz Transformation]]\nThere have been many dozens of [[derivations of the Lorentz transformations]] since Einstein's original work in 1905, each with its particular focus. Although Einstein's derivation was based on the invariance of the speed of light, there are other physical principles that may serve as starting points. Ultimately, these alternative starting points can be considered different expressions of the underlying [[principle of locality]], which states that the influence that one particle exerts on another can not be transmitted instantaneously.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Landau|first1=L.

How do we determine {{\u2032|''w''}} and {{\u2032|''x''}} in terms of ''w'' and ''x''? (Or the other way around, of course.)\n\nIt is easier at first to derive the ''inverse'' Lorentz transformation.\n#We start by noting that there can be no such thing as length expansion/contraction in the transverse directions. ''y{{'}}'' must equal ''y'' and {{\u2032|''z''}} must equal ''z'', otherwise whether a fast moving 1&nbsp;m ball could fit through a 1&nbsp;m circular hole would depend on the observer.

From the inverse transformation, the equations of the forwards transformation can be derived by solving for {{\u2032|''t''}} and {{\u2032|''x''}}.\n\n==== Linearity of the Lorentz transformations ====\nThe Lorentz transformations have a mathematical property called linearity, since ''x{{'}}'' and ''t{{'}}'' are obtained as linear combinations of ''x'' and ''t'', with no higher powers involved. The linearity of the transformation reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|67}} All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|72\u201373}} Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, but there is nothing absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will do just as well.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|190}}\n\nA result of linearity is that if two Lorentz transformations are applied sequentially, the result is also a Lorentz transformation.\n\n<small>'''Example:''' Terence observes Stella speeding away from him at 0.500&nbsp;c, and he can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.500}} to relate Stella's measurements to his own. Stella, in her frame, observes Ursula traveling away from her at 0.250&nbsp;c, and she can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.250}} to relate Ursula's measurements with her own. Because of the linearity of the transformations and the relativistic composition of velocities, Terence can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.666}} to relate Ursula's measurements with his own.</small>\n\n{{anchor|Doppler effect}}\n\n=== Doppler effect ===\n{{main|Doppler effect|Relativistic Doppler effect}}\n\nThe [[Doppler effect]] is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for a receiver and source in relative motion. For simplicity, we consider here two basic scenarios: (1) The motions of the source and/or receiver are exactly along the line connecting them (longitudinal Doppler effect), and (2) the motions are at right angles to the said line ([[transverse Doppler effect]]). We are ignoring scenarios where they move along intermediate angles.\n\n==== Longitudinal Doppler effect ====\nThe classical Doppler analysis deals with waves that are propagating in a medium, such as sound waves or water ripples, and which are transmitted between sources and receivers that are moving towards or away from each other. The analysis of such waves depends on whether the source, the receiver, or both are moving relative to the medium. Given the scenario where the receiver is stationary with respect to the medium, and the source is moving directly away from the receiver at a speed of ''v<sub>s</sub>'' for a velocity parameter of ''&beta;<sub>s</sub>'', the wavelength is increased, and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by\n: <math>f = \\frac{1}{1+\\beta _s}f_0</math>\n\nOn the other hand, given the scenario where source is stationary, and the receiver is moving directly away from the source at a speed of ''v<sub>r</sub>'' for a velocity parameter of ''&beta;<sub>r</sub>'', the wavelength is ''not'' changed, but the transmission velocity of the waves relative to the receiver is decreased, and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by\n: <math>f = (1-\\beta _r)f_0</math>\n\n[[File:Spacetime Diagram of Relativistic Doppler Effect.svg|thumb|Figure 3-6. Spacetime diagram of relativistic Doppler effect]]\nLight, unlike sound or water ripples, does not propagate through a medium, and there is no distinction between a source moving away from the receiver or a receiver moving away from the source. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;6 illustrates a relativistic spacetime diagram showing a source separating from the receiver with a velocity parameter ''&beta;'', so that the separation between source and receiver at time ''w'' is ''&beta;w''. Because of time dilation, {{tmath|1=W=Y W^{\\prime} }}. Since the slope of the green light ray is \u22121, {{tmath|1={T}=W+\\beta w=\\gamma w^{\\prime}(1+\\beta)}}.

Transverse Doppler effect scenarios]]\nSuppose that a source and a receiver, both approaching each other in uniform inertial motion along non-intersecting lines, are at their closest approach to each other. It would appear that the classical analysis predicts that the receiver detects no Doppler shift. Due to subtleties in the analysis, that expectation is not necessarily true. Nevertheless, when appropriately defined, transverse Doppler shift is a relativistic effect that has no classical analog. The subtleties are these:<ref name=\"Morin2008\">{{cite book |last1=Morin |first1=David |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics: With Problems and Solutions |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87622-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocl00mori }}</ref>{{rp|541\u2013543}}\n{{plainlist|\n* Fig. 3-7a. What is the frequency measurement when the receiver is geometrically at its closest approach to the source? This scenario is most easily analyzed from the frame S' of the source.<ref group=note>\nThe ease of analyzing a relativistic scenario often depends on the frame in which one chooses to perform the analysis. '''[[:File:Transverse Doppler effect scenarios 3.svg|In this linked image]],''' we present alternative views of the transverse Doppler shift scenario where source and receiver are at their closest approach to each other.\n\n(a) If we analyze the scenario in the frame of the receiver, we find that the analysis is more complicated than it should be. The apparent position of a celestial object is displaced from its true position (or geometric position) because of the object's motion during the time it takes its light to reach an observer. The source would be time-dilated relative to the receiver, but the redshift implied by this time dilation would be offset by a blueshift due to the longitudinal component of the relative motion between the receiver and the apparent position of the source.\n\n(b) It is much easier if, instead, we analyze the scenario from the frame of the source. An observer situated at the source knows, from the problem statement, that the receiver is at its closest point to him. That means that the receiver has no longitudinal component of motion to complicate the analysis. Since the receiver's clocks are time-dilated relative to the source, the light that the receiver receives is therefore blue-shifted by a factor of ''gamma.''</ref>\n* Fig. 3-7b. What is the frequency measurement when the receiver ''sees'' the source as being closest to it? This scenario is most easily analyzed from the frame S of the receiver.\n\nTwo other scenarios are commonly examined in discussions of transverse Doppler shift:\n* Fig. 3-7c.

If the source is moving in a circle around the receiver, what frequency does the receiver measure?\n}}<!--end plainlist-->\nIn scenario (a), the point of closest approach is frame-independent and represents the moment where there is no change in distance versus time  (i.e. dr/dt&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 where r is the distance between receiver and source) and hence no longitudinal Doppler shift. The source observes the receiver as being illuminated by light of frequency ''f{{'}}'', but also observes the receiver as having a time-dilated clock. In frame&nbsp;S, the receiver is therefore illuminated by [[blueshifted]] light of frequency\n:<math>f = f' \\gamma = f' / \\sqrt { 1 - \\beta ^2  }</math>\n\nIn scenario (b) the illustration shows the receiver being illuminated by light from when the source was closest to the receiver, even though the source has moved on. Because the source's clocks are time dilated as measured in frame S, and since dr/dt was equal to zero at this point, the light from the source, emitted from this closest point, is [[redshifted]] with frequency\n:<math>f = f' / \\gamma = f' \\sqrt { 1 - \\beta ^2  }</math>\n\nScenarios (c) and (d) can be analyzed by simple time dilation arguments. In (c), the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of <math>\\gamma</math>, and in (d), the light is redshifted. The only seeming complication is that the orbiting objects are in accelerated motion. However, if an inertial observer looks at an accelerating clock, only the clock's instantaneous speed is important when computing time dilation. (The converse, however, is not true.)<ref name=\"Morin2008\"/>{{rp|541\u2013543}} Most reports of transverse Doppler shift refer to the effect as a redshift and analyze the effect in terms of scenarios (b) or (d).<ref group=note>Not all experiments characterize the effect in terms of a redshift.

Relativistic spacetime momentum vector]]\nIn classical mechanics, the state of motion of a particle is characterized by its mass and its velocity. [[Linear momentum]], the product of a particle's mass and velocity, is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, possessing the same direction as the velocity: {{math|1='''''p'''''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'''v'''''}}. It is a ''conserved'' quantity, meaning that if a [[closed system]] is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change.\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the momentum vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector is a time component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector {{tmath|(x,t)}}. In exploring the properties of the spacetime momentum, we start, in Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;8a, by examining what a particle looks like at rest. In the rest frame, the spatial component of the momentum is zero, i.e. {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}}, but the time component equals ''mc''.\n\nWe can obtain the transformed components of this vector in the moving frame by using the Lorentz transformations, or we can read it directly from the figure because we know that {{tmath|1=(m c)^{\\prime}=y m c}} and {{tmath|1=p^{\\prime}=-\\beta y m c}}, since the red axes are rescaled by gamma. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;8b illustrates the situation as it appears in the moving frame. It is apparent that the space and time components of the four-momentum go to infinity as the velocity of the moving frame approaches ''c''.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|84\u201387}}\n\nWe will use this information shortly to obtain an expression for the [[four-momentum]].\n\n==== Momentum of light ====\n[[File:Calculating the energy of light in different inertial frames.svg|thumb|Figure 3-9. Energy and momentum of light in different inertial frames]]\nLight particles, or photons, travel at the speed of ''c'', the constant that is conventionally known as the ''speed of light''. This statement is not a tautology, since many modern formulations of relativity do not start with constant speed of light as a postulate. Photons therefore propagate along a light-like world line and, in appropriate units, have equal space and time components for every observer.\n\nA consequence of [[Maxwell's theory]] of electromagnetism is that light carries energy and momentum, and that their ratio is a constant: {{tmath|1=E/p = c}}. Rearranging, {{tmath|1=E/c = p}}, and since for photons, the space and time components are equal, ''E/c'' must therefore be equated with the time component of the spacetime momentum vector.\n\nPhotons travel at the speed of light, yet have finite momentum and energy. For this to be so, the mass term in ''&gamma;mc'' must be zero, meaning that photons are [[massless particle]]s. Infinity times zero is an ill-defined quantity, but ''E/c'' is well-defined.\n\nBy this analysis, if the energy of a photon equals ''E'' in the rest frame, it equals {{tmath|1=E^{\\prime}=(1-\\beta) \\gamma E }}in a moving frame. This result can be derived by inspection of Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;9 or by application of the Lorentz transformations, and is consistent with the analysis of Doppler effect given previously.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|88}}\n\n==== Mass-energy relationship ====\nConsideration of the interrelationships between the various components of the relativistic momentum vector led Einstein to several famous conclusions.\n\n*In the low speed limit as {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v/c''}} approaches zero, {{mvar|&gamma;}} approaches 1, so the spatial component of the relativistic momentum {{tmath|1=\\beta y m c=y m v}} approaches ''mv'', the classical term for momentum. Following this perspective, ''&gamma;m'' can be interpreted as a relativistic generalization of ''m''. Einstein proposed that the ''[[relativistic mass]]'' of an object increases with velocity according to the formula {{tmath|1=m_{r e l}=Y m}}.\n*Likewise, comparing the time component of the relativistic momentum with that of the photon, {{tmath|1=y m c=m_{r e l} c=E / c}}, so that Einstein arrived at the relationship {{tmath|1=E=m_{r e l} c^{2} }}. Simplified to the case of zero velocity, this is Einstein's famous equation relating energy and mass.\n\nAnother way of looking at the relationship between mass and energy is to consider a series expansion of {{math|1=''&gamma;mc''<sup>2</sup>}} at low velocity:\n: <math> E = \\gamma m c^2 =\\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta ^ 2}}</math> <math>\\approx m c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 ...</math>\nThe second term is just an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle. Mass indeed appears to be another form of energy.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|90\u201392}}<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|129\u2013130,180}}\n\nThe concept of relativistic mass that Einstein introduced in 1905, ''m<sub>rel</sub>'', although amply validated every day in particle accelerators around the globe (or indeed in any instrumentation whose use depends on high velocity particles, such as electron microscopes,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=H.

In 1915, [[Emmy Noether]] discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Byers|first1=Nina|title=E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws|eprint=physics/9807044|year=1998}}</ref> The fact that physical processes don't care ''where'' in space they take place ([[space translation symmetry]]) yields [[conservation of momentum]], the fact that such processes don't care ''when'' they take place ([[time translation symmetry]]) yields [[conservation of energy]], and so on. In this section, we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.\n\n==== Total momentum ====\n[[File:Relativistic conservation of momentum.png|thumb|Figure 3-10. Relativistic conservation of momentum]]\nTo understand how the Newtonian view of conservation of momentum needs to be modified in a relativistic context, we examine the problem of two colliding bodies limited to a single dimension.\n\nIn Newtonian mechanics, two extreme cases of this problem may be distinguished yielding mathematics of minimum complexity: \n:(1) The two bodies rebound from each other in a completely elastic collision. \n:(2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely inelastic collision. \nFor both cases (1) and (2), momentum, mass, and total energy are conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of inelastic collision. A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.\n\nIn case (2), two masses with momentums {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\boldsymbol{1} }=m_{t} \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{1} } }} \nand {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\boldsymbol{2} }=m_{t} \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{2} } }} collide to produce a single particle of conserved mass {{tmath|1=m=m_{1}+m_{2} }} traveling at the [[center of mass]] velocity of the original system, <math>\\boldsymbol{v_{c m}}=\\left(m_{1} \\boldsymbol{v_1}+m_{2} \\boldsymbol{v_2}\\right) /\\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\\right) </math>. The total momentum {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p=p_{1}+p_{2} } }} is conserved.\n\nFig.&nbsp;3&#8209;10 illustrates the inelastic collision of two particles from a relativistic perspective. The time components {{tmath|E_{1} / c}} and {{tmath|E_{2} / c}} add up to total ''E/c'' of the resultant vector, meaning that energy is conserved. Likewise, the space components {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p_{1} } }} and {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p_{2} } }} add up to form ''p'' of the resultant vector. The four-momentum is, as expected, a conserved quantity. However, the invariant mass of the fused particle, given by the point where the invariant hyperbola of the total momentum intersects the energy axis, is not equal to the sum of the invariant masses of the individual particles that collided. Indeed, it is larger than the sum of the individual masses: {{tmath|1=m>m_{1}+m_{2} }}.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|94\u201397}}\n\nLooking at the events of this scenario in reverse sequence, we see that non-conservation of mass is a common occurrence: when an unstable [[elementary particle]] spontaneously decays into two lighter particles, total energy is conserved, but the mass is not. Part of the mass is converted into kinetic energy.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|134\u2013138}}\n\n==== Choice of reference frames ====\n{{multiple image|align=right|image1=2-body Particle Decay-Lab.svg|width1=115|image2=2-body Particle Decay-CoM.svg|width2=105|caption1=Figure 3-11. <br/>(above) '''Lab Frame'''.<br/>(right) '''Center of Momentum Frame'''.|&nbsp;}}\nThe freedom to choose any frame in which to perform an analysis allows us to pick one which may be particularly convenient. For analysis of momentum and energy problems, the most convenient frame is usually the \"[[center-of-momentum frame]]\" (also called the zero-momentum frame, or COM frame). This is the frame in which the space component of the system's total momentum is zero. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;11 illustrates the breakup of a high speed particle into two daughter particles. In the lab frame, the daughter particles are preferentially emitted in a direction oriented along the original particle's trajectory. In the COM frame, however, the two daughter particles are emitted in opposite directions, although their masses and the magnitude of their velocities are generally not the same.\n\n[[#Contents|''Return to Introduction'']]\n\n==== Energy and momentum conservation ====\nIn a Newtonian analysis of interacting particles, transformation between frames is simple because all that is necessary is to apply the Galilean transformation to all velocities. Since {{tmath|1=v' = v - u}}, the momentum {{tmath|1=p' = p - mu}}. If the total momentum of an interacting system of particles is observed to be conserved in one frame, it will likewise be observed to be conserved in any other frame.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|241\u2013245}}\n\nConservation of momentum in the COM frame amounts to the requirement that {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} both before and after collision. In the Newtonian analysis, conservation of mass dictates that {{tmath|1=m=m_{1}+m_{2} }}. In the simplified, one-dimensional scenarios that we have been considering, only one additional constraint is necessary before the outgoing momenta of the particles can be determined&mdash;an energy condition. In the one-dimensional case of a completely elastic collision with no loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles in the COM frame will be precisely equal and opposite to their incoming velocities. In the case of a completely inelastic collision with total loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles will be zero.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|241\u2013245}}\n\nNewtonian momenta, calculated as {{tmath|1=p = mv}}, fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation. The linear transformation of velocities {{tmath|1=v' = v - u}} is replaced by the highly nonlinear\n{{tmath|1=v^{\\prime}=(v-u) \\Big/\\left(1- \\frac{v u} { c^{2} }\\right)}} so that a calculation demonstrating conservation of momentum in one frame will be invalid in other frames. Einstein was faced with either having to give up conservation of momentum, or to change the definition of momentum. As we have discussed in the previous section on [[#Four-momentum|'''four-momentum''']], this second option was what he chose.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|104}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | width             = 220\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Energy-momentum diagram for pion decay (A).png\n | width1            = <!-- displayed width of image; overridden by \"width\" above -->\n | alt1              = \n | caption1          = Figure 3-12a.

Indeed, none of the elementary derivations of special relativity require them. But once understood, {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}}, and more generally [[tensors]], greatly simplify the mathematics and conceptual understanding of special relativity. Working exclusively with such objects leads to formulas that are ''manifestly'' relativistically invariant, which is a considerable advantage in non-trivial contexts. For instance, demonstrating relativistic invariance of [[Maxwell's equations]] in their usual form is not trivial, while it is merely a routine calculation (really no more than an observation) using the [[field strength tensor]] formulation. On the other hand, general relativity, from the outset, relies heavily on {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}}, and more generally tensors, representing physically relevant entities. Relating these via equations that do not rely on specific coordinates requires tensors, capable of connecting such  {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}} even within a ''curved'' spacetime, and not just within a ''flat'' one as in special relativity. The study of tensors is outside the scope of this article, which provides only a basic discussion of spacetime.\n\n==== Definition of 4-vectors ====\nA 4-tuple, {{tmath|1=A=\\left(A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}\\right)}} is a \"4-vector\" if its component ''A<sub>&thinsp;i</sub>'' transform between frames according to the Lorentz transformation.\n\nIf using {{tmath|1=(ct, x, y, z)}} coordinates, ''A'' is a {{nowrap|1=4\u2013vector}} if it transforms (in the {{nowrap|1=''x''-direction}}) according to\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  A_0' &= \\gamma \\left( A_0 - (v/c) A_1 \\right)  \\\\ \n  A_1' &= \\gamma \\left( A_1 - (v/c) A_0 \\right)\\\\\n  A_2' &= A_2 \\\\ \n  A_3' &= A_3\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich comes from simply replacing ''ct'' with ''A''<sub>0</sub> and ''x'' with ''A''<sub>1</sub> in the earlier presentation of the [[#Lorentz transformations|'''Lorentz transformation.''']]\n\nAs usual, when we write ''x'', ''t'', etc. we generally mean ''&Delta;x'', ''&Delta;t'' etc.\n\nThe last three components of a {{nowrap|1=4\u2013vector}} must be a standard vector in three-dimensional space.

The difference between special and general relativity is that (1) In special relativity, all velocities are relative, but acceleration is absolute. (2) In general relativity, all motion is relative, whether inertial, accelerating, or rotating. To accommodate this difference, general relativity uses curved spacetime.<ref name=\"PhysicsFAQ\"/>\n\nIn this section, we analyze several scenarios involving accelerated reference frames.\n\n{{anchor|Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox}}\n\n==== Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox ====\n{{main|Bell's spaceship paradox}}\n\nThe Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox ([[Bell's spaceship paradox]]) is a good example of a problem where intuitive reasoning unassisted by the geometric insight of the spacetime approach can lead to issues.\n\n[[File:Bell's spaceship paradox - two spaceships - initial setup.png|thumb|Figure 4-4. Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox]]\nIn Fig.&nbsp;4&#8209;4, two identical spaceships float in space and are at rest relative to each other. They are connected by a string which is capable of only a limited amount of stretching before breaking. At a given instant in our frame, the observer frame, both spaceships accelerate in the same direction along the line between them with the same constant proper acceleration.<ref group=note>In relativity theory, proper acceleration is the physical acceleration (i.e., measurable acceleration as by an accelerometer) experienced by an object. It is thus acceleration relative to a free-fall, or inertial, observer who is momentarily at rest relative to the object being measured.</ref> Will the string break?\n\nThe [[Bell's spaceship paradox|main article for this section]] recounts how, when the paradox was new and relatively unknown, even professional physicists had difficulty working out the solution. Two lines of reasoning lead to opposite conclusions. Both arguments, which are presented below, are flawed even though one of them yields the correct answer.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n# To observers in the rest frame, the spaceships start a distance ''L'' apart and remain the same distance apart during acceleration. During acceleration, ''L'' is a length contracted distance of the distance {{nowrap|1=''L{{'}} = &gamma;L''}} in the frame of the accelerating spaceships. After a sufficiently long time, ''&gamma;'' will increase to a sufficiently large factor that the string must break.\n# Let ''A'' and ''B'' be the rear and front spaceships. In the frame of the spaceships, each spaceship sees the other spaceship doing the same thing that it is doing. ''A'' says that ''B'' has the same acceleration that he has, and ''B'' sees that ''A'' matches her every move. So the spaceships stay the same distance apart, and the string does not break.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n\nThe problem with the first argument is that there is no \"frame of the spaceships.\" There cannot be, because the two spaceships measure a growing distance between the two. Because there is no common frame of the spaceships, the length of the string is ill-defined. Nevertheless, the conclusion is correct, and the argument is mostly right. The second argument, however, completely ignores the relativity of simultaneity.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n\n[[File:Bell observers experiment2.png|thumb|Figure 4-5.

Instead, the satellite moves through space only in response to local conditions. Since spacetime is everywhere locally flat when considered on a sufficiently small scale, the satellite is always following a straight line in its local inertial frame. We say that the satellite always follows along the path of a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]]. No evidence of gravitation can be discovered following alongside the motions of a single particle.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>{{rp|175\u2013190}}\n\nIn any analysis of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative accelerations of ''two'' bodies or two separated particles. In Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational field of the Earth, exhibit tidal accelerations due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a different path through spacetime. The tidal accelerations that these particles exhibit with respect to each other do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described them in terms of the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal accelerations are strictly local. It is the cumulative total effect of many local manifestations of curvature that result in the ''appearance'' of a gravitational force acting at a long range from Earth.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>{{rp|175\u2013190}}\n\nTwo central propositions underlie general relativity. \n* The first crucial concept is coordinate independence: The laws of physics cannot depend on what coordinate system one uses. This is a major extension of the principle of relativity from the version used in special relativity, which states that the laws of physics must be the same for every observer moving in non-accelerated (inertial) reference frames.

Einstein's argument suggesting gravitational redshift]]\nIn the discussion of special relativity, forces played no more than a background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run at the same rate as the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a ''global'' inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, ''local'' inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\"/>{{rp|118\u2013126}}\n\nShortly after the publication of the general theory in 1916, a number of scientists pointed out that general relativity predicts the existence of gravitational redshift. Einstein himself suggested the following [[thought experiment]]: (i) Assume that a tower of height ''h'' (Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;3) has been constructed. (ii) Drop a particle of rest mass ''m'' from the top of the tower. It falls freely with acceleration ''g'', reaching the ground with velocity {{math|1=''v'' = (2''gh'')<sup>1/2</sup>}}, so that its total energy ''E'', as measured by an observer on the ground, is {{tmath|1=m + \\frac{\\frac 1 2 m v^2} {c^2} = m + \\frac{m g h} {c^2} }} (iii) A mass-energy converter transforms the total energy of the particle into a single high energy photon, which it directs upward. (iv) At the top of the tower, an energy-mass converter transforms the energy of the photon ''E{{'}}'' back into a particle of rest mass ''m{{'}}''.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\"/>{{rp|118\u2013126}}\n\nIt must be that {{math|1=''m'' = ''m{{'}}''}}, since otherwise one would be able to construct a [[perpetual motion]] device. We therefore predict that {{math|1=''E{{'}}'' = ''m''}}, so that\n: <math>\\frac{E'}{E} = \\frac{h \\nu \\, '}{ h \\nu} = \\frac{m}{m + \\frac{mgh}{c^2}} = 1 - \\frac{gh}{c^2}</math>\n\nA photon climbing in Earth's gravitational field loses energy and is redshifted. Early attempts to measure this redshift through astronomical observations were somewhat inconclusive, but definitive laboratory observations were performed by [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment|Pound & Rebka (1959)]] and later by Pound & Snider (1964).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mester |first1=John |title=Experimental Tests of General Relativity |url=https://luth2.obspm.fr/IHP06/lectures/mester-vinet/IHP-2GravRedshift.pdf |publisher=Laboratoire Univers et Th\u00e9ories |accessdate=9 June 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318085505/https://luth2.obspm.fr/IHP06/lectures/mester-vinet/IHP-2GravRedshift.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nLight has an associated frequency, and this frequency may be used to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next to her on the tower. Light going up the tower is just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive at the top of the tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16\u201318}} For a 1&nbsp;km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4&nbsp;nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.\n\nClocks in a gravitational field do not all run at the same rate. Experiments such as the Pound\u2013Rebka experiment have firmly established curvature of the time component of spacetime. The Pound\u2013Rebka experiment says nothing about curvature of the ''space'' component of spacetime. But the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation do not depend on the details of general relativity at all. ''Any'' theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16}} This includes Newtonian gravitation. A standard demonstration in general relativity is to show how, in the \"[[Newtonian limit]]\" (i.e. the particles are moving slowly, the gravitational field is weak, and the field is static), curvature of time alone is sufficient to derive Newton's law of gravity.<ref name=\"Carroll\">{{cite arxiv|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Lecture Notes on General Relativity|date=2 December 1997|eprint=gr-qc/9712019}}</ref>{{rp|101\u2013106}}\n\nNewtonian gravitation is a theory of curved time. General relativity is a theory of curved time ''and'' curved space. Given ''G'' as the gravitational constant, ''M'' as the mass of a Newtonian star, and orbiting bodies of insignificant mass at distance ''r'' from the star, the spacetime interval for Newtonian gravitation is one for which only the time coefficient is variable:<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|229\u2013232}}\n: <math>\\Delta s^2 = \\left( 1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2 r} \\right) (c \\Delta t)^2 - \\, (\\Delta x)^2 - (\\Delta y)^2 - (\\Delta z)^2 </math>\n\n{{anchor|Curvature of space}}\n\n=== Curvature of space ===\nThe <math>(1 - 2GM/(c^2 r) )</math> coefficient in front of <math>(c \\Delta t)^2</math> describes the curvature of time in Newtonian gravitation, and this curvature completely accounts for all Newtonian gravitational effects.

The reason is that planetary velocities are extremely small compared to the speed of light, so that for planets and satellites of the solar system, the <math>(c \\Delta t)^2</math> term dwarfs the spatial terms.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|234\u2013238}}\n\nDespite the minuteness of the spatial terms, the first indications that something was wrong with Newtonian gravitation were discovered over a century-and-a-half ago. In 1859, [[Urbain Le Verrier]], in an analysis of available timed observations of transits of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848, reported that known physics could not explain the orbit of Mercury, unless there possibly existed a planet or asteroid belt within the orbit of Mercury.

Origin of gravitomagnetism]]\nIt is well known that the force of magnetism can be deduced by applying the rules of special relativity to moving charges. (An eloquent demonstration of this was presented by Feynman in volume II, {{nowrap|1=chapter 13\u20136}} of his ''Lectures on Physics'', available online.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=R.

In Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;7a, two parallel, infinitely long streams of massive particles have equal and opposite velocities \u2212''v'' and +''v'' relative to a test particle at rest and centered between the two. Because of the symmetry of the setup, the net force on the \ncentral particle is zero. Assume {{tmath|1=v \\ll c}} so that velocities are simply additive.  Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;7b shows exactly the same setup, but in the frame of the upper stream. The test particle has a velocity of +''v'', and the bottom stream has a velocity of +2''v''. Since the physical situation has not changed, only the frame in which things are observed, the test particle should not be attracted towards either stream. But it is not at all clear that the forces exerted on the test particle are equal. (1) Since the bottom stream is moving faster than the top, each particle in the bottom stream has a larger mass energy than a particle in the top. (2) Because of Lorentz contraction, there are more particles per unit length in the bottom stream than in the top stream. (3) Another contribution to the active gravitational mass of the bottom stream comes from an additional pressure term which, at this point, we do not have sufficient background to discuss. All of these effects together would seemingly demand that the test particle be drawn towards the bottom stream.\n\n[[File:Galaxies-AGN-Inner-Structure.svg|right|thumb|Figure 5-8.

Taken together, {{nowrap|1=mass-energy}}, momentum, pressure and stress all serve as sources of gravity: Collectively, they are what tells spacetime how to curve.\n\nGeneral relativity predicts that pressure acts as a gravitational source with exactly the same strength as mass-energy density. The inclusion of pressure as a source of gravity leads to dramatic differences between the predictions of general relativity versus those of Newtonian gravitation. For example, the pressure term sets a maximum limit to the mass of a [[neutron star]]. The more massive a neutron star, the more pressure is required to support its weight against gravity. The increased pressure, however, adds to the gravity acting on the star's mass. Above a certain mass determined by the [[Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit]], the process becomes runaway and the neutron star collapses to a [[black hole]].<ref name=Schutz/>{{rp|243,280}}\n\nThe stress terms become highly significant when performing calculations such as hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kuroda |first1=Takami |last2=Kotake |first2=Kei |last3=Takiwaki |first3=Tomoya |title=Fully General Relativistic Simulations of Core-Collapse Supernovae with An Approximate Neutrino Transport |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=755 |issue=1 |pages=11 |arxiv=1202.2487 |year=2012 |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/755/1/11 |bibcode=2012ApJ...755...11K }}</ref>\n\n==== Experimental verification ====\nThese predictions for the roles of pressure, momentum and stress as sources of spacetime curvature are elegant and play an important role in theory.

[[Minkowski diagram|Spacetime diagrams]] can be used to visualize [[Special relativity|relativistic]] effects, such as why different observers perceive where and when events occur differently.\n\nUntil the 20th century, it was assumed that the three-dimensional geometry of the universe (its spatial expression in terms of coordinates, distances, and directions) was independent of one-dimensional time. However, in 1905, [[Albert Einstein]] based [[wikisource:Translation:On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|a work on special relativity]] on two postulates:\n\n* The laws of physics are [[Invariant (physics)|invariant]] (i.e., identical) in all [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial systems]] (i.e., non-accelerating frames of reference)\n* The [[speed of light]] in a [[vacuum]] is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.\n\nThe logical consequence of taking these postulates together is the inseparable joining together of the four dimensions\u2014hitherto assumed as independent\u2014of space and time. Many counterintuitive consequences emerge: in addition to being independent of the motion of the light source, the speed of light has the same speed regardless of the frame of reference in which it is measured; the distances and even temporal ordering of pairs of events change when measured in different [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frames of reference]] (this is the [[relativity of simultaneity]]); and the linear additivity of velocities no longer holds true.\n\nEinstein framed his theory in terms of [[kinematics]] (the study of moving bodies). His theory was an advance over [[History of special relativity#Lorentz's 1904 model|Lorentz's 1904 theory of electromagnetic phenomena]] and [[History of special relativity#Poincar\u00e9's dynamics of the electron|Poincar\u00e9's electrodynamic theory]]. Although these theories included equations identical to those that Einstein introduced (i.e. the [[Lorentz transformation]]), they were essentially ad&nbsp;hoc models proposed to explain the results of various experiments\u2014including the famous [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment|Michelson\u2013Morley interferometer experiment]]\u2014that were extremely difficult to fit into existing paradigms.\n\nIn 1908, [[Hermann Minkowski]]\u2014once one of the math professors of a young Einstein in Z\u00fcrich\u2014presented a geometric interpretation of special relativity that fused time and the three spatial dimensions of space into a single four-dimensional continuum now known as [[Minkowski space]]. A key feature of this interpretation is the formal definition of the spacetime interval. Although measurements of distance and time between [[Event (relativity)|events]] differ for measurements made in different reference frames, the spacetime interval is independent of the inertial frame of reference in which they are recorded.\n\nMinkowski's geometric interpretation of relativity was to prove vital to Einstein's development of his 1915 [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]], wherein he showed how [[stress\u2013energy tensor|mass and energy]] [[Riemann curvature tensor|curve]] flat spacetime into a [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]].\n\n{{anchor|Contents}}\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{anchor|Introduction}}\n{{anchor|Definitions}}\n\n=== Definitions ===\n<!-- Note to future editors!!!

[[General relativity]] also provides an explanation of how [[gravitational fields]] can slow the passage of time for an object as seen by an observer outside the field.\n\nIn ordinary space, a position is specified by three numbers, known as [[dimension#In physics|dimensions]]. In the [[Cartesian coordinate system]], these are called x, y, and z. A position in spacetime is called an ''event'', and requires four numbers to be specified: the three-dimensional location in space, plus the position in time (Fig.&nbsp;1). Spacetime is thus [[Four-dimensional space|four dimensional]]. An event is something that happens instantaneously at a single point in spacetime, represented by a set of coordinates ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and ''t''.\n\nThe word \"event\" used in relativity should not be confused with the use of the word \"event\" in normal conversation, where it might refer to an \"event\" as something such as a concert, sporting event, or a battle. These are not mathematical \"events\" in the way the word is used in relativity, because they have finite durations and extents. Unlike the analogies used to explain events, such as firecrackers or lightning bolts, mathematical events have zero duration and represent a single point in spacetime.\n\nThe path of a particle through spacetime can be considered to be a succession of events. The series of events can be linked together to form a line which represents a particle's progress through spacetime. That line is called the particle's ''world line''.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|105}}\n\nMathematically, spacetime is a ''[[manifold]]'', which is to say, it appears locally \"flat\" near each point in the same way that, at small enough scales, a globe appears flat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rowland |first1=Todd |title=Manifold |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Manifold.html |website=Wolfram Mathworld |publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref> An extremely large scale factor, <math>c</math> (conventionally called the ''speed-of-light'') relates distances measured in space with distances measured in time.

It was only with the advent of sensitive scientific measurements in the mid-1800s, such as the [[Fizeau experiment]] and the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]], that puzzling discrepancies began to be noted between observation versus predictions based on the implicit assumption of Euclidean space.<ref name=\"French\">{{cite book|last1=French|first1=A.P.|title=Special Relativity|date=1968|publisher=CRC Press|location=[[Boca Raton, Florida]]|isbn=0748764224|pages=35\u201360}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Figure 1-1}}\n[[File:Observer in special relativity.svg|thumb|Figure 1-1.

This usage differs significantly from the ordinary English meaning of the term. Reference frames are inherently nonlocal constructs, and according to this usage of the term, it does not make sense to speak of an observer as having a location. In Fig.&nbsp;1&#8209;1, imagine that the frame under consideration is equipped with a dense lattice of clocks, synchronized within this reference frame, that extends indefinitely throughout the three dimensions of space. Any specific location within the lattice is not important. The latticework of clocks is used to determine the time and position of events taking place within the whole frame. The term ''observer'' refers to the entire ensemble of clocks associated with one inertial frame of reference.<ref name=\"Taylor\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/spacetime_physics/|title=Spacetime Physics: Introduction to Special Relativity|last1=Taylor|first1=Edwin F.|last2=Wheeler|first2=John Archibald|date=1992|publisher=Freeman|isbn=071670336X|edition=2nd|location=San Francisco|pages=|accessdate=14 April 2017}}</ref>{{rp|17\u201322}} In this idealized case, every point in space has a clock associated with it, and thus the clocks register each event instantly, with no time delay between an event and its recording. A real observer, however, will see a delay between the emission of a signal and its detection due to the speed of light. To synchronize the clocks, in the [[data reduction]] following an experiment, the time when a signal is received will be corrected to reflect its actual time were it to have been recorded by an idealized lattice of clocks.\n\nIn many books on special relativity, especially older ones, the word \"observer\" is used in the more ordinary sense of the word. It is usually clear from context which meaning has been adopted.\n\nPhysicists distinguish between what one ''measures'' or ''observes'' (after one has factored out signal propagation delays), versus what one visually sees without such corrections. Failure to understand [[Special relativity#Measurement versus visual appearance|the difference between what one measures/observes versus what one sees]] is the source of much error among beginning students of relativity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scherr|first1=Rachel E.|last2=Shaffer|first2=Peter S.|last3=Vokos|first3=Stamatis|title=Student understanding of time in special relativity: Simultaneity and reference frames|journal=American Journal of Physics|date=July 2001|volume=69|issue=S1|pages=S24\u2013S35|doi=10.1119/1.1371254|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0207/0207109.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2017|bibcode = 2001AmJPh..69S..24S |arxiv=physics/0207109}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\n{{anchor|History}}\n{{main | History of special relativity|History of Lorentz transformations}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction         = vertical\n | width             = 220\n | image1            = Michelson-Morley experiment conducted with white light.png\n <!-- | caption1          = -->\n | image2            = MichelsonMorleyAnimationDE.gif\n | caption2          = Figure 1-2.

Among other issues, the dependence of the partial [[aether-dragging]] implied by this experiment on the index of refraction (which is dependent on wavelength) led to the unpalatable conclusion that aether ''simultaneously'' flows at different speeds for different colors of light.<ref name=Stachel>{{cite book |last=Stachel |first=John |editor1-last=Kox |editor1-first=A.

(No length changes occur in directions transverse to the direction of motion.)\n\nBy 1904, Lorentz had expanded his theory such that he had arrived at equations formally identical with those that Einstein were to derive later (i.e. the [[Lorentz transform]]), but with a fundamentally different interpretation. As a theory of [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] (the study of forces and torques and their effect on motion), his theory assumed actual physical deformations of the physical constituents of matter.<ref name=\"Pais\">{{cite book|last1=Pais|first1=Abraham|title=\"\"Subtle is the Lord-- \": The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein|date=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=019853907X|edition=11th|url=https://archive.org/details/subtleislordscie00pais}}</ref>{{rp|163\u2013174}} Lorentz's equations predicted a quantity that he called ''local time'', with which he could explain the [[aberration of light]], the Fizeau experiment and other phenomena.

However, in order to complete his search for general relativity that started in 1907, the geometric interpretation of relativity proved to be vital, and in 1916, Einstein fully acknowledged his indebtedness to Minkowski, whose interpretation greatly facilitated the transition to general relativity.<ref name=\"Pais\"/>{{rp|151\u2013152}} Since there are other types of spacetime, such as the curved spacetime of general relativity, the spacetime of special relativity is today known as ''Minkowski spacetime.''\n\n== Spacetime in special relativity ==\n{{anchor|Spacetime interval}} <!-- This section is linked from [[Lorentz transformation]] -->\n\n=== Spacetime interval ===\nIn three-dimensions, the ''distance'' <math>\\Delta{d}</math> between two points can be defined using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\Delta{d}\\right)}^2 = {\\left(\\Delta{x}\\right)}^2 + {\\left(\\Delta{y}\\right)}^2 + {\\left(\\Delta{z}\\right)}^2</math>\nAlthough two viewers may measure the x,y, and z position of the two points using different coordinate systems, the distance between the points will be the same for both (assuming that they are measuring using the same units). The distance is \"invariant\".\n\nIn special relativity, however, the distance between two points is no longer the same if measured by two different observers when one of the observers is moving, because of [[Lorentz contraction]].  The situation is even more complicated if the two points are separated in time as well as in space. For example, if one observer sees two events occur at the same place, but at different times, a person moving with respect to the first observer will see the two events occurring at different places, because (from their point of view) they are stationary, and the position of the event is receding or approaching.  Thus, a different measure must be used to measure the effective \"distance\" between two events.\n\nIn four-dimensional spacetime, the analog to distance is the ''interval''.  Although time comes in as a fourth dimension, it is treated differently than the spatial dimensions. Minkowski space hence differs in important respects from [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional Euclidean space]]. The fundamental reason for merging space and time into spacetime is that space and time are separately not invariant, which is to say that, under the proper conditions, different observers will disagree on the length of time between two ''[[event (relativity)|events]]'' (because of [[time dilation]]) or the distance between the two events (because of [[length contraction]]). But special relativity provides a new invariant, called the ''spacetime interval'', which combines distances in space and in time. All observers who measure time and distance carefully will find the same spacetime interval between any two events. Suppose an observer measures two events as being separated in time by <math>\\Delta t</math> and a spatial distance <math>\\Delta x</math>. Then the spacetime interval <math>{\\left(\\Delta{s}\\right)}^2</math> between the two events that are separated by a distance <math>\\Delta{x}</math> in space and by <math>\\Delta{ct}= c\\Delta t</math> in the <math>ct</math>-coordinate is:\n\n:<math>(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta ct)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 </math>, or for three space dimensions, <math>(\\Delta s)^2 = (\\Delta ct)^2 - (\\Delta x)^2 - (\\Delta y)^2 - (\\Delta z)^2</math><ref>{{cite book |title=Differential Manifolds and Theoretical Physics |first1=W.

In addition, C illustrates the world line of a slower-than-light-speed object. The vertical time coordinate is scaled by <math>\\textrm{c}</math> so that it has the same units (meters) as the horizontal space coordinate. Since photons travel at the speed of light, their world lines have a slope of \u00b11.

With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. In Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;2, two [[Galilean reference frame]]s (i.e. conventional 3-space frames) are displayed in relative motion.

Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3b illustrates a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O. Since S and S\u2032 are in standard configuration, their origins coincide at times ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in frame S and ''t''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 in frame S'. The ''ct''\u2032 axis passes through the events in frame S\u2032 which have ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. But the points with ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are moving in the ''x''-direction of frame S with velocity ''v'', so that they are not coincident with the ''ct'' axis at any time other than zero. Therefore, the ''ct''\u2032 axis is tilted with respect to the ''ct'' axis by an angle ''\u03b8'' given by\n\n: <math>\\tan\\ \\theta = v/c .</math>\n\nThe ''x''\u2032 axis is also tilted with respect to the ''x'' axis. To determine the angle of this tilt, we recall that the slope of the world line of a light pulse is always&nbsp;\u00b11. Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3c presents a spacetime diagram from the viewpoint of observer O\u2032. Event P represents the emission of a light pulse at ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, ''ct''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''a''. The pulse is reflected from a mirror situated a distance ''a'' from the light source (event Q), and returns to the light source at ''x''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;''ct''\u2032&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a'' (event R).\n\nThe same events P, Q, R are plotted in Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;3b in the frame of observer O.

The frames are actually equivalent. The asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates can map onto a [[Cartesian plane]], and should be considered no stranger than the manner in which, on a [[Mercator projection]] of the Earth, the relative sizes of land masses near the poles (Greenland and Antarctica) are highly exaggerated relative to land masses near the Equator.\n\n{{anchor|Light cone}}\n\n=== Light cone ===\n{{main|light cone}}\n{{anchor|Figure 2-4}}\n[[File:ModernPhysicsSpaceTimeA.png|thumb|Figure 2-4. The light cone centered on an event divides the rest of spacetime into the future, the past, and \"elsewhere\"]]\nIn Fig. 2-4, event&nbsp;O is at the origin of a spacetime diagram, and the two diagonal lines represent all events that have zero spacetime interval with respect to the origin event. These two lines form what is called the ''light cone'' of the event&nbsp;O, since adding a second spatial dimension (Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;5) makes the appearance that of two [[cone|right circular cones]] meeting with their apices at&nbsp;O. One cone extends into the future (t>0), the other into the past (t<0).\n\n[[File:World line.png|thumb|Figure 2-5. Light cone in 2D space plus a time dimension]]\nA light (double) cone divides spacetime into separate regions with respect to its apex. The interior of the future light cone consists of all events that are separated from the apex by more ''time'' (temporal distance) than necessary to cross their ''spatial distance'' at lightspeed; these events comprise the ''timelike future'' of the event&nbsp;O. Likewise, the ''timelike past'' comprises the interior events of the past light cone. So in ''timelike intervals'' &Delta;''ct'' is greater than &Delta;''x'', making timelike intervals positive. The region exterior to the light cone consists of events that are separated from the event&nbsp;O by more ''space'' than can be crossed at lightspeed in the given ''time''. These events comprise the so-called ''spacelike'' region of the event&nbsp;O, denoted  \"Elsewhere\" in Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4. Events on the light cone itself are said to be ''lightlike'' (or ''null separated'') from&nbsp;O.  Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval, all observers will assign the same light cone to any given event, and thus will agree on this division of spacetime.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|220}}\n\nThe light cone has an essential role within the concept of [[causality]]. It is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of&nbsp;O to the position and time of D (Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4). It is hence possible for event&nbsp;O to have a causal influence on event&nbsp;D. The future light cone contains all the events that could be causally influenced by O. Likewise, it is possible for a not-faster-than-light-speed signal to travel from the position and time of A, to the position and time of O. The past light cone contains all the events that could have a causal influence on O. In contrast, assuming that signals cannot travel faster than the speed of light, any event, like e.g.&nbsp;B or&nbsp;C, in the spacelike region (Elsewhere), cannot either affect event&nbsp;O, nor can they be affected by event&nbsp;O employing such signalling. Under this assumption any causal relationship between event&nbsp;O and any events in the spacelike region of a light cone is excluded.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Curiel|first1=Erik|last2=Bokulich|first2=Peter|title=Lightcones and Causal Structure|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spacetime-singularities/lightcone.html|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=26 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Relativity of simultaneity}}\n\n=== Relativity of simultaneity ===\n{{anchor|Figure 2-6}}\n[[File:Relativity of Simultaneity Animation.gif|thumb|Figure 2-6.

Likewise, for any given event, an event within the given event's past light cone occurs ''before'' the given event. The before-after relationship observed for timelike-separated events remains unchanged no matter what the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer, i.e. no matter how the observer may be moving. The situation is quite different for spacelike-separated events. [[#Figure 2-4|'''Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;4''']] was drawn from the reference frame of an observer moving at {{nowrap|1=''v'' = 0.}} From this reference frame, event&nbsp;C is observed to occur after event&nbsp;O, and event&nbsp;B is observed to occur before event&nbsp;O. From a different reference frame, the orderings of these non-causally-related events can be reversed. In particular, one notes that if two events are simultaneous in a particular reference frame, they are ''necessarily'' separated by a spacelike interval and thus are noncausally related. The observation that simultaneity is not absolute, but depends on the observer's reference frame, is termed the [[relativity of simultaneity]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Savitt|first1=Steven|title=Being and Becoming in Modern Physics. 3.

Different world lines represent clocks moving at different speeds. A clock that is stationary with respect to the observer has a world line that is vertical, and the elapsed time measured by the observer is the same as the proper time. For a clock traveling at 0.3''c'', the elapsed time measured by the observer is 5.24 meters ({{val|1.75|e=\u22128|u=s}}), while for a clock traveling at 0.7''c'', the elapsed time measured by the observer is 7.00 meters ({{val|2.34|e=\u22128|u=s}}). This illustrates the phenomenon known as [[time dilation]]. Clocks that travel faster take longer (in the observer frame) to tick out the same amount of proper time, and they travel further along the x&ndash;axis within that proper time than they would have without time dilation.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|220\u2013221}} The measurement of time dilation by two observers in different inertial reference frames is mutual.

Measurement of length requires measurement of the spacetime interval between two events that are simultaneous in one's frame of reference. But events that are simultaneous in one frame of reference are, in general, not simultaneous in other frames of reference.\n\nFig. 2-9 illustrates the motions of a 1&nbsp;m rod that is traveling at 0.5&nbsp;''c'' along the ''x'' axis.

The endpoints O and B measured when {{\u2032|''t''}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 are simultaneous events in the S\u2032 frame. But to an observer in frame S, events O and B are not simultaneous. To measure length, the observer in frame S measures the endpoints of the rod as projected onto the ''x''-axis along their world lines. The projection of the rod's ''world sheet'' onto the ''x'' axis yields the foreshortened length OC.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|125}}\n\n(not illustrated) Drawing a vertical line through A so that it intersects the ''x''' axis demonstrates that, even as OB is foreshortened from the point of view of observer O, OA is likewise foreshortened from the point of view of observer O\u2032. In the same way that each observer measures the other's clocks as running slow, each observer measures the other's rulers as being contracted.\n\nIn regards to mutual length contraction, [[#Figure 2-9|'''&nbsp;2&#8209;9''']] illustrates that the primed and unprimed frames are mutually [[Lorentz transformation#Coordinate transformation|rotated]] by a [[hyperbolic angle]] (analogous to ordinary angles in Euclidean geometry).<ref group=note>In a [[Cartesian plane]], ordinary rotation leaves a circle unchanged.

If an observer in frame S measures a clock, at rest in frame S', as running slower than his', while S' is moving at speed ''v'' in S, then the principle of relativity requires that an observer in frame S' likewise measures a clock in frame S, moving at speed \u2212''v'' in S', as running slower than hers. How two clocks can run ''both slower'' than the other, is an important question that \"goes to the heart of understanding special relativity.\"<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|198}}\n\nBasically, this apparent contradiction stems from not correctly taking into account the different settings of the necessary, related measurements. These settings allow for a consistent explanation of the ''only apparent'' contradiction. It is not about the abstract ticking of two identical clocks, but about how to measure in one frame the temporal distance of two ticks of a moving clock. It turns out that in mutually observing the duration between ticks of clocks, each moving in the respective frame, different sets of clocks must be involved. In order to measure in frame S the tick duration of a moving clock W' (at rest in S'), one uses ''two'' additional, synchronized clocks W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub> at rest in two arbitrarily fixed points in S with the spatial distance ''d''.\n:<small>Two events can be defined by the condition \"two clocks are simultaneously at one place\", i.e., when W' passes each  W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>. For both events the two readings of the collocated clocks are recorded. The difference of the two readings of W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub> is the temporal distance of the two events in S, and their spatial distance is ''d''. The difference of the two readings of W' is the temporal distance of the two events in S'. In S' these events are only separated in time, they happen at the same place in S'. Because of the invariance of the spacetime interval spanned by these two events, and the nonzero spatial separation ''d'' in S, the temporal distance in S' must be smaller than the one in S: the ''smaller'' temporal distance between the two events, resulting from the readings of the moving clock W', belongs to the ''slower'' running clock W'.</small>\n\nConversely, for judging in frame S' the temporal distance of two events on a moving clock W (at rest in S), one needs two clocks at rest in S'.\n:<small>In this comparison the clock W is moving by with velocity -''v''. Recording again the four readings for the events, defined by \"two clocks simultaneously at one place\", results in the analogous temporal distances of the two events, now temporally and spatially separated in S', and only temporally separated but collocated in S. To keep the spacetime interval invariant, the temporal distance in S must be smaller than in S', because of the spatial separation of the events in S': now clock W is observed to run slower.</small>\n\nObviously, the necessary recordings for the two judgements, with \"one moving clock\" and \"two clocks at rest\" in respectively S or S', involves two different sets, each with three clocks. Since there are different sets of clocks involved in the measurements, there is no inherent necessity that the measurements be reciprocally \"consistent\" such that, if one observer measures the moving clock to be slow, the other observer measures the one's clock to be fast.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 1|total_width=250\n| image2 = Spacetime Diagrams of Mutual Time Dilation B.png  |width2=300|height2=300\n| image4 = Spacetime Diagrams of Mutual Time Dilation D.png  |width4=300|height4=300\n| footer = Figure 2-10. Mutual time dilation }}\nFig. 2-10 illustrates the previous discussion of mutual time dilation with Minkowski diagrams. The upper picture reflects the measurements as seen from frame S \"at rest\" with unprimed, rectangular axes, and frame S' \"moving with ''v'' > 0\", coordinatized by primed, oblique axes, slanted to the right; the lower picture shows frame S' \"at rest\" with primed, rectangular coordinates, and frame S \"moving with \u2212''v'' < 0\", with unprimed, oblique axes, slanted to the left.\n\nEach line drawn parallel to a spatial axis (''x'', ''x\u2032'') represents a line of simultaneity. All events on such a line have the same time value (''ct'', ''ct\u2032''). Likewise, each line drawn parallel to a temporal axis (''ct'', ''ct\u2032'') represents a line of equal spatial coordinate values (''x'', ''x\u2032'').\n\n:<small>One may designate in both pictures the origin ''O'' (= ''O\u2032'') as the event, where the respective \"moving clock\" is collocated with the \"first clock at rest\" in both comparisons. Obviously, for this event the readings on both clocks in both comparisons are zero. As a consequence, the worldlines of the  moving clocks are the slanted to the right ''ct\u2032''-axis (upper pictures, clock W') and the slanted to the left ''ct''-axes (lower pictures, clock W). The worldlines of W<sub>1</sub> and W'<sub>1</sub> are the corresponding vertical time axes (''ct'' in the upper pictures, and ''ct\u2032'' in the lower pictures).</small>\n\n:<small>In the upper picture the place for W<sub>2</sub> is taken to be ''A''<sub>''x''</sub> > 0, and thus the worldline (not shown in the pictures) of this clock intersects the worldline of the moving clock (the ''ct\u2032''-axis)  in the event labelled ''A'', where \"two clocks are simultaneously at one place\". In the lower picture the place for W'<sub>2</sub> is taken to be ''C''<sub>''x\u2032''</sub> < 0, and so in this measurement the moving clock W passes W'<sub>2</sub> in the event ''C''.</small>\n\n:<small>In the upper picture the ''ct''-coordinate ''A''<sub>''t''</sub> of the event ''A'' (the reading of W<sub>2</sub>) is labeled ''B'', thus giving the elapsed time between the two events, measured with W<sub>1</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>, as ''OB''. For a comparison, the length of the time interval ''OA'', measured with W', must be transformed to the scale of the ''ct''-axis. This is done by the invariant hyperbola (see also Fig. 2-8) through ''A'', connecting all events with the same spacetime interval from the origin as ''A''. This yields the event ''C'' on the ''ct''-axis, and obviously: ''OC'' < ''OB'', the \"moving\" clock W' runs slower.</small>\n\nTo show the mutual time dilation immediately in the upper picture, the event ''D'' may be constructed as the event at ''x\u2032'' = 0 (the location of clock W' in S'), that is simultaneous to ''C'' (''OC'' has equal spacetime interval as ''OA'') in S'. This shows that the time interval ''OD'' is longer than ''OA'', showing that the \"moving\" clock runs slower.<ref name=\"Collier\"/>{{rp|124}}\n\nIn the lower picture the frame S is moving with velocity -''v'' in the frame S' at rest. The worldline of clock W is the ''ct''-axis (slanted to the left), the worldline of W'<sub>1</sub> is the vertical ''ct\u2032''-axis, and the worldline of W'<sub>2</sub> is the vertical through event ''C'', with ''ct\u2032''-coordinate ''D''. The invariant hyperbola through event ''C'' scales the time interval ''OC'' to ''OA'', which is shorter than ''OD''; also, ''B'' is constructed (similar to ''D'' in the upper pictures) as simultaneous to ''A'' in S, at ''x'' = 0. The result ''OB'' > ''OC'' corresponds again to above.\n\nThe word \"measure\" is important. In classical physics an observer cannot affect an observed object, but the object's state of motion ''can'' affect the observer's ''observations'' of the object.\n\n==== Twin paradox ====\nMany introductions to special relativity illustrate the differences between Galilean relativity and special relativity by posing a series of \"paradoxes\". These paradoxes are, in fact, ill-posed problems, resulting from our unfamiliarity with velocities comparable to the speed of light. The remedy is to solve many problems in special relativity and to become familiar with its so-called counter-intuitive predictions. The geometrical approach to studying spacetime is considered one of the best methods for developing a modern intuition.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\">{{cite book|last1=Schutz|first1=Bernard F.|title=A first course in general relativity|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0521277035|page=26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[twin paradox]] is a [[thought experiment]] involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket, returning home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin observes the other twin as moving, and so at first glance, it would appear that each should find the other to have aged less. The twin paradox sidesteps the justification for mutual time dilation presented above by avoiding the requirement for a third clock.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|207}} Nevertheless, the ''twin paradox'' is not a true paradox because it is easily understood within the context of special relativity.\n\nThe impression that a paradox exists stems from a misunderstanding of what special relativity states. Special relativity does not declare all frames of reference to be equivalent, only inertial frames. The traveling twin's frame is not inertial during periods when she is accelerating. Furthermore, the difference between the twins is observationally detectable: the traveling twin needs to fire her rockets to be able to return home, while the stay-at-home twin does not.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/><ref group=note>Even with no (de)acceleration i.e. using one inertial frame O for constant, high-velocity outward journey and another inertial frame I for constant, high-velocity inward journey - the sum of the elapsed time in those frames (O and I) is shorter than the elapsed time in the stationary inertial frame S. Thus acceleration and deceleration is not the cause of shorter elapsed time during the outward and inward journey. Instead the use of two different constant, high-velocity inertial frames for outward and inward journey is really the cause of shorter elapsed time total. Granted, if the same twin has to travel outward and inward leg of the journey and safely switch from outward to inward leg of the journey, the acceleration and deceleration is required. If the travelling twin could ride the high-velocity outward inertial frame and instantaneously switch to high-velocity inward inertial frame the example would still work. The point is that real reason should be stated clearly. The asymmetry is because of the comparison of sum of elapsed times in two different inertial frames (O and I) to the elapsed time in a single inertial frame S.</ref>  \n\n[[File:Introductory Physics fig 4.9.png|thumb|Figure 2-11. Spacetime explanation of the twin paradox]]\nDeeper analysis is needed before we can understand why these distinctions should result in a difference in the twins' ages. Consider the spacetime diagram of Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;11. This presents the simple case of a twin going straight out along the x axis and immediately turning back. From the standpoint of the stay-at-home twin, there is nothing puzzling about the twin paradox at all. The proper time measured along the traveling twin's world line from O to C, plus the proper time measured from C to B, is less than the stay-at-home twin's proper time measured from O to A to B. More complex trajectories require integrating the proper time between the respective events along the curve (i.e. the [[Line integral|path integral]]) to calculate the total amount of proper time experienced by the traveling twin.<ref name=\"Weiss\">{{cite web |last1=Weiss |first1=Michael |title=The Twin Paradox |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/TwinParadox/twin_paradox.html |website=The Physics and Relativity FAQ|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nComplications arise if the twin paradox is analyzed from the traveling twin's point of view.\n\nFor the rest of this discussion, we adopt Weiss's nomenclature, designating the stay-at-home twin as Terence and the traveling twin as Stella.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\nWe had previously noted that Stella is not in an inertial frame. Given this fact, it is sometimes stated that full resolution of the twin paradox requires general relativity. This is not true.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/>\n\n:<small>A pure SR analysis would be as follows: Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she fires her rockets for the turnaround, she experiences a pseudo force which resembles a gravitational force.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/> [[#Figure 2-6|'''Figs.&nbsp;2&#8209;6''']] and 2&#8209;11 illustrate the concept of lines (planes) of simultaneity: Lines parallel to the observer's x-axis (xy-plane) represent sets of events that are simultaneous in the observer frame. In Fig.&nbsp;2&#8209;11, the blue lines connect events on Terence's world line which, ''from Stella's point of view'', are simultaneous with events on her world line. (Terence, in turn, would observe a set of horizontal lines of simultaneity.) Throughout both the outbound and the inbound legs of Stella's journey, she measures Terence's clocks as running slower than her own. ''But during the turnaround'' (i.e. between the bold blue lines in the figure), a shift takes place in the angle of her lines of simultaneity, corresponding to a rapid skip-over of the events in Terence's world line that Stella considers to be simultaneous with her own. Therefore, at the end of her trip, Stella finds that Terence has aged more than she has.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/></small>\n\nAlthough general relativity is not ''required'' to analyze the twin paradox, application of the [[Equivalence Principle]] of general relativity does provide some additional insight into the subject. We had previously noted that Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip.  When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence's clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing her as if she were in a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of [[gravitational time dilation]], his clock will appear to run fast, so much so that the net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together.<ref name=\"Weiss\"/> As will be discussed in the forthcoming section [[#Curvature of time|'''Curvature of time''']], the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. ''Any'' theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence, including Newton's theory.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16}}\n{{anchor|Gravitation}}\n\n=== Gravitation ===\n<!-- Note to future editors!!!

Event&nbsp;P has coordinates (''w'',&nbsp;''x'') in the black \"rest system\" and coordinates {{math|1=({{\u2032|''w''}},&nbsp;{{\u2032|''x''}})}} in the red frame that is moving with velocity parameter {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v''/''c''}}. How do we determine {{\u2032|''w''}} and {{\u2032|''x''}} in terms of ''w'' and ''x''? (Or the other way around, of course.)\n\nIt is easier at first to derive the ''inverse'' Lorentz transformation.\n#We start by noting that there can be no such thing as length expansion/contraction in the transverse directions. ''y{{'}}'' must equal ''y'' and {{\u2032|''z''}} must equal ''z'', otherwise whether a fast moving 1&nbsp;m ball could fit through a 1&nbsp;m circular hole would depend on the observer.

From the inverse transformation, the equations of the forwards transformation can be derived by solving for {{\u2032|''t''}} and {{\u2032|''x''}}.\n\n==== Linearity of the Lorentz transformations ====\nThe Lorentz transformations have a mathematical property called linearity, since ''x{{'}}'' and ''t{{'}}'' are obtained as linear combinations of ''x'' and ''t'', with no higher powers involved. The linearity of the transformation reflects a fundamental property of spacetime that we tacitly assumed while performing the derivation, namely, that the properties of inertial frames of reference are independent of location and time. In the absence of gravity, spacetime looks the same everywhere.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|67}} All inertial observers will agree on what constitutes accelerating and non-accelerating motion.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|72\u201373}} Any one observer can use her own measurements of space and time, but there is nothing absolute about them. Another observer's conventions will do just as well.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|190}}\n\nA result of linearity is that if two Lorentz transformations are applied sequentially, the result is also a Lorentz transformation.\n\n<small>'''Example:''' Terence observes Stella speeding away from him at 0.500&nbsp;c, and he can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.500}} to relate Stella's measurements to his own. Stella, in her frame, observes Ursula traveling away from her at 0.250&nbsp;c, and she can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.250}} to relate Ursula's measurements with her own. Because of the linearity of the transformations and the relativistic composition of velocities, Terence can use the Lorentz transformations with {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.666}} to relate Ursula's measurements with his own.</small>\n\n{{anchor|Doppler effect}}\n\n=== Doppler effect ===\n{{main|Doppler effect|Relativistic Doppler effect}}\n\nThe [[Doppler effect]] is the change in frequency or wavelength of a wave for a receiver and source in relative motion. For simplicity, we consider here two basic scenarios: (1) The motions of the source and/or receiver are exactly along the line connecting them (longitudinal Doppler effect), and (2) the motions are at right angles to the said line ([[transverse Doppler effect]]). We are ignoring scenarios where they move along intermediate angles.\n\n==== Longitudinal Doppler effect ====\nThe classical Doppler analysis deals with waves that are propagating in a medium, such as sound waves or water ripples, and which are transmitted between sources and receivers that are moving towards or away from each other. The analysis of such waves depends on whether the source, the receiver, or both are moving relative to the medium. Given the scenario where the receiver is stationary with respect to the medium, and the source is moving directly away from the receiver at a speed of ''v<sub>s</sub>'' for a velocity parameter of ''&beta;<sub>s</sub>'', the wavelength is increased, and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by\n: <math>f = \\frac{1}{1+\\beta _s}f_0</math>\n\nOn the other hand, given the scenario where source is stationary, and the receiver is moving directly away from the source at a speed of ''v<sub>r</sub>'' for a velocity parameter of ''&beta;<sub>r</sub>'', the wavelength is ''not'' changed, but the transmission velocity of the waves relative to the receiver is decreased, and the observed frequency ''f'' is given by\n: <math>f = (1-\\beta _r)f_0</math>\n\n[[File:Spacetime Diagram of Relativistic Doppler Effect.svg|thumb|Figure 3-6. Spacetime diagram of relativistic Doppler effect]]\nLight, unlike sound or water ripples, does not propagate through a medium, and there is no distinction between a source moving away from the receiver or a receiver moving away from the source. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;6 illustrates a relativistic spacetime diagram showing a source separating from the receiver with a velocity parameter ''&beta;'', so that the separation between source and receiver at time ''w'' is ''&beta;w''. Because of time dilation, {{tmath|1=W=Y W^{\\prime} }}. Since the slope of the green light ray is \u22121, {{tmath|1={T}=W+\\beta w=\\gamma w^{\\prime}(1+\\beta)}}.

Transverse Doppler effect scenarios]]\nSuppose that a source and a receiver, both approaching each other in uniform inertial motion along non-intersecting lines, are at their closest approach to each other. It would appear that the classical analysis predicts that the receiver detects no Doppler shift. Due to subtleties in the analysis, that expectation is not necessarily true. Nevertheless, when appropriately defined, transverse Doppler shift is a relativistic effect that has no classical analog. The subtleties are these:<ref name=\"Morin2008\">{{cite book |last1=Morin |first1=David |title=Introduction to Classical Mechanics: With Problems and Solutions |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-87622-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontocl00mori }}</ref>{{rp|541\u2013543}}\n{{plainlist|\n* Fig. 3-7a. What is the frequency measurement when the receiver is geometrically at its closest approach to the source? This scenario is most easily analyzed from the frame S' of the source.<ref group=note>\nThe ease of analyzing a relativistic scenario often depends on the frame in which one chooses to perform the analysis. '''[[:File:Transverse Doppler effect scenarios 3.svg|In this linked image]],''' we present alternative views of the transverse Doppler shift scenario where source and receiver are at their closest approach to each other.\n\n(a) If we analyze the scenario in the frame of the receiver, we find that the analysis is more complicated than it should be. The apparent position of a celestial object is displaced from its true position (or geometric position) because of the object's motion during the time it takes its light to reach an observer. The source would be time-dilated relative to the receiver, but the redshift implied by this time dilation would be offset by a blueshift due to the longitudinal component of the relative motion between the receiver and the apparent position of the source.\n\n(b) It is much easier if, instead, we analyze the scenario from the frame of the source. An observer situated at the source knows, from the problem statement, that the receiver is at its closest point to him. That means that the receiver has no longitudinal component of motion to complicate the analysis. Since the receiver's clocks are time-dilated relative to the source, the light that the receiver receives is therefore blue-shifted by a factor of ''gamma.''</ref>\n* Fig. 3-7b. What is the frequency measurement when the receiver ''sees'' the source as being closest to it? This scenario is most easily analyzed from the frame S of the receiver.\n\nTwo other scenarios are commonly examined in discussions of transverse Doppler shift:\n* Fig. 3-7c. If the receiver is moving in a circle around the source, what frequency does the receiver measure?\n* Fig. 3-7d. If the source is moving in a circle around the receiver, what frequency does the receiver measure?\n}}<!--end plainlist-->\nIn scenario (a), the point of closest approach is frame-independent and represents the moment where there is no change in distance versus time  (i.e. dr/dt&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 where r is the distance between receiver and source) and hence no longitudinal Doppler shift. The source observes the receiver as being illuminated by light of frequency ''f{{'}}'', but also observes the receiver as having a time-dilated clock. In frame&nbsp;S, the receiver is therefore illuminated by [[blueshifted]] light of frequency\n:<math>f = f' \\gamma = f' / \\sqrt { 1 - \\beta ^2  }</math>\n\nIn scenario (b) the illustration shows the receiver being illuminated by light from when the source was closest to the receiver, even though the source has moved on. Because the source's clocks are time dilated as measured in frame S, and since dr/dt was equal to zero at this point, the light from the source, emitted from this closest point, is [[redshifted]] with frequency\n:<math>f = f' / \\gamma = f' \\sqrt { 1 - \\beta ^2  }</math>\n\nScenarios (c) and (d) can be analyzed by simple time dilation arguments. In (c), the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of <math>\\gamma</math>, and in (d), the light is redshifted. The only seeming complication is that the orbiting objects are in accelerated motion. However, if an inertial observer looks at an accelerating clock, only the clock's instantaneous speed is important when computing time dilation. (The converse, however, is not true.)<ref name=\"Morin2008\"/>{{rp|541\u2013543}} Most reports of transverse Doppler shift refer to the effect as a redshift and analyze the effect in terms of scenarios (b) or (d).<ref group=note>Not all experiments characterize the effect in terms of a redshift. For example, the [[Ives\u2013Stilwell experiment#Relativistic Doppler effect|K\u00fcndig experiment]] was set up to measure transverse blueshift using a M\u00f6ssbauer source setup at the center of a centrifuge rotor and an absorber at the rim.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Energy and momentum}}\n\n=== Energy and momentum ===\n{{main|Four-momentum|Momentum|Mass\u2013energy equivalence}}\n\n==== Extending momentum to four dimensions ====\n[[File:Relativistic spacetime momentum vector.svg|thumb|330px|Figure 3-8. Relativistic spacetime momentum vector]]\nIn classical mechanics, the state of motion of a particle is characterized by its mass and its velocity. [[Linear momentum]], the product of a particle's mass and velocity, is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity, possessing the same direction as the velocity: {{math|1='''''p'''''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m'''v'''''}}. It is a ''conserved'' quantity, meaning that if a [[closed system]] is not affected by external forces, its total linear momentum cannot change.\n\nIn relativistic mechanics, the momentum vector is extended to four dimensions. Added to the momentum vector is a time component that allows the spacetime momentum vector to transform like the spacetime position vector {{tmath|(x,t)}}. In exploring the properties of the spacetime momentum, we start, in Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;8a, by examining what a particle looks like at rest. In the rest frame, the spatial component of the momentum is zero, i.e. {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}}, but the time component equals ''mc''.\n\nWe can obtain the transformed components of this vector in the moving frame by using the Lorentz transformations, or we can read it directly from the figure because we know that {{tmath|1=(m c)^{\\prime}=y m c}} and {{tmath|1=p^{\\prime}=-\\beta y m c}}, since the red axes are rescaled by gamma. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;8b illustrates the situation as it appears in the moving frame. It is apparent that the space and time components of the four-momentum go to infinity as the velocity of the moving frame approaches ''c''.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|84\u201387}}\n\nWe will use this information shortly to obtain an expression for the [[four-momentum]].\n\n==== Momentum of light ====\n[[File:Calculating the energy of light in different inertial frames.svg|thumb|Figure 3-9. Energy and momentum of light in different inertial frames]]\nLight particles, or photons, travel at the speed of ''c'', the constant that is conventionally known as the ''speed of light''. This statement is not a tautology, since many modern formulations of relativity do not start with constant speed of light as a postulate. Photons therefore propagate along a light-like world line and, in appropriate units, have equal space and time components for every observer.\n\nA consequence of [[Maxwell's theory]] of electromagnetism is that light carries energy and momentum, and that their ratio is a constant: {{tmath|1=E/p = c}}. Rearranging, {{tmath|1=E/c = p}}, and since for photons, the space and time components are equal, ''E/c'' must therefore be equated with the time component of the spacetime momentum vector.\n\nPhotons travel at the speed of light, yet have finite momentum and energy. For this to be so, the mass term in ''&gamma;mc'' must be zero, meaning that photons are [[massless particle]]s. Infinity times zero is an ill-defined quantity, but ''E/c'' is well-defined.\n\nBy this analysis, if the energy of a photon equals ''E'' in the rest frame, it equals {{tmath|1=E^{\\prime}=(1-\\beta) \\gamma E }}in a moving frame. This result can be derived by inspection of Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;9 or by application of the Lorentz transformations, and is consistent with the analysis of Doppler effect given previously.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|88}}\n\n==== Mass-energy relationship ====\nConsideration of the interrelationships between the various components of the relativistic momentum vector led Einstein to several famous conclusions.\n\n*In the low speed limit as {{math|1=''&beta;''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v/c''}} approaches zero, {{mvar|&gamma;}} approaches 1, so the spatial component of the relativistic momentum {{tmath|1=\\beta y m c=y m v}} approaches ''mv'', the classical term for momentum. Following this perspective, ''&gamma;m'' can be interpreted as a relativistic generalization of ''m''. Einstein proposed that the ''[[relativistic mass]]'' of an object increases with velocity according to the formula {{tmath|1=m_{r e l}=Y m}}.\n*Likewise, comparing the time component of the relativistic momentum with that of the photon, {{tmath|1=y m c=m_{r e l} c=E / c}}, so that Einstein arrived at the relationship {{tmath|1=E=m_{r e l} c^{2} }}. Simplified to the case of zero velocity, this is Einstein's famous equation relating energy and mass.\n\nAnother way of looking at the relationship between mass and energy is to consider a series expansion of {{math|1=''&gamma;mc''<sup>2</sup>}} at low velocity:\n: <math> E = \\gamma m c^2 =\\frac{m c^2}{\\sqrt{1 - \\beta ^ 2}}</math> <math>\\approx m c^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 ...</math>\nThe second term is just an expression for the kinetic energy of the particle. Mass indeed appears to be another form of energy.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|90\u201392}}<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|129\u2013130,180}}\n\nThe concept of relativistic mass that Einstein introduced in 1905, ''m<sub>rel</sub>'', although amply validated every day in particle accelerators around the globe (or indeed in any instrumentation whose use depends on high velocity particles, such as electron microscopes,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=H.

Using an uppercase ''P'' to represent the four-momentum and a lowercase '''''p''''' to denote the spatial momentum, the four-momentum may be written as\n: <math>P \\equiv (E/c, \\vec{p}) = (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z)</math> or alternatively,\n: <math>P \\equiv (E, \\vec{p}) = (E, p_x, p_y, p_z) </math> using the convention that <math>c = 1 .</math><ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|129\u2013130,180}}\n\n{{anchor|Conservation laws}}\n\n=== Conservation laws ===\n{{main|Conservation law}}\n\nIn physics, conservation laws state that certain particular measurable properties of an isolated physical system do not change as the system evolves over time. In 1915, [[Emmy Noether]] discovered that underlying each conservation law is a fundamental symmetry of nature.<ref>{{cite arxiv|last1=Byers|first1=Nina|title=E. Noether's Discovery of the Deep Connection Between Symmetries and Conservation Laws|eprint=physics/9807044|year=1998}}</ref> The fact that physical processes don't care ''where'' in space they take place ([[space translation symmetry]]) yields [[conservation of momentum]], the fact that such processes don't care ''when'' they take place ([[time translation symmetry]]) yields [[conservation of energy]], and so on. In this section, we examine the Newtonian views of conservation of mass, momentum and energy from a relativistic perspective.\n\n==== Total momentum ====\n[[File:Relativistic conservation of momentum.png|thumb|Figure 3-10. Relativistic conservation of momentum]]\nTo understand how the Newtonian view of conservation of momentum needs to be modified in a relativistic context, we examine the problem of two colliding bodies limited to a single dimension.\n\nIn Newtonian mechanics, two extreme cases of this problem may be distinguished yielding mathematics of minimum complexity: \n:(1) The two bodies rebound from each other in a completely elastic collision. \n:(2) The two bodies stick together and continue moving as a single particle. This second case is the case of completely inelastic collision. \nFor both cases (1) and (2), momentum, mass, and total energy are conserved. However, kinetic energy is not conserved in cases of inelastic collision. A certain fraction of the initial kinetic energy is converted to heat.\n\nIn case (2), two masses with momentums {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\boldsymbol{1} }=m_{t} \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{1} } }} \nand {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p}_{\\boldsymbol{2} }=m_{t} \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\boldsymbol{2} } }} collide to produce a single particle of conserved mass {{tmath|1=m=m_{1}+m_{2} }} traveling at the [[center of mass]] velocity of the original system, <math>\\boldsymbol{v_{c m}}=\\left(m_{1} \\boldsymbol{v_1}+m_{2} \\boldsymbol{v_2}\\right) /\\left(m_{1}+m_{2}\\right) </math>. The total momentum {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p=p_{1}+p_{2} } }} is conserved.\n\nFig.&nbsp;3&#8209;10 illustrates the inelastic collision of two particles from a relativistic perspective. The time components {{tmath|E_{1} / c}} and {{tmath|E_{2} / c}} add up to total ''E/c'' of the resultant vector, meaning that energy is conserved. Likewise, the space components {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p_{1} } }} and {{tmath|1=\\boldsymbol{p_{2} } }} add up to form ''p'' of the resultant vector. The four-momentum is, as expected, a conserved quantity. However, the invariant mass of the fused particle, given by the point where the invariant hyperbola of the total momentum intersects the energy axis, is not equal to the sum of the invariant masses of the individual particles that collided. Indeed, it is larger than the sum of the individual masses: {{tmath|1=m>m_{1}+m_{2} }}.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|94\u201397}}\n\nLooking at the events of this scenario in reverse sequence, we see that non-conservation of mass is a common occurrence: when an unstable [[elementary particle]] spontaneously decays into two lighter particles, total energy is conserved, but the mass is not. Part of the mass is converted into kinetic energy.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|134\u2013138}}\n\n==== Choice of reference frames ====\n{{multiple image|align=right|image1=2-body Particle Decay-Lab.svg|width1=115|image2=2-body Particle Decay-CoM.svg|width2=105|caption1=Figure 3-11. <br/>(above) '''Lab Frame'''.<br/>(right) '''Center of Momentum Frame'''.|&nbsp;}}\nThe freedom to choose any frame in which to perform an analysis allows us to pick one which may be particularly convenient. For analysis of momentum and energy problems, the most convenient frame is usually the \"[[center-of-momentum frame]]\" (also called the zero-momentum frame, or COM frame). This is the frame in which the space component of the system's total momentum is zero. Fig.&nbsp;3&#8209;11 illustrates the breakup of a high speed particle into two daughter particles. In the lab frame, the daughter particles are preferentially emitted in a direction oriented along the original particle's trajectory. In the COM frame, however, the two daughter particles are emitted in opposite directions, although their masses and the magnitude of their velocities are generally not the same.\n\n[[#Contents|''Return to Introduction'']]\n\n==== Energy and momentum conservation ====\nIn a Newtonian analysis of interacting particles, transformation between frames is simple because all that is necessary is to apply the Galilean transformation to all velocities. Since {{tmath|1=v' = v - u}}, the momentum {{tmath|1=p' = p - mu}}. If the total momentum of an interacting system of particles is observed to be conserved in one frame, it will likewise be observed to be conserved in any other frame.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|241\u2013245}}\n\nConservation of momentum in the COM frame amounts to the requirement that {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} both before and after collision. In the Newtonian analysis, conservation of mass dictates that {{tmath|1=m=m_{1}+m_{2} }}. In the simplified, one-dimensional scenarios that we have been considering, only one additional constraint is necessary before the outgoing momenta of the particles can be determined&mdash;an energy condition. In the one-dimensional case of a completely elastic collision with no loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles in the COM frame will be precisely equal and opposite to their incoming velocities. In the case of a completely inelastic collision with total loss of kinetic energy, the outgoing velocities of the rebounding particles will be zero.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|241\u2013245}}\n\nNewtonian momenta, calculated as {{tmath|1=p = mv}}, fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation. The linear transformation of velocities {{tmath|1=v' = v - u}} is replaced by the highly nonlinear\n{{tmath|1=v^{\\prime}=(v-u) \\Big/\\left(1- \\frac{v u} { c^{2} }\\right)}} so that a calculation demonstrating conservation of momentum in one frame will be invalid in other frames. Einstein was faced with either having to give up conservation of momentum, or to change the definition of momentum. As we have discussed in the previous section on [[#Four-momentum|'''four-momentum''']], this second option was what he chose.<ref name=\"Bais\"/>{{rp|104}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = right\n | direction         = vertical\n | width             = 220\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Energy-momentum diagram for pion decay (A).png\n | width1            = <!-- displayed width of image; overridden by \"width\" above -->\n | alt1              = \n | caption1          = Figure 3-12a.

Mass is no longer conserved independently, because it has been subsumed into the total relativistic energy.

Indeed, none of the elementary derivations of special relativity require them. But once understood, {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}}, and more generally [[tensors]], greatly simplify the mathematics and conceptual understanding of special relativity. Working exclusively with such objects leads to formulas that are ''manifestly'' relativistically invariant, which is a considerable advantage in non-trivial contexts. For instance, demonstrating relativistic invariance of [[Maxwell's equations]] in their usual form is not trivial, while it is merely a routine calculation (really no more than an observation) using the [[field strength tensor]] formulation. On the other hand, general relativity, from the outset, relies heavily on {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}}, and more generally tensors, representing physically relevant entities. Relating these via equations that do not rely on specific coordinates requires tensors, capable of connecting such  {{nowrap|1=4\u2011vectors}} even within a ''curved'' spacetime, and not just within a ''flat'' one as in special relativity. The study of tensors is outside the scope of this article, which provides only a basic discussion of spacetime.\n\n==== Definition of 4-vectors ====\nA 4-tuple, {{tmath|1=A=\\left(A_{0}, A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}\\right)}} is a \"4-vector\" if its component ''A<sub>&thinsp;i</sub>'' transform between frames according to the Lorentz transformation.\n\nIf using {{tmath|1=(ct, x, y, z)}} coordinates, ''A'' is a {{nowrap|1=4\u2013vector}} if it transforms (in the {{nowrap|1=''x''-direction}}) according to\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  A_0' &= \\gamma \\left( A_0 - (v/c) A_1 \\right)  \\\\ \n  A_1' &= \\gamma \\left( A_1 - (v/c) A_0 \\right)\\\\\n  A_2' &= A_2 \\\\ \n  A_3' &= A_3\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich comes from simply replacing ''ct'' with ''A''<sub>0</sub> and ''x'' with ''A''<sub>1</sub> in the earlier presentation of the [[#Lorentz transformations|'''Lorentz transformation.''']]\n\nAs usual, when we write ''x'', ''t'', etc. we generally mean ''&Delta;x'', ''&Delta;t'' etc.\n\nThe last three components of a {{nowrap|1=4\u2013vector}} must be a standard vector in three-dimensional space.

The rule is that two {{nowrap|1=4-vectors}} are orthogonal if they are offset by equal and opposite angles from the 45\u00b0 line which is the world line of a light ray. This implies that a lightlike {{nowrap|1=4-vector}} is orthogonal with ''itself''.\n* '''Invariance of the magnitude of a vector:''' The magnitude of a vector is the inner product of a {{nowrap|1=4-vector}} with itself, and is a frame-independent property.

Note that a null vector is not the same as a zero vector. A null vector is one for which <math>A \\cdot A = 0 ,</math> while a zero vector is one whose components are all zero.

The difference between special and general relativity is that (1) In special relativity, all velocities are relative, but acceleration is absolute. (2) In general relativity, all motion is relative, whether inertial, accelerating, or rotating. To accommodate this difference, general relativity uses curved spacetime.<ref name=\"PhysicsFAQ\"/>\n\nIn this section, we analyze several scenarios involving accelerated reference frames.\n\n{{anchor|Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox}}\n\n==== Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox ====\n{{main|Bell's spaceship paradox}}\n\nThe Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox ([[Bell's spaceship paradox]]) is a good example of a problem where intuitive reasoning unassisted by the geometric insight of the spacetime approach can lead to issues.\n\n[[File:Bell's spaceship paradox - two spaceships - initial setup.png|thumb|Figure 4-4. Dewan\u2013Beran\u2013Bell spaceship paradox]]\nIn Fig.&nbsp;4&#8209;4, two identical spaceships float in space and are at rest relative to each other. They are connected by a string which is capable of only a limited amount of stretching before breaking. At a given instant in our frame, the observer frame, both spaceships accelerate in the same direction along the line between them with the same constant proper acceleration.<ref group=note>In relativity theory, proper acceleration is the physical acceleration (i.e., measurable acceleration as by an accelerometer) experienced by an object. It is thus acceleration relative to a free-fall, or inertial, observer who is momentarily at rest relative to the object being measured.</ref> Will the string break?\n\nThe [[Bell's spaceship paradox|main article for this section]] recounts how, when the paradox was new and relatively unknown, even professional physicists had difficulty working out the solution. Two lines of reasoning lead to opposite conclusions. Both arguments, which are presented below, are flawed even though one of them yields the correct answer.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n# To observers in the rest frame, the spaceships start a distance ''L'' apart and remain the same distance apart during acceleration. During acceleration, ''L'' is a length contracted distance of the distance {{nowrap|1=''L{{'}} = &gamma;L''}} in the frame of the accelerating spaceships. After a sufficiently long time, ''&gamma;'' will increase to a sufficiently large factor that the string must break.\n# Let ''A'' and ''B'' be the rear and front spaceships. In the frame of the spaceships, each spaceship sees the other spaceship doing the same thing that it is doing. ''A'' says that ''B'' has the same acceleration that he has, and ''B'' sees that ''A'' matches her every move. So the spaceships stay the same distance apart, and the string does not break.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n\nThe problem with the first argument is that there is no \"frame of the spaceships.\" There cannot be, because the two spaceships measure a growing distance between the two. Because there is no common frame of the spaceships, the length of the string is ill-defined. Nevertheless, the conclusion is correct, and the argument is mostly right. The second argument, however, completely ignores the relativity of simultaneity.<ref name=\"Morin\"/>{{rp|106,120\u2013122}}\n\n[[File:Bell observers experiment2.png|thumb|Figure 4-5.

Instead, the satellite moves through space only in response to local conditions. Since spacetime is everywhere locally flat when considered on a sufficiently small scale, the satellite is always following a straight line in its local inertial frame. We say that the satellite always follows along the path of a [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic]]. No evidence of gravitation can be discovered following alongside the motions of a single particle.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>{{rp|175\u2013190}}\n\nIn any analysis of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative accelerations of ''two'' bodies or two separated particles. In Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational field of the Earth, exhibit tidal accelerations due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a different path through spacetime. The tidal accelerations that these particles exhibit with respect to each other do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described them in terms of the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal accelerations are strictly local. It is the cumulative total effect of many local manifestations of curvature that result in the ''appearance'' of a gravitational force acting at a long range from Earth.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/>{{rp|175\u2013190}}\n\nTwo central propositions underlie general relativity. \n* The first crucial concept is coordinate independence: The laws of physics cannot depend on what coordinate system one uses. This is a major extension of the principle of relativity from the version used in special relativity, which states that the laws of physics must be the same for every observer moving in non-accelerated (inertial) reference frames.

Einstein's argument suggesting gravitational redshift]]\nIn the discussion of special relativity, forces played no more than a background role. Special relativity assumes the ability to define inertial frames that fill all of spacetime, all of whose clocks run at the same rate as the clock at the origin. Is this really possible? In a nonuniform gravitational field, experiment dictates that the answer is no. Gravitational fields make it impossible to construct a ''global'' inertial frame. In small enough regions of spacetime, ''local'' inertial frames are still possible. General relativity involves the systematic stitching together of these local frames into a more general picture of spacetime.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\"/>{{rp|118\u2013126}}\n\nShortly after the publication of the general theory in 1916, a number of scientists pointed out that general relativity predicts the existence of gravitational redshift. Einstein himself suggested the following [[thought experiment]]: (i) Assume that a tower of height ''h'' (Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;3) has been constructed. (ii) Drop a particle of rest mass ''m'' from the top of the tower. It falls freely with acceleration ''g'', reaching the ground with velocity {{math|1=''v'' = (2''gh'')<sup>1/2</sup>}}, so that its total energy ''E'', as measured by an observer on the ground, is {{tmath|1=m + \\frac{\\frac 1 2 m v^2} {c^2} = m + \\frac{m g h} {c^2} }} (iii) A mass-energy converter transforms the total energy of the particle into a single high energy photon, which it directs upward. (iv) At the top of the tower, an energy-mass converter transforms the energy of the photon ''E{{'}}'' back into a particle of rest mass ''m{{'}}''.<ref name=\"Schutz1985\"/>{{rp|118\u2013126}}\n\nIt must be that {{math|1=''m'' = ''m{{'}}''}}, since otherwise one would be able to construct a [[perpetual motion]] device. We therefore predict that {{math|1=''E{{'}}'' = ''m''}}, so that\n: <math>\\frac{E'}{E} = \\frac{h \\nu \\, '}{ h \\nu} = \\frac{m}{m + \\frac{mgh}{c^2}} = 1 - \\frac{gh}{c^2}</math>\n\nA photon climbing in Earth's gravitational field loses energy and is redshifted. Early attempts to measure this redshift through astronomical observations were somewhat inconclusive, but definitive laboratory observations were performed by [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment|Pound & Rebka (1959)]] and later by Pound & Snider (1964).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mester |first1=John |title=Experimental Tests of General Relativity |url=https://luth2.obspm.fr/IHP06/lectures/mester-vinet/IHP-2GravRedshift.pdf |publisher=Laboratoire Univers et Th\u00e9ories |accessdate=9 June 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318085505/https://luth2.obspm.fr/IHP06/lectures/mester-vinet/IHP-2GravRedshift.pdf |archivedate=18 March 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nLight has an associated frequency, and this frequency may be used to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock next to her on the tower. Light going up the tower is just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive at the top of the tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16\u201318}} For a 1&nbsp;km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4&nbsp;nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.\n\nClocks in a gravitational field do not all run at the same rate. Experiments such as the Pound\u2013Rebka experiment have firmly established curvature of the time component of spacetime. The Pound\u2013Rebka experiment says nothing about curvature of the ''space'' component of spacetime. But the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation do not depend on the details of general relativity at all. ''Any'' theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence.<ref name=\"Schutz\"/>{{rp|16}} This includes Newtonian gravitation. A standard demonstration in general relativity is to show how, in the \"[[Newtonian limit]]\" (i.e. the particles are moving slowly, the gravitational field is weak, and the field is static), curvature of time alone is sufficient to derive Newton's law of gravity.<ref name=\"Carroll\">{{cite arxiv|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Lecture Notes on General Relativity|date=2 December 1997|eprint=gr-qc/9712019}}</ref>{{rp|101\u2013106}}\n\nNewtonian gravitation is a theory of curved time. General relativity is a theory of curved time ''and'' curved space.

Origin of gravitomagnetism]]\nIt is well known that the force of magnetism can be deduced by applying the rules of special relativity to moving charges. (An eloquent demonstration of this was presented by Feynman in volume II, {{nowrap|1=chapter 13\u20136}} of his ''Lectures on Physics'', available online.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=R.

In Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;7a, two parallel, infinitely long streams of massive particles have equal and opposite velocities \u2212''v'' and +''v'' relative to a test particle at rest and centered between the two. Because of the symmetry of the setup, the net force on the \ncentral particle is zero. Assume {{tmath|1=v \\ll c}} so that velocities are simply additive.  Fig.&nbsp;5&#8209;7b shows exactly the same setup, but in the frame of the upper stream. The test particle has a velocity of +''v'', and the bottom stream has a velocity of +2''v''. Since the physical situation has not changed, only the frame in which things are observed, the test particle should not be attracted towards either stream. But it is not at all clear that the forces exerted on the test particle are equal. (1) Since the bottom stream is moving faster than the top, each particle in the bottom stream has a larger mass energy than a particle in the top. (2) Because of Lorentz contraction, there are more particles per unit length in the bottom stream than in the top stream. (3) Another contribution to the active gravitational mass of the bottom stream comes from an additional pressure term which, at this point, we do not have sufficient background to discuss. All of these effects together would seemingly demand that the test particle be drawn towards the bottom stream.\n\n[[File:Galaxies-AGN-Inner-Structure.svg|right|thumb|Figure 5-8.

Taken together, {{nowrap|1=mass-energy}}, momentum, pressure and stress all serve as sources of gravity: Collectively, they are what tells spacetime how to curve.\n\nGeneral relativity predicts that pressure acts as a gravitational source with exactly the same strength as mass-energy density. The inclusion of pressure as a source of gravity leads to dramatic differences between the predictions of general relativity versus those of Newtonian gravitation.

The increased pressure, however, adds to the gravity acting on the star's mass.

Feldman]], and [[Adam Schroeder]], and written by Niccol. The film stars [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank, adopted and raised by a corporation inside a [[simulated reality|simulated]] television show revolving around his life, until he discovers it and decides to escape.  Additional roles are performed by [[Laura Linney]], [[Noah Emmerich]], [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Holland Taylor]], [[Ed Harris]], and [[Brian Delate]].\n\n''The Truman Show'' was originally a [[spec script]] by Niccol, inspired by an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' called \"[[Special Service]]\".<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904060604576574592522839126 | title=Films Inspired by Rod Serling's \"The Twilight Zone\" \u2013 Snapshot | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=September 23, 2011 | accessdate=July 14, 2012 | author=Steinberg, Don}}</ref> Unlike the finished product, it was more of a [[science-fiction]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in [[New York City]]. [[Scott Rudin]] purchased the script, and set up production at [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Brian De Palma]] was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million\u2014$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at [[Seaside, Florida]], a master-[[planned community]] located in the [[Florida Panhandle]].\n\nThe film was a financial success, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the [[71st Academy Awards]], [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], [[52nd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[The Saturn Award]]s. ''The Truman Show'' has been analyzed as a [[thesis]] on [[Christianity]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[simulated reality]], [[existentialism]], and [[reality television]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTruman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of ''The Truman Show'', a [[reality television]] program broadcast live around the clock worldwide. He has spent his entire life in the seaside town of Seahaven Island, which in reality is an enormous set near [[Hollywood]], equipped with state of the art technology to simulate day and night and weather conditions, as well as 5000 cameras to record Truman's every move. The producers discourage Truman from leaving Seahaven by instilling him with [[aquaphobia]] through the \"death\" of his TV father in a boating \"accident\", and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling. All of Seahaven's other residents are actors. Christof, the show's creator and executive producer, seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behaviour and give audiences a relatable everyman.\n\nDespite Christof's control, he could not predict all of Truman\u2019s actions. During his college years, Truman was intended to fall in love with and marry co-student Meryl, but fell for Sylvia, an [[Extra (acting)|extra]]. Sylvia warned him that his reality is fake before being removed from the show, where Truman is told she moved to [[Fiji]] with her father. While Truman went on to marry Meryl, he continues to think about Sylvia. He uses scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret, and seeks travel to Fiji. Outside of the show, Sylvia has become part of a \"Free Truman\" campaign that demands the end of the show and Truman's freedom and accuses Christof of making his life worse, which Christof denies.\n\nAs the show goes on, Truman starts noticing unusual events: a spotlight falling out of the sky, a radio frequency that precisely describes his movements, and rain that falls only on him. Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back onto the set, but other actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure him, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress; during an argument with Truman, she [[breaking character|breaks character]] and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof re-introduces Truman's father to the show properly, under the guise of having [[amnesia|lost his memory]] after the boating accident. This helps the show regain the ratings lead with audiences and Truman seems to return to his routines, except he begins sleeping in his basement.\n\nOne evening, the production staff discovers that the sleeping Truman is completely out of their sight. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, finding that he has left a snowman dummy and a tape recorder playing snoring sounds in his place, and has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, revealing that Truman is gone, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history, while a citywide search for Truman is launched. Audiences around the world, including the media, are drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat, after an attempt to fetch Truman fails. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but, while Christof\u2019s bosses and assistants demand that he ends the show, Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.\n\nTruman continues to sail until, to his despair, his boat strikes the wall of the dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is \"no more truth\" in the real world and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: \"In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night,\" (previously his catch-phrase), takes a bow, and exits. The viewers cheer Truman on, while Sylvia races to greet him. A defeated Christof's supervisors end the program for the last time and the viewers check their television guides to see what else is on television.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank: Chosen out of six unwanted pregnancies to be the first child legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has a job in the insurance business and a wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. [[Robin Williams]] was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' because Carrey's performance reminded him of [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name=\"pro\" /> Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in comedic roles.<ref>{{cite news | author = Weinraub, Bernard | title = Director Tries a Fantasy As He Questions Reality | work = The New York Times | date = May 21, 1998 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E0D71539F932A15756C0A96E958260 | accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do ''The Truman Show'' for $12 million.<ref name=\"12mil\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/new-truman-villain-harris-1117435072/|title=New ''Truman'' villain: Harris|date=April 7, 1997|work=Variety|author=Busch, Anita M.|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref> Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's [[improvisation]]al skills, and the two became more interactive.<ref name=\"pro\" /> The scene in which Truman declares \"this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy\" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.<ref name=\"part2\" />\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Hannah Gill acting as Meryl Burbank, Truman's wife, a nurse at the local hospital. Since the show relies on [[product placement]] for revenue, Meryl regularly shows off various items she has recently \"purchased\", one of the many oddities that makes Truman question his life. Her role is to act the part of Truman's wife and ultimately to have a child by him, despite her reluctance to accomplish either. Linney heavily studied [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears catalogs]] from the 1950s to develop her character's poses.<ref name=\"part1\" />\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Christof: The creator of ''The Truman Show''. Christof remains dedicated to the program at all costs, often overseeing and directing its course in person (rather than through aides), but at the climax, he speaks to Truman over a loudspeaker, revealing the nature of Truman's situation. [[Dennis Hopper]] was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 (during filming) over \"creative differences\". Harris was a last-minute replacement.<ref name=\"12mil\" /> Hopper later stated he was fired after two days because Weir and producer [[Scott Rudin]] had made a deal that if they didn't both approve of Hopper's performance, they would replace him.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/at-home-with-dennis-hopper | title=Farewell then Dennis Hopper}}</ref> A number of other actors had turned down the role after Hopper's departure.<ref name=\"part2\" /> Harris considered making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.<ref name=\"pro\" />\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Louis Coltrane playing Marlon, Truman's best friend since early childhood. Marlon is a [[vending machine]] operator for the company Goodies, who promises Truman he would never lie to him, despite the latest events in Truman's life. Emmerich has said, \"My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious drug addiction for many years. Been in and out of rehab.\"<ref name=\"pro\" /> Very little of this is shown in the finished film, but several deleted scenes depict Louis actively expressing guilt over Truman's situation, and in one sequence he spots Truman during his escape and purposely says nothing. His name is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgam]] of two jazz musicians, [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[John Coltrane]], and in one scene he plays trumpet.\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia was hired to play a background extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but was thrown out of the show before she could do so. She then becomes a protester against ''The Truman Show'', urging Christof to release its lead.\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Alanis Montclair playing Angela Burbank, Truman's mother: Christof orders that she attempt to persuade Truman to have children.\n* [[Brian Delate]] as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his character on the show was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and as he tries to get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Simeon (control room director). Though second-in-command at the lunar room, he is conflicted when ordered to attempt to kill Truman via storm.\n* [[Peter Krause]] as Laurence (Truman's boss): At Truman's office, Laurence often interrupts Truman when he talks about his dreams of moving to [[Fiji]].\n\n==Production==\n[[Andrew Niccol]] completed a one-page [[film treatment]] titled ''The Malcolm Show'' in May 1991.<ref>{{cite news | author = Benedict Carver | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117477740 | title = 'Truman' suit retort | work = Variety | date = June 22, 1998 | accessdate = May 15, 2009}}</ref> The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in New York City.<ref name=\"part1\">{{Cite video |title=How's It Going to End?

It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7.\" Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later on in 1995, Jim Carrey signed to star,<ref name=\"part1\" /> but because of commitments with ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' and ''[[Liar Liar]]'', he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year.<ref name=\"pro\" /> Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role.<ref name=\"part1\" /> Niccol rewrote the script twelve times,<ref name=\"pro\" /> while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history.

[[Sound stage]]s at Universal Studios were reserved for the story's setting of Seahaven before Weir's wife introduced him to [[Seaside, Florida]], a \"master-planned community\" located in the Florida Panhandle. Pre-production offices were immediately opened in Seaside, where the majority of filming took place.

He feels trapped into a familial and social world to which he tries to conform while being unable to entirely identify with it, believing that he has no other choice (other than through the fantasy of fleeing to a far-way island). Eventually, Truman gains sufficient awareness of his condition to \"leave home\"{{mdash}}developing a more mature and authentic identity as an adult, leaving his child-self behind and becoming a ''True''-man.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-8315.2008.00030.x |title=The Truman Show: How's it going to end? |year=2008 |last1=Brearley |first1=Michael |last2=Sabbadini |first2=Andrea |journal=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=433\u201340 |pmid=18405297}}</ref>}}\n\n===Similarity to ''Utopia''===\nParallels can be drawn from [[Thomas More]]'s 1516 book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', in which More describes an island with only one entrance and only one exit. Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to ''The Truman Show'' because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's ''Utopia'' and real-life groups such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]].<ref name=\"Robert\" /> It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban \"[[picket fence]]\" appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the \"[[American Dream]]\" of the 1950s. The \"American Dream\" concept in Truman's world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant.<ref name=\"Robert\">Beuka, Robert.

Feldman]], and [[Adam Schroeder]], and written by Niccol. The film stars [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank, adopted and raised by a corporation inside a [[simulated reality|simulated]] television show revolving around his life, until he discovers it and decides to escape.  Additional roles are performed by [[Laura Linney]], [[Noah Emmerich]], [[Natascha McElhone]], [[Holland Taylor]], [[Ed Harris]], and [[Brian Delate]].\n\n''The Truman Show'' was originally a [[spec script]] by Niccol, inspired by an episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' called \"[[Special Service]]\".<ref name=\"wsj\">{{cite web | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111904060604576574592522839126 | title=Films Inspired by Rod Serling's \"The Twilight Zone\" \u2013 Snapshot | work=The Wall Street Journal | date=September 23, 2011 | accessdate=July 14, 2012 | author=Steinberg, Don}}</ref> Unlike the finished product, it was more of a [[science-fiction]] [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in [[New York City]]. [[Scott Rudin]] purchased the script, and set up production at [[Paramount Pictures]]. [[Brian De Palma]] was to direct before Weir signed as director, making the film for $60 million\u2014$20 million less than the original estimate. Niccol rewrote the script while the crew was waiting for Carrey to sign. The majority of filming took place at [[Seaside, Florida]], a master-[[planned community]] located in the [[Florida Panhandle]].\n\nThe film was a financial success, debuting to critical acclaim, and earned numerous nominations at the [[71st Academy Awards]], [[56th Golden Globe Awards]], [[52nd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[The Saturn Award]]s. ''The Truman Show'' has been analyzed as a [[thesis]] on [[Christianity]], [[metaphilosophy]], [[simulated reality]], [[existentialism]], and [[reality television]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTruman Burbank is the unsuspecting star of ''The Truman Show'', a [[reality television]] program broadcast live around the clock worldwide. He has spent his entire life in the seaside town of Seahaven Island, which in reality is an enormous set near [[Hollywood]], equipped with state of the art technology to simulate day and night and weather conditions, as well as 5000 cameras to record Truman's every move. The producers discourage Truman from leaving Seahaven by instilling him with [[aquaphobia]] through the \"death\" of his TV father in a boating \"accident\", and by constantly broadcasting and printing messages of the dangers of traveling. All of Seahaven's other residents are actors. Christof, the show's creator and executive producer, seeks to capture Truman's real emotion and human behaviour and give audiences a relatable everyman.\n\nDespite Christof's control, he could not predict all of Truman\u2019s actions. During his college years, Truman was intended to fall in love with and marry co-student Meryl, but fell for Sylvia, an [[Extra (acting)|extra]]. Sylvia warned him that his reality is fake before being removed from the show, where Truman is told she moved to [[Fiji]] with her father. While Truman went on to marry Meryl, he continues to think about Sylvia. He uses scraps from magazines to recreate her face in secret, and seeks travel to Fiji. Outside of the show, Sylvia has become part of a \"Free Truman\" campaign that demands the end of the show and Truman's freedom and accuses Christof of making his life worse, which Christof denies.\n\nAs the show goes on, Truman starts noticing unusual events: a spotlight falling out of the sky, a radio frequency that precisely describes his movements, and rain that falls only on him. Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back onto the set, but other actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon to reassure him, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress; during an argument with Truman, she [[breaking character|breaks character]] and is taken off the show. Hoping to bring Truman back to a controllable state, Christof re-introduces Truman's father to the show properly, under the guise of having [[amnesia|lost his memory]] after the boating accident. This helps the show regain the ratings lead with audiences and Truman seems to return to his routines, except he begins sleeping in his basement.\n\nOne evening, the production staff discovers that the sleeping Truman is completely out of their sight. Marlon is sent to check on Truman, finding that he has left a snowman dummy and a tape recorder playing snoring sounds in his place, and has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, revealing that Truman is gone, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history, while a citywide search for Truman is launched. Audiences around the world, including the media, are drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat, after an attempt to fetch Truman fails. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but, while Christof\u2019s bosses and assistants demand that he ends the show, Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.\n\nTruman continues to sail until, to his despair, his boat strikes the wall of the dome. He finds an exit door, but Christof, speaking directly to Truman through a speaker system, tries to convince him to stay, stating there is \"no more truth\" in the real world and that by staying in his artificial world, he would have nothing to fear. Truman considers this, then states: \"In case I don't see you... good afternoon, good evening, and good night,\" (previously his catch-phrase), takes a bow, and exits. The viewers cheer Truman on, while Sylvia races to greet him. A defeated Christof's supervisors end the program for the last time and the viewers check their television guides to see what else is on television.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Carrey]] as Truman Burbank: Chosen out of six unwanted pregnancies to be the first child legally adopted by a corporation, Truman is unaware that his daily life is broadcast continuously around the world. He has a job in the insurance business and a wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. [[Robin Williams]] was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' because Carrey's performance reminded him of [[Charlie Chaplin]].<ref name=\"pro\" /> Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in comedic roles.<ref>{{cite news | author = Weinraub, Bernard | title = Director Tries a Fantasy As He Questions Reality | work = The New York Times | date = May 21, 1998 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D01E0D71539F932A15756C0A96E958260 | accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Carrey, who was then normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do ''The Truman Show'' for $12 million.<ref name=\"12mil\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/new-truman-villain-harris-1117435072/|title=New ''Truman'' villain: Harris|date=April 7, 1997|work=Variety|author=Busch, Anita M.|accessdate=March 27, 2017}}</ref> Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's [[improvisation]]al skills, and the two became more interactive.<ref name=\"pro\" /> The scene in which Truman declares \"this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy\" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.<ref name=\"part2\" />\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Hannah Gill acting as Meryl Burbank, Truman's wife, a nurse at the local hospital. Since the show relies on [[product placement]] for revenue, Meryl regularly shows off various items she has recently \"purchased\", one of the many oddities that makes Truman question his life. Her role is to act the part of Truman's wife and ultimately to have a child by him, despite her reluctance to accomplish either. Linney heavily studied [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears catalogs]] from the 1950s to develop her character's poses.<ref name=\"part1\" />\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Christof: The creator of ''The Truman Show''. Christof remains dedicated to the program at all costs, often overseeing and directing its course in person (rather than through aides), but at the climax, he speaks to Truman over a loudspeaker, revealing the nature of Truman's situation. [[Dennis Hopper]] was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 (during filming) over \"creative differences\". Harris was a last-minute replacement.<ref name=\"12mil\" /> Hopper later stated he was fired after two days because Weir and producer [[Scott Rudin]] had made a deal that if they didn't both approve of Hopper's performance, they would replace him.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sabotagetimes.com/tv-film/at-home-with-dennis-hopper | title=Farewell then Dennis Hopper}}</ref> A number of other actors had turned down the role after Hopper's departure.<ref name=\"part2\" /> Harris considered making Christof a hunchback, but Weir did not like the idea.<ref name=\"pro\" />\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Louis Coltrane playing Marlon, Truman's best friend since early childhood. Marlon is a [[vending machine]] operator for the company Goodies, who promises Truman he would never lie to him, despite the latest events in Truman's life. Emmerich has said, \"My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious drug addiction for many years. Been in and out of rehab.\"<ref name=\"pro\" /> Very little of this is shown in the finished film, but several deleted scenes depict Louis actively expressing guilt over Truman's situation, and in one sequence he spots Truman during his escape and purposely says nothing. His name is an [[Amalgamation (names)|amalgam]] of two jazz musicians, [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[John Coltrane]], and in one scene he plays trumpet.\n* [[Natascha McElhone]] as Sylvia playing Lauren Garland (Truman's college schoolmate): Sylvia was hired to play a background extra, a fellow student at Truman's college, named Lauren. She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but was thrown out of the show before she could do so. She then becomes a protester against ''The Truman Show'', urging Christof to release its lead.\n* [[Holland Taylor]] as Alanis Montclair playing Angela Burbank, Truman's mother: Christof orders that she attempt to persuade Truman to have children.\n* [[Brian Delate]] as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his character on the show was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and as he tries to get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Simeon (control room director). Though second-in-command at the lunar room, he is conflicted when ordered to attempt to kill Truman via storm.\n* [[Peter Krause]] as Laurence (Truman's boss): At Truman's office, Laurence often interrupts Truman when he talks about his dreams of moving to [[Fiji]].\n\n==Production==\n[[Andrew Niccol]] completed a one-page [[film treatment]] titled ''The Malcolm Show'' in May 1991.<ref>{{cite news | author = Benedict Carver | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117477740 | title = 'Truman' suit retort | work = Variety | date = June 22, 1998 | accessdate = May 15, 2009}}</ref> The original draft was more in tone of a science fiction [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], with the story set in New York City.<ref name=\"part1\">{{Cite video |title=How's It Going to End?

It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7.\" Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming.

[[Sound stage]]s at Universal Studios were reserved for the story's setting of Seahaven before Weir's wife introduced him to [[Seaside, Florida]], a \"master-planned community\" located in the Florida Panhandle. Pre-production offices were immediately opened in Seaside, where the majority of filming took place.

Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to ''The Truman Show'' because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's ''Utopia'' and real-life groups such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]].<ref name=\"Robert\" /> It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban \"[[picket fence]]\" appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the \"[[American Dream]]\" of the 1950s. The \"American Dream\" concept in Truman's world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant.<ref name=\"Robert\">Beuka, Robert.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Despite a promising start, the band broke up in the late 1970s and Squier, the band's frontman, left to pursue a solo career.\n\nSquier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and released his solo debut in spring of 1980. ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier's fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' came in September 1984 and brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Co-produced by a veteran songwriter [[Jim Steinman]], ''Signs of Life'' saw Squier melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; he reportedly played for half-empty arenas on some dates of the Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video, more familiar to his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold a disappointing 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. It was also Squier's first album not to be supported with a tour since Capitol decided not to promote it - which later built strong tensions between the label and Squier.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]].'' It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did partly restore Squier's success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock with small hints of then-successful glam metal; it's nowadays regarded as one of the strongest inputs of his catalogue by his fanbase. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite a promising comeback chances, Squier's popularity continued to descend and he wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception was mixed; many critized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. It is generally seen as one of Squier's weakest efforts. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].''

In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J.

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Despite a promising start, the band broke up in the late 1970s and Squier, the band's frontman, left to pursue a solo career.\n\nSquier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and released his solo debut in spring of 1980. ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100.

The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier's fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' came in September 1984 and brought him his third consecutive platinum certification.

The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]].''

However, despite a promising comeback chances, Squier's popularity continued to descend and he wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception was mixed; many critized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. It is generally seen as one of Squier's weakest efforts. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].''

A tournament known is Artemis is held to determine whom the best fighter is. This year Yamano Ban, Aoshima Kazuya, and Kawamura Ami are in the tournament with their LBX's. After the trio pulls off a shocking victory in the first round Ban thinks back to how he met his robot earlier that year. Ban has loved LBX's all his life. His father created them and early on showed Ban how to love and care for them. However his father went missing 8 years earlier when Plane PA027 went missing on its way to the Neo Technology Summit. No wreckage was ever found, but Ban's mom has not allowed him to play with an LBX since then at home. It all changes when a mysterious lady breaks out of the Innovator base and finds Ban, She gives him a case that he takes home. When Ban opens the case at home he finds a LBX inside. Before he can activate it a laser scans him. Outside 3 Innovator spies reveal this LBX has a Death Lock inside it and if an uncertified user picks it up it will kill that person with a poisonous dart. Ban ends up being the certified user, so the three spies attack him with their Dequoo LBX's. Ban is chased behind the couch by a Dequoo with a gun, and the other two attempt to chop up his LBX until he gets it activated. Once activated Ban is able to dispose of the three Dequoo's, but it leaves the entertainment room in shambles. His mom arrives home and says it is ok for him to keep the LBX, but first he needs to clean the room up. She then goes outside and thinks to herself that something big is about to happen.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 02\n| Title               = The Lost Achilles\n| TranslitTitle       = Ubawareta Akiresu\n| NativeTitle         = \u596a\u308f\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30ad\u30ec\u30b9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|3|9}}<ref name=\"ANC-February\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ban takes the AX-00 to the Kitajima Model Shop where he meets with Ami. He tells Kitijama, Saki, and Ami the story of how he got the LBX. At the Innovators base Yagami finds out why the Professor sent Ban the LBX. He learns AX-00 is protecting an item known as the Platinum Capsule. If anyone other than Ban were to try and grab AX-00, not only would they die from the poisonous dart, but the death lock system would also self destruct and destroy the Platinum Capsule. The only way to regain this would be by defeating AX-00 in a LBX battle. Over at Tiny Orbit the board asks the director Uzaki Yuusuke why he built the unauthorized Achilles form. He reveals the specs and points out that this design is more advanced than anything they've ever had before, and it will make them millions. He goes back to his office where he receives another blueprint for a LBX to be called Hunter. He signs his name J. Back at Kitajima's Kitajima decides to give Ban the Achilles armor, but he is disappointed to learn that Saki has sold it, until he learns the cash card is fake. If Ban can find Gouda Honza and defeat him he can use the Achilles armor for free. Ban heads to school with Ami and shows Kazu his new LBX. He then asks Kazu if he knows anything about Gouda. Kazu reveals Gouda uses a LBX known as the Destruction God of Hell and he is one of the Four Devas. Kazu refuses to tell them where Gouda is and leaves before ban can pressure him into giving up more details. After school Ban and Ami recruit the help of Ryuu and go looking for Gouda's base. Mika ends up telling them where it is. Once they arrive at the base Ban, Amy, and Ryuu meet the other three Divas and their LBX's- Riko with Queen, Tetsuo with Nazu, and Ginji with Mad Dog. The trio refuse to give up Gouda's location unless these 3 can beat them in a LBX battle. When AX-00 begins predicting his opponents moves Ban gains a slight advantage. That advantage quickly fails with Ryuu's Buld is destroyed by Queen's gun fire and rockets. Ryuu withdraws, and just before AX-00 is destroyed Kazu makes the save with Warrior. With Kazu's added strength Ban is able to destroy the three LBX's, with an assist from a magnetic charge by Warrior. After repairing their LBX's the three enter a nearby door and meet Gouda face-to-face.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 03\n| Title               = Hell's Destroyer\n| TranslitTitle       = Jigoku no Hakaishin\n| NativeTitle         = \u5730\u7344\u306e\u7834\u58ca\u795e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|3|16}}<ref name=\"WN-March\">{{cite web|url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/84 |script-title=ja:\u30c0\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u6226\u6a5f |publisher=Web Newtype |language=Japanese |accessdate=March 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x5Csi5bD?url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/84 |archivedate=March 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = Gouda returns the Achilles frame to Ban and reveals he was told to take it to keep it out of the hands of dangerous organizations on unsmart kids.

Kunoichi is customized for speed while Warrior and Achilles are customized for short distance shooting. The three also come up with a strategy to take down Hakai-O using hit-and-run tactics. The plan backfires on them when Hakai-O uses his Gaou Cannon to create a smokescreen. Hakai-O then moves in on Warrior and crushes him. The second time Hakai-O uses his Gaou cannon Kazu realizes that Hakai-O temporarily goes offline because of the amount of power that it uses. After the third attack he tells Ban and Ami the news, and on the fourth attack Ban is able to grab Warrior's gun and take out the Gaou Cannon before moving in and knocking him out of commission. Gouda keeps his word and lets them keep the Achilles frame. At the Innovators headquarters Yagami is on the phone and tells them not to worry about Achilles being completed.

Him and Ami agree to battle at Kitajima's after school, but first they want to check on Kazu and see if he has gotten over his LBX being destroyed. Ryu ends up claiming he is the one who defeated Gouda and gets hero worship from all the kids, but his speech backfires on him and forces him to hide after school when they ask him to defeat Gouda and get their LBX's back from them. Over at the Innovators base Yagami has finished construction on a new LBX that he believes will win him the Platinum Capsule. He dispatches a task force to make sure it can target Achilles. Ban and Ami head to Kitajima's and find Kazu is not there. Kazu is at a nearby mall reading the newest LBX magazine and wishing he had enough allowance to buy a new LBX. A man in a dark alleyway offers to sale him a LBX real cheap and presents to him Egypt. Egypt hypnotizes Kazu and tells him to destroy Achilles. Kazu leaves the shop table, and the man selling the LBX's is revealed to be one of the Innovator agents. Kazu finds Ban and Ami after Ban has left Kitajima's and challenges him to a battle. Kazu throws out a D-cube and Egypt. the D-cube brings up a desert setting. The Innovators agents watch the match from across the river while one of the men from Blue Cat's watches from the roadway. They see Achilles is slow to move in the sand, giving Egypt a huge advantage, but before Egypt can destroy Achilles a special mode, V-Mode is activated. The one thing Ban does not like- when Achilles is in V Mode he cannot control him. Achilles destroys Egypt and breaks Kazu out of the hypnosis. The agents retreat while the man marvels that Achilles has such a special mode on hand. Afterwards the trio return to Kitajima's where Kitajima has customized a Gladiator for Kazu to use until Kazu can buy a new LBX.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 05\n| Title               = The Dark Assassin\n| TranslitTitle       = Yami no Ansatsusha\n| NativeTitle         = \u95c7\u306e\u6697\u6bba\u8005\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|3|23}}<ref name=\"WN-March\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Dr. Kaid\u014d hopes to eliminate the prime minister Zaizen Sousuke.

He is given a letter that says use the kids with the white LBX to prevent the attack. He is also given a new LBX to help in the mission. Hizami sends Uzaki Takuya to get Ban, Ami, and Kazu from Kitajima's. He takes them back to Blue Cat's where they show the kids the new LBX Hunter and praise Achilles maintenance. Takuya then reveals he did not get them just to show them the new LBX. Instead he hopes they'll help prevent the assassination. If they agree Kazu will be given Hunter at no charge. The kids agree and head home to practice. Kazu focuses specifically on his long range shooting, but despite calibrating the gun and doing some maintenance to Hunter he cannot seem to hit the bullseye. The next day Kazu thinks of pulling out until Ban gives a speech reminding him how LBX's should be fun but that they an lose them all if this attack succeeds. Kazu agrees to go if he can practice some more first, but when they enter Blue Cat's Hizami receives a call saying Zaizen Sousuke's induction parade has been moved up.

Kazu uses Hunter to scan the building on the other side of the glass, and they find what appears to be Assassin. The three infiltrate the building and run into the 3 Dequoo's that tried to kidnap Achilles in episode 1. Achilles and Kunoichi distract the Buld's while Kazu and Hunter run up the building and take out Assassin. Only when they arrive they find out Assassin is a dummy. After destroying the Dequoo's Ami and Ban go up, and Ban sees another building nearby with a helipad on it. Once again Kazu uses Hunter's sites to zoom in, and once again Assassin is present. In order for Ban and Ami to make it to the building in time Kazu must use Hunter's high aiming specs to distract Assassin. Kazu gets off three shots, two of which cause smoke and hit Assassin. Assassin retaliates by trying to take out Hunter, but Kazu is able to get him to safety. Amy and Ban make it to the building in time and use their speed to take out Assassin.

Their goal was to create an endless supply of energy known as the Eternal Cycler. However Professor Yamano realized it could be used as a weapon and decided to hide the plans inside the Platinum Capsule. Ban asks Takuya and Hizami if they know where his father is being held at, and they say no. Ban and Kazu return home, but Ami stays behind to do a little snooping. Meanwhile Yagamai asks Doctor Kaid\u014d if he was responsible for the Assassin incident since Assassin was made from their specs. With Kunoichi's recording mode she finds out Professor Yamano is being held at a place called Angel Star. Ryuu explains that Angel Star is owned by Kamiya Craft and that it is the largest weapon manufacture in Japan. He also tells them they have been investigated for making secret weapons, though he believes they are innocent. Ban, Kazu, and Ami decide to investigate the building anyway. At Angel Star we are introduced to Heiji Kirishima. Kirishima originally created the boxes that house the LBX battles, but he later lost the licensing right to Tiny Orbit. As a result he now works overtime almost daily for Kamiya Craft hoping to restart his business. Ban uses Achilles to hold the door open at Angel Star, and Ban, Ami, and Kazu enter the building. The cameras quickly catch them, and a squadron of Dequoo R LBX's are sent to try and stop them. Achilles, Hunter, and Kunoichi wipe out the Dequoo R's and continue to investigate further through the air ducts where they find a new security LBC named Inbit blocking the way.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 08\n| Title               = The Great Labyrinth, Angel Star\n| TranslitTitle       = Daimeiky\u016b Enjeru Sut\u0101\n| NativeTitle         = \u5927\u8ff7\u5bae\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|4|20}}<ref name=\"WN-April\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ban, Ami, and Kazu run into Inbit in the air ducts.

Kamiya sees what Ban has done and decides to come up with a new strategy. He has Dequoo R's continue to distract Ban and his friends in the air ducts while he goes and gets Kirishima. He takes Kirishima out of the control, but not before having Yagami plant a false location for Professor Yamano in the control room. Kagami then tells Kirishima that Tiny Orbit has sent Achilles in to steal their most confidential data. He is promised if he can destroy Achilles that he will be given the finds to restart his company. In the control room Ban and his friends find a hidden elevator and take it to the lowest floor.

Takuya runs a computer scan and sees they are at Angel Star, so the two depart immediately to rescue them. The Steel Monster quickly shows how it got its name. The tractor is enforced with heavy armor that the LBX's cannot penetrate. It is also possessed with a laser eye system. Hunter accidentally shoots a cloth down over the camera of the Steel Monster, and Ban realizes that camera is the Achilles heel. The three change their targeting strategy to the camera, and when they take out the camera Kirishima switches to manual view. Manual view at least slows down the Steel Monsters response time. A mysterious silver colored LBX then appears. It distracts the Steel Monster and points out the large crate above it. Hunter switches his target to the crate, which comes down and crushes the Steel Monster. Kirishima escapes unharmed. Ban is then told over the Loud Speaker that Professor Yamano has been removed and the only way he can get more information is by winning Angrivisdas. An escape hatch opens revealing Hazami and Gouda.

A jet fighter then flies up to the school. A boy climbs out of the jet fighter and into Ban's class. It is the exchange student. He introduces himself as Kaid\u014d Jin and says he has nothing else to tell the class. When Ryuu asks him about LBX's later on he ignores him.

At first the group decides to walk away from them, but they tease him with the knowledge that they might know where his father is being held. Ban agrees to battle them, but they say they will only reveal where his father is being held if he can beat them 3-on-1. Ban and Achilles battle the Innovators Dequoo's. During the battle Ban learns his first finishing move, Lightning Lance, and is able to overpower them. The Innovators agents retreat without telling Ban anything, and the Four Devas remember how Gouda revealed to them that they would soon be fighting the Innovators. Afterwards the group goes into a nearby arcade where they find Gouda has lost in a LBX battle to one Sendou Daiki and his LBX Joker. Gouda is about to hand over all his territory to Daiki when he realizes there is a catch. Daiki can only claim Gouda's territory if he is the first one to defeat him. That honor went to Ban. Now the only way Daiki can claim the territory is by defeating Ban in battle. Ban and Achilles battle Daiki and Joker, but Ban relies to much on his finishing move, Lightning Lance. As a result Achilles is slow and cannot hit Joker. Daiki begins to use Joker's speed and causes what appears to be clones to appear. Before Joker can finish Achilles though the Emperor intervenes. Jin says they should finish their battle at Angrivisdas since they are both competing, and Daiki agrees. Ban is given a list of everyone competing in Angrivisdas by Gouda. He takes this list back to Kitijima's where Ami, Kazu, and Ban come up with strategies to defeat each competitor. As time runs out the group heads to Angrivisdas. Welcoming everyone to Angrivisdas is none other than the legendary LBX fighter Lex. Lex announces that each LBX battle will be unlimited regulation, meaning anything goes.

Gatoh seems to dominate the pace with his rocket launcher, forcing Ban to continually dodge and run around in circles. Eventually Kazu reminds Ban that he needs to turn the battle in his favor through pace. Ban charges straight at the Buld and begins getting in multiple hits. Gatoh decides to cheat and use a stun grenade. With Achilles stunned Gatoh breaks out an axe and chops at Achilles shield. The axe has gun powder hidden in it and sends Achilles flying. The shield falls to the side and allows Gatoh free access to Achilles right arm. He begins attacking Achilles right arm continually, hoping to chop it off. When stun wears off Achilles is able to dodge again, but he loses his right arm in the process. Once again Ban is forced to dodge, but while he's dodging he's moving in closer. Ban decides to use his shield to block one of Buld's missile launches, and in the process he learns Sword Cyclone. Achilles tosses his shield aside and picks up the sword. He uses sword cyclone and advances to the semifinals with the win, thanks to his second round opponents eliminating each other at the same time. Afterwards Kazu, Ami, and Jin all advance with victories. The quarterfinals begin and Kazu and Daiki advance, setting up a Daiki vs. Ban semifinal match.

At first Daiki seems like he dodges every attack with ease. He quickly reveals that while Achilles has more strength with Hakai-O's arm, he has also left himself highly vulnerable because he is off balance. Ban tries to correct this by turning the lance into a battering club, but Daiki continues to have Joker dodge and cast his mirage again. With 3 Joker's on the field Ban begins to take hit after hit and seems to be losing with ease. Ban tries to create a smokescreen to see which Joker is real, but they still manage to come at him from two sides. Achilles gets knocked down to 25% power and once again enters V-Mode. With V-Mode active Achilles once again gains strength and begins to bludgeon the Joker's with ease. One of the hits reveals that there is not 1 Joker on the field. Instead there are three. However Ban cannot control V-Mode, Daiki realizes that V-Mode runs on a computer controlled AI attack pattern and begins to dodge the attacks and get hits on Achilles. Just then Ban receives a message from the stands. A man has appeared in the stands with the white LBX that saved them at Angel Star. The LBX's name is Pandora. It sends Ban a code, and Ban gains control of V-Mode. Takuya also sees the man and runs towards him, seemingly recognizing him from some other place. Despite Ban having gained control of V-Mode, his power has drifted to less than 10%. Joker only needs one hit to finish Achilles off. While still in V-Mode Ban remembers The Emperors beheading of 3 LBX's at one point in the arena and realizes he can use the same strategy. Achilles runs to a cliff wall that's a dead end. Daiki thinks it's so his LBX's will face Achilles one-on-one and sends them into the air so they can attack at one. Realizing his plan has worked Ban runs underneath the Joker's and releases a Lightning Lance when they are lined up as one. The Lightning Lance destroys all 3 Joker's and sends Ban to the finals, right as V-Mode wears off. After the match Ban asks Daiki is he was the spy, and Daiki says he works only for himself. Takuya arrives where the man was in the stands, but the man has disappeared. Takuya says he would not let this mystery man get in his way and ruin his plans. As Daiki leaves Gouda tells Ban good job but says he cannot fight in the finals that way. He supplies Ban with the right arm of Achilles, fully repaired. Up next Kazu faces Emperor and Jin in the second semi-final. Kazu realizes The Emperor has more speed and strength than him, so he gets distance and tries to take out The Emperor with long-range shots. The Emperor dodges the attacks and forces Kazu to use Hunter's Stinger Missile attack. The attack merely causes a smokescreen for The Emperor, and The Emperor gets one quick ax strike to the neck of Hunter finishing off Hunter. The final has been set.

Jin promises to tell Ban the coordinates of where his father is at if he can beat him. Ban does not waste anytime time. He attacks head on, but The Emperor dodges most of his attacks. Ban decides to use Lightning Lance to force The Emperor to attack. Once The Emperor jumps into the air Ban activates Achilles V-Mode and does some serious damage, or so he thinks. In reality The Emperor suffers about 20% damage, and Jin decides to reveal his true strength. The Emperors eyes go from black to white to a blood red. His speed increases, and no one can keep up with Jin's hand control movements. Jin uses his finisher, Impact Kasier, to bury Achilles, but Achilles manage to dig his way out and starts blocking all of The Emperors hands on attacks.

Lex uses his GRex's finishing function on The Emperor G2 to cause some serious damage, but the Emperor M2 quickly rebounds and slices Gouda's Hakai-O in half to eliminate him. G-Rex has a shot at a quick attack to finish The Emperor M2, but for some unknown reason Lex hesitates and Jin gets the win. After the match Lex goes outside and tells someone on a phone call that everything is going according to their plan. Over at Tiny Corp Takuya decides to return and confront his brother Yuuya. He reveals that Yuuya is the man that was in the stands at Angrivisdas with Pandora. He asks Yuuya to help him restore the seekers so they can get revenge for their father. Apparently Yoshimitsu is responsible for the series of events that led to his death, but what those events are is untold. Yuuya refuses saying they cannot use Tiny Corp's resources to hel them get revenge, but that does not mean there are not other ways they can do so. Back at Artemis Jin easily wins the Block A final to move to the Battle Royal. Block B begins where we are introduced to Masked J and his LBX Masquerade J, who have entered solo. In the first match of B Block Masquerade J displays amazing agility and stabs his opponents LBX's in the neck to allow him to advance to the quarterfinals of Block B. Ban is amazed by Masquerade J's moves, but he thinks Masked J looks familiar.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 20\n| Title               = The Troublesome Tournament\n| TranslitTitle       = Haran no T\u014dnamento\n| NativeTitle         = \u6ce2\u4e71\u306e\u30c8\u30fc\u30ca\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|7|13}}<ref name=\"WN-July\">{{cite web|url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/37 |script-title=ja:\u30c0\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u6226\u6a5f |publisher=Web Newtype |language=Japanese |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/603gZ6uiK?url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/37 |archivedate=July 9, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = The B Block Finals begin as Masked J battles one Shou Kanzaki and his Gladiator who have finished off all their opponents in less than a minute. At first Shou and Gladiator make hit after hit on Masquerade and appear to have an overwhelming advantage. It has all been a trick though. Masked J was merely getting the timing of Gladiator's attacks. He begins to dodge attack after attack and when Gladiator gets cornered he finishes him with Storm Sword. After the match Masked J tells Shou he needs to start focusing on his defense and stop acting so immature. The C-block contestants include Ban, Kazu, and Ami. They are called to head for the waiting rooms. In the waiting room they meet John & Paul, the North American champions. Ban tries to wish them good luck in the upcoming match, but John & Paul refuse to acknowledge him, making Ami upset. John & Paul decide they want to finish the match before it begins, but Asia Area Champion Morigami Keita and his Warrior break it up and tell them to settle it in their opening match. Ban thanks Keita and they become quick friends. Keita and his teammates Nakabayashi Reina (w/ Amazonese) and Kunoshita Kouji (w/ Buld) let Ban and his teammates see the specs on all their LBX's, as long as they get to do the same for Achilles, Hunter, and Kunoichi. Shortly after the first matches are called. Ami wants to fight the North American champions because of their feud in the back, but she feels Achilles & Hunter provide the best chance for them to move on. John & Paul launch their Orteha & Titan into the ring, and we see the match that opens the series. Of course Ban and his team prevail, and we see quick snipets of their quarter and semi matches. In the C-Block final Ban and his friends face off with Keita and his crew. They open up with a series on head-to-head matches that make the teams appear even. However Hunter gets tricked into a trap, and Achilles and Kunoichi get damaged when they move in and save Hunter.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 21\n| Title               = Explosive: The Super Plasma Burst\n| TranslitTitle       = Sakuretsu Ch\u014d Purazuma B\u0101suto\n| NativeTitle         = \u70b8\u88c2 \u8d85\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|7|20}}<ref name=\"WN-July\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = With Achilles and Kunoichi damaged, Keita and Reina move in to try and finish them. Hunter uses his stinger missile though and causes a smokescreen, allowing them to escape. Ami comes up with a plan, and the group heads towards the middle of the Industrial Zone. Keita group follows at a slower pace, and eventually they get flanked by Hunter and Kunoichi. Keita thinks it is a move solely to keep him from attacking Achilles and heads to a corner where he sees Achillies shield. It ends up being a laid trap. The shield is all that's there, and Hunter has moved into sniping position. Hunter targets Warrior, but Buld jumps in the way and is eliminated. Next Hunter provides supporting fire aimed at Warrior that allows Ban to move in. Amazonese decides to target Hunter, which allows Kunoishi to come out and target Warrior 2-on-1. Amazonese has a major speed advantage over Hunter, but Hunter is able to perform the same type of kick that Ban used to send John's Ortega flying in the previous episode. With Amazonese stuck in the air Hunter is able to use his pin point targeting and eliminate her. Hunter then moves down to join Achilles and Kunoichi in a 3-on-1 assault. Keita realizes if the attack hits he'll be finished, and he launches his finishing move Trident. It hits all of Team Ban's members, and while Achilles shield absorbs the damage Kunoichi and Hunter take the attack head-on and are eliminated. The battle becomes 1-on-1, and Warrior has a major speed advantage thanks to Achilles damaged leg. Ban switches over to his energy gauge, and after he has absorbed enough attacks and thrust enough spears at Warrior he is able to release his new finisher Super Plasma Burst to gain the victory. Keita's team congratulates Ban on his efforts and moving on to the finals in a real sign of sportsmanship. Ban and his friends then go to get their LBX's repaired while D Block begins. Daiki advances throughout D Block to the finals with ease. On the other side a solo entry known as Yujin advances to the finals. Yujin is known to be one of Otacross's disciples, but he insists on fighting the LBX battles as OtaRed, a defender of justice, Daiki scoffs at him and thinks his Joker Mk 2 will get an easy victory to advance to the Battle Royale just before the final battle begins.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 22\n| Title               = The Mysterious Player: Yuuya Haibara\n| TranslitTitle       = Nazo no Pureiy\u0101 Haibara Yuuya\n| NativeTitle         = \u8b0e\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u7070\u539f\u30e6\u30a6\u30e4\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|7|27}}<ref name=\"WN-July\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Daiki battles Yujin in the Block D Finals.

The mysterious player Yuuya Haibara does not appear to have a lot of skills, but he keeps getting victories and advances to the Block F finals. Jin and Ban both realize Yuuya looks like he is going through a series of tests instead of fighting seriously, and when Yuuya advances to the Block F finals it becomes quite obvious his victories, which have been less than impressive, were all merely a series of tests. What's even more disturbing is the lack of communication from Yuuya. As Yuuya advances from Block F, a 30-minute intermission is held so the five finalists can all get their LBX's in tip-top shape for the upcoming battle royale.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 23\n| Title               = The Face Off: Battle Royal\n| TranslitTitle       = Kessen Batoru Rowaiyaru\n| NativeTitle         = \u6c7a\u6226 \u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ed\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|8|3}}<ref name=\"WN-July\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = The finals begin with an all-out battle royal.

The five finalist continue to go blow-by-blow until Yujin and Yuuya are seen attacking The Emperor Mk 2 and Masquerade J is seen attacking Achilles. While Masquerade J is attacking Achilles a file is transferred over to Achilles with a note, you'll need this in the future. Shortly before the file is completed the Innovators activate a special mode of Yuuya's control suit. The special mode ends up taking over Yuuya's brain and sends him on a rampage. He destroys Masquerade J and Bibinbird X, eliminating Masked J and Yujin from the competition. When his two teammates decide to run from the scene Jin realizes the only way to save Yuuya is by doing his LBX. Ban and Jin set aside their differences and team up together. Emperor Mk 2 causes a smokescreen while Achilles performs his Lightning Lance finisher, eliminating Judge and freeing Yuuya from the suits control. Yuuya collapses, so the competition is halted while he receives medical attention. Ban questions Jin on what the relation is between Yuuya and Jin, but Jin refuses to answer and announces it is time for their final battle to commence.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 24\n| Title               = The Shocking Last Battle\n| TranslitTitle       = Sh\u014dgeki no Rasuto Batoru\n| NativeTitle         = \u885d\u6483\u306e\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|8|10}}<ref name=\"WN-August\">{{cite web|url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/43 |script-title=ja:\u30c0\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u6226\u6a5f |publisher=Web Newtype |language=Japanese |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60plazfUY?url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/43 |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = The finals of Artemis are held as Emperor Mk 2 and Achilles match each other blow for blow.

Achilles though is able to perform some acrobatics that Emperor is unable to match, and eventually Achilles gets behind Emperor and stabs him through the chest to finish him off. Achilles and Ban are declared the winners of Artemis. However The Emperor Mk 2 rises again. Jin loses all control of his machine, and Emperor Mk 2 grabs onto Achilles before self destructing. Achilles is destroyed. After everyone sees Achilles destroyed the power to the building is cut.

Yagami learns that it was the Innovators red team that shut down the power at Artemis and killed the guards watching Metanus GX in the process.

Meanwhile Jin has taken over watching Yuuya and he begins to question his grandfather's involvement in the entire ordeal as Yuuya lies in a coma. We learn that Jin and Yuuya were both the lone survivors in their families in the tragic Tokio Bridge collapse that also took Yagami's family. Shortly after the bridge collapse Jin was adopted by Yoshimitsu and become a Kaido. When his grandfather refuses to answer why he programmed The Emperor Mk 2 to self-destruct and why he killed the guards Jin decides to rebel.

When the group arrives at Tiny Orbit they learn that Tiny Orbit is developing a new Sparkbload system that will increase the usage of LBX's to 50 km and allow them to be used in space and on other planets. Ami realizes that Pandora had to be operated with this technology, and when she sees the railcar speeds through Tiny Orbit's station lasting 5 seconds she realizes it has to be someone there.

The group is not able to decipher the Platinum Capsule, but they find blueprints for a new LBX had been downloaded into the Platinum Capsule roughly 72 hours before, during Artemis.

Elsewhere on the base Yagami is given a file that contains all the data on the Tokio Bridge incident, but when the red team begins to hunt him he is forced to alter his escape route. Also in the base is Jin, who has pulled data showing that Yuuya was used as a science experiment by Yoshimitsu. Jin decides to leave Yoshimitsu's care for good and join Ban and his friends fighting the Innovators. Eventually the man who gave Yagami the data leads him into a trap room and traps him, but Jin frees him allowing him to escape. Back at Yoshimitsu's office Rina holds a gun to Yoshimitsu and demands he allows Optima to go forward in the medical field. Yoshimitsu grabs the gun and gets into a wrestling contest, accidentally forcing the gun to go off and shoot him in the process. As Rina flees the scene Yoshimitsu is seen rising from the gunshot, but he is no longer human. Instead he is some sort of robot who has taken over Yoshimitsu's spot. Yagami finds Rina crying in the halls and drags her along so they can escape. The group flees to the spy jet Eclipse and manage to escape within it.

Seeing no other choice, Ban asks if using Odin and the Sparkbload together might work to stop the wreck. Odin launches and infiltrates the train with roughly 20 km until impact. When he arrives in car 1 he sees that the LBX General Commander is controlling the train. Odin and General Commander fight, but Ban has a hard time using Odin's control functions because he is so much more advanced than Achilles. Seeing no other choice Ban runs headlong at General Commander and stuns him, allowing Odin to use his Gungnir finisher. General Commander is defeated, and Odin activates the brakes, However the brakes fail to engage. Yuusuke contacts the linear command and learns of a second way to stop the train. Ban destroys the trains control panel, causing the train to crash into the tracks and friction to slow it down. The actions appear to have taken place two late though as the train still has too much speed and will crash into Tiny Orbit.

Jason Kurosawa insists on coming over and shaking each team members hand from his opposition. Meanwhile Gouda and Daiki argue which of them will battle in the first round. The wait is not long as the Hacker Corps stuns everyone with a quick knockout. Ban intervenes and decides to battle Saki since they are friends. Saki sends out her Kunoichi to battle Ban's Odin. Saki features a style that basically runs headlong into anything and does not evaluate her surroundings. Ban uses this to his advantage to get the win and advance to face the Hacker Corps in the semifinals.

Ban studies the terrain and sees a cliff he believes could finish off Fenrir if they can distract him. Odin and Hakai-O Z move to separate parts of the arena, and when Fenrir jumps up to the cliff Hakai-O Z launches his Super Gaou Cannon and buries Fenrir. With Fenrir supposedly finished Odin takes on Pandora while Hakai-O Z and Nightmare both move in on Proto Zenon.

The field is an ice field, so it takes some time for Hakai-O Z and Nightmare to adjust to it. Eventually Hakai-O Z and Nightmare throw their opponent's Claymid's into each other and severely damage them with their finishers. Maa decides to intervene and uses his finisher, God Speed Sword, to eliminate his teammates LBX's while damaging all of Team Ban's LBX's. Before God Speed Sword hits Ban has Odin run in and try to deflect the rays associated with the attack, but it costs Odin his left arm.

They are able to gather 99% of the data, but the remaining 1% of the data is stuck in a net storm. If the data touches the storm at all it will be deleted. Seeing no other choice Yamaneko uses Otacross's virtual scanner to scan his LBX. He then creates a mini storm around his LBX, causing his LBX to be absorbed by the larger storm. Once Red Ribbon is inside he grabs the data and uses his blasters to create a hole in the storm. With the hole created he is able to throw out the data, and Ban and his friends are able to gain the decipher key for the Platinum Capsule.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 36\n| Title               = Humanity's Hope, Eternal Cycler\n| TranslitTitle       = Jinrui no Kibou, Eternal Cycler\n| NativeTitle         = \u4eba\u985e\u306e\u5e0c\u671b\u30a8\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30e9\u30fc\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|11|9}}<ref name=\"WN-March\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = As Ban and his friends begin to return to Tiny Orbit they get surrounded by Innovators who want to steal the Eternal Cycler data.

As the group arrives at Tiny Orbit Yuusuke decides to trust Yagami and his allies. Yuusuke then demands they begin creating a rough draft on the Eternal Cycler because the prime minister has approved Yoshimitsu's Earth Crust Generation project. The Earth Crust Generation Project calls for energy to be harvested from underground volcanoes, but it would make Earth's crust unstable and lead to lots of destruction. Over at Cyber Lance Jin returns Proto Zenon with the data he collected from Akihabara Kingdom. The data will allow them to evolve Proto Zenon into Zenon's final form. Elsewhere Daiki is battlign at the arcades trying to get some sense of fun back into his life, but he feels there is something missing.

At the same time Ban and his friends head towards the Seekers base and run into Rina, who has been rehired by Tiny Orbit for her Sparkbload knowledge. Sawamura goes into Tiny Orbit's main security room and shuts off their alarm system. Outside Kirishima is hired to steal the eternal cycler when it is completed.

Roughly 1 hour is needed to finish the eternal cycler. As the LBX's begin to attack Gouda uses his finishing move, Super Gaou Cannon to take out nearly 1,000 LBX's. The Hacker Corps follow suit as Red Ribbon uses his Napalm Bomb, Gladiator uses his laser cutter, and Claymisha uses his trident. When the LBX's get past the first line Ami realizes the ones getting through are All Inbit's that run on AI's. With this new knowledge they are able to narrow down the attack patterns and use their finishers to take out more LBX's. Odin uses Gugnir, Fenrir uses Hawk Eye Drive, and Ami uses Chaotic Fist. When the LBX's are narrowed down to roughly 2,000 the Innovators send in their fort tank Bardoma as a last resort. Jin arrives with the newly completed Zenon, and the groups are reassigned.

LBX battles can now been seen all across the city, and Ban has been invited to Tiny Orbit's new product revealing ceremony at Tokio SIA. In a nearby arcade, Hiro Ozora competes in the electronic LBX game and gets 20 consecutive wins to win a rare Senshiman figure. A mysterious man bumps into him and picks up the Senshiman figure. When Hiro goes to check the figure he sees the LBX Perseus instead of Senshiman. Hiro has never used LBX's before and nearly hits Ban. Ban checks out Perseus because he has never seen him before. He then teaches Hiro how to use him before finishing the trip to Tokio SIA. At Tokio SIA Takuya reveals Tiny Orbit's newest product - a Black Achilles LBX known as Achilles Deed. After the presentation Achilles Deed gets hacked, and all unmanned LBX's across the city begin attacking. Ami, Ban, and Kazuya attempt to stop them, but Fenrir and Pandora get destroyed and gets knock out gas used on them. Hiro arrives at Tokio SIA and attempts to assist Ban. The mysterious man returns and gives Ban a D-Egg to battle Achilles Deed in so people can escape. Odin and Perseus are unable to match Achilles Deed's speed, and Odin misses hitting Achilles Deed with Gungnir. Achilles Deed retaliates using his finisher, Black Storm. He destroys Odin and escapes the D-Egg. After the battle, the mysterious man reveals that a new enemy has risen. Before he can tell Ban and Takuya any more information, a masked man comes on the electronic screen and claims a new group known as the Detectors must become the rulers of the Earth, and they will do so by any means necessary.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 02\n| Title               = Ban and Hiro W Assault\n| TranslitTitle       = Ban to Hiro W Shutsugeki\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d0\u30f3\u3068\u30d2\u30ed \uff37\u51fa\u6483\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|1|25}}\n| ShortSummary        = The mysterious man introduces himself as Cobra. He was sent by Professor Yamano to give Hiro and Ban their new LBX's and to stop the threat of the Detectors should it arise. He reveals that the Detectors are kidnapping the strongest LBX players for unknown reasons. Cobra gives Ban a new LBX, Elysion, with which to fight. Ban assembles Elysion and Cobra traces down that the hacked computer being controlled by the Detectors is the old Seeker base. Takuya provides Ban and Hiro knowledge on how to get to the base. On B8 the two get ambushed by 5 Inbit's, but Ban and Hiro use good teamwork to stop them and defeat them with ease. The group makes it inside the Seeker base where they have to face multiple LBX's. The final set of LBX's in the battle feature two G-Rexes and Achilles Deed. If they can defeat them they can shut down the hijacked computer. Another mysterious youth shows up and uses a very customized Dequoo to destroy the two G-Rexes. Achilles Deed retreats and Elysion shuts down the computer. As Ban goes to thank him, the youth reveals he is not there to help. Instead he is there to defeat Ban, and he'll defeat all enemies in they way to make sure they cannot defeat Ban before he does. Over at the Senate Zaizen brings Yagami out of the shadows and asks him to investigate the Detectors. He senses the man's ambition is not world domination, but is hiding a much more ulterior motive, although he's not sure what it is.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 03\n| Title               = Chosen Warriors\n| TranslitTitle       = Erabareshi Senshi-tachi\n| NativeTitle         = \u9078\u3070\u308c\u3057\u6226\u58eb\u305f\u3061\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary        = Takuya and Cobra arrive at the base, but the mysterious youth has left. Takuya decides to restore the Seekers and contacts Rina to come and assemble the old base. Cobra reveals all he knows about the Detectors, which is not much more than what has been shared. He reveals that the LBX's are being controlled through a process called brainjacking. The brainjacking occurs through the M Chip which Omegadain requires all LBX's to have. However Professor Yamano has ignored that requirement and made it so Perseus and Elysion do not have the M Chip. He also reveals that a third LBX from Professor Yamano will be presented to the winner of the Shibuya Town Martial Arts tournament. The next day, Takuya contacts Yagami and asks him to investigate Omegadain. He also tells him he is bringing back the Seekers to fight. Meanwhile in Shibuya, Ran Hanasaki wins the martial arts tournament and is presented the LBX Minerva. After the tourney she goes to fight her friend outside when Detector LBX's arrive. Minerva and Warrior are able to handle most of them, but then Warrior gets brainjacked. Minerva is forced to take out Warrior and then gets surrounded by Achilles Deed, a black Kunoichi, and a black Hunter. Ban and Hiro arrive and help Ran take out the Kunoichi and Hunter, but Achilles Deed escapes. Ran is made a member of the team and is taken to the Seekers base. Over across the sea the president of A Nation asks her defense secretary and vice president to do research on the LBX crisis. The vice president chooses to go to Omegadain for advice while the defense secretary contacts Yagami and Zaizen. Back at the Seekers base the CCM's for Ami and Kazuya are detected. They appear to be on a plane headed to A Nation, but before precise coordinates can be located the signals are cut off.

The group boards Tiny Orbit's jet and heads for N City. Cobra reveals they are heading for NICS because NICS can trace all super computers. He also reveals that a super computer is required for the brainjacking to work. As they continue to head for N City in A Nation, the plane begins to descend early. Automatic LBX's have snuck on board and taken control of the plane at the wheel sector, in the toilet, and in the conference room. Ban, Ran, and Hiro each descend upon a location and use their finishers to defeat the Detectors Inbits. Elysion uses Holy Lance, Perseus uses Cosmo Slash, and Minerva uses Flame Avalanche.

The two appear to have evenly matched speed and skills. When Ban begins to get serious, Jessica pulls out Jeanne D and welcomes the group to N City. She reveals she is from NICS and has been sent to pick them up. Back in Japan, we learn that the Seekers are working on a vaccine program to stop the brainjacking of the super computers. The group arrives at NICS and Jessica introduces her father, defense secretary Owen Kaios. Cobra shares with NICS what they know, and the two groups agree to work together. At noon the LBX's in N City get brainjacked. The Detectors leader once again appears on screen and demands the President withdraw by 6 p.m. or he will continue to have LBX's go on a rampage. Ban, Hiro, Jessica, and Ran are given a program on their CCM's that will allow them to detect EM waves. Using the program they trace the hijacked computer to the subway doctor train. The Seekers finish the vaccine program. The four members install the vaccine program in their LBX's, and Jessica and Hiro head into the doctor train to stop the brainjacking. Once inside they run into Kousuke who has been turned into a slave player by the Detectors and has a control collar around his neck that brainwashes him. His sole mission is to stop the group from deactivating the train. With 1 minute left until 6 Hiro throws Shadow Lucifer into the air with Perseus's swords. Jeanne D finishes off Shadow Lucifer deactivating the control collar and making Kousuke fall unconscious. Jeanne D installs the vaccine program, and the LBX's fail to start back up at 6.

As the train is moved from the alternative route to the main route, a mysterious LBX begins to fill the subway with thick, sticky threads similar to a spiderweb. The threads catch on to the train and stop it roughly 1m before impact with one of the parked subway trains. As Jessica and Hiro get off they run to see what stopped the train. They find the mysterious LBX which returns to Jin. Ban and Ran arrive and Ban and Jin are reunited. Jin reveals his new LBX is Triton. Triton was customized for him and does not contain the M chip. He also reveals he was brought by another of Professor Yamano's assistants, Mongoose. Cobra and Mongoose go at it while NICS recovers Kousuke and takes him back to examine him. Over in Japan things are looking down for Tiny Orbit. The stocks are crashing and people are calling for Takuya's resignation. Before Takuya can do anything about it Tiny Orbit is bought out by Crystar Ingram, and Crystar Ingram places Kawamura Muneto, a former Innovator member in charge of the company. Takuya is kicked out of Tiny Orbit, but as he leaves his secretary tells him to let her handle the rest inside Tiny Orbit. Back in A Nation NICS makes Jin a member of the team. Ban and company are then taken to meet their resident hacker who is revealed to be none other than Otacross. Otacross reveals he has learned that the computers being brainjacked continue to maintain their functions, but they do not operate at 100%. Otacross then scans the many super computers and learns of a computer in Shang-Pao, China which is about to be brainjacked. NICS loads the team up onto their transport vehicle, the Duck Shuttle, and they take off for China. Meanwhile Takuya meets with Yagami and reveals that Crystar Ingram and Omegadain have some sort of relation. Yagami then asks Takuya to go on some sort of mission in his place.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 07\n| Title               = Reunion of Dragon Tower\n| TranslitTitle       = Doragon Taw\u0101 no Saikai\n| NativeTitle         = \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u518d\u4f1a\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|2|29}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jessica shows everyone around the Duck Shuttle including places like the control room, the conference center/recreation room, the bedrooms, and the cockpit. When they arrive in Shang-Pao Otacross calls everyone to the control room. He introduces everyone to his creation, the Riding Saucer. The Riding Saucer was created to allows LBX's to have greater mobility in the air and in places like space. Because it is night Otacross has Ban fly Elysion around the city on a Riding Saucer. Ban does scans of the supercomputers on the way, and the group narrows it down to two super computers: Dragon Tower and Shang-Pao Harbor. The next morning the teams divide into two groups to search the locations. Ban, Ran, and Otacross go to Dragon Tower while Jin, Jessica, and Hiro go to Shang-Pao Harbor. Ban and Ran thinks Dragon Tower looks creepy, but Otacross reveals that it is actually an amusement park in disguise. The group goes inside and Ran is given a map of Dragon Tower by a giant panda bear person. Otacross decides they should check Dragon Tower by going up the emergency stairs. When the group makes it to the elevator, automated LBX's jump out and try to ambush them. Otacross eliminates them with ZX-1, and then a brainjacking signal is detected. The group raises up the tower with Otacross eliminating another set of LBX's with ZX-2 and Minerva eliminating the third, but Otacross breaks his back in the process. Ban decides to take Otacross back down but tells Ran to find the supercomputer and then wait for backup before engaging the enemy. Ran finds the supercomputer and learns that the giant panda bear person is actually a slave player. Ran ignores Ban's council and engages the slave player, who fights back with 2 Dark Kunoichi's and a Dark Pandora. Ban and Otacross detect the battle and head back up, but Minerva is defeated before they make it up. Otacross and Ban arrive and Otcross fuses his LBX's to form Perfect ZX-3. The panda bear takes off her mask and reveals herself to be Ami, who is now under Detector's control. Dark Pandora picks up Minerva and throws her over the edge of the building. Elysion boards the Riding Saucer and saves Minerva before the frame is destroyed. He returns to the roof and returns Minerva to Ran for repairs. Afterwards Elysion enters the battle box as Ban and Otacross prepare to battle Ami. Meanwhile the others arrive at Dragon Tower after learning the docks were a decoy, but as they try to head up they get ambushed by enemy LBX's, ensuring Ami would not have a fair number of combatants facing her.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 08\n| Title               = Ami Was an Enemy\n| TranslitTitle       = Teki ni Natta Ami\n| NativeTitle         = \u6575\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30df\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|3|7}}\n| ShortSummary        = Ami battles Ban and Otacross in a winner takes all slugfest. Ami's speed seems to be too much for Ban and Oacross to handle. Otacross eventually gets frustrated and just has Perfect ZX-3 throw out an arm. It manages to make contact with the Pandora and temporarily stuns Ami. Ban follows suit by firing off his finisher Holy Lance forcing the Pandora and Kunoichi's into the air. Otacross uses his Thundercross while the LBX's are in the air to cause a breakover and free Ami from control. Ami collapses, and Ban decides to install the vaccine program. We learn the LBX's the others were fighting were brainjacked as they shut down when the vaccine program finishes installing. Ami comes to and admits she does not remember anything after Pandora was destroyed at Tokio SIA. Ami is told how the Detectors are handling the LBX fighters and decides to fight, but a severe headache hits her and keeps her from joining NICS at this time. The team takes Ami back to Japan where she is placed in Rina and the Seekers custody. Takuya joins the group and announces he'll be joining them from here on out, but he also brings with him a surprise. Yuuya Haibara joins the team. The group returns to N City where Takuya and Yuuya are officially made NICS members. NICS decides to investigate Crystar Ingram and Omegadain behind the scenes, but first they decide to analyze the new data they received from the China incident.

The scene shifts to Omegadain's test room where we see the youth that said he would destroy Ban in the first episode. His name is Kazama Kirito, and he's Omegadain's test player. Kirito destroys 10 LBX's with his customized Dequoo in less than a minute. While a video explaining Omegadain's role in M-chips is playing Ban, Jin, and Yuuya are sent to try to make it to Omegadain's controlroom through the air shafts. Kirito sees them and decides to make a challenge. Jin and Ban make it to the halls where their air vents are located, but Ban gets trapped in the bathroom and has to alter the infiltration route. Yuuya also makes it to his vent, but he is intercepted by Kirito and forced into battle. Yuuya debuts his Liu Bei LBX to battle against Kirito's customized Joker. While Yuuya battles Kirito Ban and Jin close in on the control room, but government officials show up and force them to vacate their hiding places. As the battle between Liu Bei and Joker hits a high mark, the government officials arrive where Yuuya and Kirito are battling. They force the battle to stop and the Vice President of A Nation announces that Omegadain is being blockaded by the government. All non-Omegadain personnel are forced to leave the premises, including Ban, Jin, and Yuuya.

Hiro, Ran, and Jessica are sent out to take out as many brainjacked LBX's as possible until the super computer can be found. The enemy LBX's overwhelm them, and Perseus ends up being saved by M. Goujou, Cryster Ingram's test player. After the battle the LBX's stop their revolt. Detector comes on and gives the Egyptian Presidency one hour to stop all foreign oil shipments. If they fail to do so, he will restart the LBX riot. Otacross finally tracks the brainjacked super computer to a local hotel that is also being used as a refugee site for the LBX attack. Jessica instantaneously memorises the map of the building, and she leads Hiro and Ran through the hotel to stop the computer. Meanwhile in N City Takuya, Ban, Jin, and Yuuya visit Omegadain's President. He basically confronts them and asks them why they keep suspecting him of being guilty of espionage when there are multiple reports showing M Chips to be safe. Takuya brings up the hidden room, so Alan takes them to it and shows them it is a manufacturing line for M chips. Back in Egypt, Hiro, Jessica, and Ran make it to the computer room corridor but they get cut off by two Anubius LBX's and a slave player.

Before they can leave though Hiro gets another vision showing him the hotel could explode. Hiro insists on Otacross looking it up and refuses to leave until this mystery can be solved. While waiting for more details a computer in the hotel overheats and explodes. It causes some minor damage to the hotel. Otacross reveals that the hotel's cooling system appears to be what was compromised during the brainjacking. While it cooled off the hotel enough to help the customers, it did not cool it off enough for the computer systems. Otacross finds a second computer getting ready to catch fire. If it does, it will ignite the oil tank next to it and cause the hotel to explode. The hotel is evacuated and Hiro and Goujou rush to stop the computer. They find Achilles Deed blocking their way so they send out Perseus and the mystery LBX, which is finally revealed to be called Shin Egypt. Shortly after the battle commences Ran and Jessica use the Duck Shuttle's control pods to send their LBX's to distract Achilles Deed. With Achilles Deed distracted Hiro and Goujou are able to turn off the super computer and prevent it from exploding. Back in N City, Takuya learns that the Egyptian riot has been stopped.

Yuuya boards the train and is followed close by Kirito. As the train takes off Yuuya reveals what he heard. 5 mysterious youths get out of their seats and head to the back of the train. Two decide to stand guard at the door while another 2 send in their Hakai-O's to cut the back train car off. As they do so the train begins to slow down.

Jin starts to battle him, but Takuya picks up a third LBX in the drivers room. Shortly after the train speeds up again. Takuya decides to investigate on his own and gets locked in the second car by the sixth man. He contacts the guys, and when Kirito learns the story about the rain robbers is true he lets them pass. Ban, Jin, and Yuuya are stopped at the last car by the guards. A third member of the gang comes out and backs them up by one car. Ban, Jin, and Yuuya are forced to battle their opponents Hakai-O's.

Elysion and Triton go to cover for him, and Jin has Triton use a baseball-like swing to send one of the charges back towards the Hakai-O's. It stuns the Hakai-O's while Liu Bei recovers. Ban and company then destroy their LBX's, and Jin ties up the thieves with Triton. With 3 opponents down Yuuya is sent to free Takuya while Ban and Jin move on. The other two Wild Badge members send out their Hakai-O's to stop them, and they are joined by the sixth man who is revealed to be the leader of the group. His name is Bartz.

Seeing no other choice Ban, Jin, and Yuuya decide to use their automatic entries from being finalists the year before to enter Artemis. Jessica proposes they form two teams of three since each team can hold up to three members. The others agree, but Hiro hesitates saying he does not have the experience needed to compete at Artemis. Otacross proposes Hiro, Ran, and Jessica be given special training by participating in Angra Texas, A Nation's most dangerous and no rules LBX tournament. Jessica protests the decision, but her father overrules her and makes it official. Otacross then assigns Ban, Jin, and Yuuya as trainers for Hiro, Ran, and Jessica. Ban is teamed up with Hiro, Jin with Jessica, and Yuuya with Ran. Jessica and Ran refuse to listen to any advice Jin and Yuuya give them during training, but Hiro absorbs it all.

Shortly afterwards Jessica and Billy get their tenth wins to advance to the finals, and Hiro picks up his ninth win. Angra Texas announces a head-to-had match between Hiro and Ran will determine who gets the final spot. They are given half an hour to prepare for the fight. During this time Ran and Yuuya get into a fight, making Yuuya feel like a lousy coach. Jessica tells him not to worry that Ban will have learned from him, but she says it takes girls using their own unique skills to be able to apply all the principles. Outside Jin comes across Ran and is surprised by what he sees. The half hour draws to a conclusion, and the fight between Ran and Hiro begins. Jin comes in as coach for Ran for this one fight instead of Yuuya. Despite her earlier struggles Ran appears to have mastered the sword and shield Liu Bei uses and she is able to hold off most of Perseus's attacks. The two appear fairly even, but Ran slowly drives Hiro into a corner. Little does she know Hiro is studying her looking for a way to throw Minerva off balance. During a thrust Hiro leaps into the air instead of to the side causing Minerva to lose balance. Perseus jabs Minerva from behind causing a break over and moving Hiro onto the 3-way final.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 15\n| Title               = Three-way Duel\n| TranslitTitle       = Kett\u014d Toraianguru\n| NativeTitle         = \u6c7a\u95d8 \u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|5|2}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jessica, Hiro, and Billy Stallion prepare to battle for the Angra Texas title.

The stadium is revealed, and all non-combatants are asked to leave, including the coaches. As the final match starts Billy decides to first target Perseus. He causes Perseus to run into a mine field, thereby trapping him and making it where he will fight Jessica one-on-one. Jessica mistakenly thinks that Billy has feelings for her, but when Billy admits the only thing he has feelings for is LBX's and that the matches he had been checking out were Hiro's she gets mad. Jessica is able to use this fury to increase her speed, and she uses the terrain as a shield. Billy decides to narrow things down and uses his quick draw to eliminate most of the mountains Jessica has been using as a shield. He then shoots her shield out of her hand, leading to a one-on-one quick draw competition. Hiro decides to use his Cosmo Slash finisher to eliminate the rest of the land mines, and as the smokescreen reaches Jessica and Billy shots are fired. Bill walks out the winner and turns his eyes towards Hiro. Billy's speed proves to be too much for Hiro at first, but Hiro remembers what it was like fighting with a lance. He decides to turn Perseus's entire body into a lance. He manages to knock away Billy's guns, and after him and Billy regain their weapons of choice they face down each other. Hiro gains new speed and manages to make it a close fight that Billy cannot keep up with. Billy is defeated, and Hiro becomes the Anga Texas champion.

Hiro and Yuuya head to Geek Street where Hiro hopes to collect rare Senshiman action figures. Yuuya tags along hoping to learn about some of the shows he has never seen, having had no real childhood. They get what Hiro wanted to get, but some of the geeks present recognize them and ask them to battle. As neither of them had brought their LBX's they get a couple of loaners to do battle. Meanwhile, Jin talks with Ban and helps him realize he cannot control all the attacking and force someone else to adjust their pace. Back at the geek shop all 5 people that recognized Yuuya and Hiro participate in a 5-on-2 battle. Without having Perseus, Hiro begins to realize what true teamwork is. Yuuya leads 4 of the guys in a distraction maneuver while Hiro takes out the lone shark. 4-on-2 seems a little more reasonable as Hiro and Yuuya each are able to dispose of 2 of their opponents. As everyone returns to NICS both Ban and Hiro ask for one more battle to end the day. It's a 3-on-1 battle of Jeanne D, Triton, and Liu Bei against Sigma Orbis.

Otacross is unable to locate the control computer, so Ban, Hiro, and Ran launch Elysion, Perseus, and Minerva on Riding Saucers to find the best ways to attack the LBX's in the city. Along the way, Hiro nearly crashes into an automatic blimp flying around the city. Detector finally comes on and informss the world that Campbellen is but the first city in his plan for world domination. From Campbellen he will take control of the whole Australian nation and then eventually the whole world. Otacross is finally able to lock onto the control computers EM waves, but he learns there are four readings. They are coming from the four automated blimps floating around the city. The team thinks they can handle 3 of them, but they are unsure what to do with the fourth. Reinforcements arrive as President Zaizen sends Yagami and his team in the Eclipse to assist in the battle. Along with them is Ami and her new Pandora. Otacross hacks into the 4 blimps computers and forces them to land. The groups then leave the Duck Shuttle and the Eclipse in teams of two to do battle. Ban and Hiro enter the first blimp where they find Gouda is now a slace player. Jin and Yuuya enter blimp two where they find Daiki. Ran and Jessica team up in blimp three where Otasilver is the slave player. Finally, Ami and Yagami infiltrate blimp four and run into Yamaneko. The teams get trapped in D-Eggs and are forced to battle the slave players who use familiar, yet different LBX's - Hakai-O Dogma, Nightmare Fear, Bibinbird Chaos, and Bloody Ribbon.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 29\n| Title               = The Truth Detector\n| TranslitTitle       = Ditekut\u0101 Sono Shinjitsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u30c7\u30a3\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc \u305d\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|8|1}}\n| ShortSummary        = The battles between the Slave Players and the agents of NICS intensify, but in the end Ban and his friends walk out with the victories thanks to the finishers Holy Lance, Ocean Blast, Homura Kuzushi, and Souken Rangaki. The Eclipse picks up Gouda while the Duck Shuttle picks up Daiki, Otasilver, and Yamaneko, much to the relief of Otacross. Hiro notices that all four blimps are from the Ocean Museum locally and thinks that it might have something to do with Detector. The group goes to investigate and finds that Asuka has been turned into a slave player. Ban and Hiro fight Asuka and Vampire Cat but try to remain cautious because of her strength. Detector watches the battle carefully and decides to send someone in. The person ends up being Kazuya, who is teamed with Achilles Deed. Asuka sees the collar and assumes that Kazuya is on her side, but Black Achilles uses Black Storm in Demonic Mode to break over Vampire Cat. Kazuya takes off the collar and reveals he is not a slave player, much to Ban's relief, but he reveals that he has been working with Detector because they have found a greater threat. Afterwards Detector reveals himself to be none other than Professor Yamano. Professor Yamano reveals that the Ocean Museum has been secretly manufacturing missiles for a super weapon. Ocean Museum is owned by none other than Omegadain, who also owns the super weapon. The super weapon they have created is the Paradise Satellite. The group hesitates believing Professor Yamano until they see the weapons themselves. Ban confront his father on turning the LBX's evil and destroying many people's dreams, but a temporary truce is called for when they learn Omegadain is about to make another move. Professor Yamano is also confronted by Asuka as she questions why he turned her into a slave player. Professor Yamano reveals that while he did make the others into slave players, Asuka was made a slave player by Omegadain as they tried to protect their weapon.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 30\n| Title               = The Father and Son of LBX\n| TranslitTitle       = Chantoko no LBX\n| NativeTitle         = \u7236\u3068\u5b50\u306eLBX\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|8|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = The team is able to shut down the missiles and Ocean Museum is turned over to the Australian government.

Secretary Kaios informs Professor Yamano that he will be tried for his terrorist acts, but not until the possibility of war ends. First they must stop Omegadain's plans. Professor Yamano instructs NICS to search the control computers he hacked for information on Paradise being a secret military base. The group finds no definitive evidence that Paradise is a military base. However the Seekers base reveals a shocking truth. By further delving into the records, they find Paradise has occasionally let off mysterious energy aimed right at nations that have opposed A-Nation's power plants. The group realizes that Paradise must have a laser firing system that is doing the destroying. Professor Yamano instructs NICS to search for the tanker Future Hope, believing it operates Paradise. The tanker is found, but a large radar device keeps the team from getting close. With no other choice 8 of the kids use Riding Saucers while Kazuya just uses Achilles Deed's flight system. The group is launched out of the Duck Shuttle.

Ami makes the save. The boys and Jessica finish off the air LBX's and then join the other three in defeating the ground LBX's. Duck Shuttle lands on Future Hope, and the groups decide to divide into two teams. Professor Yamano will lead Ban, Kazuya, and all the girls except Jessica to what they believe is the control room while Cobra will lead Hiro, Jin, Yuuya, and Jessica to a second room that has high computer readings coming from it. At the center of the ship, the teams get ambushed in a missile room. Asuka, Jessica, and Ran stay behind to take out the new enemy LBX's while Ban, Kazuya, and Ami head up with his father toward the control room. Cobra leads Hiro, Jin, and Yuuya to the second room where they find Hiro's mom, Professor Haruka Ozora programming a new supercomputer called Adam and Eve. Hiro criticizes his mom for getting too caught up in her work and ignoring all the terrorist activities Omegadain has done. She informs them the only way to shut down Future Hope is in the control room. Doctor Mummy watches the groups' progress from the control room and tells everyone to evacuate the ship after putting it in lockdown. Professor Ozora has Adam and Eve access Omegadain's hidden files and reads what activities they have truly been performing. She decides to leave Omegadain after shutting down Adam and Eve, but first she will help the group destroy Future Hope. Professor Yamano, Ban, Ami, and Kazuya make it to the control room where Doctor Mummy greets them. Ban recognizes that Doctor Mummy is covered in bandages and has the same hair color that Lex did.

Doctor Mummy sends out a Killer Droid to take care of Elysion, Achilles Deed, and Pandora. The group gets trapped in the battlefield and decides to use their speed and agility to aggravate Killer Droid until Hiro and Ran can arrive and form Sigma Orbis. Hiro, Jin, and Yuuya advance toward the control room but get surrounded by LBX's. When their LBX's get cornered, Vampire Bat ambushes some of the LBX's from behind. Shortly thereafter, Jeanne D and Minerva do likewise. The six LBX's combined overwhelm Omegadain's LBX fleet, allowing them to once again advance towards the control room. Over at Omegadain, Kirito finds evidence on their computer that supports the idea that Lex is Doctor Mummy. He also finds that Omegadain is tied to someone in the presidency. He decides to take this knowledge to Alan Worthen so he can complete the Cyclops AI he's working on. Back on Future Hope, Kazuya accidentally shoots the wires on Killer Droid's feet, causing him to slow down. Ami uses this opportunity to shoot Killer Droid in the chest and weaken the shield surrounding them. Killer Droid raises up in a frenzy and reboots. Elsewhere on the ship, Doctor Ozora powers down Adam and Eve and apologizes for them having to suffer from Omegadain's plan because of their innocence. Hiro and the others arrive, and Killer Droid senses their LBX's so it expands the shield to encompass the newcomers. Ban, Hiro, and Ran try to form Sigma Orbis, but Killer Droid would not let their LBX's get close to each other. The others decide to use a coordinated attack on Killer Droid's leg wires to slow it down enough to allow Sigma Orbis to form. At the President's office Jessica's father arrives and forces his way into the office. He reveals Omegadain's hidden weapon and reveals that someone in the Presidency is working with them. Back at Omegadain, Kirito makes it to Alan Worthen's office and finds it empty. As he prepares to leave, he sees blood on the floor. Kirito runs over to the blood and discovers Alan Worthen who is now dead. Back on Future Hope, Sigma Orbis transforms and destroys Killer Droid with one shot. Doctor Mummy flees, but before Professor Yamano can power down the computer, Doctor Ozora arrives and makes them let her do it. The ship is programmed to explode if any unauthorized users get on the computer. As she begins powering down the ship, she learns a shocking secret. Secretary Kaios is called and informed that Vice President Alfeld Gardyne is the spy in the presidency. Alfeld calls in support from Bishop, Omegadain's computer technician, and reveals he is actually an assassin who has killed Alan Worthen. His goal now is to give the Presidency to Alfeld, which means Secretary Kaios and the President have just become new collateral damage in his plan.

After entering the base the President and Secretary Kaios are introduced to Doctor Mummy, whom Alfeld refers to as Lex. Over on Future Hope, Doctor Ozora finishes powering down the base when Hiro receives one of his visions of the future. Hiro foresees a scenario where the President and Secretary Kaios perish in an explosion at the National Defense Base. Jessica recognizes the description of the building Hiro describes and gets him to confirm it is the National Defense Base. The team boards the Duck Shuttle and departs for the National Defense Base. Along the way, Cobra is able to hack into the base's cameras, with the help of Professor Yamano, and they confirm the President and Secretary Kaios are being held there. Back at the National Defense Base, Alfeld questions the President on the code to access the satellite controls. The President refuses to give him the codes, and he says they will be doing this in a while. As the Duck Shuttle flies toward the National Defense Base, Professor Yamano is asked some questions by Doctor Ozora and the kids. One of the questions he gets asked is how he was able to be Detector when the kids were in England standing next to him. Kazuya admits that it was a pre-recorded segment and that he was helping Professor Yamano by that time. As they get closer Takuya expresses a concern anbout getting the Duck Shuttle close enough with being detected. Otacross finds a path in the canyon that will keep the Duck Shuttle off the National Defense Base's radar, and Metamo R flies them through that route. Unluckily for the group LBX's have been dispatched around the National Defense Base in case something like this happens.

Team 1 is Jessica, Asuka, Yuuya, and Takuya. Team 2 id Ban, Hiro, Ran, and Professor Yamano. Team 3 consists of Jin, Ami, Kazuya, and Cobra. While the groups make their way up three canyons to sneak into the base, Otacross and Professor Ozora find the best infiltration route for the base using a video game simulation. Words reaches the Defense Base that one platoon of their LBX's has been eliminated, so they send an army of LBX's down the canyon to try and slow everyone down. Jessica, Asuka, Yuuya, Jin, Ami, and Kazuya are all spotted by the defense LBX's and are forced to fight. Ban, Hiro, Ran, and Professor Yamano spot the defense LBX's before they are spotted and hide behind a rock where they would not be seen. The defense LBX's give up on them. Professor Yamano spots a side canyon trail that will take them to the same location without getting caught, so Ban and company go up that trail. Professor Ozora successfully finds a way through the case to the command center and sends the data to the teams. Ban sends Elysion in to knock out the fans, and then the team begins sneaking through the base. All is going well until Hiro trips in the vehicle assembly area and causes some noise. Groups come rushing to capture them, but the other two teams arrive and cause a distraction, allowing Ban and his team to make it to the command center's entryway. As they arrive at the entryway they are confronted by Lt. Jack Gelato, leader of the Fire Sweets LBX squad. He uses one of Professor Yamano's original creations, Proto I to engage the guys in a D-egg battle. Proto I has amazing speed and a special mechanism known as the High-Dimensional Multiple Joint System that lets it flip when it gets attacked from both sides.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 35\n| Title               = The Threatening LBX Proto I\n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u014di no LBX Puroto I\n| NativeTitle         = \u8105\u5a01\u306eLBX \u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30fbI\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|9|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Proto I proves to be too strong for Ban, Hiro, and Ran to handle. However Professor Yamano notices Proto I still has a problem with overheating. Ban proposes the merge to form Sigma Orbis, but Professor Yamano tells him to wait until they have only around 10% power remaining. If they can cause Proto I to overheat, they have a chance of beating him with Sigma Orbis. Minerva gets severely damaged, but Ban and Hiro use Elysion and Perseus to distract Proto I until it's time to merge. With only 10% power remaining, the group merges into Sigma Orbis. With roughly only 5% power remaining Proto I finally overheats and Sigma Orbis is able to beat him. The group shows Jack Gelato proof of the President and Secretary Kaios having been brought in, and he decides to help the group. Jack tries to enter the passcode to access the command center, but it has been changed, and the President and Secretary Kaios are trapped inside. Alfeld, Doctor Mummy, and Bishop are seen boarding the space shuttle at the base as they were unable to gain the needed passcode, but they seem unfazed. Ban and company use Sigma Orbis's finisher to open the door, and Secretary Kaios and the President escape with only 5 seconds to spare before the command center explodes. The group races to the shuttle's control room and the shuttle's launch pad as two different teams to try and stop the launch. Professor Yamano is able to hack part of the ship's system and tries to dump the fuel, but instead the Command Center's computers all power down. The ship launches as Alfeld heads toward space. Secretary Kaios then announces they will return to NICS immediately and re-equip the Duck Shuttle so the kids can pursue them into space and stop Paradise permanently.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 36\n| Title               = Take Off into Space\n| TranslitTitle       = Uch\u016b e no Hasshin\n| NativeTitle         = \u5b87\u5b99\u3078\u306e\u767a\u9032\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|10|3}}\n| ShortSummary        = After dropping off Secretary Kaios and the President, the team heads to a secondary NICS facility to modify the Duck Shuttle for space travel. Meanwhile, in space, Alfeld, Doctor Mummy, and Bishop board Paradise and Doctor Mummy is tasked with starting up Paradise. Doctor Mummy succeeds, and Alfeld begins to laugh. While Duck Shuttle is being updated, Professor Yamano announces that Minerva will be getting upgrades to make her worthy of space travel. He also reveals that they have been given two Proto I's by Jack Gelato and that these LBX's will be customized for Ban and Hiro. Detector returns, though everyone suspects it is actually Alfeld. Detector orders the world to surrender and vows to show everyone the Detectors' real power. Alfeld uses the Paradise satellite to destroy an unmanned A-Nation Island. He then gives everyone a 6-hour deadline to surrender or he will destroy their nations one-by-one. Secretary Kaios and the President think about what they should do when the NICS main headquarter computer goes into lockdown and traps everyone in the facility. Alfeld comes on and announces the President has been kidnapped by Detector but that A Nation will continue to fight the terrorists. The people rally and support his words. Secretary Kaios learns that the direct communication with Duck Shuttle is still active and contacts the group. Doctor Ozora informs him that the lockdown probably means NICS will be the next target. She also reveals it takes 6 hours to recharge the satellite cannon. Duck Shuttle's renovations are completed and Professor Yamano begins construction on an upgraded Minerva. After the Duck Shuttle loads onto the launch pad many enemy LBX's begin attacking. The kids, minus Ran, launch on the Riding Saucers and start taking out many of the LBX's, but they are overwhelmed. When the launch pad gets attacked, Hiro and Ban decide to sacrifice their Riding Saucers to keep it safe. Triton and Liu Bei save Elysion and Perseus. The kids reboard the Duck Shuttle and launch only seconds before the launch pad is destroyed, but they make it into space safely.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 37\n| Title               = The Descent of Icarus\n| TranslitTitle       = Ikarosu no K\u014drin\n| NativeTitle         = \u30a4\u30ab\u30ed\u30b9\u306e\u964d\u81e8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|10|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = After making it into space, Doctor Ozora reveals that with Paradise's computer reactivated, they will face a dangerous laser defense system. Otacross comes up with the idea that they can create a dodging program and avoid the lasers successfully so they can infiltrate Paradise. Otacross and Doctor Ozora begin working on the new program. Meanwhile the kids are reminded that their LBX's must remain on the Flying Saucers and use various long range guns or they will lose their LBX's to space forever. The exception to this is Achilles Deed and the newly remodeled Minerva Kai, which is presented back to Ran. After giving Ran Minerva Kai, Professor Yamano returns to working on new LBX's for Ban and Hiro. Enemy LBX's begin to attack, and everyone launches except Ban and Hiro. The damage Elysion and Perseus suffered from the sacrifice of their Flying Saucers has penetrated their cores, making them unable to be used. Minerva Kai and Achilles Deed do their best to take out any enemy LBX's that get too close while the others fly out further, but Duck Shuttle comes under attack. Too much damage to Duck Shuttle would make it unable to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Professor Yamano completes the modifications to the Proto I's, and Ban and Hiro launch Ikaros Zero and Ikaros Force. Ikaros Zero and Ikaros Force easily dispose of the enemy LBX's while debuting a new mode they have - weapons form. Under weapons form, the Ikaros can turn into a weapon their partner can use to delete most enemies with a finishing function. In this episode, Ban turns Ikaros Zero into weapon form and Hiro destroys most of the enemy LBX's with the Finishing Function 00 Sword. The group has their LBX's reboard the Duck Shuttle. On Paradise Kirito vows to get the 3% data he needs to finish his program to bring his girlfriend back to life before Ban and company get there. Duck Shuttle comes into range of the laser defense system, and when the ship gets down to a 20% dodge rate, it looks like they will be destroyed. However Doctor Ozora and Otacross arrive with the dodging program and uploads Metamo R with it. He is able to get the Duck Shuttle to dodge all attacks and get under the satellite where there are no lasers, allowing the Ikaros and Minerva Kai to go out and create a passage for them.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 38\n| Title               = Capturing Paradise\n| TranslitTitle       = Paradaisu o K\u014dryaku Seyo\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u653b\u7565\u305b\u3088\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|10|17}}\n| ShortSummary        = In order to get inside Paradise, Ikaros Force, Ikaros Zero, and Minerva Kai must create an opening. Ikaros Force goes into his weapon form and Ikaros Zero uses Meteor Breaker to penetrate the first layer of steel. Minerva Kai then uses her Extreme Flame Avalanche finisher to penetrate the second layer and create the needed opening. Ikaros Force then downloads the blue prints for Paradise, allowing Otacross to come up with a route to the command center. In order to make it to the command center the group will have to divide into 4 teams and destroy the limiters, thereby activating the elevator. Otacross leads the group into Paradise, but about halfway in they are cut off by Kirito. Kirito has decided to get the final 3% he needs to complete Cyclops AI through battle. He traps Ban, Hiro, and Ran in a D-Egg and sends out his Dequoo OZ, Hakai-O Kirito Custom, and Joker Kirito Custom to battle Ikaros Zero, Ikaros Force, and Minerva Kai. A glimpse of Kirito's past is seen. Many weeks ago, Kirito had a girlfriend named Amy. One rainy day, Kirito was running late to a date and a truck slid on the wet road and killed Amy right in front of his eyes. Kirito built an android version of Amy, but without the perfect brain it lacked the feelings that it was Amy. Alan Worthen offered Kirito the perfect brain on the pretext that he would become Omegadain's test player. That perfect brain is part of Cyclops AI and sits now at 97%. The group begins to battle, and Ikaros Zero destroys Hakai-O Kirito Custom with Cosmo Slash. Minerva Kai destroys Joker Kirito custom with Extreme Flame Avalanche. Just before Ban can unleash Ikaros Force's finisher, the download reaches 100% and Dequo-OZ powers up abruptly. Ikaros Zero transforms into weapon mode and they unleash the Meteor Breaker to counter Dequoo-OZ's strength from the finisher X Blade. The two powerful finishers makes the D-Egg to go unstable and allows a mysterious LBX to infiltrate the battlefield. The mysterious LBX stabs Dequoo-OZ through the chest and steals the perfect brain. Alfeld comes on and thanks Kirito for his hardwork and relieves him of his duties, announcing that the perfect brain can only work in LBX's and could never work in an android. Alfeld's LBX flees with the perfect brain, and the kids are able to move on. Kirito collapses to the ground utterly devastated. As the group moves on they divide into teams. Ami goes with Kazuya, Jin with Yuuya, Jessica with Asuka, and Ban, Hiro, and Ran travel with Professor Yamano and Doctor Ozora. They destroy the limiters and activate the emergency elevators. As the groups arrive in the control corridor hallway an alarm sounds. The emergency doors to the control center close with only Ban's team making it through to the elevator. Seeing no other choice Ban's group takes the elevator to the control room where they are welcomed by Alfeld, Doctor Mummy, and Bishop with only 15 minutes left until the satellite can fire again.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 39\n| Title               = The Ultimate Power of Zeus\n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u016bkyoku no Chikara Zeusu\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a76\u6975\u306e\u529b \u30bc\u30a6\u30b9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|10|24}}\n| ShortSummary        = Ota X finds a way for the other teams to get out, while Ban and his team have a confrontation with Gardyne.

If that were not enough LBX's begin showing up all over the place and begin attacking the audience. Luckily the Duck Shuttle shows up. Ban, Hiro, Ran, Jin, Kazu, Ami, Asuka, Yuuya, and Jessica launch their LBX's and begin battling the enemies LBX's. A mysterious boy named San controls the LBX's, but he decides to save his wildcards for another day. Ban and Hiro communicate with Tenma and the other soccer players, and they come up with a plan to destroy the enemy LBX's.<br><br>Once the enemy LBX's are destroyed another new girl appears. She casts some sort of spell that causes everyone in the world to start disappearing. Luckily Fei arrives in the Inazuma Bus and saves Shunsei Inazuma Japan. They follow the Duck Ship to the woods where they introduce themselves and quickly become friends.<br><br>A little later on a scream is heard in the woods. Ban, Hiro, and Tenma rush to the scene where they save a girl named Fran from two LBX's. The group quickly begins to know Fran and thinks she is becoming their friend. It is all a setup though. Fran tries to make them all disappear in the night, but their hope and goals protect them. Fran realizes the only way to defeat them is by causing dissent within the ranks.<br><br>Slowly dissent is caused. First Fran has a killer droid destroy Pandora and Achilles Deed, which causes Kazu and Ami to disappear. Then she plants evidence that will turn the two groups against each other.  What she had not counted on was Shinsuke watching her planting the evidence in the tent in middle of the  last night. He reveals this to everyone, and they turn against Fran. Fran summons Asta and San revealing that the three are the responsibles for what is happening right now, and the three challenge everyone to a soccer (against Asta) and LBX (against San) match at coordinates G223.<br><br>Of course everyone rushes off to do the battle. Asta and San use techniques which cause the teams to turn against each other, but Ban, Hiro, and Tenma use their various speeches to again focus the group. Inazuma Japan ends up defeating Asta's The Destructchers 3-2, and Ban and his friends destroy all of San's LBX's. Fran goes ballistic when she sees her brothers lose and attacks both groups with her own LBX, keshin armed and soccer special technique that erases everything. The groups unite to create God Hand W which engulfs Fran and turns her back into her light hearted good self. <br><br>With Fran and her brothers defeated the worlds are restored to normal. The groups say goodbye before disappearing and go back to their worlds where they can once again enjoy soccer, LBX battles, and for Fran she can be reunited with her siblings and create a world full of flowers and joy.\n}}\n|}\n\n==''Little Battlers eXperience Wars''==\n'''Opening themes'''\n* \"Mugen Myself\" by Little Blue boX (eps 1-21)\n* \"Eternal\" by Little Blue boX (eps 22-37)\n'''Ending themes'''\n* \"Kamisama Y\u0101y\u0101y\u0101\" by Dream5 (eps 1-21)\n* \"Bokutachi no Wars\" by Ryota Ohsaka, Sayori Ishizuka, and Tomoaki Maeno (eps 22-36)\n* \"Hirameki\" by Ryota Ohsaka (ep 37)\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%; margin:left; background:#FFF;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #CCF\"\n! style=\"width:3em;\"  | No.\n!

At a special assembly Ban explains why he has come only to have Arata ask Ban is he will hold a match with him. Ban agrees. What Ban does not tell him is that it will be a tag-team match. Ban (w/ Odin) teams up with Jin (w/ Zenon) and battles Arata (w/ Dot Blastizer) and Muraku Houjou (w/ Magna Orthus). Ban and Jin easily prevail over the two. Ban tells Arata the reason he lost is because he is not conversing with his LBX. Later Ban and Arata hold a rematch with Achilles and Achilles Deeed. This time the two put up an even fight. Arata is able to communicate with Achilles Deed. In the end both use their hissatsu techniques (Lightning Lance & Cosmo Slash) and end the battle in a draw. After the battle Ban decides to go to Nation-A to continue learning more about LBX's when he graduates High School, and Arata is finally able to leave the island after getting his permission form signed.\n}}\n|}\n\n==''LBX: Little Battlers eXperience''==\n\n===Season 1===\n'''Ending theme'''\n* \"Battle On\" by Mike Twining & Andrew Twining \n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%; margin:left; background:#FFF;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #CCF\"\n! style=\"width:3em;\"  | No.\n! style=\"width:12em;\" | Dub Title\n! style=\"width:12em;\" | Original U.S. airdate\n|-\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 01\n| Title           = Starting Small\n| AltDate         = August 24, 2014<ref name=\"TV Guide\">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/lbx/episodes-season-1/683506/ | title=LBX Season 1 Episodes | publisher = TV Guide | accessdate = August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Van Yamano and his best friends Amy Cohen and Kaz Walker have just entered the Artemis Tournament with the objective to become the best LBX players in the world.

A tournament known is Artemis is held to determine whom the best fighter is. This year Yamano Ban, Aoshima Kazuya, and Kawamura Ami are in the tournament with their LBX's. After the trio pulls off a shocking victory in the first round Ban thinks back to how he met his robot earlier that year. Ban has loved LBX's all his life. His father created them and early on showed Ban how to love and care for them. However his father went missing 8 years earlier when Plane PA027 went missing on its way to the Neo Technology Summit. No wreckage was ever found, but Ban's mom has not allowed him to play with an LBX since then at home. It all changes when a mysterious lady breaks out of the Innovator base and finds Ban, She gives him a case that he takes home. When Ban opens the case at home he finds a LBX inside. Before he can activate it a laser scans him. Outside 3 Innovator spies reveal this LBX has a Death Lock inside it and if an uncertified user picks it up it will kill that person with a poisonous dart. Ban ends up being the certified user, so the three spies attack him with their Dequoo LBX's. Ban is chased behind the couch by a Dequoo with a gun, and the other two attempt to chop up his LBX until he gets it activated. Once activated Ban is able to dispose of the three Dequoo's, but it leaves the entertainment room in shambles. His mom arrives home and says it is ok for him to keep the LBX, but first he needs to clean the room up. She then goes outside and thinks to herself that something big is about to happen.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 02\n| Title               = The Lost Achilles\n| TranslitTitle       = Ubawareta Akiresu\n| NativeTitle         = \u596a\u308f\u308c\u305f\u30a2\u30ad\u30ec\u30b9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|3|9}}<ref name=\"ANC-February\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ban takes the AX-00 to the Kitajima Model Shop where he meets with Ami. He tells Kitijama, Saki, and Ami the story of how he got the LBX. At the Innovators base Yagami finds out why the Professor sent Ban the LBX. He learns AX-00 is protecting an item known as the Platinum Capsule. If anyone other than Ban were to try and grab AX-00, not only would they die from the poisonous dart, but the death lock system would also self destruct and destroy the Platinum Capsule. The only way to regain this would be by defeating AX-00 in a LBX battle. Over at Tiny Orbit the board asks the director Uzaki Yuusuke why he built the unauthorized Achilles form. He reveals the specs and points out that this design is more advanced than anything they've ever had before, and it will make them millions. He goes back to his office where he receives another blueprint for a LBX to be called Hunter. He signs his name J. Back at Kitajima's Kitajima decides to give Ban the Achilles armor, but he is disappointed to learn that Saki has sold it, until he learns the cash card is fake. If Ban can find Gouda Honza and defeat him he can use the Achilles armor for free. Ban heads to school with Ami and shows Kazu his new LBX. He then asks Kazu if he knows anything about Gouda. Kazu reveals Gouda uses a LBX known as the Destruction God of Hell and he is one of the Four Devas. Kazu refuses to tell them where Gouda is and leaves before ban can pressure him into giving up more details. After school Ban and Ami recruit the help of Ryuu and go looking for Gouda's base. Mika ends up telling them where it is. Once they arrive at the base Ban, Amy, and Ryuu meet the other three Divas and their LBX's- Riko with Queen, Tetsuo with Nazu, and Ginji with Mad Dog. The trio refuse to give up Gouda's location unless these 3 can beat them in a LBX battle. When AX-00 begins predicting his opponents moves Ban gains a slight advantage. That advantage quickly fails with Ryuu's Buld is destroyed by Queen's gun fire and rockets. Ryuu withdraws, and just before AX-00 is destroyed Kazu makes the save with Warrior. With Kazu's added strength Ban is able to destroy the three LBX's, with an assist from a magnetic charge by Warrior. After repairing their LBX's the three enter a nearby door and meet Gouda face-to-face.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 03\n| Title               = Hell's Destroyer\n| TranslitTitle       = Jigoku no Hakaishin\n| NativeTitle         = \u5730\u7344\u306e\u7834\u58ca\u795e\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|3|16}}<ref name=\"WN-March\">{{cite web|url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/84 |script-title=ja:\u30c0\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u6226\u6a5f |publisher=Web Newtype |language=Japanese |accessdate=March 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5x5Csi5bD?url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/84 |archivedate=March 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = Gouda returns the Achilles frame to Ban and reveals he was told to take it to keep it out of the hands of dangerous organizations on unsmart kids. He then challenges Ban, Kazu, and Ami to a 3-on-1 battle against his Hakai-O, AKA the Destruction God of Hell. Kunoichi is customized for speed while Warrior and Achilles are customized for short distance shooting. The three also come up with a strategy to take down Hakai-O using hit-and-run tactics. The plan backfires on them when Hakai-O uses his Gaou Cannon to create a smokescreen. Hakai-O then moves in on Warrior and crushes him. The second time Hakai-O uses his Gaou cannon Kazu realizes that Hakai-O temporarily goes offline because of the amount of power that it uses. After the third attack he tells Ban and Ami the news, and on the fourth attack Ban is able to grab Warrior's gun and take out the Gaou Cannon before moving in and knocking him out of commission. Gouda keeps his word and lets them keep the Achilles frame. At the Innovators headquarters Yagami is on the phone and tells them not to worry about Achilles being completed.

Him and Ami agree to battle at Kitajima's after school, but first they want to check on Kazu and see if he has gotten over his LBX being destroyed. Ryu ends up claiming he is the one who defeated Gouda and gets hero worship from all the kids, but his speech backfires on him and forces him to hide after school when they ask him to defeat Gouda and get their LBX's back from them. Over at the Innovators base Yagami has finished construction on a new LBX that he believes will win him the Platinum Capsule. He dispatches a task force to make sure it can target Achilles. Ban and Ami head to Kitajima's and find Kazu is not there. Kazu is at a nearby mall reading the newest LBX magazine and wishing he had enough allowance to buy a new LBX. A man in a dark alleyway offers to sale him a LBX real cheap and presents to him Egypt. Egypt hypnotizes Kazu and tells him to destroy Achilles. Kazu leaves the shop table, and the man selling the LBX's is revealed to be one of the Innovator agents. Kazu finds Ban and Ami after Ban has left Kitajima's and challenges him to a battle. Kazu throws out a D-cube and Egypt. the D-cube brings up a desert setting. The Innovators agents watch the match from across the river while one of the men from Blue Cat's watches from the roadway. They see Achilles is slow to move in the sand, giving Egypt a huge advantage, but before Egypt can destroy Achilles a special mode, V-Mode is activated. The one thing Ban does not like- when Achilles is in V Mode he cannot control him. Achilles destroys Egypt and breaks Kazu out of the hypnosis. The agents retreat while the man marvels that Achilles has such a special mode on hand. Afterwards the trio return to Kitajima's where Kitajima has customized a Gladiator for Kazu to use until Kazu can buy a new LBX.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 05\n| Title               = The Dark Assassin\n| TranslitTitle       = Yami no Ansatsusha\n| NativeTitle         = \u95c7\u306e\u6697\u6bba\u8005\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|3|23}}<ref name=\"WN-March\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Dr. Kaid\u014d hopes to eliminate the prime minister Zaizen Sousuke. In order to do so he hires a professional hit man and creates a new LBX known as Assassin for him to use.

He is given a letter that says use the kids with the white LBX to prevent the attack. He is also given a new LBX to help in the mission. Hizami sends Uzaki Takuya to get Ban, Ami, and Kazu from Kitajima's. He takes them back to Blue Cat's where they show the kids the new LBX Hunter and praise Achilles maintenance. Takuya then reveals he did not get them just to show them the new LBX. Instead he hopes they'll help prevent the assassination. If they agree Kazu will be given Hunter at no charge. The kids agree and head home to practice. Kazu focuses specifically on his long range shooting, but despite calibrating the gun and doing some maintenance to Hunter he cannot seem to hit the bullseye. The next day Kazu thinks of pulling out until Ban gives a speech reminding him how LBX's should be fun but that they an lose them all if this attack succeeds.

Kazu uses Hunter to scan the building on the other side of the glass, and they find what appears to be Assassin. The three infiltrate the building and run into the 3 Dequoo's that tried to kidnap Achilles in episode 1. Achilles and Kunoichi distract the Buld's while Kazu and Hunter run up the building and take out Assassin. Only when they arrive they find out Assassin is a dummy. After destroying the Dequoo's Ami and Ban go up, and Ban sees another building nearby with a helipad on it. Once again Kazu uses Hunter's sites to zoom in, and once again Assassin is present.

Their goal was to create an endless supply of energy known as the Eternal Cycler. However Professor Yamano realized it could be used as a weapon and decided to hide the plans inside the Platinum Capsule. Ban asks Takuya and Hizami if they know where his father is being held at, and they say no. Ban and Kazu return home, but Ami stays behind to do a little snooping. Meanwhile Yagamai asks Doctor Kaid\u014d if he was responsible for the Assassin incident since Assassin was made from their specs. With Kunoichi's recording mode she finds out Professor Yamano is being held at a place called Angel Star. Ryuu explains that Angel Star is owned by Kamiya Craft and that it is the largest weapon manufacture in Japan. He also tells them they have been investigated for making secret weapons, though he believes they are innocent. Ban, Kazu, and Ami decide to investigate the building anyway. At Angel Star we are introduced to Heiji Kirishima. Kirishima originally created the boxes that house the LBX battles, but he later lost the licensing right to Tiny Orbit. As a result he now works overtime almost daily for Kamiya Craft hoping to restart his business. Ban uses Achilles to hold the door open at Angel Star, and Ban, Ami, and Kazu enter the building. The cameras quickly catch them, and a squadron of Dequoo R LBX's are sent to try and stop them. Achilles, Hunter, and Kunoichi wipe out the Dequoo R's and continue to investigate further through the air ducts where they find a new security LBC named Inbit blocking the way.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 08\n| Title               = The Great Labyrinth, Angel Star\n| TranslitTitle       = Daimeiky\u016b Enjeru Sut\u0101\n| NativeTitle         = \u5927\u8ff7\u5bae\u30a8\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|4|20}}<ref name=\"WN-April\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Ban, Ami, and Kazu run into Inbit in the air ducts.

Kamiya sees what Ban has done and decides to come up with a new strategy. He has Dequoo R's continue to distract Ban and his friends in the air ducts while he goes and gets Kirishima. He takes Kirishima out of the control, but not before having Yagami plant a false location for Professor Yamano in the control room. Kagami then tells Kirishima that Tiny Orbit has sent Achilles in to steal their most confidential data. He is promised if he can destroy Achilles that he will be given the finds to restart his company. In the control room Ban and his friends find a hidden elevator and take it to the lowest floor.

Takuya runs a computer scan and sees they are at Angel Star, so the two depart immediately to rescue them. The Steel Monster quickly shows how it got its name. The tractor is enforced with heavy armor that the LBX's cannot penetrate. It is also possessed with a laser eye system. Hunter accidentally shoots a cloth down over the camera of the Steel Monster, and Ban realizes that camera is the Achilles heel. The three change their targeting strategy to the camera, and when they take out the camera Kirishima switches to manual view. Manual view at least slows down the Steel Monsters response time. A mysterious silver colored LBX then appears. It distracts the Steel Monster and points out the large crate above it. Hunter switches his target to the crate, which comes down and crushes the Steel Monster. Kirishima escapes unharmed. Ban is then told over the Loud Speaker that Professor Yamano has been removed and the only way he can get more information is by winning Angrivisdas. An escape hatch opens revealing Hazami and Gouda.

A jet fighter then flies up to the school. A boy climbs out of the jet fighter and into Ban's class. It is the exchange student. He introduces himself as Kaid\u014d Jin and says he has nothing else to tell the class. When Ryuu asks him about LBX's later on he ignores him.

At first the group decides to walk away from them, but they tease him with the knowledge that they might know where his father is being held. Ban agrees to battle them, but they say they will only reveal where his father is being held if he can beat them 3-on-1. Ban and Achilles battle the Innovators Dequoo's. During the battle Ban learns his first finishing move, Lightning Lance, and is able to overpower them. The Innovators agents retreat without telling Ban anything, and the Four Devas remember how Gouda revealed to them that they would soon be fighting the Innovators. Afterwards the group goes into a nearby arcade where they find Gouda has lost in a LBX battle to one Sendou Daiki and his LBX Joker. Gouda is about to hand over all his territory to Daiki when he realizes there is a catch. Daiki can only claim Gouda's territory if he is the first one to defeat him. That honor went to Ban. Now the only way Daiki can claim the territory is by defeating Ban in battle. Ban and Achilles battle Daiki and Joker, but Ban relies to much on his finishing move, Lightning Lance. As a result Achilles is slow and cannot hit Joker. Daiki begins to use Joker's speed and causes what appears to be clones to appear. Before Joker can finish Achilles though the Emperor intervenes. Jin says they should finish their battle at Angrivisdas since they are both competing, and Daiki agrees. Ban is given a list of everyone competing in Angrivisdas by Gouda. He takes this list back to Kitijima's where Ami, Kazu, and Ban come up with strategies to defeat each competitor. As time runs out the group heads to Angrivisdas. Welcoming everyone to Angrivisdas is none other than the legendary LBX fighter Lex. Lex announces that each LBX battle will be unlimited regulation, meaning anything goes.

Gatoh seems to dominate the pace with his rocket launcher, forcing Ban to continually dodge and run around in circles. Eventually Kazu reminds Ban that he needs to turn the battle in his favor through pace. Ban charges straight at the Buld and begins getting in multiple hits. Gatoh decides to cheat and use a stun grenade. With Achilles stunned Gatoh breaks out an axe and chops at Achilles shield. The axe has gun powder hidden in it and sends Achilles flying. The shield falls to the side and allows Gatoh free access to Achilles right arm. He begins attacking Achilles right arm continually, hoping to chop it off. When stun wears off Achilles is able to dodge again, but he loses his right arm in the process. Once again Ban is forced to dodge, but while he's dodging he's moving in closer. Ban decides to use his shield to block one of Buld's missile launches, and in the process he learns Sword Cyclone. Achilles tosses his shield aside and picks up the sword. He uses sword cyclone and advances to the semifinals with the win, thanks to his second round opponents eliminating each other at the same time. Afterwards Kazu, Ami, and Jin all advance with victories. The quarterfinals begin and Kazu and Daiki advance, setting up a Daiki vs. Ban semifinal match.

At first Daiki seems like he dodges every attack with ease. He quickly reveals that while Achilles has more strength with Hakai-O's arm, he has also left himself highly vulnerable because he is off balance. Ban tries to correct this by turning the lance into a battering club, but Daiki continues to have Joker dodge and cast his mirage again. With 3 Joker's on the field Ban begins to take hit after hit and seems to be losing with ease. Ban tries to create a smokescreen to see which Joker is real, but they still manage to come at him from two sides. Achilles gets knocked down to 25% power and once again enters V-Mode. With V-Mode active Achilles once again gains strength and begins to bludgeon the Joker's with ease. One of the hits reveals that there is not 1 Joker on the field. Instead there are three. However Ban cannot control V-Mode, Daiki realizes that V-Mode runs on a computer controlled AI attack pattern and begins to dodge the attacks and get hits on Achilles. Just then Ban receives a message from the stands. A man has appeared in the stands with the white LBX that saved them at Angel Star. The LBX's name is Pandora. It sends Ban a code, and Ban gains control of V-Mode. Takuya also sees the man and runs towards him, seemingly recognizing him from some other place. Despite Ban having gained control of V-Mode, his power has drifted to less than 10%. Joker only needs one hit to finish Achilles off. While still in V-Mode Ban remembers The Emperors beheading of 3 LBX's at one point in the arena and realizes he can use the same strategy. Achilles runs to a cliff wall that's a dead end. Daiki thinks it's so his LBX's will face Achilles one-on-one and sends them into the air so they can attack at one. Realizing his plan has worked Ban runs underneath the Joker's and releases a Lightning Lance when they are lined up as one. The Lightning Lance destroys all 3 Joker's and sends Ban to the finals, right as V-Mode wears off. After the match Ban asks Daiki is he was the spy, and Daiki says he works only for himself. Takuya arrives where the man was in the stands, but the man has disappeared. Takuya says he would not let this mystery man get in his way and ruin his plans. As Daiki leaves Gouda tells Ban good job but says he cannot fight in the finals that way. He supplies Ban with the right arm of Achilles, fully repaired. Up next Kazu faces Emperor and Jin in the second semi-final. Kazu realizes The Emperor has more speed and strength than him, so he gets distance and tries to take out The Emperor with long-range shots. The Emperor dodges the attacks and forces Kazu to use Hunter's Stinger Missile attack. The attack merely causes a smokescreen for The Emperor, and The Emperor gets one quick ax strike to the neck of Hunter finishing off Hunter. The final has been set.

Jin promises to tell Ban the coordinates of where his father is at if he can beat him. Ban does not waste anytime time. He attacks head on, but The Emperor dodges most of his attacks. Ban decides to use Lightning Lance to force The Emperor to attack. Once The Emperor jumps into the air Ban activates Achilles V-Mode and does some serious damage, or so he thinks. In reality The Emperor suffers about 20% damage, and Jin decides to reveal his true strength. The Emperors eyes go from black to white to a blood red. His speed increases, and no one can keep up with Jin's hand control movements.

Lex uses his GRex's finishing function on The Emperor G2 to cause some serious damage, but the Emperor M2 quickly rebounds and slices Gouda's Hakai-O in half to eliminate him. G-Rex has a shot at a quick attack to finish The Emperor M2, but for some unknown reason Lex hesitates and Jin gets the win. After the match Lex goes outside and tells someone on a phone call that everything is going according to their plan. Over at Tiny Corp Takuya decides to return and confront his brother Yuuya. He reveals that Yuuya is the man that was in the stands at Angrivisdas with Pandora. He asks Yuuya to help him restore the seekers so they can get revenge for their father. Apparently Yoshimitsu is responsible for the series of events that led to his death, but what those events are is untold. Yuuya refuses saying they cannot use Tiny Corp's resources to hel them get revenge, but that does not mean there are not other ways they can do so. Back at Artemis Jin easily wins the Block A final to move to the Battle Royal. Block B begins where we are introduced to Masked J and his LBX Masquerade J, who have entered solo. In the first match of B Block Masquerade J displays amazing agility and stabs his opponents LBX's in the neck to allow him to advance to the quarterfinals of Block B. Ban is amazed by Masquerade J's moves, but he thinks Masked J looks familiar.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 20\n| Title               = The Troublesome Tournament\n| TranslitTitle       = Haran no T\u014dnamento\n| NativeTitle         = \u6ce2\u4e71\u306e\u30c8\u30fc\u30ca\u30e1\u30f3\u30c8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|7|13}}<ref name=\"WN-July\">{{cite web|url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/37 |script-title=ja:\u30c0\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u6226\u6a5f |publisher=Web Newtype |language=Japanese |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/603gZ6uiK?url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/37 |archivedate=July 9, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = The B Block Finals begin as Masked J battles one Shou Kanzaki and his Gladiator who have finished off all their opponents in less than a minute. At first Shou and Gladiator make hit after hit on Masquerade and appear to have an overwhelming advantage. It has all been a trick though. Masked J was merely getting the timing of Gladiator's attacks. He begins to dodge attack after attack and when Gladiator gets cornered he finishes him with Storm Sword. After the match Masked J tells Shou he needs to start focusing on his defense and stop acting so immature. The C-block contestants include Ban, Kazu, and Ami. They are called to head for the waiting rooms. In the waiting room they meet John & Paul, the North American champions. Ban tries to wish them good luck in the upcoming match, but John & Paul refuse to acknowledge him, making Ami upset. John & Paul decide they want to finish the match before it begins, but Asia Area Champion Morigami Keita and his Warrior break it up and tell them to settle it in their opening match. Ban thanks Keita and they become quick friends. Keita and his teammates Nakabayashi Reina (w/ Amazonese) and Kunoshita Kouji (w/ Buld) let Ban and his teammates see the specs on all their LBX's, as long as they get to do the same for Achilles, Hunter, and Kunoichi. Shortly after the first matches are called. Ami wants to fight the North American champions because of their feud in the back, but she feels Achilles & Hunter provide the best chance for them to move on. John & Paul launch their Orteha & Titan into the ring, and we see the match that opens the series. Of course Ban and his team prevail, and we see quick snipets of their quarter and semi matches. In the C-Block final Ban and his friends face off with Keita and his crew. They open up with a series on head-to-head matches that make the teams appear even. However Hunter gets tricked into a trap, and Achilles and Kunoichi get damaged when they move in and save Hunter.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 21\n| Title               = Explosive: The Super Plasma Burst\n| TranslitTitle       = Sakuretsu Ch\u014d Purazuma B\u0101suto\n| NativeTitle         = \u70b8\u88c2 \u8d85\u30d7\u30e9\u30ba\u30de\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|7|20}}<ref name=\"WN-July\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = With Achilles and Kunoichi damaged, Keita and Reina move in to try and finish them. Hunter uses his stinger missile though and causes a smokescreen, allowing them to escape. Ami comes up with a plan, and the group heads towards the middle of the Industrial Zone. Keita group follows at a slower pace, and eventually they get flanked by Hunter and Kunoichi. Keita thinks it is a move solely to keep him from attacking Achilles and heads to a corner where he sees Achillies shield. It ends up being a laid trap. The shield is all that's there, and Hunter has moved into sniping position. Hunter targets Warrior, but Buld jumps in the way and is eliminated. Next Hunter provides supporting fire aimed at Warrior that allows Ban to move in. Amazonese decides to target Hunter, which allows Kunoishi to come out and target Warrior 2-on-1. Amazonese has a major speed advantage over Hunter, but Hunter is able to perform the same type of kick that Ban used to send John's Ortega flying in the previous episode. With Amazonese stuck in the air Hunter is able to use his pin point targeting and eliminate her. Hunter then moves down to join Achilles and Kunoichi in a 3-on-1 assault. Keita realizes if the attack hits he'll be finished, and he launches his finishing move Trident. It hits all of Team Ban's members, and while Achilles shield absorbs the damage Kunoichi and Hunter take the attack head-on and are eliminated. The battle becomes 1-on-1, and Warrior has a major speed advantage thanks to Achilles damaged leg. Ban switches over to his energy gauge, and after he has absorbed enough attacks and thrust enough spears at Warrior he is able to release his new finisher Super Plasma Burst to gain the victory. Keita's team congratulates Ban on his efforts and moving on to the finals in a real sign of sportsmanship. Ban and his friends then go to get their LBX's repaired while D Block begins. Daiki advances throughout D Block to the finals with ease. On the other side a solo entry known as Yujin advances to the finals. Yujin is known to be one of Otacross's disciples, but he insists on fighting the LBX battles as OtaRed, a defender of justice, Daiki scoffs at him and thinks his Joker Mk 2 will get an easy victory to advance to the Battle Royale just before the final battle begins.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 22\n| Title               = The Mysterious Player: Yuuya Haibara\n| TranslitTitle       = Nazo no Pureiy\u0101 Haibara Yuuya\n| NativeTitle         = \u8b0e\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\u7070\u539f\u30e6\u30a6\u30e4\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|7|27}}<ref name=\"WN-July\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = Daiki battles Yujin in the Block D Finals.

The mysterious player Yuuya Haibara does not appear to have a lot of skills, but he keeps getting victories and advances to the Block F finals. Jin and Ban both realize Yuuya looks like he is going through a series of tests instead of fighting seriously, and when Yuuya advances to the Block F finals it becomes quite obvious his victories, which have been less than impressive, were all merely a series of tests. What's even more disturbing is the lack of communication from Yuuya. As Yuuya advances from Block F, a 30-minute intermission is held so the five finalists can all get their LBX's in tip-top shape for the upcoming battle royale.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 23\n| Title               = The Face Off: Battle Royal\n| TranslitTitle       = Kessen Batoru Rowaiyaru\n| NativeTitle         = \u6c7a\u6226 \u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30ed\u30ef\u30a4\u30e4\u30eb\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|8|3}}<ref name=\"WN-July\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = The finals begin with an all-out battle royal.

The five finalist continue to go blow-by-blow until Yujin and Yuuya are seen attacking The Emperor Mk 2 and Masquerade J is seen attacking Achilles. While Masquerade J is attacking Achilles a file is transferred over to Achilles with a note, you'll need this in the future. Shortly before the file is completed the Innovators activate a special mode of Yuuya's control suit. The special mode ends up taking over Yuuya's brain and sends him on a rampage. He destroys Masquerade J and Bibinbird X, eliminating Masked J and Yujin from the competition. When his two teammates decide to run from the scene Jin realizes the only way to save Yuuya is by doing his LBX. Ban and Jin set aside their differences and team up together. Emperor Mk 2 causes a smokescreen while Achilles performs his Lightning Lance finisher, eliminating Judge and freeing Yuuya from the suits control. Yuuya collapses, so the competition is halted while he receives medical attention. Ban questions Jin on what the relation is between Yuuya and Jin, but Jin refuses to answer and announces it is time for their final battle to commence.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 24\n| Title               = The Shocking Last Battle\n| TranslitTitle       = Sh\u014dgeki no Rasuto Batoru\n| NativeTitle         = \u885d\u6483\u306e\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|8|10}}<ref name=\"WN-August\">{{cite web|url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/43 |script-title=ja:\u30c0\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u6226\u6a5f |publisher=Web Newtype |language=Japanese |accessdate=August 10, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60plazfUY?url=http://anime.webnt.jp/programs/view/43 |archivedate=August 10, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| ShortSummary        = The finals of Artemis are held as Emperor Mk 2 and Achilles match each other blow for blow.

Achilles though is able to perform some acrobatics that Emperor is unable to match, and eventually Achilles gets behind Emperor and stabs him through the chest to finish him off. Achilles and Ban are declared the winners of Artemis. However The Emperor Mk 2 rises again. Jin loses all control of his machine, and Emperor Mk 2 grabs onto Achilles before self destructing. Achilles is destroyed. After everyone sees Achilles destroyed the power to the building is cut.

Yagami learns that it was the Innovators red team that shut down the power at Artemis and killed the guards watching Metanus GX in the process.

Meanwhile Jin has taken over watching Yuuya and he begins to question his grandfather's involvement in the entire ordeal as Yuuya lies in a coma. We learn that Jin and Yuuya were both the lone survivors in their families in the tragic Tokio Bridge collapse that also took Yagami's family. Shortly after the bridge collapse Jin was adopted by Yoshimitsu and become a Kaido. When his grandfather refuses to answer why he programmed The Emperor Mk 2 to self-destruct and why he killed the guards Jin decides to rebel.

When the group arrives at Tiny Orbit they learn that Tiny Orbit is developing a new Sparkbload system that will increase the usage of LBX's to 50 km and allow them to be used in space and on other planets. Ami realizes that Pandora had to be operated with this technology, and when she sees the railcar speeds through Tiny Orbit's station lasting 5 seconds she realizes it has to be someone there.

The group is not able to decipher the Platinum Capsule, but they find blueprints for a new LBX had been downloaded into the Platinum Capsule roughly 72 hours before, during Artemis.

Elsewhere on the base Yagami is given a file that contains all the data on the Tokio Bridge incident, but when the red team begins to hunt him he is forced to alter his escape route. Also in the base is Jin, who has pulled data showing that Yuuya was used as a science experiment by Yoshimitsu. Jin decides to leave Yoshimitsu's care for good and join Ban and his friends fighting the Innovators. Eventually the man who gave Yagami the data leads him into a trap room and traps him, but Jin frees him allowing him to escape. Back at Yoshimitsu's office Rina holds a gun to Yoshimitsu and demands he allows Optima to go forward in the medical field. Yoshimitsu grabs the gun and gets into a wrestling contest, accidentally forcing the gun to go off and shoot him in the process. As Rina flees the scene Yoshimitsu is seen rising from the gunshot, but he is no longer human. Instead he is some sort of robot who has taken over Yoshimitsu's spot. Yagami finds Rina crying in the halls and drags her along so they can escape. The group flees to the spy jet Eclipse and manage to escape within it.

Seeing no other choice, Ban asks if using Odin and the Sparkbload together might work to stop the wreck. Odin launches and infiltrates the train with roughly 20 km until impact. When he arrives in car 1 he sees that the LBX General Commander is controlling the train. Odin and General Commander fight, but Ban has a hard time using Odin's control functions because he is so much more advanced than Achilles. Seeing no other choice Ban runs headlong at General Commander and stuns him, allowing Odin to use his Gungnir finisher. General Commander is defeated, and Odin activates the brakes, However the brakes fail to engage. Yuusuke contacts the linear command and learns of a second way to stop the train. Ban destroys the trains control panel, causing the train to crash into the tracks and friction to slow it down. The actions appear to have taken place two late though as the train still has too much speed and will crash into Tiny Orbit.

Jason Kurosawa insists on coming over and shaking each team members hand from his opposition. Meanwhile Gouda and Daiki argue which of them will battle in the first round. The wait is not long as the Hacker Corps stuns everyone with a quick knockout. Ban intervenes and decides to battle Saki since they are friends. Saki sends out her Kunoichi to battle Ban's Odin. Saki features a style that basically runs headlong into anything and does not evaluate her surroundings. Ban uses this to his advantage to get the win and advance to face the Hacker Corps in the semifinals.

Ban studies the terrain and sees a cliff he believes could finish off Fenrir if they can distract him. Odin and Hakai-O Z move to separate parts of the arena, and when Fenrir jumps up to the cliff Hakai-O Z launches his Super Gaou Cannon and buries Fenrir. With Fenrir supposedly finished Odin takes on Pandora while Hakai-O Z and Nightmare both move in on Proto Zenon.

The field is an ice field, so it takes some time for Hakai-O Z and Nightmare to adjust to it. Eventually Hakai-O Z and Nightmare throw their opponent's Claymid's into each other and severely damage them with their finishers. Maa decides to intervene and uses his finisher, God Speed Sword, to eliminate his teammates LBX's while damaging all of Team Ban's LBX's. Before God Speed Sword hits Ban has Odin run in and try to deflect the rays associated with the attack, but it costs Odin his left arm.

They are able to gather 99% of the data, but the remaining 1% of the data is stuck in a net storm. If the data touches the storm at all it will be deleted. Seeing no other choice Yamaneko uses Otacross's virtual scanner to scan his LBX. He then creates a mini storm around his LBX, causing his LBX to be absorbed by the larger storm. Once Red Ribbon is inside he grabs the data and uses his blasters to create a hole in the storm. With the hole created he is able to throw out the data, and Ban and his friends are able to gain the decipher key for the Platinum Capsule.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 36\n| Title               = Humanity's Hope, Eternal Cycler\n| TranslitTitle       = Jinrui no Kibou, Eternal Cycler\n| NativeTitle         = \u4eba\u985e\u306e\u5e0c\u671b\u30a8\u30bf\u30fc\u30ca\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30af\u30e9\u30fc\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2011|11|9}}<ref name=\"WN-March\"/>\n| ShortSummary        = As Ban and his friends begin to return to Tiny Orbit they get surrounded by Innovators who want to steal the Eternal Cycler data.

As the group arrives at Tiny Orbit Yuusuke decides to trust Yagami and his allies. Yuusuke then demands they begin creating a rough draft on the Eternal Cycler because the prime minister has approved Yoshimitsu's Earth Crust Generation project. The Earth Crust Generation Project calls for energy to be harvested from underground volcanoes, but it would make Earth's crust unstable and lead to lots of destruction. Over at Cyber Lance Jin returns Proto Zenon with the data he collected from Akihabara Kingdom. The data will allow them to evolve Proto Zenon into Zenon's final form. Elsewhere Daiki is battlign at the arcades trying to get some sense of fun back into his life, but he feels there is something missing.

At the same time Ban and his friends head towards the Seekers base and run into Rina, who has been rehired by Tiny Orbit for her Sparkbload knowledge. Sawamura goes into Tiny Orbit's main security room and shuts off their alarm system. Outside Kirishima is hired to steal the eternal cycler when it is completed.

Roughly 1 hour is needed to finish the eternal cycler. As the LBX's begin to attack Gouda uses his finishing move, Super Gaou Cannon to take out nearly 1,000 LBX's. The Hacker Corps follow suit as Red Ribbon uses his Napalm Bomb, Gladiator uses his laser cutter, and Claymisha uses his trident. When the LBX's get past the first line Ami realizes the ones getting through are All Inbit's that run on AI's. With this new knowledge they are able to narrow down the attack patterns and use their finishers to take out more LBX's. Odin uses Gugnir, Fenrir uses Hawk Eye Drive, and Ami uses Chaotic Fist. When the LBX's are narrowed down to roughly 2,000 the Innovators send in their fort tank Bardoma as a last resort. Jin arrives with the newly completed Zenon, and the groups are reassigned.

LBX battles can now been seen all across the city, and Ban has been invited to Tiny Orbit's new product revealing ceremony at Tokio SIA. In a nearby arcade, Hiro Ozora competes in the electronic LBX game and gets 20 consecutive wins to win a rare Senshiman figure. A mysterious man bumps into him and picks up the Senshiman figure. When Hiro goes to check the figure he sees the LBX Perseus instead of Senshiman. Hiro has never used LBX's before and nearly hits Ban. Ban checks out Perseus because he has never seen him before. He then teaches Hiro how to use him before finishing the trip to Tokio SIA. At Tokio SIA Takuya reveals Tiny Orbit's newest product - a Black Achilles LBX known as Achilles Deed. After the presentation Achilles Deed gets hacked, and all unmanned LBX's across the city begin attacking. Ami, Ban, and Kazuya attempt to stop them, but Fenrir and Pandora get destroyed and gets knock out gas used on them. Hiro arrives at Tokio SIA and attempts to assist Ban. The mysterious man returns and gives Ban a D-Egg to battle Achilles Deed in so people can escape. Odin and Perseus are unable to match Achilles Deed's speed, and Odin misses hitting Achilles Deed with Gungnir. Achilles Deed retaliates using his finisher, Black Storm. He destroys Odin and escapes the D-Egg. After the battle, the mysterious man reveals that a new enemy has risen. Before he can tell Ban and Takuya any more information, a masked man comes on the electronic screen and claims a new group known as the Detectors must become the rulers of the Earth, and they will do so by any means necessary.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 02\n| Title               = Ban and Hiro W Assault\n| TranslitTitle       = Ban to Hiro W Shutsugeki\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d0\u30f3\u3068\u30d2\u30ed \uff37\u51fa\u6483\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|1|25}}\n| ShortSummary        = The mysterious man introduces himself as Cobra. He was sent by Professor Yamano to give Hiro and Ban their new LBX's and to stop the threat of the Detectors should it arise. He reveals that the Detectors are kidnapping the strongest LBX players for unknown reasons. Cobra gives Ban a new LBX, Elysion, with which to fight. Ban assembles Elysion and Cobra traces down that the hacked computer being controlled by the Detectors is the old Seeker base. Takuya provides Ban and Hiro knowledge on how to get to the base. On B8 the two get ambushed by 5 Inbit's, but Ban and Hiro use good teamwork to stop them and defeat them with ease. The group makes it inside the Seeker base where they have to face multiple LBX's. The final set of LBX's in the battle feature two G-Rexes and Achilles Deed. If they can defeat them they can shut down the hijacked computer. Another mysterious youth shows up and uses a very customized Dequoo to destroy the two G-Rexes. Achilles Deed retreats and Elysion shuts down the computer. As Ban goes to thank him, the youth reveals he is not there to help. Instead he is there to defeat Ban, and he'll defeat all enemies in they way to make sure they cannot defeat Ban before he does. Over at the Senate Zaizen brings Yagami out of the shadows and asks him to investigate the Detectors. He senses the man's ambition is not world domination, but is hiding a much more ulterior motive, although he's not sure what it is.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 03\n| Title               = Chosen Warriors\n| TranslitTitle       = Erabareshi Senshi-tachi\n| NativeTitle         = \u9078\u3070\u308c\u3057\u6226\u58eb\u305f\u3061\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|2|1}}\n| ShortSummary        = Takuya and Cobra arrive at the base, but the mysterious youth has left. Takuya decides to restore the Seekers and contacts Rina to come and assemble the old base. Cobra reveals all he knows about the Detectors, which is not much more than what has been shared. He reveals that the LBX's are being controlled through a process called brainjacking. The brainjacking occurs through the M Chip which Omegadain requires all LBX's to have. However Professor Yamano has ignored that requirement and made it so Perseus and Elysion do not have the M Chip. He also reveals that a third LBX from Professor Yamano will be presented to the winner of the Shibuya Town Martial Arts tournament. The next day, Takuya contacts Yagami and asks him to investigate Omegadain. He also tells him he is bringing back the Seekers to fight. Meanwhile in Shibuya, Ran Hanasaki wins the martial arts tournament and is presented the LBX Minerva. After the tourney she goes to fight her friend outside when Detector LBX's arrive. Minerva and Warrior are able to handle most of them, but then Warrior gets brainjacked. Minerva is forced to take out Warrior and then gets surrounded by Achilles Deed, a black Kunoichi, and a black Hunter. Ban and Hiro arrive and help Ran take out the Kunoichi and Hunter, but Achilles Deed escapes. Ran is made a member of the team and is taken to the Seekers base. Over across the sea the president of A Nation asks her defense secretary and vice president to do research on the LBX crisis. The vice president chooses to go to Omegadain for advice while the defense secretary contacts Yagami and Zaizen. Back at the Seekers base the CCM's for Ami and Kazuya are detected. They appear to be on a plane headed to A Nation, but before precise coordinates can be located the signals are cut off.

The group boards Tiny Orbit's jet and heads for N City. Cobra reveals they are heading for NICS because NICS can trace all super computers. He also reveals that a super computer is required for the brainjacking to work. As they continue to head for N City in A Nation, the plane begins to descend early. Automatic LBX's have snuck on board and taken control of the plane at the wheel sector, in the toilet, and in the conference room. Ban, Ran, and Hiro each descend upon a location and use their finishers to defeat the Detectors Inbits. Elysion uses Holy Lance, Perseus uses Cosmo Slash, and Minerva uses Flame Avalanche.

The two appear to have evenly matched speed and skills. When Ban begins to get serious, Jessica pulls out Jeanne D and welcomes the group to N City. She reveals she is from NICS and has been sent to pick them up. Back in Japan, we learn that the Seekers are working on a vaccine program to stop the brainjacking of the super computers. The group arrives at NICS and Jessica introduces her father, defense secretary Owen Kaios. Cobra shares with NICS what they know, and the two groups agree to work together. At noon the LBX's in N City get brainjacked. The Detectors leader once again appears on screen and demands the President withdraw by 6 p.m. or he will continue to have LBX's go on a rampage. Ban, Hiro, Jessica, and Ran are given a program on their CCM's that will allow them to detect EM waves. Using the program they trace the hijacked computer to the subway doctor train. The Seekers finish the vaccine program. The four members install the vaccine program in their LBX's, and Jessica and Hiro head into the doctor train to stop the brainjacking. Once inside they run into Kousuke who has been turned into a slave player by the Detectors and has a control collar around his neck that brainwashes him. His sole mission is to stop the group from deactivating the train. With 1 minute left until 6 Hiro throws Shadow Lucifer into the air with Perseus's swords. Jeanne D finishes off Shadow Lucifer deactivating the control collar and making Kousuke fall unconscious. Jeanne D installs the vaccine program, and the LBX's fail to start back up at 6.

As the train is moved from the alternative route to the main route, a mysterious LBX begins to fill the subway with thick, sticky threads similar to a spiderweb. The threads catch on to the train and stop it roughly 1m before impact with one of the parked subway trains. As Jessica and Hiro get off they run to see what stopped the train. They find the mysterious LBX which returns to Jin. Ban and Ran arrive and Ban and Jin are reunited. Jin reveals his new LBX is Triton. Triton was customized for him and does not contain the M chip. He also reveals he was brought by another of Professor Yamano's assistants, Mongoose. Cobra and Mongoose go at it while NICS recovers Kousuke and takes him back to examine him. Over in Japan things are looking down for Tiny Orbit. The stocks are crashing and people are calling for Takuya's resignation. Before Takuya can do anything about it Tiny Orbit is bought out by Crystar Ingram, and Crystar Ingram places Kawamura Muneto, a former Innovator member in charge of the company. Takuya is kicked out of Tiny Orbit, but as he leaves his secretary tells him to let her handle the rest inside Tiny Orbit. Back in A Nation NICS makes Jin a member of the team. Ban and company are then taken to meet their resident hacker who is revealed to be none other than Otacross. Otacross reveals he has learned that the computers being brainjacked continue to maintain their functions, but they do not operate at 100%. Otacross then scans the many super computers and learns of a computer in Shang-Pao, China which is about to be brainjacked. NICS loads the team up onto their transport vehicle, the Duck Shuttle, and they take off for China. Meanwhile Takuya meets with Yagami and reveals that Crystar Ingram and Omegadain have some sort of relation. Yagami then asks Takuya to go on some sort of mission in his place.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 07\n| Title               = Reunion of Dragon Tower\n| TranslitTitle       = Doragon Taw\u0101 no Saikai\n| NativeTitle         = \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30bf\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u518d\u4f1a\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|2|29}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jessica shows everyone around the Duck Shuttle including places like the control room, the conference center/recreation room, the bedrooms, and the cockpit. When they arrive in Shang-Pao Otacross calls everyone to the control room. He introduces everyone to his creation, the Riding Saucer. The Riding Saucer was created to allows LBX's to have greater mobility in the air and in places like space. Because it is night Otacross has Ban fly Elysion around the city on a Riding Saucer. Ban does scans of the supercomputers on the way, and the group narrows it down to two super computers: Dragon Tower and Shang-Pao Harbor. The next morning the teams divide into two groups to search the locations. Ban, Ran, and Otacross go to Dragon Tower while Jin, Jessica, and Hiro go to Shang-Pao Harbor. Ban and Ran thinks Dragon Tower looks creepy, but Otacross reveals that it is actually an amusement park in disguise. The group goes inside and Ran is given a map of Dragon Tower by a giant panda bear person. Otacross decides they should check Dragon Tower by going up the emergency stairs. When the group makes it to the elevator, automated LBX's jump out and try to ambush them. Otacross eliminates them with ZX-1, and then a brainjacking signal is detected. The group raises up the tower with Otacross eliminating another set of LBX's with ZX-2 and Minerva eliminating the third, but Otacross breaks his back in the process. Ban decides to take Otacross back down but tells Ran to find the supercomputer and then wait for backup before engaging the enemy. Ran finds the supercomputer and learns that the giant panda bear person is actually a slave player. Ran ignores Ban's council and engages the slave player, who fights back with 2 Dark Kunoichi's and a Dark Pandora. Ban and Otacross detect the battle and head back up, but Minerva is defeated before they make it up. Otacross and Ban arrive and Otcross fuses his LBX's to form Perfect ZX-3. The panda bear takes off her mask and reveals herself to be Ami, who is now under Detector's control. Dark Pandora picks up Minerva and throws her over the edge of the building. Elysion boards the Riding Saucer and saves Minerva before the frame is destroyed. He returns to the roof and returns Minerva to Ran for repairs. Afterwards Elysion enters the battle box as Ban and Otacross prepare to battle Ami. Meanwhile the others arrive at Dragon Tower after learning the docks were a decoy, but as they try to head up they get ambushed by enemy LBX's, ensuring Ami would not have a fair number of combatants facing her.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 08\n| Title               = Ami Was an Enemy\n| TranslitTitle       = Teki ni Natta Ami\n| NativeTitle         = \u6575\u306b\u306a\u3063\u305f\u30a2\u30df\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|3|7}}\n| ShortSummary        = Ami battles Ban and Otacross in a winner takes all slugfest. Ami's speed seems to be too much for Ban and Oacross to handle. Otacross eventually gets frustrated and just has Perfect ZX-3 throw out an arm. It manages to make contact with the Pandora and temporarily stuns Ami. Ban follows suit by firing off his finisher Holy Lance forcing the Pandora and Kunoichi's into the air. Otacross uses his Thundercross while the LBX's are in the air to cause a breakover and free Ami from control. Ami collapses, and Ban decides to install the vaccine program. We learn the LBX's the others were fighting were brainjacked as they shut down when the vaccine program finishes installing. Ami comes to and admits she does not remember anything after Pandora was destroyed at Tokio SIA. Ami is told how the Detectors are handling the LBX fighters and decides to fight, but a severe headache hits her and keeps her from joining NICS at this time. The team takes Ami back to Japan where she is placed in Rina and the Seekers custody. Takuya joins the group and announces he'll be joining them from here on out, but he also brings with him a surprise. Yuuya Haibara joins the team. The group returns to N City where Takuya and Yuuya are officially made NICS members. NICS decides to investigate Crystar Ingram and Omegadain behind the scenes, but first they decide to analyze the new data they received from the China incident.

The scene shifts to Omegadain's test room where we see the youth that said he would destroy Ban in the first episode. His name is Kazama Kirito, and he's Omegadain's test player. Kirito destroys 10 LBX's with his customized Dequoo in less than a minute. While a video explaining Omegadain's role in M-chips is playing Ban, Jin, and Yuuya are sent to try to make it to Omegadain's controlroom through the air shafts. Kirito sees them and decides to make a challenge. Jin and Ban make it to the halls where their air vents are located, but Ban gets trapped in the bathroom and has to alter the infiltration route. Yuuya also makes it to his vent, but he is intercepted by Kirito and forced into battle. Yuuya debuts his Liu Bei LBX to battle against Kirito's customized Joker. While Yuuya battles Kirito Ban and Jin close in on the control room, but government officials show up and force them to vacate their hiding places. As the battle between Liu Bei and Joker hits a high mark, the government officials arrive where Yuuya and Kirito are battling. They force the battle to stop and the Vice President of A Nation announces that Omegadain is being blockaded by the government. All non-Omegadain personnel are forced to leave the premises, including Ban, Jin, and Yuuya.

Hiro, Ran, and Jessica are sent out to take out as many brainjacked LBX's as possible until the super computer can be found. The enemy LBX's overwhelm them, and Perseus ends up being saved by M. Goujou, Cryster Ingram's test player. After the battle the LBX's stop their revolt. Detector comes on and gives the Egyptian Presidency one hour to stop all foreign oil shipments. If they fail to do so, he will restart the LBX riot. Otacross finally tracks the brainjacked super computer to a local hotel that is also being used as a refugee site for the LBX attack. Jessica instantaneously memorises the map of the building, and she leads Hiro and Ran through the hotel to stop the computer. Meanwhile in N City Takuya, Ban, Jin, and Yuuya visit Omegadain's President. He basically confronts them and asks them why they keep suspecting him of being guilty of espionage when there are multiple reports showing M Chips to be safe. Takuya brings up the hidden room, so Alan takes them to it and shows them it is a manufacturing line for M chips. Back in Egypt, Hiro, Jessica, and Ran make it to the computer room corridor but they get cut off by two Anubius LBX's and a slave player.

Before they can leave though Hiro gets another vision showing him the hotel could explode. Hiro insists on Otacross looking it up and refuses to leave until this mystery can be solved. While waiting for more details a computer in the hotel overheats and explodes. It causes some minor damage to the hotel. Otacross reveals that the hotel's cooling system appears to be what was compromised during the brainjacking. While it cooled off the hotel enough to help the customers, it did not cool it off enough for the computer systems. Otacross finds a second computer getting ready to catch fire. If it does, it will ignite the oil tank next to it and cause the hotel to explode. The hotel is evacuated and Hiro and Goujou rush to stop the computer. They find Achilles Deed blocking their way so they send out Perseus and the mystery LBX, which is finally revealed to be called Shin Egypt. Shortly after the battle commences Ran and Jessica use the Duck Shuttle's control pods to send their LBX's to distract Achilles Deed. With Achilles Deed distracted Hiro and Goujou are able to turn off the super computer and prevent it from exploding. Back in N City, Takuya learns that the Egyptian riot has been stopped.

Yuuya boards the train and is followed close by Kirito. As the train takes off Yuuya reveals what he heard. 5 mysterious youths get out of their seats and head to the back of the train. Two decide to stand guard at the door while another 2 send in their Hakai-O's to cut the back train car off. As they do so the train begins to slow down.

Jin starts to battle him, but Takuya picks up a third LBX in the drivers room. Shortly after the train speeds up again. Takuya decides to investigate on his own and gets locked in the second car by the sixth man. He contacts the guys, and when Kirito learns the story about the rain robbers is true he lets them pass. Ban, Jin, and Yuuya are stopped at the last car by the guards. A third member of the gang comes out and backs them up by one car. Ban, Jin, and Yuuya are forced to battle their opponents Hakai-O's.

Elysion and Triton go to cover for him, and Jin has Triton use a baseball-like swing to send one of the charges back towards the Hakai-O's. It stuns the Hakai-O's while Liu Bei recovers. Ban and company then destroy their LBX's, and Jin ties up the thieves with Triton. With 3 opponents down Yuuya is sent to free Takuya while Ban and Jin move on. The other two Wild Badge members send out their Hakai-O's to stop them, and they are joined by the sixth man who is revealed to be the leader of the group. His name is Bartz.

Seeing no other choice Ban, Jin, and Yuuya decide to use their automatic entries from being finalists the year before to enter Artemis. Jessica proposes they form two teams of three since each team can hold up to three members. The others agree, but Hiro hesitates saying he does not have the experience needed to compete at Artemis. Otacross proposes Hiro, Ran, and Jessica be given special training by participating in Angra Texas, A Nation's most dangerous and no rules LBX tournament. Jessica protests the decision, but her father overrules her and makes it official. Otacross then assigns Ban, Jin, and Yuuya as trainers for Hiro, Ran, and Jessica. Ban is teamed up with Hiro, Jin with Jessica, and Yuuya with Ran. Jessica and Ran refuse to listen to any advice Jin and Yuuya give them during training, but Hiro absorbs it all.

Shortly afterwards Jessica and Billy get their tenth wins to advance to the finals, and Hiro picks up his ninth win. Angra Texas announces a head-to-had match between Hiro and Ran will determine who gets the final spot. They are given half an hour to prepare for the fight. During this time Ran and Yuuya get into a fight, making Yuuya feel like a lousy coach. Jessica tells him not to worry that Ban will have learned from him, but she says it takes girls using their own unique skills to be able to apply all the principles. Outside Jin comes across Ran and is surprised by what he sees. The half hour draws to a conclusion, and the fight between Ran and Hiro begins. Jin comes in as coach for Ran for this one fight instead of Yuuya. Despite her earlier struggles Ran appears to have mastered the sword and shield Liu Bei uses and she is able to hold off most of Perseus's attacks. The two appear fairly even, but Ran slowly drives Hiro into a corner. Little does she know Hiro is studying her looking for a way to throw Minerva off balance. During a thrust Hiro leaps into the air instead of to the side causing Minerva to lose balance. Perseus jabs Minerva from behind causing a break over and moving Hiro onto the 3-way final.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 15\n| Title               = Three-way Duel\n| TranslitTitle       = Kett\u014d Toraianguru\n| NativeTitle         = \u6c7a\u95d8 \u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30b0\u30eb\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|5|2}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jessica, Hiro, and Billy Stallion prepare to battle for the Angra Texas title.

The stadium is revealed, and all non-combatants are asked to leave, including the coaches. As the final match starts Billy decides to first target Perseus. He causes Perseus to run into a mine field, thereby trapping him and making it where he will fight Jessica one-on-one. Jessica mistakenly thinks that Billy has feelings for her, but when Billy admits the only thing he has feelings for is LBX's and that the matches he had been checking out were Hiro's she gets mad. Jessica is able to use this fury to increase her speed, and she uses the terrain as a shield. Billy decides to narrow things down and uses his quick draw to eliminate most of the mountains Jessica has been using as a shield. He then shoots her shield out of her hand, leading to a one-on-one quick draw competition. Hiro decides to use his Cosmo Slash finisher to eliminate the rest of the land mines, and as the smokescreen reaches Jessica and Billy shots are fired. Bill walks out the winner and turns his eyes towards Hiro. Billy's speed proves to be too much for Hiro at first, but Hiro remembers what it was like fighting with a lance. He decides to turn Perseus's entire body into a lance. He manages to knock away Billy's guns, and after him and Billy regain their weapons of choice they face down each other. Hiro gains new speed and manages to make it a close fight that Billy cannot keep up with. Billy is defeated, and Hiro becomes the Anga Texas champion.

Hiro and Yuuya head to Geek Street where Hiro hopes to collect rare Senshiman action figures. Yuuya tags along hoping to learn about some of the shows he has never seen, having had no real childhood. They get what Hiro wanted to get, but some of the geeks present recognize them and ask them to battle. As neither of them had brought their LBX's they get a couple of loaners to do battle. Meanwhile, Jin talks with Ban and helps him realize he cannot control all the attacking and force someone else to adjust their pace. Back at the geek shop all 5 people that recognized Yuuya and Hiro participate in a 5-on-2 battle. Without having Perseus, Hiro begins to realize what true teamwork is. Yuuya leads 4 of the guys in a distraction maneuver while Hiro takes out the lone shark. 4-on-2 seems a little more reasonable as Hiro and Yuuya each are able to dispose of 2 of their opponents. As everyone returns to NICS both Ban and Hiro ask for one more battle to end the day. It's a 3-on-1 battle of Jeanne D, Triton, and Liu Bei against Sigma Orbis.

Otacross is unable to locate the control computer, so Ban, Hiro, and Ran launch Elysion, Perseus, and Minerva on Riding Saucers to find the best ways to attack the LBX's in the city. Along the way, Hiro nearly crashes into an automatic blimp flying around the city. Detector finally comes on and informss the world that Campbellen is but the first city in his plan for world domination. From Campbellen he will take control of the whole Australian nation and then eventually the whole world. Otacross is finally able to lock onto the control computers EM waves, but he learns there are four readings. They are coming from the four automated blimps floating around the city. The team thinks they can handle 3 of them, but they are unsure what to do with the fourth. Reinforcements arrive as President Zaizen sends Yagami and his team in the Eclipse to assist in the battle. Along with them is Ami and her new Pandora. Otacross hacks into the 4 blimps computers and forces them to land. The groups then leave the Duck Shuttle and the Eclipse in teams of two to do battle. Ban and Hiro enter the first blimp where they find Gouda is now a slace player. Jin and Yuuya enter blimp two where they find Daiki. Ran and Jessica team up in blimp three where Otasilver is the slave player. Finally, Ami and Yagami infiltrate blimp four and run into Yamaneko. The teams get trapped in D-Eggs and are forced to battle the slave players who use familiar, yet different LBX's - Hakai-O Dogma, Nightmare Fear, Bibinbird Chaos, and Bloody Ribbon.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 29\n| Title               = The Truth Detector\n| TranslitTitle       = Ditekut\u0101 Sono Shinjitsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u30c7\u30a3\u30c6\u30af\u30bf\u30fc \u305d\u306e\u771f\u5b9f\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|8|1}}\n| ShortSummary        = The battles between the Slave Players and the agents of NICS intensify, but in the end Ban and his friends walk out with the victories thanks to the finishers Holy Lance, Ocean Blast, Homura Kuzushi, and Souken Rangaki. The Eclipse picks up Gouda while the Duck Shuttle picks up Daiki, Otasilver, and Yamaneko, much to the relief of Otacross. Hiro notices that all four blimps are from the Ocean Museum locally and thinks that it might have something to do with Detector. The group goes to investigate and finds that Asuka has been turned into a slave player. Ban and Hiro fight Asuka and Vampire Cat but try to remain cautious because of her strength. Detector watches the battle carefully and decides to send someone in. The person ends up being Kazuya, who is teamed with Achilles Deed. Asuka sees the collar and assumes that Kazuya is on her side, but Black Achilles uses Black Storm in Demonic Mode to break over Vampire Cat. Kazuya takes off the collar and reveals he is not a slave player, much to Ban's relief, but he reveals that he has been working with Detector because they have found a greater threat. Afterwards Detector reveals himself to be none other than Professor Yamano. Professor Yamano reveals that the Ocean Museum has been secretly manufacturing missiles for a super weapon. Ocean Museum is owned by none other than Omegadain, who also owns the super weapon. The super weapon they have created is the Paradise Satellite. The group hesitates believing Professor Yamano until they see the weapons themselves. Ban confront his father on turning the LBX's evil and destroying many people's dreams, but a temporary truce is called for when they learn Omegadain is about to make another move. Professor Yamano is also confronted by Asuka as she questions why he turned her into a slave player. Professor Yamano reveals that while he did make the others into slave players, Asuka was made a slave player by Omegadain as they tried to protect their weapon.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 30\n| Title               = The Father and Son of LBX\n| TranslitTitle       = Chantoko no LBX\n| NativeTitle         = \u7236\u3068\u5b50\u306eLBX\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|8|15}}\n| ShortSummary        = The team is able to shut down the missiles and Ocean Museum is turned over to the Australian government.

Secretary Kaios informs Professor Yamano that he will be tried for his terrorist acts, but not until the possibility of war ends. First they must stop Omegadain's plans. Professor Yamano instructs NICS to search the control computers he hacked for information on Paradise being a secret military base. The group finds no definitive evidence that Paradise is a military base. However the Seekers base reveals a shocking truth. By further delving into the records, they find Paradise has occasionally let off mysterious energy aimed right at nations that have opposed A-Nation's power plants. The group realizes that Paradise must have a laser firing system that is doing the destroying. Professor Yamano instructs NICS to search for the tanker Future Hope, believing it operates Paradise. The tanker is found, but a large radar device keeps the team from getting close. With no other choice 8 of the kids use Riding Saucers while Kazuya just uses Achilles Deed's flight system. The group is launched out of the Duck Shuttle.

Ami makes the save. The boys and Jessica finish off the air LBX's and then join the other three in defeating the ground LBX's. Duck Shuttle lands on Future Hope, and the groups decide to divide into two teams. Professor Yamano will lead Ban, Kazuya, and all the girls except Jessica to what they believe is the control room while Cobra will lead Hiro, Jin, Yuuya, and Jessica to a second room that has high computer readings coming from it. At the center of the ship, the teams get ambushed in a missile room. Asuka, Jessica, and Ran stay behind to take out the new enemy LBX's while Ban, Kazuya, and Ami head up with his father toward the control room. Cobra leads Hiro, Jin, and Yuuya to the second room where they find Hiro's mom, Professor Haruka Ozora programming a new supercomputer called Adam and Eve. Hiro criticizes his mom for getting too caught up in her work and ignoring all the terrorist activities Omegadain has done. She informs them the only way to shut down Future Hope is in the control room. Doctor Mummy watches the groups' progress from the control room and tells everyone to evacuate the ship after putting it in lockdown. Professor Ozora has Adam and Eve access Omegadain's hidden files and reads what activities they have truly been performing. She decides to leave Omegadain after shutting down Adam and Eve, but first she will help the group destroy Future Hope. Professor Yamano, Ban, Ami, and Kazuya make it to the control room where Doctor Mummy greets them. Ban recognizes that Doctor Mummy is covered in bandages and has the same hair color that Lex did.

Doctor Mummy sends out a Killer Droid to take care of Elysion, Achilles Deed, and Pandora. The group gets trapped in the battlefield and decides to use their speed and agility to aggravate Killer Droid until Hiro and Ran can arrive and form Sigma Orbis. Hiro, Jin, and Yuuya advance toward the control room but get surrounded by LBX's. When their LBX's get cornered, Vampire Bat ambushes some of the LBX's from behind. Shortly thereafter, Jeanne D and Minerva do likewise. The six LBX's combined overwhelm Omegadain's LBX fleet, allowing them to once again advance towards the control room. Over at Omegadain, Kirito finds evidence on their computer that supports the idea that Lex is Doctor Mummy. He also finds that Omegadain is tied to someone in the presidency. He decides to take this knowledge to Alan Worthen so he can complete the Cyclops AI he's working on. Back on Future Hope, Kazuya accidentally shoots the wires on Killer Droid's feet, causing him to slow down. Ami uses this opportunity to shoot Killer Droid in the chest and weaken the shield surrounding them. Killer Droid raises up in a frenzy and reboots. Elsewhere on the ship, Doctor Ozora powers down Adam and Eve and apologizes for them having to suffer from Omegadain's plan because of their innocence. Hiro and the others arrive, and Killer Droid senses their LBX's so it expands the shield to encompass the newcomers. Ban, Hiro, and Ran try to form Sigma Orbis, but Killer Droid would not let their LBX's get close to each other. The others decide to use a coordinated attack on Killer Droid's leg wires to slow it down enough to allow Sigma Orbis to form. At the President's office Jessica's father arrives and forces his way into the office. He reveals Omegadain's hidden weapon and reveals that someone in the Presidency is working with them. Back at Omegadain, Kirito makes it to Alan Worthen's office and finds it empty. As he prepares to leave, he sees blood on the floor. Kirito runs over to the blood and discovers Alan Worthen who is now dead. Back on Future Hope, Sigma Orbis transforms and destroys Killer Droid with one shot. Doctor Mummy flees, but before Professor Yamano can power down the computer, Doctor Ozora arrives and makes them let her do it. The ship is programmed to explode if any unauthorized users get on the computer. As she begins powering down the ship, she learns a shocking secret. Secretary Kaios is called and informed that Vice President Alfeld Gardyne is the spy in the presidency. Alfeld calls in support from Bishop, Omegadain's computer technician, and reveals he is actually an assassin who has killed Alan Worthen. His goal now is to give the Presidency to Alfeld, which means Secretary Kaios and the President have just become new collateral damage in his plan.

After entering the base the President and Secretary Kaios are introduced to Doctor Mummy, whom Alfeld refers to as Lex. Over on Future Hope, Doctor Ozora finishes powering down the base when Hiro receives one of his visions of the future. Hiro foresees a scenario where the President and Secretary Kaios perish in an explosion at the National Defense Base. Jessica recognizes the description of the building Hiro describes and gets him to confirm it is the National Defense Base. The team boards the Duck Shuttle and departs for the National Defense Base. Along the way, Cobra is able to hack into the base's cameras, with the help of Professor Yamano, and they confirm the President and Secretary Kaios are being held there. Back at the National Defense Base, Alfeld questions the President on the code to access the satellite controls. The President refuses to give him the codes, and he says they will be doing this in a while. As the Duck Shuttle flies toward the National Defense Base, Professor Yamano is asked some questions by Doctor Ozora and the kids. One of the questions he gets asked is how he was able to be Detector when the kids were in England standing next to him. Kazuya admits that it was a pre-recorded segment and that he was helping Professor Yamano by that time. As they get closer Takuya expresses a concern anbout getting the Duck Shuttle close enough with being detected. Otacross finds a path in the canyon that will keep the Duck Shuttle off the National Defense Base's radar, and Metamo R flies them through that route. Unluckily for the group LBX's have been dispatched around the National Defense Base in case something like this happens.

Team 1 is Jessica, Asuka, Yuuya, and Takuya. Team 2 id Ban, Hiro, Ran, and Professor Yamano. Team 3 consists of Jin, Ami, Kazuya, and Cobra. While the groups make their way up three canyons to sneak into the base, Otacross and Professor Ozora find the best infiltration route for the base using a video game simulation. Words reaches the Defense Base that one platoon of their LBX's has been eliminated, so they send an army of LBX's down the canyon to try and slow everyone down. Jessica, Asuka, Yuuya, Jin, Ami, and Kazuya are all spotted by the defense LBX's and are forced to fight. Ban, Hiro, Ran, and Professor Yamano spot the defense LBX's before they are spotted and hide behind a rock where they would not be seen. The defense LBX's give up on them. Professor Yamano spots a side canyon trail that will take them to the same location without getting caught, so Ban and company go up that trail. Professor Ozora successfully finds a way through the case to the command center and sends the data to the teams. Ban sends Elysion in to knock out the fans, and then the team begins sneaking through the base. All is going well until Hiro trips in the vehicle assembly area and causes some noise. Groups come rushing to capture them, but the other two teams arrive and cause a distraction, allowing Ban and his team to make it to the command center's entryway. As they arrive at the entryway they are confronted by Lt. Jack Gelato, leader of the Fire Sweets LBX squad. He uses one of Professor Yamano's original creations, Proto I to engage the guys in a D-egg battle. Proto I has amazing speed and a special mechanism known as the High-Dimensional Multiple Joint System that lets it flip when it gets attacked from both sides.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 35\n| Title               = The Threatening LBX Proto I\n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u014di no LBX Puroto I\n| NativeTitle         = \u8105\u5a01\u306eLBX \u30d7\u30ed\u30c8\u30fbI\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|9|19}}\n| ShortSummary        = Proto I proves to be too strong for Ban, Hiro, and Ran to handle. However Professor Yamano notices Proto I still has a problem with overheating. Ban proposes the merge to form Sigma Orbis, but Professor Yamano tells him to wait until they have only around 10% power remaining. If they can cause Proto I to overheat, they have a chance of beating him with Sigma Orbis. Minerva gets severely damaged, but Ban and Hiro use Elysion and Perseus to distract Proto I until it's time to merge. With only 10% power remaining, the group merges into Sigma Orbis. With roughly only 5% power remaining Proto I finally overheats and Sigma Orbis is able to beat him. The group shows Jack Gelato proof of the President and Secretary Kaios having been brought in, and he decides to help the group. Jack tries to enter the passcode to access the command center, but it has been changed, and the President and Secretary Kaios are trapped inside. Alfeld, Doctor Mummy, and Bishop are seen boarding the space shuttle at the base as they were unable to gain the needed passcode, but they seem unfazed. Ban and company use Sigma Orbis's finisher to open the door, and Secretary Kaios and the President escape with only 5 seconds to spare before the command center explodes. The group races to the shuttle's control room and the shuttle's launch pad as two different teams to try and stop the launch. Professor Yamano is able to hack part of the ship's system and tries to dump the fuel, but instead the Command Center's computers all power down. The ship launches as Alfeld heads toward space. Secretary Kaios then announces they will return to NICS immediately and re-equip the Duck Shuttle so the kids can pursue them into space and stop Paradise permanently.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 36\n| Title               = Take Off into Space\n| TranslitTitle       = Uch\u016b e no Hasshin\n| NativeTitle         = \u5b87\u5b99\u3078\u306e\u767a\u9032\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|10|3}}\n| ShortSummary        = After dropping off Secretary Kaios and the President, the team heads to a secondary NICS facility to modify the Duck Shuttle for space travel. Meanwhile, in space, Alfeld, Doctor Mummy, and Bishop board Paradise and Doctor Mummy is tasked with starting up Paradise. Doctor Mummy succeeds, and Alfeld begins to laugh. While Duck Shuttle is being updated, Professor Yamano announces that Minerva will be getting upgrades to make her worthy of space travel. He also reveals that they have been given two Proto I's by Jack Gelato and that these LBX's will be customized for Ban and Hiro. Detector returns, though everyone suspects it is actually Alfeld. Detector orders the world to surrender and vows to show everyone the Detectors' real power. Alfeld uses the Paradise satellite to destroy an unmanned A-Nation Island. He then gives everyone a 6-hour deadline to surrender or he will destroy their nations one-by-one. Secretary Kaios and the President think about what they should do when the NICS main headquarter computer goes into lockdown and traps everyone in the facility. Alfeld comes on and announces the President has been kidnapped by Detector but that A Nation will continue to fight the terrorists. The people rally and support his words. Secretary Kaios learns that the direct communication with Duck Shuttle is still active and contacts the group. Doctor Ozora informs him that the lockdown probably means NICS will be the next target. She also reveals it takes 6 hours to recharge the satellite cannon. Duck Shuttle's renovations are completed and Professor Yamano begins construction on an upgraded Minerva. After the Duck Shuttle loads onto the launch pad many enemy LBX's begin attacking. The kids, minus Ran, launch on the Riding Saucers and start taking out many of the LBX's, but they are overwhelmed. When the launch pad gets attacked, Hiro and Ban decide to sacrifice their Riding Saucers to keep it safe. Triton and Liu Bei save Elysion and Perseus. The kids reboard the Duck Shuttle and launch only seconds before the launch pad is destroyed, but they make it into space safely.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 37\n| Title               = The Descent of Icarus\n| TranslitTitle       = Ikarosu no K\u014drin\n| NativeTitle         = \u30a4\u30ab\u30ed\u30b9\u306e\u964d\u81e8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|10|10}}\n| ShortSummary        = After making it into space, Doctor Ozora reveals that with Paradise's computer reactivated, they will face a dangerous laser defense system. Otacross comes up with the idea that they can create a dodging program and avoid the lasers successfully so they can infiltrate Paradise. Otacross and Doctor Ozora begin working on the new program. Meanwhile the kids are reminded that their LBX's must remain on the Flying Saucers and use various long range guns or they will lose their LBX's to space forever. The exception to this is Achilles Deed and the newly remodeled Minerva Kai, which is presented back to Ran. After giving Ran Minerva Kai, Professor Yamano returns to working on new LBX's for Ban and Hiro. Enemy LBX's begin to attack, and everyone launches except Ban and Hiro. The damage Elysion and Perseus suffered from the sacrifice of their Flying Saucers has penetrated their cores, making them unable to be used. Minerva Kai and Achilles Deed do their best to take out any enemy LBX's that get too close while the others fly out further, but Duck Shuttle comes under attack. Too much damage to Duck Shuttle would make it unable to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Professor Yamano completes the modifications to the Proto I's, and Ban and Hiro launch Ikaros Zero and Ikaros Force. Ikaros Zero and Ikaros Force easily dispose of the enemy LBX's while debuting a new mode they have - weapons form. Under weapons form, the Ikaros can turn into a weapon their partner can use to delete most enemies with a finishing function. In this episode, Ban turns Ikaros Zero into weapon form and Hiro destroys most of the enemy LBX's with the Finishing Function 00 Sword. The group has their LBX's reboard the Duck Shuttle. On Paradise Kirito vows to get the 3% data he needs to finish his program to bring his girlfriend back to life before Ban and company get there. Duck Shuttle comes into range of the laser defense system, and when the ship gets down to a 20% dodge rate, it looks like they will be destroyed. However Doctor Ozora and Otacross arrive with the dodging program and uploads Metamo R with it. He is able to get the Duck Shuttle to dodge all attacks and get under the satellite where there are no lasers, allowing the Ikaros and Minerva Kai to go out and create a passage for them.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 38\n| Title               = Capturing Paradise\n| TranslitTitle       = Paradaisu o K\u014dryaku Seyo\n| NativeTitle         = \u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9\u3092\u653b\u7565\u305b\u3088\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|10|17}}\n| ShortSummary        = In order to get inside Paradise, Ikaros Force, Ikaros Zero, and Minerva Kai must create an opening. Ikaros Force goes into his weapon form and Ikaros Zero uses Meteor Breaker to penetrate the first layer of steel. Minerva Kai then uses her Extreme Flame Avalanche finisher to penetrate the second layer and create the needed opening. Ikaros Force then downloads the blue prints for Paradise, allowing Otacross to come up with a route to the command center. In order to make it to the command center the group will have to divide into 4 teams and destroy the limiters, thereby activating the elevator. Otacross leads the group into Paradise, but about halfway in they are cut off by Kirito. Kirito has decided to get the final 3% he needs to complete Cyclops AI through battle. He traps Ban, Hiro, and Ran in a D-Egg and sends out his Dequoo OZ, Hakai-O Kirito Custom, and Joker Kirito Custom to battle Ikaros Zero, Ikaros Force, and Minerva Kai. A glimpse of Kirito's past is seen. Many weeks ago, Kirito had a girlfriend named Amy. One rainy day, Kirito was running late to a date and a truck slid on the wet road and killed Amy right in front of his eyes. Kirito built an android version of Amy, but without the perfect brain it lacked the feelings that it was Amy. Alan Worthen offered Kirito the perfect brain on the pretext that he would become Omegadain's test player. That perfect brain is part of Cyclops AI and sits now at 97%. The group begins to battle, and Ikaros Zero destroys Hakai-O Kirito Custom with Cosmo Slash. Minerva Kai destroys Joker Kirito custom with Extreme Flame Avalanche. Just before Ban can unleash Ikaros Force's finisher, the download reaches 100% and Dequo-OZ powers up abruptly. Ikaros Zero transforms into weapon mode and they unleash the Meteor Breaker to counter Dequoo-OZ's strength from the finisher X Blade. The two powerful finishers makes the D-Egg to go unstable and allows a mysterious LBX to infiltrate the battlefield. The mysterious LBX stabs Dequoo-OZ through the chest and steals the perfect brain. Alfeld comes on and thanks Kirito for his hardwork and relieves him of his duties, announcing that the perfect brain can only work in LBX's and could never work in an android. Alfeld's LBX flees with the perfect brain, and the kids are able to move on. Kirito collapses to the ground utterly devastated. As the group moves on they divide into teams. Ami goes with Kazuya, Jin with Yuuya, Jessica with Asuka, and Ban, Hiro, and Ran travel with Professor Yamano and Doctor Ozora. They destroy the limiters and activate the emergency elevators. As the groups arrive in the control corridor hallway an alarm sounds. The emergency doors to the control center close with only Ban's team making it through to the elevator. Seeing no other choice Ban's group takes the elevator to the control room where they are welcomed by Alfeld, Doctor Mummy, and Bishop with only 15 minutes left until the satellite can fire again.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 39\n| Title               = The Ultimate Power of Zeus\n| TranslitTitle       = Ky\u016bkyoku no Chikara Zeusu\n| NativeTitle         = \u7a76\u6975\u306e\u529b \u30bc\u30a6\u30b9\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2012|10|24}}\n| ShortSummary        = Ota X finds a way for the other teams to get out, while Ban and his team have a confrontation with Gardyne.

If that were not enough LBX's begin showing up all over the place and begin attacking the audience. Luckily the Duck Shuttle shows up. Ban, Hiro, Ran, Jin, Kazu, Ami, Asuka, Yuuya, and Jessica launch their LBX's and begin battling the enemies LBX's. A mysterious boy named San controls the LBX's, but he decides to save his wildcards for another day. Ban and Hiro communicate with Tenma and the other soccer players, and they come up with a plan to destroy the enemy LBX's.<br><br>Once the enemy LBX's are destroyed another new girl appears. She casts some sort of spell that causes everyone in the world to start disappearing. Luckily Fei arrives in the Inazuma Bus and saves Shunsei Inazuma Japan. They follow the Duck Ship to the woods where they introduce themselves and quickly become friends.<br><br>A little later on a scream is heard in the woods. Ban, Hiro, and Tenma rush to the scene where they save a girl named Fran from two LBX's. The group quickly begins to know Fran and thinks she is becoming their friend. It is all a setup though. Fran tries to make them all disappear in the night, but their hope and goals protect them. Fran realizes the only way to defeat them is by causing dissent within the ranks.<br><br>Slowly dissent is caused. First Fran has a killer droid destroy Pandora and Achilles Deed, which causes Kazu and Ami to disappear. Then she plants evidence that will turn the two groups against each other.  What she had not counted on was Shinsuke watching her planting the evidence in the tent in middle of the  last night. He reveals this to everyone, and they turn against Fran. Fran summons Asta and San revealing that the three are the responsibles for what is happening right now, and the three challenge everyone to a soccer (against Asta) and LBX (against San) match at coordinates G223.<br><br>Of course everyone rushes off to do the battle. Asta and San use techniques which cause the teams to turn against each other, but Ban, Hiro, and Tenma use their various speeches to again focus the group. Inazuma Japan ends up defeating Asta's The Destructchers 3-2, and Ban and his friends destroy all of San's LBX's. Fran goes ballistic when she sees her brothers lose and attacks both groups with her own LBX, keshin armed and soccer special technique that erases everything. The groups unite to create God Hand W which engulfs Fran and turns her back into her light hearted good self. <br><br>With Fran and her brothers defeated the worlds are restored to normal. The groups say goodbye before disappearing and go back to their worlds where they can once again enjoy soccer, LBX battles, and for Fran she can be reunited with her siblings and create a world full of flowers and joy.\n}}\n|}\n\n==''Little Battlers eXperience Wars''==\n'''Opening themes'''\n* \"Mugen Myself\" by Little Blue boX (eps 1-21)\n* \"Eternal\" by Little Blue boX (eps 22-37)\n'''Ending themes'''\n* \"Kamisama Y\u0101y\u0101y\u0101\" by Dream5 (eps 1-21)\n* \"Bokutachi no Wars\" by Ryota Ohsaka, Sayori Ishizuka, and Tomoaki Maeno (eps 22-36)\n* \"Hirameki\" by Ryota Ohsaka (ep 37)\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%; margin:left; background:#FFF;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #CCF\"\n! style=\"width:3em;\"  | No.\n!

At a special assembly Ban explains why he has come only to have Arata ask Ban is he will hold a match with him. Ban agrees. What Ban does not tell him is that it will be a tag-team match. Ban (w/ Odin) teams up with Jin (w/ Zenon) and battles Arata (w/ Dot Blastizer) and Muraku Houjou (w/ Magna Orthus). Ban and Jin easily prevail over the two. Ban tells Arata the reason he lost is because he is not conversing with his LBX. Later Ban and Arata hold a rematch with Achilles and Achilles Deeed. This time the two put up an even fight. Arata is able to communicate with Achilles Deed. In the end both use their hissatsu techniques (Lightning Lance & Cosmo Slash) and end the battle in a draw. After the battle Ban decides to go to Nation-A to continue learning more about LBX's when he graduates High School, and Arata is finally able to leave the island after getting his permission form signed.\n}}\n|}\n\n==''LBX: Little Battlers eXperience''==\n\n===Season 1===\n'''Ending theme'''\n* \"Battle On\" by Mike Twining & Andrew Twining \n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%; margin:left; background:#FFF;\"\n|- style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid #CCF\"\n! style=\"width:3em;\"  | No.\n! style=\"width:12em;\" | Dub Title\n! style=\"width:12em;\" | Original U.S. airdate\n|-\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 01\n| Title           = Starting Small\n| AltDate         = August 24, 2014<ref name=\"TV Guide\">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/lbx/episodes-season-1/683506/ | title=LBX Season 1 Episodes | publisher = TV Guide | accessdate = August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Van Yamano and his best friends Amy Cohen and Kaz Walker have just entered the Artemis Tournament with the objective to become the best LBX players in the world.
