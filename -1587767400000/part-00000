The order venerates the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] as its [[patron saint|patroness]], under the [[titles of Mary|title]] of Our Lady of Mount Philermos.\n\nThe headquarters of the Order of Saint John had been located [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|in Malta]] from 1530 until 1798. It was technically a vassal of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], holding Malta in exchange for a [[Tribute of the Maltese Falcon|nominal fee]], but declared independence in 1753.\n\nIt was expelled from Malta under the [[French occupation of Malta|French occupation]] in 1798 and, from 1805 to 1812, many of its possessions in [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Europe were confiscated, resulting in the fragmentation of the order into a number of Protestant branches, since 1961 united under the umbrella of the [[Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem]].\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 confirmed the loss of Malta, but the [[Congress of Verona]] in 1822 guaranteed the continued existence of the Catholic order as a sovereign entity. The seat of the order was moved to [[Ferrara]] in 1826 and to Rome in 1834, the interior of [[Palazzo Malta]] being considered [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] sovereign territory of the order. The grand priories of Lombardy-Venetia and of Sicily were restored from 1839 to 1841. The office of Grand Master was restored by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1879, after a vacancy of 75 years, confirming [[Giovanni Battista Ceschi a Santa Croce]] as the first Grand Master of the restored Order of Malta.\n\nThe [[Holy See]] was established as a subject of international law in the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929. In the following decades, the connection between the Holy See and the Order of Malta was seen as so close as to call into question the actual sovereignty of the order as a separate entity. This has prompted constitutional changes on the part of the Order, which were implemented in 1997. Since then, the Order has been widely recognized as a sovereign subject of international law in its own right.<ref>\"On account of some arguments presented in the 1950s, to the effect that the ties with the Holy See in a constitutional and international law context were so close and frequent that the true sovereignty of the Order could be called in question, constitutional changes were made by the Order. These were established in 1997. While the previous constitution laid down that the Order of Malta was a 'legal entity solemnly recognised by the Holy See', this formulation has now been removed from the Order's constitution. The previous constitution prescribed that, after being elected, the head of state of the Order of Malta, that is to say the Grand Master, must be approved by the Pope, the new wording in the constitution only prescribes that after election the Grand Master shall inform the Pope of his election. The requirement of approval has gone and is replaced by a simple communication on the part of the Grand Master. Changes have been implemented throughout to show that the Order is independent of the Holy See from the constitutional and international law perspective.\" Bo J.

Copper engraving by [[Laurent Cars]], c. 1725.]]\n\nThe birth of the order dates back to around 1048. Merchants from the ancient [[Duchy of Amalfi|Marine Republic of Amalfi]] obtained from the Caliph of Egypt the authorisation to build a church, convent, and hospital in Jerusalem, to care for pilgrims of any religious faith or race. The Order of St. John of Jerusalem\u2013the monastic community that ran the hospital for the pilgrims in the Holy Land\u2013became independent under the guidance of its founder, the religious brother [[Blessed Gerard|Gerard]].\n\nWith the [[Papal bull]] ''[[Pie postulatio voluntatis]]'' dated 15 February 1113, [[Pope Paschal II]] approved the foundation of the Hospital and placed it under the aegis of the Holy See, granting it the right to freely elect its superiors without interference from other secular or religious authorities. By virtue of the Papal Bull, the hospital became an order exempt from the control of the local church. All the Knights were religious, bound by the three monastic vows of [[Evangelical counsels|poverty, chastity and obedience]].\n\nThe constitution of the Christian [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] during the [[Crusades]] obliged the order to take on the military defence of the sick, the pilgrims, and the captured territories. The order thus added the task of defending the faith to that of its hospitaller mission.\n\nAs time went on, the order adopted the white eight-pointed Cross that is still its symbol today. The eight points represent the eight \"beatitudes\" that Jesus pronounced in his [[Sermon on the Mount]].\n\n=== Cyprus ===\nWhen the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land fell after the [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Siege of Acre]] in 1291, the order settled first in [[Cyprus]].\n\n===Rhodes===\nIn 1310, led by Grand Master Fra' [[Foulques de Villaret]], the knights regrouped on the island of [[Rhodes]]. From there, the defense of the Christian world required the organization of a naval force; so the Order built a powerful fleet and sailed the eastern Mediterranean, fighting battles for the sake of Christendom, including Crusades in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, the institutions of the Order and the knights who came to Rhodes from every corner of Europe were grouped according to the languages they spoke. The first seven such groups, or [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)|''Langues'' (Tongues)]] \u2013 from [[Provence]], [[Auvergne]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Aragon]] ([[Navarre]]), [[England]] (with [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]), and [[Germany]] \u2013 became eight in 1492, when [[Castile]] and [[Portugal]] were separated from the ''Langue'' of Aragon. Each ''Langue'' included [[Priories]] or Grand Priories, [[Bailiwick]]s, and [[Commandry (feudalism)|Commanderies]].\n\nThe Order was governed by its Grand Master, the Prince of Rhodes, and its Council. From its beginning, independence from other nations granted by pontifical charter and the universally recognised right to maintain and deploy armed forces constituted grounds for the international sovereignty of the Order, which minted its own coins and maintained diplomatic relations with other States. The senior positions of the Order were given to representatives of different ''Langues''.\n\nIn 1523, after six months of siege and fierce combat against the fleet and army of Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the Knights were forced to surrender, and left Rhodes with military honours.\n\n===Malta===\n[[File:Bust portrait of a knight of Malta cropped.jpg|thumb|Bust portrait of a Knight of Malta]]\n{{main|History of Malta under the Order of Saint John}}\nThe order remained without a territory of its own until 1530, when Grand Master Fra' [[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam|Philippe de Villiers de l'Isle Adam]] took possession of the island of [[Malta]], granted to the order by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his mother Queen [[Joanna of Castile]] as monarchs of Sicily, with the approval of [[Pope Clement VII]], for which the order had to honour the conditions of the [[Tribute of the Maltese Falcon]].\n\n==== Protestant Reformation ====\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] which split Western Europe into [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] states affected the knights as well. In several countries, including England, Scotland and [[Sweden]], the order was dissolved. In others, including the [[Netherlands]] and Germany, entire bailiwicks or commanderies (administrative divisions of the order) experienced religious conversions; these \"[[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Johanniter orders]]\" survive in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden and many other countries, including the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]]. It was established that the order should remain neutral in any war between Christian nations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Colonies in the Caribbean ====\n[[File:Hospitaller colonization.png|thumb|Map of the colonies of the order in the [[Caribbean]] during the 17th century]]\n{{main|Hospitaller colonization of the Americas}}\n\nFrom 1651 to 1665, the Order of Saint John ruled four islands in the Caribbean. On 21 May 1651, it acquired the islands of [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], [[Saint Kitts|Saint Christopher]], [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]] and [[Saint Martin]]. These were purchased from the French [[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique]] which had just been dissolved. In 1665, the four islands were sold to the [[French West India Company]].\n\n====Great siege of Malta====\n{{main|Great Siege of Malta}}\nIn 1565, the Knights, led by Grand Master Fra' [[Jean de Vallette]] (after whom the capital of Malta, [[Valletta]], was named), defended the island for more than three months during the Great Siege by the Turks.\n\n==== Battle of Lepanto ====\n[[File:Battle_of_Lepanto_1571.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), unknown artist, late 16th century]]\n{{main|Battle of Lepanto}}\nThe fleet of the order contributed to the ultimate destruction of the Ottoman naval power in the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, led by [[John of Austria]], half brother of King [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\n==== French occupation of Malta ====\n[[File:Emperor Paul in the Crown of the Grand Master of the Order of Malta.jpeg|thumb|[[Paul I of Russia|Emperor Paul]] wearing the Crown of the Grand Master of the [[Order of Malta]] (1799).]]\n{{main|French occupation of Malta}}\nTheir [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] stronghold of Malta was captured by the [[French First Republic]] under [[Napoleon]] in 1798 [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria#Capture of Malta|during his expedition to Egypt]], following the [[French Revolution]] and the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Napoleon demanded from [[List of Princes and Grand Masters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Grand Master]] [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]] that his ships be allowed to enter the port and to take on water and supplies. The Grand Master replied that only two foreign ships could be allowed to enter the port at a time. Bonaparte, aware that such a procedure would take a very long time and would leave his forces vulnerable to Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]], immediately ordered a cannon fusillade against Malta.<ref>Cole, Juan (2007).

The Russian Emperor, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], gave the largest number of knights shelter in [[Saint Petersburg]], an action which gave rise to the [[Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller]] and the Order's recognition among the Russian Imperial Orders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focusmm.com/malta/ma_hist3.htm|title=Focus on Malta \u2013 History|publisher=Focusmm.com|accessdate=2008-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304043839/http://www.focusmm.com/malta/ma_hist3.htm|archive-date=4 March 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The refugee knights in Saint Petersburg proceeded to elect Tsar Paul as their Grand Master \u2013 a rival to Grand Master von Hompesch until the latter's abdication left Paul as the sole Grand Master. Grand Master Paul I created, in addition to the Roman Catholic Grand Priory, a \"Russian Grand Priory\" of no fewer than 118 Commanderies, dwarfing the rest of the Order and open to all Christians. Paul's election as Grand Master was, however, never ratified under Roman Catholic canon law, and he was the ''de facto'' rather than ''[[de jure]]'' Grand Master of the Order.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the order had been severely weakened by the loss of its priories throughout Europe. Only 10% of the order's income came from traditional sources in Europe, with the remaining 90% being generated by the Russian Grand Priory until 1810. This was partly reflected in the government of the Order being under Lieutenants, rather than Grand Masters, in the period 1805 to 1879, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] restored a Grand Master to the order. This signaled the renewal of the order's fortunes as a humanitarian and religious organization.\n\nOn 19 September 1806, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] government offered the sovereignty of the island of [[Gotland]] to the Order. The offer was rejected since it would have meant the Order renouncing their claim to Malta.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stair Sainty|first1=Guy|title=From the loss of Malta to the modern era|url=http://www.chivalricorders.org/orders/smom/maltmod.htm|website=ChivalricOrders.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306192355/http://www.chivalricorders.org/orders/smom/maltmod.htm|archivedate=6 March 2012|date=2000}}</ref>\n\n===Exile===\nThe French forces occupying Malta expelled the knights from their country.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=SghCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA32| page= 32| title= Pi\u00e8ces diverses relatives aux operations militaires et pol. du g\u00e9n.

However, this was not to be because objections to the treaty quickly grew in the UK.\n\nBonaparte's rejection of a British offer involving a ten-year lease of Malta prompted the reactivation of the British blockade of the French coast; Britain declared war on France on 18 May.<ref>Pocock, Tom (2005).

Large-scale hospitaller and charitable activities were carried out during World Wars I and II under Grand Master Fra' [[Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere]] (1931\u20131951).

This class is subdivided into three categories, namely that of ''Knight and Dames of Honour and Devotion in Obedience'', ''Knight and Dames of Grace and Devotion in Obedience'', and ''Knight and Dames of Magistral Grace in Obedience''.\n*'''Third Class''', which is subdivided into six categories: ''Knights and Dames of Honour and Devotion'', ''Conventual Chaplains ad honorem'', ''Knights and Dames of Grace and Devotion'', ''Magistral Chaplains'', ''Knights and Dames of Magistral Grace'', and ''Donats (male and female) of Devotion.'' All categories of this class are made up of members who take no vows and who had to show a decreasingly extensive history of nobility. Knights and Dames of magistral grace need not prove any noble lineage and are the most common class of knights in the United States.\n\nWithin each class and category of knights are ranks ranging from bailiff grand cross (the highest) through knight grand cross, and knight \u2014 thus one could be a \"knight of grace and devotion,\" or a \"bailiff grand cross of justice.\" The final rank of ''donat'' is offered to some who join the order in the class of \"justice\" but who are not knights. Bishops and priests are generally honorary members, or knights, of the Order of Malta. However, there are some priests who are full members of the Order, and this is usually because they were conferred knighthood prior to ordination. The priests of the Order of Malta are ranked as Honorary Canons, as in the Order of the Holy Sepulchre; and they are entitled to wear the black mozetta with purple piping and purple fascia.\n\nPrior to the 1990s, all officers of the Order had to be of noble birth (''i.e.'', [[armiger]]ous for at least a hundred years), as they were all knights of justice or of obedience. However, Knights of Magistral Grace (''i.e.'', those without noble proofs) now may make the Promise of Obedience and, at the discretion of the Grand Master and Sovereign Council, may enter the [[novitiate]] to become professed Knights of Justice. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nWorldwide, there are over 13,000 knights and dames, of whom approximately 55 are professed religious.<ref>{{cite book |first=H.J.A. |last=Sire |title=The Knights of Malta: A Modern Resurrection | location =London|publisher=Third Millennium |year=2016 |page=278}}</ref>\nMembership in the Order is by invitation only and solicitations are not entertained.\n\nThe Order's finances are audited by a Board of Auditors, which includes a President and four Councillors, all elected by the Chapter General.

One of the aircraft transferred to the Order of Malta, still with the Order's fuselage roundels, is preserved in the [[Italian Air Force Museum]].<ref>''Military Aircraft Insignia of the World'' by John Cochrane and Stuart Elliott, published 1998 by Airlife Publishing Limited of Shrewsbury, England (illustrated). {{ISBN|1-85310-873-1}}</ref>\n\n===Logistics===\nThe Military Corps has become known in mainland Europe for its operation of [[hospital train]]s,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324183934/http://www.orderofmalta.int/wp-content/themes/order_of_malta/gallery_zoom.php?id=35087&foto=0&lang=en]</ref> a service which was carried out intensively during both World Wars.

The order venerates the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] as its [[patron saint|patroness]], under the [[titles of Mary|title]] of Our Lady of Mount Philermos.\n\nThe headquarters of the Order of Saint John had been located [[History of Malta under the Order of Saint John|in Malta]] from 1530 until 1798. It was technically a vassal of the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], holding Malta in exchange for a [[Tribute of the Maltese Falcon|nominal fee]], but declared independence in 1753.\n\nIt was expelled from Malta under the [[French occupation of Malta|French occupation]] in 1798 and, from 1805 to 1812, many of its possessions in [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Europe were confiscated, resulting in the fragmentation of the order into a number of Protestant branches, since 1961 united under the umbrella of the [[Alliance of the Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem]].\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815 confirmed the loss of Malta, but the [[Congress of Verona]] in 1822 guaranteed the continued existence of the Catholic order as a sovereign entity. The seat of the order was moved to [[Ferrara]] in 1826 and to Rome in 1834, the interior of [[Palazzo Malta]] being considered [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] sovereign territory of the order. The grand priories of Lombardy-Venetia and of Sicily were restored from 1839 to 1841. The office of Grand Master was restored by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1879, after a vacancy of 75 years, confirming [[Giovanni Battista Ceschi a Santa Croce]] as the first Grand Master of the restored Order of Malta.\n\nThe [[Holy See]] was established as a subject of international law in the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929. In the following decades, the connection between the Holy See and the Order of Malta was seen as so close as to call into question the actual sovereignty of the order as a separate entity. This has prompted constitutional changes on the part of the Order, which were implemented in 1997. Since then, the Order has been widely recognized as a sovereign subject of international law in its own right.<ref>\"On account of some arguments presented in the 1950s, to the effect that the ties with the Holy See in a constitutional and international law context were so close and frequent that the true sovereignty of the Order could be called in question, constitutional changes were made by the Order. These were established in 1997. While the previous constitution laid down that the Order of Malta was a 'legal entity solemnly recognised by the Holy See', this formulation has now been removed from the Order's constitution. The previous constitution prescribed that, after being elected, the head of state of the Order of Malta, that is to say the Grand Master, must be approved by the Pope, the new wording in the constitution only prescribes that after election the Grand Master shall inform the Pope of his election. The requirement of approval has gone and is replaced by a simple communication on the part of the Grand Master. Changes have been implemented throughout to show that the Order is independent of the Holy See from the constitutional and international law perspective.\" Bo J.

Until the 1990s, the highest classes of membership, including officers, required proof of noble lineage. More recently, a path was created for Knights and Dames of the lowest class (of whom proof of aristocratic lineage is not required) to be specially elevated to the highest class, making them eligible for office in the order.\n\nThe order employs about 42,000 doctors, nurses, auxiliaries and [[paramedic]]s assisted by 80,000 volunteers in more than 120 countries,{{NoteTag|name=M13000}} assisting children, homeless, handicapped, elderly, and [[terminal illness|terminally ill]] people, refugees, and [[leprosy|lepers]] around the world without distinction of ethnicity or religion.{{NoteTag|The order's website says \"its programmes include medical and social assistance, disaster relief in the case of armed conflicts and natural catastrophes, emergency services and first aid corps, help for the elderly, the handicapped and children in need and the provision of first aid training, and support for refugees and internally displaced persons regardless of race, origin or religion.\"|name=M13000}} Through its worldwide relief corps, [[Malteser International]], the order aids victims of [[natural disaster]]s, epidemics and war.

The Order of St. John of Jerusalem\u2013the monastic community that ran the hospital for the pilgrims in the Holy Land\u2013became independent under the guidance of its founder, the religious brother [[Blessed Gerard|Gerard]].\n\nWith the [[Papal bull]] ''[[Pie postulatio voluntatis]]'' dated 15 February 1113, [[Pope Paschal II]] approved the foundation of the Hospital and placed it under the aegis of the Holy See, granting it the right to freely elect its superiors without interference from other secular or religious authorities. By virtue of the Papal Bull, the hospital became an order exempt from the control of the local church. All the Knights were religious, bound by the three monastic vows of [[Evangelical counsels|poverty, chastity and obedience]].\n\nThe constitution of the Christian [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] during the [[Crusades]] obliged the order to take on the military defence of the sick, the pilgrims, and the captured territories. The order thus added the task of defending the faith to that of its hospitaller mission.\n\nAs time went on, the order adopted the white eight-pointed Cross that is still its symbol today. The eight points represent the eight \"beatitudes\" that Jesus pronounced in his [[Sermon on the Mount]].\n\n=== Cyprus ===\nWhen the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land fell after the [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Siege of Acre]] in 1291, the order settled first in [[Cyprus]].\n\n===Rhodes===\nIn 1310, led by Grand Master Fra' [[Foulques de Villaret]], the knights regrouped on the island of [[Rhodes]]. From there, the defense of the Christian world required the organization of a naval force; so the Order built a powerful fleet and sailed the eastern Mediterranean, fighting battles for the sake of Christendom, including Crusades in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]].\n\nIn the early 14th century, the institutions of the Order and the knights who came to Rhodes from every corner of Europe were grouped according to the languages they spoke. The first seven such groups, or [[Langue (Knights Hospitaller)|''Langues'' (Tongues)]] \u2013 from [[Provence]], [[Auvergne]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Aragon]] ([[Navarre]]), [[England]] (with [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]), and [[Germany]] \u2013 became eight in 1492, when [[Castille]] and [[Portugal]] were separated from the ''Langue'' of Aragon. Each ''Langue'' included [[Priories]] or Grand Priories, [[Bailiwick]]s, and [[Commandry (feudalism)|Commanderies]].\n\nThe Order was governed by its Grand Master, the Prince of Rhodes, and its Council. From its beginning, independence from other nations granted by pontifical charter and the universally recognised right to maintain and deploy armed forces constituted grounds for the international sovereignty of the Order, which minted its own coins and maintained diplomatic relations with other States. The senior positions of the Order were given to representatives of different ''Langues''.\n\nIn 1523, after six months of siege and fierce combat against the fleet and army of Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], the Knights were forced to surrender, and left Rhodes with military honours.\n\n===Malta===\n[[File:Bust portrait of a knight of Malta cropped.jpg|thumb|Bust portrait of a Knight of Malta]]\n{{main|History of Malta under the Order of Saint John}}\nThe order remained without a territory of its own until 1530, when Grand Master Fra' [[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam|Philippe de Villiers de l'Isle Adam]] took possession of the island of [[Malta]], granted to the order by Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and his mother Queen [[Joanna of Castile]] as monarchs of Sicily, with the approval of [[Pope Clement VII]], for which the order had to honour the conditions of the [[Tribute of the Maltese Falcon]].\n\n==== Protestant Reformation ====\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] which split Western Europe into [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] states affected the knights as well. In several countries, including England, Scotland and [[Sweden]], the order was dissolved. In others, including the [[Netherlands]] and Germany, entire bailiwicks or commanderies (administrative divisions of the order) experienced religious conversions; these \"[[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Johanniter orders]]\" survive in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden and many other countries, including the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]]. It was established that the order should remain neutral in any war between Christian nations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Colonies in the Caribbean ====\n[[File:Hospitaller colonization.png|thumb|Map of the colonies of the order in the [[Caribbean]] during the 17th century]]\n{{main|Hospitaller colonization of the Americas}}\n\nFrom 1651 to 1665, the Order of Saint John ruled four islands in the Caribbean. On 21 May 1651, it acquired the islands of [[Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]], [[Saint Kitts|Saint Christopher]], [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Croix]] and [[Saint Martin]]. These were purchased from the French [[Compagnie des \u00celes de l'Am\u00e9rique]] which had just been dissolved. In 1665, the four islands were sold to the [[French West India Company]].\n\n====Great siege of Malta====\n{{main|Great Siege of Malta}}\nIn 1565, the Knights, led by Grand Master Fra' [[Jean de Vallette]] (after whom the capital of Malta, [[Valletta]], was named), defended the island for more than three months during the Great Siege by the Turks.\n\n==== Battle of Lepanto ====\n[[File:Battle_of_Lepanto_1571.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), unknown artist, late 16th century]]\n{{main|Battle of Lepanto}}\nThe fleet of the order contributed to the ultimate destruction of the Ottoman naval power in the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, led by [[John of Austria]], half brother of King [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\n==== French occupation of Malta ====\n[[File:Emperor Paul in the Crown of the Grand Master of the Order of Malta.jpeg|thumb|[[Paul I of Russia|Emperor Paul]] wearing the Crown of the Grand Master of the [[Order of Malta]] (1799).]]\n{{main|French occupation of Malta}}\nTheir [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] stronghold of Malta was captured by the [[French First Republic]] under [[Napoleon]] in 1798 [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria#Capture of Malta|during his expedition to Egypt]], following the [[French Revolution]] and the subsequent [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Napoleon demanded from [[List of Princes and Grand Masters of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Grand Master]] [[Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim]] that his ships be allowed to enter the port and to take on water and supplies. The Grand Master replied that only two foreign ships could be allowed to enter the port at a time. Bonaparte, aware that such a procedure would take a very long time and would leave his forces vulnerable to Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]], immediately ordered a cannon fusillade against Malta.<ref>Cole, Juan (2007).

The Russian Emperor, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]], gave the largest number of knights shelter in [[Saint Petersburg]], an action which gave rise to the [[Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller]] and the Order's recognition among the Russian Imperial Orders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.focusmm.com/malta/ma_hist3.htm|title=Focus on Malta \u2013 History|publisher=Focusmm.com|accessdate=2008-10-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304043839/http://www.focusmm.com/malta/ma_hist3.htm|archive-date=4 March 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The refugee knights in Saint Petersburg proceeded to elect Tsar Paul as their Grand Master \u2013 a rival to Grand Master von Hompesch until the latter's abdication left Paul as the sole Grand Master. Grand Master Paul I created, in addition to the Roman Catholic Grand Priory, a \"Russian Grand Priory\" of no fewer than 118 Commanderies, dwarfing the rest of the Order and open to all Christians. Paul's election as Grand Master was, however, never ratified under Roman Catholic canon law, and he was the ''de facto'' rather than ''[[de jure]]'' Grand Master of the Order.\n\nBy the early 19th century, the order had been severely weakened by the loss of its priories throughout Europe. Only 10% of the order's income came from traditional sources in Europe, with the remaining 90% being generated by the Russian Grand Priory until 1810. This was partly reflected in the government of the Order being under Lieutenants, rather than Grand Masters, in the period 1805 to 1879, when [[Pope Leo XIII]] restored a Grand Master to the order. This signaled the renewal of the order's fortunes as a humanitarian and religious organization.\n\nOn 19 September 1806, the [[Sweden|Swedish]] government offered the sovereignty of the island of [[Gotland]] to the Order. The offer was rejected since it would have meant the Order renouncing their claim to Malta.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stair Sainty|first1=Guy|title=From the loss of Malta to the modern era|url=http://www.chivalricorders.org/orders/smom/maltmod.htm|website=ChivalricOrders.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306192355/http://www.chivalricorders.org/orders/smom/maltmod.htm|archivedate=6 March 2012|date=2000}}</ref>\n\n===Exile===\nThe French forces occupying Malta expelled the knights from their country.<ref>{{cite book| url= https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=SghCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA32| page= 32| title= Pi\u00e8ces diverses relatives aux operations militaires et pol. du g\u00e9n.

However, this was not to be because objections to the treaty quickly grew in the UK.\n\nBonaparte's rejection of a British offer involving a ten-year lease of Malta prompted the reactivation of the British blockade of the French coast; Britain declared war on France on 18 May.<ref>Pocock, Tom (2005).

Large-scale hospitaller and charitable activities were carried out during World Wars I and II under Grand Master Fra' [[Ludovico Chigi Albani della Rovere]] (1931\u20131951). Under the Grand Masters Fra' [[Angelo de Mojana di Cologna]] (1962\u201388) and Fra' [[Andrew Bertie]] (1988\u20132008), the projects expanded.\n\n====Relations with the Republic of Malta====\n[[File:St-Angelo-Malta.jpg|thumb|Flags of Malta and the SMOM on [[Fort Saint Angelo]]]]\n\nTwo bilateral treaties have been concluded with the [[Republic of Malta]].

Until the 1990s membership in this class was restricted to members of families with noble lineages. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}} There are also three surviving [[enclosed religious orders|enclosed monasteries]] of nuns of the Order, two in Spain that date from the 11/12th centuries and one in Malta, whose members hold the same rank in the Order as chaplains.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.orderofmalta.int/sovereign-order-of-malta/nuns-of-the-order/ |title=The Nuns of the Order of Malta |accessdate=22 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623174202/https://www.orderofmalta.int/sovereign-order-of-malta/nuns-of-the-order/ |archive-date=23 June 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*'''Second Class''': ''[[Knight in Obedience|Knight and Dames in Obedience]]'', similarly restricted until recently, these knights and dames make a promise, rather than a vow, of obedience. This class is subdivided into three categories, namely that of ''Knight and Dames of Honour and Devotion in Obedience'', ''Knight and Dames of Grace and Devotion in Obedience'', and ''Knight and Dames of Magistral Grace in Obedience''.\n*'''Third Class''', which is subdivided into six categories: ''Knights and Dames of Honour and Devotion'', ''Conventual Chaplains ad honorem'', ''Knights and Dames of Grace and Devotion'', ''Magistral Chaplains'', ''Knights and Dames of Magistral Grace'', and ''Donats (male and female) of Devotion.'' All categories of this class are made up of members who take no vows and who had to show a decreasingly extensive history of nobility. Knights and Dames of magistral grace need not prove any noble lineage and are the most common class of knights in the United States.\n\nWithin each class and category of knights are ranks ranging from bailiff grand cross (the highest) through knight grand cross, and knight \u2014 thus one could be a \"knight of grace and devotion,\" or a \"bailiff grand cross of justice.\" The final rank of ''donat'' is offered to some who join the order in the class of \"justice\" but who are not knights. Bishops and priests are generally honorary members, or knights, of the Order of Malta. However, there are some priests who are full members of the Order, and this is usually because they were conferred knighthood prior to ordination. The priests of the Order of Malta are ranked as Honorary Canons, as in the Order of the Holy Sepulchre; and they are entitled to wear the black mozetta with purple piping and purple fascia.\n\nPrior to the 1990s, all officers of the Order had to be of noble birth (''i.e.'', [[armiger]]ous for at least a hundred years), as they were all knights of justice or of obedience. However, Knights of Magistral Grace (''i.e.'', those without noble proofs) now may make the Promise of Obedience and, at the discretion of the Grand Master and Sovereign Council, may enter the [[novitiate]] to become professed Knights of Justice. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nWorldwide, there are over 13,000 knights and dames, of whom approximately 55 are professed religious.<ref>{{cite book |first=H.J.A. |last=Sire |title=The Knights of Malta: A Modern Resurrection | location =London|publisher=Third Millennium |year=2016 |page=278}}</ref>\nMembership in the Order is by invitation only and solicitations are not entertained.\n\nThe Order's finances are audited by a Board of Auditors, which includes a President and four Councillors, all elected by the Chapter General.

These aircraft were operated by Italian Air Force personnel temporarily flying for the Order, carried the Order's roundels on the fuselage and Italian ones on the wings, and were used mainly for standard Italian Air Force training and transport missions but also for some humanitarian tasks proper of the Order of Malta (like the transport of sick pilgrims to the Lourdes sanctuary). In the early '50s, when the strictures of the peace treaty had been much relaxed by the Allied authorities, the aircraft returned under full control of the Italian Air Force. One of the aircraft transferred to the Order of Malta, still with the Order's fuselage roundels, is preserved in the [[Italian Air Force Museum]].<ref>''Military Aircraft Insignia of the World'' by John Cochrane and Stuart Elliott, published 1998 by Airlife Publishing Limited of Shrewsbury, England (illustrated). {{ISBN|1-85310-873-1}}</ref>\n\n===Logistics===\nThe Military Corps has become known in mainland Europe for its operation of [[hospital train]]s,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120324183934/http://www.orderofmalta.int/wp-content/themes/order_of_malta/gallery_zoom.php?id=35087&foto=0&lang=en]</ref> a service which was carried out intensively during both World Wars.
