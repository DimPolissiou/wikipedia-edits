It is adjacent to [[Aston University]].\n\n===Institute history===\nBIAD reached its full maturity in the 1890s, as the [[Birmingham Municipal School of Art]] at Margaret Street, under the leadership of [[Edward R.

This was the second polytechnic in Birmingham, the first \u2013 [[Birmingham Polytechnic Institution]] \u2013 having existed in the mid-19th century for ten years.\n\n[[File:Small-pros.jpg|thumb|left|Early Birmingham Polytechnic prospectuses showing the original logo]]\nIt was formed initially out of five colleges. Some of the colleges' staff fought against the merger<ref name=\"The Guardian 2003 p. 9\">The Guardian (1959\u20132003). London (UK): 4 January 1972. p. 9</ref> but later changed their minds. The colleges were:<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n*[[Birmingham School of Art|Birmingham College of Art and Design]] (originally the [[Birmingham Government School of Design]], founded in October 1843);\n*[[Birmingham School of Music]] (developed as a department of the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute]] around 1859);\n*Birmingham College of Commerce (established in the early 20th century as a branch school of the Birmingham Central Technical College, which went on to become Aston University);\n*South Birmingham Technical College (opened in 1961);\n*[[North Birmingham Technical College]] (formerly Aston Technical College, opened in 1966).\n\nThe latter's new Perry Barr campus (which began construction in 1971) became the centre of the new Polytechnic, although the institution continued to have a number of different campuses spread across the city. This has sometimes been seen as a weakness of the polytechnic, with the dispersal of sites considered confusing to visitors.<ref>The Times, Thursday, 8 June 1972; pg. III; Issue 58499; col A \"Education battered in political arena\"</ref>\n\n[[File:Building-PB.jpg|thumb|right|Site of Perry Barr (later City North) campus before building began in the early 1970s]]\nIn the early 1970s, the Perry Barr campus was the site of building work for what later became the centrepiece of the polytechnic: the Attwood and Baker buildings. Later in the 1970s, the campus was increased in size with the building of what later became the Cox, Dawson, Edge, Feeney and Galton buildings. In the early 1980s, the William Kenrick Library was added to the site. Other, smaller buildings were subsequently constructed, and the estate became known as the City North Campus of Birmingham City University.\n\nFrom its opening, the polytechnic was considered very strong in the field of [[art and design]]. As early as 1972, fashion and textile courses were heavily oversubscribed; there were 100 applications for every 30 places.<ref name=\"The Guardian 2003 p. 9\"/> Also in that year, the polytechnic held the Design in a Polytechnic exhibition, which was opened at a reception hosted by Sir Duncan Oppenheim, the chairman of the Council of Industrial Design.<ref name=\"The Times pg. 12\">The Times, Wednesday, 5 January 1972; pg. 12; Issue 58367; col B</ref> Arts courses remained strong at the polytechnic through the 1970s, with twice as many arts students compared to those doing engineering or technology courses.<ref>Peter Wilby.  The Observer (1791- 2003). 6 May 1973. p. 23</ref>\n\nIn 1975, three more colleges were added to the polytechnic:\n\n*[[Anstey College of Physical Education]] (founded as a private college for women in 1897);\n*Bordesley College of Education (founded as a [[Local Education Authority]] (LEA) Day Training College for women teachers in 1963);\n*City of Birmingham College of Education (founded as an LEA Emergency [[Teacher training college]] in 1948).\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the polytechnic's then-chairman, William Kenrick, sparked criticism from politicians for saying his students were \"second-class\" students.<ref>JOHN FAIRHALL Education Correspondent.  The Guardian (1959\u20132003). London (UK): 20 March 1976. p. 4</ref> In 1978, a lecturer in law, Francis Reynolds, was convicted and fined \u00a3150 for preparing instruments of property conveyance without being a solicitor. He did this to challenge the monopoly solicitors held over conveyancing, which he felt led to higher costs.<ref name=\"The Times pg. 12\"/>\n\n[[File:Birmingham Poly.jpg|thumb|left|Logo after the late 1980s]]\n\nBy 1979, the polytechnic was one of the biggest in the country, though that did not prevent it from being \"starved\" of resources and money. There was a concern that without sufficient investment, the quality of its degree courses in areas such as engineering could not be maintained to the desired standard.<ref>John Fairhall Education Correspondent.  The Guardian (1959\u20132003). London (UK): 22 February 1979. p. 5</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the [[Birmingham Institute of Art and Design]] (BIAD) was established from the merging of the polytechnic's Faculty of Art and Design with [[Bournville College of Art]]. The extensive archives from these earlier incarnations, including over 10,000 artworks, were housed at the polytechnic's Margaret Street campus.\n\nFollowing the UK Government's [[Education Reform Act 1988|Education Reform Act]] in 1989, the polytechnic ceased to be under Birmingham Local Education Authority control and became an independent corporation with [[charitable organization|charitable status]].<ref>The Guardian (1959\u20132003). London (UK): 23 July 1987. p. 6</ref> It was funded by the Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council and no longer by the local education authority. The polytechnic continued to have close links to [[Birmingham City Council]], and to this day the [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham]] also serves as the University's Chancellor.\n\nThe change in status enabled a tighter union between the polytechnic and industry, and by 1989 it had 30 lecturer's posts sponsored by firms.<ref>Michael Smith.  The Guardian (1959\u20132003). London (UK): 11 July 1989. p. 25</ref>\n\n===University status===\nThe [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]] allowed all polytechnics to adopt the title of \"university\". The name ''University of Central England in Birmingham'' was approved by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] on 16 June 1992.

A final year undergraduate student was writing a paper on Mapplethorpe's work and intended to illustrate the paper with a few photographs. She took the photographs to the local photo-studio to be developed and the photo-studio informed [[West Midlands Police]] because of the unusual nature of the images. The police confiscated the library book from the student and informed the university that the book would have to be destroyed. If the university agreed to the destruction, no further action would be taken.\n\nThe university Vice-Chancellor, Peter Knight, took the view\u2014supported by the Senate\u2014that the book was a legitimate book for the university library to hold and that the action of the police was a serious infringement of [[academic freedom]]. The Vice-Chancellor was interviewed by the police, under caution, with a view to prosecution under the terms of the [[Obscene Publications Acts|Obscene Publications Act]], which defines obscenity as material that is likely to deprave and corrupt. The police focused on one particular image, 'Jim and Tom, Sausalito 1977', which depicts one man [[urolagnia|urinating into the mouth of another]].\n\nAfter the interview with the Vice-Chancellor, a file was sent to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] as the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) has to take the decision as to whether or not to proceed with a trial.

This has sometimes been seen as a weakness of the polytechnic, with the dispersal of sites considered confusing to visitors.<ref>The Times, Thursday, 8 June 1972; pg.

Later in the 1970s, the campus was increased in size with the building of what later became the Cox, Dawson, Edge, Feeney and Galton buildings. In the early 1980s, the William Kenrick Library was added to the site. Other, smaller buildings were subsequently constructed, and the estate became known as the City North Campus of Birmingham City University.\n\nFrom its opening, the polytechnic was considered very strong in the field of [[art and design]].

If the university agreed to the destruction, no further action would be taken.\n\nThe university Vice-Chancellor, Peter Knight, took the view\u2014supported by the Senate\u2014that the book was a legitimate book for the university library to hold and that the action of the police was a serious infringement of [[academic freedom]]. The Vice-Chancellor was interviewed by the police, under caution, with a view to prosecution under the terms of the [[Obscene Publications Acts|Obscene Publications Act]], which defines obscenity as material that is likely to deprave and corrupt. The police focused on one particular image, 'Jim and Tom, Sausalito 1977', which depicts one man [[urolagnia|urinating into the mouth of another]].\n\nAfter the interview with the Vice-Chancellor, a file was sent to the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] as the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) has to take the decision as to whether or not to proceed with a trial. After a delay of about six months, the affair came to an end when the DPP informed Knight that no action would be taken as \"there was insufficient evidence to support a successful prosecution on this occasion\". The original book was returned, in a slightly tattered state, and restored to the university library.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |title=After a year out on loan Mapplethorpe book is set to return to library shelves |date=10 August 1999 |accessdate=6 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823022442/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |archivedate=23 August 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Partner institutions===\n[[File:Matthew Boulton College.jpg|thumb|right|[[Birmingham Metropolitan College]], one of the university's partner institutions]]\nThe university runs access and foundation programmes through an international network of associated universities and further education colleges.\n\n==Academic profile==\n\n===Research===\nThe university has five Centres of Research Excellence, which are the main focus of its research activity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bcu.ac.uk/research/index.html |title=Research |publisher=Birmingham City University |accessdate=6 March 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301112436/http://www.bcu.ac.uk/research/index.html |archivedate=1 March 2008 }}</ref> Following the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] conducted by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]], the ''[[Birmingham Post]]'' reported that more than 70 per cent of research work submitted by Birmingham City University\u2014including in business and management studies, education, English, social work and social policy, and town and country planning\u2014was \"officially recognised as of an international standard\", and 15 per cent of that work was \"rated as world leading\".

The home screen can be configured where the apps are enlarged, showing 4 columns and 5 rows in portrait mode and 5 columns and 4 rows in landscape mode. Enlarging the apps on the home screen will remove the feature where the [[Widget|widgets]] squish in from the right. Instead, the [[Widget|widgets]] will slide in on top of the applications. The first page of the home screen can be configured to show a column of [[Widget|widgets]] next to the applications without having to open them for easy access. Spotlight Search is no longer part of the widgets, but can still be accessed by swiping down from the center of the home screen or by pressing Command + Space on a connected keyboard.\n\n=== Multitasking ===\n\niPadOS features a multitasking system developed with more capabilities compared to iOS, with features like Slide Over and Split View that make it possible to use multiple different applications simultaneously. Double-clicking the Home Button or swiping up from the bottom of the screen and pausing will display all currently active spaces. Each space can feature a single app, or a Split View featuring two apps. The user can also swipe left or right on the Home Indicator to go between spaces at any time, or swipe left/right with four fingers.\n\nWhile using an app, swiping up slightly from the bottom edge of the screen will summon the Dock, where apps stored within can be dragged to different areas of the current space to be opened in either Split View or Slide Over. Dragging an app to the left or right edge of the screen will create a Split View, which will allow both apps to be used side-by-side. The size of the two apps in Split View can be adjusted by dragging a pill shaped icon in the center of the vertical divider and dragging the divider all the way to one side of the screen closes the respective app. If the user drags an app from the dock over the current app, it will create a floating window called Slide Over which can be dragged to either the left or right side of the screen. A Slide Over window can be hidden by swiping it off the right side of the screen, and swiping left from the right edge of the screen will restore it. Slide Over apps can also be cycled between by swiping left or right on the Home Indicator in the Slide Over window and pulling up on it will open an app switcher for Slide Over windows. A pill shaped icon at the top of apps in Split View or Slide Over allows them to be switched in an out of Split View and Slide Over.\n\nThe user can now have several instances of a single app open at once. A new [[Mission Control (macOS)|Expos\u00e9]] mode has been added which allows the user to see all of the instances of an app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cultofmac.com/629606/ipados-app-windows/|title=iPadOS lets you open multiple instances of the same app for powerful multitasking|date=June 6, 2019|website=Cult of Mac|access-date=August 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn many applications, a notable exception being [[YouTube]], videos can be shrunk down into a picture-in-picture window so the user can continue watching it while using other apps. This window containing the video can be resized by pinching and spreading and can be docked to any of the four corners of the screen. It can also be hidden by swiping it off the side of the screen and is denoted by an arrow at the edge where the video is hidden and swiping it will bring it back onscreen.\n\n=== Safari ===\niPadOS Safari now shows desktop versions of websites by default, includes a [[download manager]], and has 30 new [[keyboard shortcut]]s if an external keyboard is connected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/06/safari-on-ipados-optimized-for-desktop-websites/|title=Safari on iPadOS Optimized to Work With at Least Some Desktop Versions of Websites|last=Hardwick|first=Tim|website=[[MacRumors]]|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imore.com/ipados-preview-desktop-class-safari-download-manager-and-more|title=iPadOS Preview: Desktop-class Safari, Download Manager, and more!|date=July 18, 2019|website=[[iMore]]|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650197/apple-ipad-os-ipados-multitasking-homescreen-features-wwdc-2019|title=Apple reveals iPadOS for iPad with a new home screen, multitasking improvements, and more|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=June 3, 2019|website=[[The Verge]]|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/ipados|title=iPadOS: public beta, release date and features list|last=Lumb|first=David|last2=Tablets|first2=John McCann 2019-07-09T13:32:07Z|website=[[TechRadar]]|access-date=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Sidecar ===\nSidecar allows for an iPad to function as a [[Multi-monitor|second monitor]] for [[macOS]] and is named as such due to the setup's resemblance to [[Sidecar|articulated motorcycles]].

To emphasize the different feature set available on the iPad, at WWDC 2019 Apple announced that the variant of iOS that runs on iPad devices would be rebranded as \"iPadOS\". The new naming strategy began with iPadOS 13, in 2019.<ref name = AppleInsider />\n\n== Updates ==\n\n=== iPadOS 13 ===\n\nThe releases of iPadOS began with 13.1; there was no 13.0 release.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The home screen can be configured where the apps are enlarged, showing 4 columns and 5 rows in portrait mode and 5 columns and 4 rows in landscape mode. Enlarging the apps on the home screen will remove the feature where the widgets squish in from the right. Instead, the widgets will slide in on top of the apps. The first page of the home screen can be configured to show a column of widgets next to the applications without having to open them for easy access. Spotlight Search is no longer part of the widgets, but can still be accessed by swiping down from the center of the home screen or by pressing Command + Space on a connected keyboard.\n\n=== Multitasking ===\n\niPadOS features a multitasking system developed with more capabilities compared to iOS, with features like Slide Over and Split View that make it possible to use multiple different applications simultaneously. Double-clicking the Home Button or swiping up from the bottom of the screen and pausing will display all currently active spaces. Each space can feature a single app, or a Split View featuring two apps. The user can also swipe left or right on the Home Indicator to go between spaces at any time, or swipe left/right with four fingers.\n\nWhile using an app, swiping up slightly from the bottom edge of the screen will summon the Dock, where apps stored within can be dragged to different areas of the current space to be opened in either Split View or Slide Over. Dragging an app to the left or right edge of the screen will create a Split View, which will allow both apps to be used side-by-side. The size of the two apps in Split View can be adjusted by dragging a pill shaped icon in the center of the vertical divider and dragging the divider all the way to one side of the screen closes the respective app. If the user drags an app from the dock over the current app, it will create a floating window called Slide Over which can be dragged to either the left or right side of the screen. A Slide Over window can be hidden by swiping it off the right side of the screen, and swiping left from the right edge of the screen will restore it. Slide Over apps can also be cycled between by swiping left or right on the Home Indicator in the Slide Over window and pulling up on it will open an app switcher for Slide Over windows. A pill shaped icon at the top of apps in Split View or Slide Over allows them to be switched in an out of Split View and Slide Over.\n\nThe user can now have several instances of a single app open at once. A new [[Mission Control (macOS)|Expos\u00e9]] mode has been added which allows the user to see all of the instances of an app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cultofmac.com/629606/ipados-app-windows/|title=iPadOS lets you open multiple instances of the same app for powerful multitasking|date=June 6, 2019|website=Cult of Mac|access-date=August 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn many applications, a notable exception being [[YouTube]], videos can be shrunk down into a picture-in-picture window so the user can continue watching it while using other apps. This window containing the video can be resized by pinching and spreading and can be docked to any of the four corners of the screen. It can also be hidden by swiping it off the side of the screen and is denoted by an arrow at the edge where the video is hidden and swiping it will bring it back onscreen.\n\n=== Safari ===\niPadOS Safari now shows desktop versions of websites by default, includes a [[download manager]], and has 30 new [[keyboard shortcut]]s if an external keyboard is connected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/06/safari-on-ipados-optimized-for-desktop-websites/|title=Safari on iPadOS Optimized to Work With at Least Some Desktop Versions of Websites|last=Hardwick|first=Tim|website=[[MacRumors]]|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imore.com/ipados-preview-desktop-class-safari-download-manager-and-more|title=iPadOS Preview: Desktop-class Safari, Download Manager, and more!|date=July 18, 2019|website=[[iMore]]|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650197/apple-ipad-os-ipados-multitasking-homescreen-features-wwdc-2019|title=Apple reveals iPadOS for iPad with a new home screen, multitasking improvements, and more|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=June 3, 2019|website=[[The Verge]]|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techradar.com/news/ipados|title=iPadOS: public beta, release date and features list|last=Lumb|first=David|last2=Tablets|first2=John McCann 2019-07-09T13:32:07Z|website=[[TechRadar]]|access-date=August 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Sidecar ===\nSidecar allows for an iPad to function as a [[Multi-monitor|second monitor]] for [[macOS]] and is named as such due to the setup's resemblance to [[Sidecar|articulated motorcycles]].

It was the 46th staging of [[Masters (snooker)|the Masters]] tournament, which was first held in [[1975 Masters (snooker)|1975]] and the second of three [[Triple Crown (snooker)|Triple Crown]] events in the [[2019\u201320 snooker season|2019\u201320 season]], following the [[2019 UK Championship]] and preceding the [[2020 World Snooker Championship]]. The event featured the top 16 players from the [[snooker world rankings]] in a [[single-elimination tournament]]. It was organised by the [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] and was broadcast by the [[BBC]] and [[Eurosport]] in Europe.\n\nThe defending champion was [[Judd Trump]] who had defeated [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]] 10\u20134 in the final of the [[2019 Masters (snooker)|previous year's event]]. In defence of his title, Trump lost to [[Shaun Murphy]] 3\u20136 in the first round. O'Sullivan was eligible to compete in the event, but chose not to participate; his entry was given to [[Ali Carter]], who reached the final where he played [[Stuart Bingham]]. Recovering from 5\u20137 behind, Bingham won the final 10\u20138 to claim his first Masters title. He became the oldest Masters champion at age&nbsp;43, beating the previous record set by [[Ray Reardon]] in [[1976 Masters (snooker)|1976]].\n\nIn winning the event, Bingham won [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]250,000 from a total prize pool of \u00a3725,000. The tournament featured a total of 18 [[century break]]s; the highest break was a 144 compiled by [[David Gilbert (snooker player)|David Gilbert]] in the quarter-finals, for which he won \u00a315,000.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Ali Carter breaking off Masters final 2020.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of a crowd behind a snooker table|The setup inside the [[Alexandra Palace]] during the tournament]]\n[[Masters (snooker)|The Masters]] is an invitational tournament that was first held in [[1975 Masters (snooker)|1975]], with the top-16 players from the snooker world rankings being invited to participate.<ref name=\"hYf7Y\" /><ref name=\"bbc._Mast\" /> The 2020 Masters was the second [[Triple Crown (snooker)|Triple Crown]] event of the [[2019\u201320 snooker season]], following the [[2019 UK Championship]] and preceding the [[2020 World Snooker Championship]].<ref name=\"2pMvO\" /> The event was  held between 12 and 19&nbsp;January 2020.<ref name=\"radi_Mast\" /> The defending champion [[Judd Trump]], who won the [[2019 Masters (snooker)|2019 Masters]], was [[Seed (sports)|seeded]] first for the event; the remaining places were allocated according to the [[Snooker world rankings 2019/2020|world rankings]] after the UK Championship in December 2019.
