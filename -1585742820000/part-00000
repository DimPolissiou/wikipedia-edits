The consequences of the war lingered well into the second half of the decade, with a war-weary Europe divided between the jostling spheres of influence of the [[Western world]] and the [[Soviet Union]], leading to the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. To some degree internal and external tensions in the [[post-war]] era were managed by new institutions, including the [[United Nations]], the [[welfare state]], and the [[Bretton Woods system]], facilitating the [[post\u2013World War II economic expansion]], which lasted well into the 1970s. The conditions of the post-war world encouraged [[decolonization]] and the emergence of new states and governments, with [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Israel]], [[Vietnam]], and others declaring independence, although rarely without bloodshed. The decade also witnessed the early beginnings of new technologies (such as [[computer]]s, [[nuclear power]], and [[jet engine|jet propulsion]]), often first developed in tandem with the war effort, and later adapted and improved upon in the post-war era.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Politics and wars==\n\n=== Wars ===\n[[File:EasternFrontWWIIcolage.png|right|thumb|250px|[[World War II]]]]\n[[File:German Reich 1942.svg|220px|thumb|In Green: {{flag|Nazi Germany|name=German Reich}} at its peak (1942):\n{{legend|#336733|[[:en:Nazi Germany|Germany]]}}\n{{legend|#55c255|Civilian-administered occupied territories ''([[:en:Reichskommissariat|Reichskommissariat]]'' and [[:en:General Government|General Government]])}}\n{{legend|#a5dfa5|Military-administered occupied territories ''([[:en:Military Administration (Nazi Germany)|Milit\u00e4rverwaltung]])''}}]]\n* [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945)\n** [[Nazi Germany]] invades [[Poland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Benelux]], and the [[French Third Republic]] from 1939 to 1941.\n** [[Soviet Union]] invades [[Poland]], [[Finland]], occupies [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]] and Romanian region of [[Bessarabia]] from 1939 to 1941.\n** Germany faces the [[United Kingdom]] in the [[Battle of Britain]] (1940).

Hollywood was instrumental in producing dozens of classic films during the 1940s, several of which were about the war and some are on most lists of all-time great films. [[European cinema]] survived although obviously curtailed during wartime and yet many films of high quality were made in the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Cinema of France|France]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]], the [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] and elsewhere in Europe. The [[cinema of Japan]] also survived.

Films such as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' and ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' are considered classics and helped launch the careers of legendary actors such as [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ava Gardner]]. The genre has been widely copied since its initial inception.\n\nIn France during the war the tour de force ''[[Children of Paradise]]'' directed by [[Marcel Carn\u00e9]] (1945), was shot in Nazi occupied Paris.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/Films-Dr-Ex/Les-Enfants-du-Paradis.html DeWitt Bodeen, ''Les Enfants du Paradis'', filmreference.com]</ref><ref>[http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/les_enfants_du_paradis.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113153911/http://www.eufs.org.uk/films/les_enfants_du_paradis.html |date=2009-01-13 }} Gio MacDonald, Edinburgh University Film Society program notes, 1994\u201395</ref><ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20020106/REVIEWS08/201060301/1023 Quoted by Roger Ebert, ''Children of Paradise'', ''Chicago Sun-Times'', 6 January 2002 review of the Criterion DVD release]</ref> Memorable films from post-war England include [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]]) and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'' ([[1948 in film|1948]]), Carol Reed's ''[[Odd Man Out]]'' ([[1947 in film|1947]]) and ''[[The Third Man]]'' ([[1949 in film|1949]]), and [[Powell and Pressburger]]'s ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]]), ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]]) and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' ([[1948 in film|1948]]), [[Laurence Olivier]]'s ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'', the first non-American film to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' ([[1949 in film|1949]]) directed by [[Robert Hamer]]. [[Italian neorealism]] of the 1940s produced poignant movies made in post-war Italy. ''[[Roma, citt\u00e0 aperta]]'' directed by [[Roberto Rossellini]] (1945), ''[[Sciusci\u00e0]]'' directed by [[Vittorio De Sica]] (1946), ''[[Pais\u00e0]]'' directed by Roberto Rossellini (1946), ''[[La terra trema]]'' directed by [[Luchino Visconti]] (1948), ''[[The Bicycle Thief]]'' directed by [[Vittorio De Sica]] (1948), and ''[[Bitter Rice]]'' directed by [[Giuseppe De Santis]] (1949), are some well-known examples.\n\nIn Japanese cinema, ''[[The 47 Ronin (1941 film)|The 47 Ronin]]'' is a 1941 black and white two-part [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese film]] directed by [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]. ''[[The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail]]'' (1945), and the post-war ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), and ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' (1949), directed by [[Akira Kurosawa]] are considered important early works leading to his first masterpieces of the 1950s. ''Drunken Angel'' (1948), marked the beginning of the successful collaboration between Kurosawa and actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] that lasted until 1965.\n\n===Music===\n{{expand section|date=July 2018}}\n{{Main|1940s in music}}\n[[File:Frank Sinatra in Till the Clouds Roll By.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Frank Sinatra]] gained massive popularity during the decade, becoming one of the first [[teen idol]]s, and one of the pop artists who sold the most records in the 1940s]]\n* The most popular music style during the 1940s was [[swing music|swing]], which prevailed during World War II. In the later periods of the 1940s, less swing was prominent and crooners like [[Frank Sinatra]], along with genres such as bebop and the earliest traces of rock and roll, were the prevalent genre.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|List of years in literature|List of years in poetry}}\n* [[For Whom the Bell Tolls]] by [[Ernest Hemingway]] in 1940.\n* [[The Myth of Sisyphus]] by [[Albert Camus]] in 1942.\n* [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]] by [[Albert Camus]] in 1942.\n* [[The Little Prince]] by [[Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry]] in 1943.\n* [[Anti-Semite and Jew]] by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in 1943.\n* [[The Fountainhead]] by [[Ayn Rand]] in 1943.\n* [[No Exit]] by [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in 1944.\n* [[Pippi Longstocking (book)|Pippi Longstocking]] by [[Astrid Lindgren]] in 1945.\n* [[The Diary of a Young Girl|The Diary of Anne Frank]] by [[Anne Frank]] in 1947.\n* [[Death of a Salesman]] by [[Arthur Miller]] in 1949.\n* [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]] by [[George Orwell]] in 1949.\n* [[The Glass Menagerie]] by [[Tennessee Williams]] in 1944.\n\n===Fashion===\n\nAs the 1940s went through times of hardship during and after WWII, the solution was significant rationing and fashion items and fabrics were no exception. Fashion became more utilitarian or function and comfortability over style. Besides this rationing, as a tribute, women's fashion also changed to reflect that and it was seen in the new silhouette that is featured suits. In order to feminize this, certain elements were added such as the straight knee-length skirts and accessories to complete the look. Even with the challenges imposed by shortages in rayon, nylon, wool, leather, rubber, metal (for snaps, buckles, and embellishments), and even the amount of fabric that could be used in any one garment, the fashion industry's wheels kept chugging slowly along, producing what it could. After the fall of France in 1940, Hollywood drove fashion in the United States almost entirely, with the exception of a few trends coming from war torn London in 1944 and 1945, as America's own rationing hit full force, and the idea of function seemed to overtake fashion, if only for a few short months until the end of the war. Fabrics shifted dramatically as rationing and wartime shortages controlled import items such as silk and furs. Floral prints seem to dominate the early 1940s, with the mid-to-late 1940s also seeing what is sometimes referred to as \"atomic prints\" or geometric patterns and shapes. The color of fashion seemed to even go to war, with patriotic nautical themes and dark greens and khakis dominating the color palettes, as trousers and wedges slowly replaced the dresses and more traditional heels due to shortages in stockings and gasoline. The most common characteristics of this fashion were the straight skirt, pleats, front fullness, squared shoulders with v-necks or high necks, slim sleeves and the most favorited necklines were sailor, mandarin and scalloped.\n\n<ref>http://www.womeninwwii.com/fashion/1940sfashion.asp</ref>\n{{See also|1930\u20131945 in fashion|1945\u20131960 in fashion}}\n\n==People==\n\n===Notable world leaders===\nThis is a list of leaders of states.

During [[World War II]] in the United States [[List of Heavyweight Champions|Heavyweight Boxing Champion]] [[Joe Louis]] and numerous stars and performers from American baseball and other sports served in the armed forces until the end of the war. Among the many baseball players (including well known stars) who served during World War II were [[Moe Berg]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Bob Feller]], [[Hank Greenberg]], [[Stan Musial]] (in 1945), [[Warren Spahn]], and [[Ted Williams]]. They like many others sacrificed their personal and valuable career time for the benefit and well being of the rest of society.

After the war many players returned to their teams, while the major event of the second half of the 1940s was the 1945 signing of [[Jackie Robinson]] to a players contract by [[Branch Rickey]] the general manager of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].

In 1936, he lost an important 12 round fight (his first loss) to the German boxer [[Max Schmeling]] and he vowed to meet Schmeling once again in the ring. Louis' comeback bout against Schmeling became an international symbol of the struggle between the US and democracy against Nazism and Fascism. When on June 22, 1938, Louis knocked Schmeling out in the first few seconds of the first round during their rematch at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], his sensational comeback victory riveted the entire nation. Louis enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]] on January 10, 1942, in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Louis' cultural impact was felt well outside the ring. He is widely regarded as the first [[African American]] to achieve the status of a nationwide hero within the United States, and was also a focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during [[World War II]].<ref name=matters>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4qYeafQzMC&pg=PA64&dq=isbn=9780814798829 |location=New York |title=Sports Matters: Race, Recreation, and Culture |editor=John Bloom |editor2=Michael Nevin Willard |year=2002 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=978-0-8147-9882-9 |pages=46\u201347 |author1=Bloom, John |author2=Willard, Michael Nevin}}</ref>\n*[[Buddy Baer]]\n*[[Ezzard Charles]]\n*[[Billy Conn]]\n*[[Rocky Graziano]]\n*[[Joe Louis]]\n*[[Sugar Ray Robinson]]\n*[[Max Schmeling]]\n*[[Jersey Joe Walcott]]\n*[[Tony Zale]]\n\n====Track and Field====\n\n==See also==\n* [[1940s in television]]\n* [[List of years in literature#1940s|1940s in literature]]\n\n===Timeline===\nThe following articles contain brief timelines listing the most prominent events of the decade.\n*[[1940]] \u2022 [[1941]] \u2022 [[1942]] \u2022 [[1943]] \u2022 [[1944]] \u2022 [[1945]] \u2022 [[1946]] \u2022 [[1947]] \u2022 [[1948]] \u2022 [[1949]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Lewis, Thomas Tandy, ed.

The consequences of the war lingered well into the second half of the decade, with a war-weary Europe divided between the jostling spheres of influence of the [[Western world]] and the [[Soviet Union]], leading to the beginning of the [[Cold War]]. To some degree internal and external tensions in the [[post-war]] era were managed by new institutions, including the [[United Nations]], the [[welfare state]], and the [[Bretton Woods system]], facilitating the [[post\u2013World War II economic expansion]], which lasted well into the 1970s. The conditions of the post-war world encouraged [[decolonization]] and the emergence of new states and governments, with [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Israel]], [[Vietnam]], and others declaring independence, although rarely without bloodshed. The decade also witnessed the early beginnings of new technologies (such as [[computer]]s, [[nuclear power]], and [[jet engine|jet propulsion]]), often first developed in tandem with the war effort, and later adapted and improved upon in the post-war era.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Politics and wars==\n\n=== Wars ===\n[[File:EasternFrontWWIIcolage.png|right|thumb|250px|[[World War II]]]]\n[[File:German Reich 1942.svg|220px|thumb|In Green: {{flag|Nazi Germany|name=German Reich}} at its peak (1942):\n{{legend|#336733|[[:en:Nazi Germany|Germany]]}}\n{{legend|#55c255|Civilian-administered occupied territories ''([[:en:Reichskommissariat|Reichskommissariat]]'' and [[:en:General Government|General Government]])}}\n{{legend|#a5dfa5|Military-administered occupied territories ''([[:en:Military Administration (Nazi Germany)|Milit\u00e4rverwaltung]])''}}]]\n* [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945)\n** [[Nazi Germany]] invades [[Poland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Benelux]], and the [[French Third Republic]] from 1939 to 1941.\n** [[Soviet Union]] invades [[Poland]], [[Finland]], occupies [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Lithuania]] and Romanian region of [[Bessarabia]] from 1939 to 1941.\n** Germany faces the [[United Kingdom]] in the [[Battle of Britain]] (1940).

Hollywood was instrumental in producing dozens of classic films during the 1940s, several of which were about the war and some are on most lists of all-time great films. [[European cinema]] survived although obviously curtailed during wartime and yet many films of high quality were made in the [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], [[Cinema of France|France]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]], the [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] and elsewhere in Europe. The [[cinema of Japan]] also survived. [[Akira Kurosawa]] and other directors managed to produce significant films during the 1940s.\n\nPolish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film Calling mr. Smith (1943) about current nazi crimes in occupied Europe during the war and about lies of nazi propaganda.<ref>https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAXbMp/rqGRLe9</ref>\n\n[[Film Noir]], a film style that incorporated crime dramas with dark images, became largely prevalent during the decade. Films such as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' and ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' are considered classics and helped launch the careers of legendary actors such as [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ava Gardner]].

Fashion became more utilitarian or function and comfortability over style. Besides this rationing, as a tribute, women's fashion also changed to reflect that and it was seen in the new silhouette that is featured suits. In order to feminize this, certain elements were added such as the straight knee-length skirts and accessories to complete the look. Even with the challenges imposed by shortages in rayon, nylon, wool, leather, rubber, metal (for snaps, buckles, and embellishments), and even the amount of fabric that could be used in any one garment, the fashion industry's wheels kept chugging slowly along, producing what it could. After the fall of France in 1940, Hollywood drove fashion in the United States almost entirely, with the exception of a few trends coming from war torn London in 1944 and 1945, as America's own rationing hit full force, and the idea of function seemed to overtake fashion, if only for a few short months until the end of the war. Fabrics shifted dramatically as rationing and wartime shortages controlled import items such as silk and furs. Floral prints seem to dominate the early 1940s, with the mid-to-late 1940s also seeing what is sometimes referred to as \"atomic prints\" or geometric patterns and shapes. The color of fashion seemed to even go to war, with patriotic nautical themes and dark greens and khakis dominating the color palettes, as trousers and wedges slowly replaced the dresses and more traditional heels due to shortages in stockings and gasoline. The most common characteristics of this fashion were the straight skirt, pleats, front fullness, squared shoulders with v-necks or high necks, slim sleeves and the most favorited necklines were sailor, mandarin and scalloped.\n\n<ref>http://www.womeninwwii.com/fashion/1940sfashion.asp</ref>\n{{See also|1930\u20131945 in fashion|1945\u20131960 in fashion}}\n\n==People==\n\n===Notable world leaders===\nThis is a list of leaders of states.

The 1940 and 1944 [[Olympic Games]] were cancelled because of [[World War II]]. During [[World War II]] in the United States [[List of Heavyweight Champions|Heavyweight Boxing Champion]] [[Joe Louis]] and numerous stars and performers from American baseball and other sports served in the armed forces until the end of the war. Among the many baseball players (including well known stars) who served during World War II were [[Moe Berg]], [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Bob Feller]], [[Hank Greenberg]], [[Stan Musial]] (in 1945), [[Warren Spahn]], and [[Ted Williams]]. They like many others sacrificed their personal and valuable career time for the benefit and well being of the rest of society. The Summer Olympics were resumed in 1948 in [[London]] and the Winter games were held that year in [[St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]].\n\nIn 1947, [[Wataru Misaka]] of the [[1947\u201348 New York Knicks season|New York Knicks]] became the first person of color to play in modern professional basketball, just months after [[Jackie Robinson]] had broke the color barrier in [[Major League Baseball]] for the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/sports/basketball/wat-misaka-dead.html|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Baseball====\n[[File:Baseball.

After the war many players returned to their teams, while the major event of the second half of the 1940s was the 1945 signing of [[Jackie Robinson]] to a players contract by [[Branch Rickey]] the general manager of the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]].

In 1936, he lost an important 12 round fight (his first loss) to the German boxer [[Max Schmeling]] and he vowed to meet Schmeling once again in the ring. Louis' comeback bout against Schmeling became an international symbol of the struggle between the US and democracy against Nazism and Fascism. When on June 22, 1938, Louis knocked Schmeling out in the first few seconds of the first round during their rematch at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], his sensational comeback victory riveted the entire nation. Louis enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]] on January 10, 1942, in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Louis' cultural impact was felt well outside the ring. He is widely regarded as the first [[African American]] to achieve the status of a nationwide hero within the United States, and was also a focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during [[World War II]].<ref name=matters>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kC4qYeafQzMC&pg=PA64&dq=isbn=9780814798829 |location=New York |title=Sports Matters: Race, Recreation, and Culture |editor=John Bloom |editor2=Michael Nevin Willard |year=2002 |publisher=New York University Press |isbn=978-0-8147-9882-9 |pages=46\u201347 |author1=Bloom, John |author2=Willard, Michael Nevin}}</ref>\n*[[Buddy Baer]]\n*[[Ezzard Charles]]\n*[[Billy Conn]]\n*[[Rocky Graziano]]\n*[[Joe Louis]]\n*[[Sugar Ray Robinson]]\n*[[Max Schmeling]]\n*[[Jersey Joe Walcott]]\n*[[Tony Zale]]\n\n====Track and Field====\n\n==See also==\n* [[1940s in television]]\n* [[List of years in literature#1940s|1940s in literature]]\n\n===Timeline===\nThe following articles contain brief timelines listing the most prominent events of the decade.\n*[[1940]] \u2022 [[1941]] \u2022 [[1942]] \u2022 [[1943]] \u2022 [[1944]] \u2022 [[1945]] \u2022 [[1946]] \u2022 [[1947]] \u2022 [[1948]] \u2022 [[1949]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Lewis, Thomas Tandy, ed.

If he had defects, they were generally overlooked by his audiences, who admired his upright and independent private life.

Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal.<ref>J. Boaden, ''The Life of Mrs. Jordan: Including Original Private Correspondence'', 2 vols (Edward Bull, London 1831), I, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2H4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 120-23] (Google).</ref> However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly. It was said that he prided himself on the reflection that he was never called upon to perform in an [[after-piece]], or to pass through a trapdoor in any entrance or exit on the stage.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref>\n\n===Charles Surface===\nSmith's masterpiece was his impersonation of Charles Surface in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', which won the highest praise for originality, boldness of conception, truth, freedom, ease, and gracefulness of action and manner.<ref>W. Hone, ''The Every-Day Book'' (London 1825), II, pp. 1287\u20131291.</ref> He is mentioned favourably in [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]'s ''[[Essays of Elia]]'':<blockquote>\"...it was then the fashion to cry down John Kemble, who took the part after Smith; but, I thought, very unjustly. Smith, I fancy, was more airy, and took the eye with a certain gaiety of person. He brought with him no sombre recollections of tragedy. He had not to expiate the fault of having pleased beforehand in lofty declamation. He had no sins of Hamlet or of Richard to atone for. His failure in these parts was a passport to success in one of so opposite a tendency.\"<ref>C. Lamb, 'On the artificial comedy of the last century', in ''Essays of Elia'' ed. A. Ainger (Macmillan and Co. Ltd., London 1910), pp. 192-201, [https://archive.org/details/essaysofelia00lambrich/page/200/mode/2up at p. 200] (Internet Archive).</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 9 March 1788, after a performance of [[Hamlet]], Smith announced his intention to retire and \"resign the sprightly Charles to abler hands and younger heads\". After a performance of the role on 9 June 1788, he gave his farewell speech, though he did appear once more in 1798 in a benefit performance for his friend [[Thomas King (actor)|Thomas King]], when, 'having grown very lusty, he went through the character with that spirit, ease, and elegance, for which he was unequalled.'<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and retirement==\nIn his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref> He first married the sister of the [[Earl of Sandwich]], Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of [[Leiston]] in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to [[Hamlet Watling]], whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith's<ref>Hamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, [[Ipswich Museum]], Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.</ref>). Smith died at [[Bury St Edmunds]] on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year. There his elegant figure was remembered as always wearing a white hat edged with green, a blue coat, figured waistcoat, fustian coloured breeches, and gaiters to match, and carrying a gold-headed cane. He was loved by the youngsters of Bury whom he often obliged with sweets from the candy-shop.<ref>W.

The poet [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Charles Churchill]], in his \"Rosciad\" satire of 1761, said of him: \"Smith the genteel, the airy, and the smart; Smith was just gone to school to say his part.\"<ref>C. Churchill, ''The Rosciad'' Fifth edition (Author, London 1771), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eQ4UAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 20] (Google).</ref> Smith was at Covent Garden for 22 years.\n\n===Drury Lane 1774\u20131788===\nAt the end of season in 1774 he and the actress [[Elizabeth Hartley (actress)|Elizabeth Hartley]], who played his on-stage lover in ''Henry II or The Fall of Rosamond'', caused a scandal when they absconded to France.

Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal.<ref>J. Boaden, ''The Life of Mrs. Jordan: Including Original Private Correspondence'', 2 vols (Edward Bull, London 1831), I, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2H4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 120-23] (Google).</ref> However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly. It was said that he prided himself on the reflection that he was never called upon to perform in an [[after-piece]], or to pass through a trapdoor in any entrance or exit on the stage.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref>\n\n===Charles Surface===\nSmith's masterpiece was his impersonation of Charles Surface in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', which won the highest praise for originality, boldness of conception, truth, freedom, ease, and gracefulness of action and manner.<ref>W. Hone, ''The Every-Day Book'' (London 1825), II, pp. 1287\u20131291.</ref> He is mentioned favourably in [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]'s ''[[Essays of Elia]]'':<blockquote>\"...it was then the fashion to cry down John Kemble, who took the part after Smith; but, I thought, very unjustly. Smith, I fancy, was more airy, and took the eye with a certain gaiety of person. He brought with him no sombre recollections of tragedy. He had not to expiate the fault of having pleased beforehand in lofty declamation. He had no sins of Hamlet or of Richard to atone for. His failure in these parts was a passport to success in one of so opposite a tendency.\"<ref>C. Lamb, 'On the artificial comedy of the last century', in ''Essays of Elia'' ed. A. Ainger (Macmillan and Co. Ltd., London 1910), pp. 192-201, [https://archive.org/details/essaysofelia00lambrich/page/200/mode/2up at p. 200] (Internet Archive).</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 9 March 1788, after a performance of [[Hamlet]], Smith announced his intention to retire and \"resign the sprightly Charles to abler hands and younger heads\". After a performance of the role on 9 June 1788, he gave his farewell speech, though he did appear once more in 1798 in a benefit performance for his friend [[Thomas King (actor)|Thomas King]], when, 'having grown very lusty, he went through the character with that spirit, ease, and elegance, for which he was unequalled.'<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>\n\n==Personal life and retirement==\nIn his early days, Smith was often distracted from his professional work by his love of fox-hunting.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref> He first married the sister of the [[Earl of Sandwich]], Mrs Kelland Courtnay (a widow), who died in 1762. His elopement to Ireland with Elizabeth Hartley followed. In later life he was remarried, to Miss Newson of [[Leiston]] in Suffolk. (Through the second marriage in the Newson family is traced a relationship to [[Hamlet Watling]], whose brother Edwin also married a daughter of Smith's<ref>Hamlet Watling, 'Suffolk Heraldry & Genealogy in 12 Vols' (MS, [[Ipswich Museum]], Christchurch Mansion) Vol 8.</ref>). Smith died at [[Bury St Edmunds]] on 13 September 1819 in his 89th year. There his elegant figure was remembered as always wearing a white hat edged with green, a blue coat, figured waistcoat, fustian coloured breeches, and gaiters to match, and carrying a gold-headed cane. He was loved by the youngsters of Bury whom he often obliged with sweets from the candy-shop.<ref>W.
