He helped end the [[My Lai Massacre]] of the South Vietnamese village known as [[S\u01a1n M\u1ef9]] on March 16, 1968.\n\nDuring the massacre, Thompson and his [[Hiller OH-23 Raven]] crew, [[Glenn Andreotta]] and [[Lawrence Colburn]], stopped a number of killings by threatening and blocking American officers and enlisted soldiers of Company C, 1st Battalion, [[20th Infantry Regiment (United States)|20th Infantry Regiment]], 11th Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division. Additionally, Thompson and his crew saved a number of Vietnamese civilians by personally escorting them away from advancing United States Army ground units and assuring their evacuation by air. Thompson reported the atrocities by radio several times while at S\u01a1n M\u1ef9. Although these reports reached [[Task Force Barker]] operational headquarters, nothing was done to stop the massacre. After evacuating a child to a Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i hospital, Thompson angrily reported to his superiors at Task Force Barker headquarters that a massacre was occurring at S\u01a1n M\u1ef9. Immediately following Thompson's report, Lieutenant Colonel [[Frank A. Barker]] ordered all ground units in S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 to cease [[search and destroy]] operations in the village.\n\nIn 1970, Thompson testified against those responsible for the My Lai Massacre. Twenty-six officers and enlisted soldiers, including [[William Calley]] and [[Ernest Medina]], were charged with criminal offenses, but all were either acquitted or pardoned. Thompson was condemned and ostracized by many individuals in the United States military and government, as well as the public, for his role in the investigations and trials concerning the My Lai massacre. As a direct result of what he experienced, Thompson experienced [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[alcoholism]], [[divorce]], and severe [[nightmare disorder]].<ref name=\"NPR\">{{cite news |last1=Ulaby |first1=Neda |title=50 Years After The My Lai Massacre, An Opera Confronts The Past |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/03/17/593992434/50-years-after-the-my-lai-massacre-an-opera-confronts-the-past |accessdate=14 September 2018 |work=NPR |date=17 March 2018}}</ref> Despite the adversity he faced, he remained in the [[United States Army]] until November 1, 1983, then continued to make a living as a helicopter pilot in the [[Southeastern United States]].\n\nIn 1998, 30 years after the massacre, Thompson and the two other members of his crew, Andreotta and Colburn, were awarded the [[Soldier's Medal]] (Andreotta posthumously), the United States Army's highest award for bravery not involving direct contact with the enemy.<ref name=\"resource1998\">{{Citation |journal = The Congressional Record (Senate) |year = 1998 |title = Additional Statements |url = http://bulk.resource.org/gpo.gov/record/1998/1998_S01709.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229153345/http://bulk.resource.org/gpo.gov/record/1998/1998_S01709.pdf|url-status = dead|archive-date = 2008-02-29}}</ref> Thompson and Colburn returned to S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 to meet with survivors of the massacre at the [[S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 Memorial]] in 1998.

Everywhere we'd look, we'd see bodies. These were infants, two-, three-, four-, five-year-olds, women, very old men, no draft-age people whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"The Heroes of My Lai\"/>\n\nThompson and his crew, who at first thought the artillery bombardment caused all the civilian deaths on the ground, became aware that Americans were murdering the villagers after a wounded civilian woman they requested medical evacuation for, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T\u1ea9u (ch\u00edn T\u1ea9u), was murdered right in front of them by Captain Medina, the commanding officer of the operation.

We were hovering six feet off the ground not more than twenty feet away when Captain Medina came over, kicked her, stepped back, and finished her off. He did it right in front of us. When we saw Medina do that, it clicked. It was our guys doing the killing.<ref name=\"historyisaweapon.com\" /> }}\n\nImmediately after the execution, Thompson discovered the irrigation ditch full of Calley's victims. Thompson then radioed a message to accompanying gunships and Task Force Barker headquarters, \"It looks to me like there's an awful lot of unnecessary killing going on down there.

They spotted a group of women, children, and old men in the northeast corner of the village fleeing from advancing soldiers from the 2nd Platoon, Company C. Immediately realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese civilians, Thompson landed his helicopter between the advancing ground unit and the villagers.<ref name=Angers />{{RP|79}} He turned to Colburn and Andreotta and ordered them to shoot the men in the 2nd Platoon if they attempted to kill any of the fleeing civilians.<ref name=Angers />{{RP|81}} While Colburn and Andreotta focused their guns on the 2nd Platoon, Thompson located as many civilians as he could, persuaded them to follow him to a safer location, and ensured their evacuation with the help of two [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Huey]] pilots he was friends with.<ref name=Bilton />{{rp|138\u2013139}}\n\nLow on fuel, Thompson was forced to return to a supply airstrip miles outside the village. Before they departed the village, Andreotta spotted movement in the irrigation ditch full of bodies. According to Trent Angers in ''The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story'' (2014),\n\n{{blockquote|The helicopter looped around then set down quickly near the edge of the ditch. Andreotta had maintained visual contact with the spot where he saw the movement, and he darted out of the aircraft as soon as it touched the ground.

He retired from the army in 1983.\n\n==Post-military life==\nThompson became a helicopter pilot for the oil industry, operating in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1988 an English documentary film producer, Michael Bilton, working for [[Yorkshire Television]], managed to contact Thompson via his mother, who was then widowed and living in Texas. At that point Thompson had all but disappeared from public life. Bilton had contacted former crew member [[Lawrence Colburn]], and put Thompson and Colburn in touch with each other after a gap of nearly 16 years. Both Thompson and Colburn had been trying to find each other, but without success. Thompson was living in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Colburn near Atlanta, Georgia. They quickly arranged a reunion. Bilton spent a long weekend with Thompson discussing the events at My Lai. It proved the beginning of a long friendship which lasted until Thompson's death.\n\nBoth Thompson and Colburn were interviewed for the film ''[[Four Hours in My Lai]]'' (1989) (''Remember My Lai?'' on PBS) \u2013 which went on to win a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Academy Award]] and an international [[Emmy]] award. The interview showed Thompson relating what he had witnessed at My Lai: \"Here we were supposed to be the guys in the white hats. It upset me\".<ref>\"My Lai: A Half Told Story\", ''London Sunday Times Magazine'', pp. 28\u201329, 23rd April, 1989.</ref> Bilton and his colleague Kevin Sim then began researching a book and Bilton conducted further interviews with Thompson and Colburn. When the book ''Four Hours in My Lai'' (1992) was published, it prompted a campaign to have the heroism of Thompson and his helicopter crew recognised. Several senior figures in the U.S. military supported the campaign, as did President [[George H. W. Bush]]. Thompson and Colburn were invited to speak to a wide range of audiences about the ethics of warfare including at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], a conference in Norway, and at Connecticut College in New London, where they were each awarded an honorary doctorate.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/07/national/07thompson.html|title=Hugh Thompson, 62; Saved Civilians at My Lai|date=7 January 2006|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Thompson and Colburn returned to the village of S\u01a1n M\u1ef9, where they met some of the people they saved during the killings, including Thi Nhung and Pham Thi Nhanh, two women who had been part of the group about to be killed by Brooks's 2nd Platoon.<ref name=Angers />{{RP|77}} Thompson said to the survivors, \"I just wish our crew that day could have helped more people than we did.\"<ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite news|title='Blood and fire' of My Lai remembered 30 years later|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9803/16/my.lai/|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=2015-02-15}}</ref> He reported that one of the women they had helped out came up to him and asked, \"Why didn't the people who committed these acts come back with you?\" He said that he was \"just devastated\" but that she finished her sentence: \"So we could forgive them.\" He later told a reporter, \"I'm not man enough to do that.

Additionally, Thompson and his crew saved a number of Vietnamese civilians by personally escorting them away from advancing United States Army ground units and assuring their evacuation by air. Thompson reported the atrocities by radio several times while at S\u01a1n M\u1ef9. Although these reports reached [[Task Force Barker]] operational headquarters, nothing was done to stop the massacre. After evacuating a child to a Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i hospital, Thompson angrily reported to his superiors at Task Force Barker headquarters that a massacre was occurring at S\u01a1n M\u1ef9. Immediately following Thompson's report, Lieutenant Colonel [[Frank A. Barker]] ordered all ground units in S\u01a1n M\u1ef9 to cease [[search and destroy]] operations in the village.\n\nIn 1970, Thompson testified against those responsible for the My Lai Massacre. Twenty-six officers and enlisted soldiers, including [[William Calley]] and [[Ernest Medina]], were charged with criminal offenses, but all were either acquitted or pardoned. Thompson was condemned and ostracized by many individuals in the United States military and government, as well as the public, for his role in the investigations and trials concerning the My Lai massacre.

Everywhere we'd look, we'd see bodies. These were infants, two-, three-, four-, five-year-olds, women, very old men, no draft-age people whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"The Heroes of My Lai\"/>\n\nThompson and his crew, who at first thought the artillery bombardment caused all the civilian deaths on the ground, became aware that Americans were murdering the villagers after a wounded civilian woman they requested medical evacuation for, Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb T\u1ea9u (ch\u00edn T\u1ea9u), was murdered right in front of them by Captain Medina, the commanding officer of the operation. According to Lawrence Colburn,\n\n{{blockquote|Then we saw a young girl about twenty years old lying on the grass. We could see that she was unarmed and wounded in the chest. We marked her with smoke because we saw a squad not too far away. The smoke was green, meaning it's safe to approach. Red would have meant the opposite. We were hovering six feet off the ground not more than twenty feet away when Captain Medina came over, kicked her, stepped back, and finished her off. He did it right in front of us. When we saw Medina do that, it clicked. It was our guys doing the killing.<ref name=\"historyisaweapon.com\" /> }}\n\nImmediately after the execution, Thompson discovered the irrigation ditch full of Calley's victims. Thompson then radioed a message to accompanying gunships and Task Force Barker headquarters, \"It looks to me like there's an awful lot of unnecessary killing going on down there. Something ain't right about this. There's bodies everywhere. There's a ditch full of bodies that we saw. There's something wrong here.\"<ref name=Angers />{{RP|75}} Thompson spotted movement in the irrigation ditch, indicating that there were civilians alive in it.

They spotted a group of women, children, and old men in the northeast corner of the village fleeing from advancing soldiers from the 2nd Platoon, Company C. Immediately realizing that the soldiers intended to murder the Vietnamese civilians, Thompson landed his helicopter between the advancing ground unit and the villagers.<ref name=Angers />{{RP|79}} He turned to Colburn and Andreotta and ordered them to shoot the men in the 2nd Platoon if they attempted to kill any of the fleeing civilians.<ref name=Angers />{{RP|81}} While Colburn and Andreotta focused their guns on the 2nd Platoon, Thompson located as many civilians as he could, persuaded them to follow him to a safer location, and ensured their evacuation with the help of two [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Huey]] pilots he was friends with.<ref name=Bilton />{{rp|138\u2013139}}\n\nLow on fuel, Thompson was forced to return to a supply airstrip miles outside the village. Before they departed the village, Andreotta spotted movement in the irrigation ditch full of bodies. According to Trent Angers in ''The Forgotten Hero of My Lai: The Hugh Thompson Story'' (2014),\n\n{{blockquote|The helicopter looped around then set down quickly near the edge of the ditch. Andreotta had maintained visual contact with the spot where he saw the movement, and he darted out of the aircraft as soon as it touched the ground. Thompson got out and guarded one side of the chopper and Colburn guarded the other. Andreotta had to walk on several badly mangled bodies to get where he was going. He lifted a corpse with several bullet holes in the torso and there, lying under it, was a child, age five or six, covered in blood and obviously in a state of shock.}}\n\nThe child, Do Ba, was pulled from the irrigation ditch and after failing to find any more survivors, Thompson's crew transported the child to a hospital in Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i.<ref name=Angers />{{RP|215}}\n\nAfter transporting the child to the hospital, Thompson flew to the Task Force Barker headquarters (Landing Zone Dottie), and angrily reported the massacre to his superiors.<ref name=Bilton />{{rp|176\u2013179}} His report quickly reached Lieutenant Colonel Frank Barker, the operation's overall commander. Barker immediately radioed ground forces to cease the \"killings\". After the helicopter was refueled, Thompson's crew returned to the village to ensure that no more civilians were being murdered and that the wounded were evacuated.<ref name=Angers />{{RP|89}}\n\n===After the massacre===\nThompson made an official report of the killings and was interviewed by Colonel Oran Henderson, the commander of the [[11th Infantry Brigade (United States)|11th Infantry Brigade]] (the parent organization of the 20th Infantry).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mylai/Henderson.html|title=PEERS REPORT: Col.

Thompson quickly received the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for his actions at My Lai. The citation for the award fabricated events, for example praising Thompson for taking to a hospital a Vietnamese child \"...caught in intense crossfire\". It also stated that his \"...sound judgment had greatly enhanced Vietnamese\u2013American relations in the operational area.\" Thompson threw away the citation.<ref name=Bilton />{{rp|204\u2013205}}\n\nThompson continued to fly observation missions in the OH-23 and was hit by enemy fire a total of eight times.

He retired from the army in 1983.\n\n==Post-military life==\nThompson became a helicopter pilot for the oil industry, operating in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1988 an English documentary film producer, Michael Bilton, working for [[Yorkshire Television]], managed to contact Thompson via his mother, who was then widowed and living in Texas. At that point Thompson had all but disappeared from public life. Bilton had contacted former crew member [[Lawrence Colburn]], and put Thompson and Colburn in touch with each other after a gap of nearly 16 years. Both Thompson and Colburn had been trying to find each other, but without success. Thompson was living in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Colburn near Atlanta, Georgia. They quickly arranged a reunion. Bilton spent a long weekend with Thompson discussing the events at My Lai. It proved the beginning of a long friendship which lasted until Thompson's death.\n\nBoth Thompson and Colburn were interviewed for the film ''[[Four Hours in My Lai]]'' (1989) (''Remember My Lai?'' on PBS) \u2013 which went on to win a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|British Academy Award]] and an international [[Emmy]] award. The interview showed Thompson relating what he had witnessed at My Lai: \"Here we were supposed to be the guys in the white hats. It upset me\".<ref>\"My Lai: A Half Told Story\", ''London Sunday Times Magazine'', pp. 28\u201329, 23rd April, 1989.</ref> Bilton and his colleague Kevin Sim then began researching a book and Bilton conducted further interviews with Thompson and Colburn. When the book ''Four Hours in My Lai'' (1992) was published, it prompted a campaign to have the heroism of Thompson and his helicopter crew recognised. Several senior figures in the U.S. military supported the campaign, as did President [[George H. W. Bush]]. Thompson and Colburn were invited to speak to a wide range of audiences about the ethics of warfare including at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], a conference in Norway, and at Connecticut College in New London, where they were each awarded an honorary doctorate.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/07/national/07thompson.html|title=Hugh Thompson, 62; Saved Civilians at My Lai|date=7 January 2006|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=10 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, Thompson and Colburn returned to the village of S\u01a1n M\u1ef9, where they met some of the people they saved during the killings, including Thi Nhung and Pham Thi Nhanh, two women who had been part of the group about to be killed by Brooks's 2nd Platoon.<ref name=Angers />{{RP|77}} Thompson said to the survivors, \"I just wish our crew that day could have helped more people than we did.\"<ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite news|title='Blood and fire' of My Lai remembered 30 years later|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9803/16/my.lai/|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=2015-02-15}}</ref> He reported that one of the women they had helped out came up to him and asked, \"Why didn't the people who committed these acts come back with you?\" He said that he was \"just devastated\" but that she finished her sentence: \"So we could forgive them.\" He later told a reporter, \"I'm not man enough to do that.

It is understood among Muslims that that challenge has not been met.<ref name=bw/>\n\n==Studies==\n[[File:Surat 28 ayah 88-29 ayah 1 folio.jpg|thumb|left|Folio from a section of the Qur'an, 14th century]]\nThe literary quality of the Qur'an has been generally acknowledged by Muslim and some non-Muslim scholars and intellectuals.<ref name=comments/> and there is evidence that Muslims accepted Islam on the basis of evaluating the Qur'an as a text that surpasses all human production.<ref name=znasr/> Whilst western views typically ascribe  social, ideological, propagandistic, or military reasons for the success of early Islam, Muslim sources view the literary quality of the Qur'an as a decisive factor for the adoption of the Islamic creed and its ideology, resulting in its spread and development in the 7th century.<ref name=bw/> A thriving poetic tradition existed at the time of Muhammad, however, according to Afnan Fatani, a contemporary scholar of Islamic studies, Muhammad had brought, in spite of being illiterate, something that was superior to anything that the poets and orators had ever written or heard. They did not question this, what they rejected was the Qur'an's ideas, especially [[monotheism]] and [[resurrection]].<ref name=lm/> Numerous scholars devoted time to finding out why the Qur'an was inimitable. The majority of opinions was around eloquence of the Qur'an both in wording and meaning as its speech does not form to poetry nor prose commonly expressed in all languages. Thus it is understood that the inimitability of the Qur'an resides in this third genre in which words have been arranged in a particular way accompanied with flawless meaning that humans are unable to reproduce.<ref name=sophia/>\n\nNonliguistic approaches focus on the inner meanings of the Qur'an.<ref name=taji/> [[Oliver Leaman]], favoring a nonlinguistic approach, criticizes the links between aesthetic judgment and faith and argues that it is possible to be impressed by something without thinking that it came about supernaturally and vice versa it is possible to believe in the divine origin of the Qur'an without agreeing to the aesthetic supremacy of the text. He thinks that it is  the combination of language, ideas, and hidden meanings of the Qur'an that makes it an immediately convincing product.<ref name=lm2/>\n\n===Classic works===\nThere are numerous classical works of literary criticism which have studied the Qur'an and examined its style:\n\nThe most famous works on the doctrine of inimitability are two medieval books by the grammarian [[Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani|Al Jurjani]] (d. 1078 CE), ''Dala\u2019il al-i'jaz'' ('the Arguments of Inimitability') and ''Asraral-balagha'' ('the Secrets of Eloquence'). Al Jurjani argued that the inimitability of the Qur'an is a linguistic phenomenon and proposed that the Qur'an has a degree of excellence unachievable by human beings.<ref name=larkin/> Al Jurjani believed that Qur'an's eloquence must be a certain special quality in the manner of its stylistic arrangement and composition or a certain special way of joining words. He studied the Qur'an with literary proofs and examined the various literary features and how they were utilized.<ref name=sophia/> He rejected  the idea that the words (''alfaz'') and meaning (''ma'ani'') of a literary work can be separated. In his view the meaning was what determined the quality of the style and that it would be absurd to attribute qualities of eloquence to a text only by observing its words. He explains that eloquence does not reside in the correct application of grammar as these are only necessary not sufficient conditions for the quality of a text. The originality of Al Jurjani is that he linked his view on meaning as the determining factor in the quality of a text by considering it not in isolation but as it is realized within a text. He wished to impress his audience with the need to study not only theology but also grammatical details and literary theory in order to improve their understanding of the inimitability of the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite book|last=Versteegh|first=Kees|title=Landmarks in linguistic thought III : the Arabic linguistic tradition: chapter 8|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415157579|edition=1. publ.}}</ref> For Al Jurjani the dichotomy much elaborated by earlier critics between 'word' and 'meaning' was a false one. He suggested considering not merely the meaning but 'the meaning of the meaning'. He defined two types of meaning one that resorts to the 'intellect' the other to the 'imagination'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Roger|title=An introduction to Arabic literature|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Al Baqillani's point was not that the Qur'an broke the custom by extraordinary degree of eloquence but that it broke the custom of the existing literary forms by creating a new genre of expression.\n\n[[Ibrahim an-Nazzam|Ibrahim al-Nazzam]] of Basra (d. 846 CE) was among the first to study the doctrine.<ref name=sophia/> According to Al Nazzam, Qur'ans inimitability is due to the information in its content which as divine revelation contains divine knowledge. Thus, Qur'an's supremacy lies in its content rather than its style.<ref name=znasr/> [[Sharif al-Murtaza|A- Murtaza]] (d. 1044 CE) had similar views, turning to divine intervention as the only viable explanation as to why the challenge was not met.<ref name=zadeh/>\n\n[[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad|Al-Qadi Abd al-Jabbar]] (d. 1025 CE), in his book ''Al-Mughni'' (\"the sufficient book\"), insists on the hidden meanings of the Qur'an along with its eloquence and provides some counter-arguments against the criticism leveled at Muhammad and the Qur'an. Abd al-Jabbar studies the doctrine in parts 15 and 16 of his book series. According to Abd al-Jabbr, Arabs chose not to compete with Muhammad in the literary field but on the battlefield and this was another reason that they recognized the superiority of the Qur'an. Abd al-Jabbar rejected the doctrine of ''sarfah'' (the prohibition from production) because according to him ''sarfah'' makes a miracle of something other than the Qur'an and not the Qur'an itself. The doctrine of ''sarfah'' means that people can produce a rival to the Qur'an but due to some supernatural or divine cause decide against doing so. Therefore, according to Abd al-Jabbar, the correct interpretation of ''sarfah'' is that the motives to rival the Qur'an disappears because of the recognition of the impossibility of doing so.<ref name=yrahman/>\n\nYahya ibn Ziyad al-Farra (d. 822 CE), Abu Ubaydah (d. 824 CE), Ibn Qutaybah (d. 889 CE), Rummani (d. 994 CE), Khattabi (d. 998 CE), and Zarkashi (d. 1392 CE) are also among notable scholars in this subject. Ibn Qutaybah considered 'brevity' which he defined as ''\"jam' al-kathir mi ma'anih fi l-qalil min lafzih\"'' (collection of many ideas in a few words) as one aspect of Qur'anic miraculousness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boullata|first=Issa J.|title=Literary structures of religious meaning in the Qur'an|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0700712569|pages=279}}</ref> Zarkashi in his book ''Al-Burhan'' stated that miraculousness of the Qur'an can be perceived but not described.<ref name=sophia/>\n\n=== Scientific ''I'jaz'' Literature ===\nSome hold that some verses of the Qur'an contain scientific theories that have been discovered only in modern times confirming Qur'an's miraculousness.

Bucaille states that he has examined the degree of compatibility between the Qur'an and modern scientific data and that this study has led him to the conclusion that the Qur'an did not contain statements that contradicted modern science.

He refers to verse 29:20 which says \"Travel throughout the earth and see how He brings life into being\" and 3:190 which says \"In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day there are indeed signs for men of understanding\" and concludes that these verses do not have any specific scientific content, rather they encourage believers to observe natural phenomena and reflect on the complexity of the universe. According to Nidhal Guessoum some works on miracles in the Qur'an follow a set pattern; they generally begin with a verse from the Qur'an, for example, the verse \"So verily I swear by the stars that run and hide . . .\" (81:15-16) and quickly declare that it refers to black holes, or take the verse \"I swear by the Moon in her fullness, that ye shall journey on from stage to stage\" (84:18-19) and decide it refers to space travel, and so on. \"What is meant to be allegorical and poetic is transformed into products of science\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Sardar|first=Ziauddin|title=Weird science|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2008/08/quran-muslim-scientific|publisher=Newstatesman|accessdate=Aug 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Muhammad's literacy===\nIn Islamic theology, Muhammad's illiteracy is a way of emphasizing that he was a transparent medium for divine revelation and a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood since the illiterate prophet could not have composed the eloquent poetry and prose of the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weddle|first=David L.|title=Miracles. ; Wonder and Meaning in World Religions.|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=978-0814794166|pages=[https://archive.org/details/miracleswonderme0000wedd/page/177 177\u2013209]|url=https://archive.org/details/miracleswonderme0000wedd/page/177}}</ref>  According to [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Tabatabaei]] (d. 1981), a Muslim scholar, the force of this challenge becomes clear when we realize that it is issued for someone whose life should resemble that of Muhammad namely the life of an orphan, uneducated in any formal sense, not being able to read or write and grew up in the unenlightened age of the ''jahiliyah'' period (the age of ignorance) before Islam.<ref>{{cite book|last=TabaTaba'i|first=Allamah Sayyid M.

It has also been translated to 'Gentile'.

It is understood among Muslims that that challenge has not been met.<ref name=bw/>\n\n==Studies==\n[[File:Surat 28 ayah 88-29 ayah 1 folio.jpg|thumb|left|Folio from a section of the Qur'an, 14th century]]\nThe literary quality of the Qur'an has been generally acknowledged by Muslim and some non-Muslim scholars and intellectuals.<ref name=comments/> and there is evidence that Muslims accepted Islam on the basis of evaluating the Qur'an as a text that surpasses all human production.<ref name=znasr/> Whilst western views typically ascribe  social, ideological, propagandistic, or military reasons for the success of early Islam, Muslim sources view the literary quality of the Qur'an as a decisive factor for the adoption of the Islamic creed and its ideology, resulting in its spread and development in the 7th century.<ref name=bw/> A thriving poetic tradition existed at the time of Muhammad, however, according to Afnan Fatani, a contemporary scholar of Islamic studies, Muhammad had brought, in spite of being illiterate, something that was superior to anything that the poets and orators had ever written or heard. They did not question this, what they rejected was the Qur'an's ideas, especially [[monotheism]] and [[resurrection]].<ref name=lm/> Numerous scholars devoted time to finding out why the Qur'an was inimitable. The majority of opinions was around eloquence of the Qur'an both in wording and meaning as its speech does not form to poetry nor prose commonly expressed in all languages. Thus it is understood that the inimitability of the Qur'an resides in this third genre in which words have been arranged in a particular way accompanied with flawless meaning that humans are unable to reproduce.<ref name=sophia/>\n\nNonliguistic approaches focus on the inner meanings of the Qur'an.<ref name=taji/> [[Oliver Leaman]], favoring a nonlinguistic approach, criticizes the links between aesthetic judgment and faith and argues that it is possible to be impressed by something without thinking that it came about supernaturally and vice versa it is possible to believe in the divine origin of the Qur'an without agreeing to the aesthetic supremacy of the text. He thinks that it is  the combination of language, ideas, and hidden meanings of the Qur'an that makes it an immediately convincing product.<ref name=lm2/>\n\n===Classic works===\nThere are numerous classical works of literary criticism which have studied the Qur'an and examined its style:\n\nThe most famous works on the doctrine of inimitability are two medieval books by the grammarian [[Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani|Al Jurjani]] (d. 1078 CE), ''Dala\u2019il al-i'jaz'' ('the Arguments of Inimitability') and ''Asraral-balagha'' ('the Secrets of Eloquence'). Al Jurjani argued that the inimitability of the Qur'an is a linguistic phenomenon and proposed that the Qur'an has a degree of excellence unachievable by human beings.<ref name=larkin/> Al Jurjani believed that Qur'an's eloquence must be a certain special quality in the manner of its stylistic arrangement and composition or a certain special way of joining words. He studied the Qur'an with literary proofs and examined the various literary features and how they were utilized.<ref name=sophia/> He rejected  the idea that the words (''alfaz'') and meaning (''ma'ani'') of a literary work can be separated. In his view the meaning was what determined the quality of the style and that it would be absurd to attribute qualities of eloquence to a text only by observing its words. He explains that eloquence does not reside in the correct application of grammar as these are only necessary not sufficient conditions for the quality of a text. The originality of Al Jurjani is that he linked his view on meaning as the determining factor in the quality of a text by considering it not in isolation but as it is realized within a text. He wished to impress his audience with the need to study not only theology but also grammatical details and literary theory in order to improve their understanding of the inimitability of the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite book|last=Versteegh|first=Kees|title=Landmarks in linguistic thought III : the Arabic linguistic tradition: chapter 8|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415157579|edition=1. publ.}}</ref> For Al Jurjani the dichotomy much elaborated by earlier critics between 'word' and 'meaning' was a false one. He suggested considering not merely the meaning but 'the meaning of the meaning'. He defined two types of meaning one that resorts to the 'intellect' the other to the 'imagination'.<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Roger|title=An introduction to Arabic literature|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

Al Baqillani's point was not that the Qur'an broke the custom by extraordinary degree of eloquence but that it broke the custom of the existing literary forms by creating a new genre of expression.\n\n[[Ibrahim an-Nazzam|Ibrahim al-Nazzam]] of Basra (d. 846 CE) was among the first to study the doctrine.<ref name=sophia/> According to Al Nazzam, Qur'ans inimitability is due to the information in its content which as divine revelation contains divine knowledge. Thus, Qur'an's supremacy lies in its content rather than its style.<ref name=znasr/> [[Sharif al-Murtaza|A- Murtaza]] (d. 1044 CE) had similar views, turning to divine intervention as the only viable explanation as to why the challenge was not met.<ref name=zadeh/>\n\n[[Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad|Al-Qadi Abd al-Jabbar]] (d. 1025 CE), in his book ''Al-Mughni'' (\"the sufficient book\"), insists on the hidden meanings of the Qur'an alongside with its eloquence and provides some counter-arguments against the criticism leveled at Muhammad and the Qur'an. Abd al-Jabbar studies the doctrine in parts 15 and 16 of his book series. According to Abd al-Jabbr, Arabs chose not to compete with Muhammad in the literary field but on the battlefield and this was another reason that they recognized the superiority of the Qur'an. Abd al-Jabbar rejected the doctrine of ''sarfah'' (the prohibition from production) because according to him ''sarfah'' makes a miracle of something other than the Qur'an and not the Qur'an itself. The doctrine of ''sarfah'' means that people can produce a rival to the Qur'an but due to some supernatural or divine cause decide against doing so. Therefore, according to Abd al-Jabbar, the correct interpretation of ''sarfah'' is that the motives to rival the Qur'an disappears because of the recognition of the impossibility of doing so.<ref name=yrahman/>\n\nYahya ibn Ziyad al-Farra (d. 822 CE), Abu Ubaydah (d. 824 CE), Ibn Qutaybah (d. 889 CE), Rummani (d. 994 CE), Khattabi (d. 998 CE), and Zarkashi (d. 1392 CE) are also among notable scholars in this subject. Ibn Qutaybah considered 'brevity' which he defined as ''\"jam' al-kathir mi ma'anih fi l-qalil min lafzih\"'' (collection of many ideas in a few words) as one aspect of Qur'anic miraculousness.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boullata|first=Issa J.|title=Literary structures of religious meaning in the Qur'an|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0700712569|pages=279}}</ref> Zarkashi in his book ''Al-Burhan'' stated that miraculousness of the Qur'an can be perceived but not described.<ref name=sophia/>\n\n=== Scientific ''I'jaz'' Literature ===\nSome hold that some verses of the Qur'an contain scientific theories that have been discovered only in modern times confirming Qur'an's miraculousness. This has been criticized by the scientific community.\n\n[[Maurice Bucaille]] in his writings provides some interpretations of verses that he claimed to be in agreement with modern science and that had not been known in the past. Bucaille states that he has examined the degree of compatibility between the Qur'an and modern scientific data and that this study has led him to the conclusion that the Qur'an did not contain statements that contradicted modern science. He then argues that it is inconceivable that the scientific statements of the Qur'an could have been the work of man.<ref name=Bucaille>{{cite book|last=Pannell|first=Maurice Bucaille ; translated from the French by Alastair D.|title=The Bible, the Qur'an, and science : the Holy scriptures examined in the light of modern knowledge|year=1980|publisher=Seghers|location=Paris|isbn=2221012119|pages=Introduction|edition=3rd ed., rev. and expanded.|author2=author, the}}</ref>\n\nSome examples of these verses include 41:11,<ref>\"Then turned He to the heaven when it was smoke, and said unto it and unto the earth: Come both of you, willingly or loth.

He refers to verse 29:20 which says \"Travel throughout the earth and see how He brings life into being\" and 3:190 which says \"In the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of night and day there are indeed signs for men of understanding\" and concludes that these verses do not have any specific scientific content, rather they encourage believers to observe natural phenomena and reflect on the complexity of the universe. According to Nidhal Guessoum some works on miracles in the Qur'an follow a set pattern; they generally begin with a verse from the Qur'an, for example, the verse \"So verily I swear by the stars that run and hide . . .\" (81:15-16) and quickly declare that it refers to black holes, or take the verse \"I swear by the Moon in her fullness, that ye shall journey on from stage to stage\" (84:18-19) and decide it refers to space travel, and so on. \"What is meant to be allegorical and poetic is transformed into products of science\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Sardar|first=Ziauddin|title=Weird science|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2008/08/quran-muslim-scientific|publisher=Newstatesman|accessdate=Aug 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Muhammad's literacy===\nIn Islamic theology, Muhammad's illiteracy is a way of emphasizing that he was a transparent medium for divine revelation and a sign of the genuineness of his prophethood since the illiterate prophet could not have composed the eloquent poetry and prose of the Qur'an.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weddle|first=David L.|title=Miracles. ; Wonder and Meaning in World Religions.|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=978-0814794166|pages=[https://archive.org/details/miracleswonderme0000wedd/page/177 177\u2013209]|url=https://archive.org/details/miracleswonderme0000wedd/page/177}}</ref>  According to [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei|Tabatabaei]] (d. 1981), a Muslim scholar, the force of this challenge becomes clear when we realize that it is issued for someone whose life should resemble that of Muhammad namely the life of an orphan, uneducated in any formal sense, not being able to read or write and grew up in the unenlightened age of the ''jahiliyah'' period (the age of ignorance) before Islam.<ref>{{cite book|last=TabaTaba'i|first=Allamah Sayyid M.

The Arabic term ''\"ummi\"'' in 7:158 and 62:2 is translated to 'illiterate' and 'unlettered'.<ref>see for example translations by Pickthall, Yusuf Ali, and Daryabadi. It has also been translated to 'Gentile'. Arberry translates to 'the prophet of the common folk'.</ref> The medieval exegete [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al Tabari]] (d. 923 CE) maintained that the term induced two meanings: firstly, the inability to read or write in general and secondly, the inexperience or ignorance of the previous books or scriptures.<ref name=gunther>{{cite journal|last=G\u00fcnther|first=Sebastian|title=Muhammad, the Illiterate Prophet: An Islamic Creed in the Qur'an and Qur'anic Exegesis|journal=Journal of Qur'anic Studies|year=2002|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1\u201326|doi=10.3366/jqs.2002.4.1.1}}</ref>\n\nThe early sources on the history of Islam provide that Muhammad especially in Medina used scribes to correspond with the tribes. Likewise, though infrequently rather than constantly, he had scribes write down, on separate pages not yet in one single book, parts of the Qur'an.<ref name=gunther/> Collections of prophetic tradition occasionally mention Muhammad having basic knowledge of reading and writing, while others deny it. For example, in the book  [[Sahih al-Bukhari]], a collection of early sayings, it is mentioned that when Muhammad and the Meccans agreed to conclude a peace treaty, Muhammad made a minor change to his signature or in one occasion he asked for a paper to write a statement.<ref>[[Sahih Bukhari]] by Muhammad Al Bukhari (d.870CE), narrations number 2699 http://sunnah.com/bukhari/53/9 and 114 http://sunnah.com/bukhari/3/56</ref>\n\n[[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi|Fakhr Al-Razi]], the 12th century Islamic theologian, has expressed his idea is his book ''Tafsir Al Razi'':<ref>Tafsir Al Razi by Fakhr Al Din Al Razi, volume 15 pages 23 and 29, translated in G\u00fcnther, Sebastian (2002). \"Muhammad, the Illiterate Prophet: An Islamic Creed in the Qur'an and Qur'anic Exegesis\".
