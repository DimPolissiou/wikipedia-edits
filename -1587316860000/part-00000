However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the [[:wikt:poltroon|poltroon]] to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"<ref>Bourquin, S..''Military History Journal, V. 4, No. 4, The Zulu Military Organization'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, Dec. 1978</ref> The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed. Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200\u2013400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 2,800 soldiers<ref>https://www.history.co.uk/article/the-battle-of-isandlwana-and-the-anglo-zulu-war-of-1879</ref> which include half of the British infantry contingent, and along with a few hundred auxiliaries, set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind approximately 600 British [[Red coat (military uniform)|red coat]] [[line infantry]] \u2013 five companies, around 90 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the [[24th Regiment of Foot]] to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 700 men composed of the [[Natal Native Contingent]], local mounted irregulars, and other units. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, over 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp excluding civilian auxiliaries.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Pulleine received further reports during the early morning, each of which noted movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a Rocket Battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s lost control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, with their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli.

Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22. About 20% of each battalion had some sort of firearm</ref> and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.<ref>Morris, p. 371.</ref>\n\nPulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B gives a start time for the battle of around 8:00 am with the Zulus falling back behind the hills until noon and the final Zulu advance beginning at 1:00 pm</ref> until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford's retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.<ref>Morris, pp. 373\u201374.</ref>\n\nAn officer in advance of Chelmsford's force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:\n\n{{quote|In a few seconds we distinctly saw the guns fired again, one after the other, sharp.

It also left little time and gave scant information for Pulleine to organise the defence.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat. The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nDonald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref> A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n\nThe official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref> Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin.

''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] was besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311.

Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold.

Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979.

He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval. Chelmsford, however, obtained an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] to personally explain the events. She asked Gladstone to meet Chelmsford; this meeting was brief, and during it Gladstone voiced his displeasure.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bambatha Rebellion]]\n* [[Battle of Adwa]]\n* [[Battle of Blood River]]\n* [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]]\n* [[British military history]]\n* [[Colony of Natal]]\n* [[List of Zulu War Victoria Cross recipients]]\n* [[Martini\u2013Henry]]\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n* [[Natal Native Contingent]]\n* ''[[Zulu Dawn]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances |author2=assisted in those portions of the work that touch on military matters by Lieut.-Colonel Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich|isbn=1-152-31729-6|archive-date=18 June 2007|url-status=live|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fz1CAAAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Doyle|editor1-first= Peter|editor2-last= Bennett|editor2-first= Matthew R.|title=Fields of Battle|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|year= 2002|isbn=1-4020-0433-8|first=Tony|last=Pollard|chapter=The Mountain is their Monument|pp=118\u2013}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

However, their marksmanship was very poor, quality and supply of powder and shot dreadful, maintenance non-existent and attitude towards firearms summed up in the observation that: \"The generality of Zulu warriors, however, would not have firearms \u2013 the arms of a coward, as they said, for they enable the [[:wikt:poltroon|poltroon]] to kill the brave without awaiting his attack.\"<ref>Bourquin, S..''Military History Journal, V. 4, No. 4, The Zulu Military Organization'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, Dec. 1978</ref> The British had timed the invasion to coincide with the harvest, intending to catch the Zulu warrior-farmers dispersed. Fortuitously for Cetshwayo, the Zulu army had already begun to assemble at Ulundi, as it did every year for the ''[[Umkhosi Wokweshwama|First Fruits]]'' ceremony when all warriors were duty-bound to report to their regimental barracks near Ulundi.<ref>Lock, p. 82</ref><ref name=c294>Colenso, p. 294</ref>\n\nCetshwayo sent the 24,000 strong main Zulu impi from near present-day Ulundi, on 17 January, across the [[White Umfolozi River]] with the following command to his warriors: \"March slowly, attack at dawn and eat up the red soldiers.\"<ref>Lock, p. 86</ref>\n\nOn 18 January, some 4,000 warriors were detached from the main body to attack [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]]'s No. 1 Column near [[Eshowe]]. The remaining 20,000 Zulus camped at the isiPhezi ikhanda. The next day, the main force arrived and camped near [[Babanango|Babanango Mountain]], then moved the next day to a camp near Siphezi Mountain. Finally, on 21 January they moved into the Ngwebeni Valley, where they remained concealed, planning to attack the British on 23 January, but they were discovered by a scouting party on 22 January. Under the command of Ntshigwayo kaMahole the Zulu army had reached its position in easy stages. It marched in two columns within sight of each other, but a few miles apart to prevent a surprise attack. They were preceded by a screening force of mounted scouts supported by parties of warriors 200\u2013400 strong tasked with preventing the main columns from being sighted.<ref>Lock, pp. 129\u201331</ref> The speed of the Zulu advance compared to the British was marked. The Zulu impi had advanced over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} in five days, while Chelmsford had only advanced slightly over {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 10 days.<ref>Lock, pp. 87, 129\u201330</ref>\n\nThe British under Chelmsford pitched camp at [[Isandlwana]] on 20 January,<ref name=\"NHoSA-166\"/> but did not follow standing orders to entrench. No [[laager]] (circling of the wagons) was formed. Chelmsford did not see the need for one, stating, \"It would take a week to make.\"<ref name=c294/> But the chief reason for the failure to take defensive precautions appears to have been that the British command severely underestimated the Zulus' capabilities. The experience of numerous colonial wars fought in Africa was that the massed firepower of relatively small bodies of professional European troops, armed with modern firearms and artillery and supplemented by local allies and levies, would march out to meet the natives whose poorly equipped armies would put up a fight but in the end would succumb. Chelmsford believed that a force of over 4,000, including 2,000 British infantry armed with [[Martini\u2013Henry]] [[rifle]]s, as well as artillery, had more than sufficient firepower to overwhelm any attack by Zulus armed only with spears, cowhide shields and a few firearms such as [[Brown Bess]] [[musket]]s. Indeed, with a British force of this size, it was the logistical arrangements which occupied Chelmsford's thoughts. Rather than any fear that the camp might be attacked, his main concern was managing the huge number of wagons and oxen required to support his forward advance.<ref>Colenso, pp. 264\u201366, 273\u201375</ref>\n\nOnce he had established the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with elements of a Zulu force which he believed to be the vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 2,800 soldiers<ref>https://www.history.co.uk/article/the-battle-of-isandlwana-and-the-anglo-zulu-war-of-1879</ref> which include half of the British infantry contingent, and along with a few hundred auxiliaries, set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle so as to achieve a decisive victory. It never occurred to him that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.<ref>Lock, p. 151</ref>\n\nChelmsford left behind approximately 600 British [[Red coat (military uniform)|red coat]] [[line infantry]] \u2013 five companies, around 90 fighting men in each, of the 1st Battalion and one stronger company of around 150 men from the 2nd Battalion of the [[24th Regiment of Foot]] to guard the camp, under the command of [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry Pulleine]]. Pulleine's orders were to defend the camp and wait for further instructions to support the general as and when called upon. Pulleine also had around 700 men composed of the [[Natal Native Contingent]], local mounted irregulars, and other units. He also had two artillery pieces, with around 70 men of the Royal Artillery. In total, over 1,300 men and two artillery guns of the No. 3 Column were left to defend the camp excluding civilian auxiliaries.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 36</ref><ref>https://www.historyhit.com/facts-about-the-battle-of-isandlwana/</ref>\n[[File:LL1882 pg279 ZULU SOLDIERS AND KRAAL.jpg|thumb|Zulu warriors, 1882]]\nPulleine, left in command of a rear position, was an administrator with no experience of front-line command on a campaign. Nevertheless, he commanded a strong force, particularly the six veteran regular infantry companies, which were experienced in colonial warfare. The mounted vedettes, cavalry scouts, patrolling some {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from camp reported at 7:00 am that groups of Zulus, numbering around 4,000 men, could be seen. Pulleine received further reports during the early morning, each of which noted movements, both large and small, of Zulus. There was speculation among the officers whether these troops were intending to march against Chelmsford's rear or towards the camp itself.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\">Knight (1992, 2002), p. 40</ref>\n\nAround 10:30 am, [[Colonel]] [[Anthony Durnford]], whose left arm was paralyzed from the Xhosa War, arrived from [[Rorke's Drift]] with 500 men of the [[Natal Native Contingent]] and a Rocket Battery of the No. 2 Column to reinforce the camp at Isandlwana. This brought the issue of command to the fore because Durnford was senior and by tradition should have assumed command.<ref>Pulleine's rank was brevet lieutenant colonel; in other words he was still being paid as a major.</ref> However, he did not over-rule Pulleine's dispositions and after lunch he quickly decided to take to the initiative and move forward to engage a Zulu force which Pulleine and Durnford judged to be moving against Chelmsford's rear. Durnford asked for a company of the 24th, but Pulleine was reluctant to agree since his orders had been specifically to defend the camp.<ref name=\"Knight, Ian 1879, p. 40\"/>\n\nChelmsford had underestimated the disciplined, well-led, well-motivated and confident Zulus. The failure to secure an effective defensive position, the poor intelligence on the location of the main Zulu army, Chelmsford's decision to split his force in half, and the Zulus' tactical exploitation of the terrain and the weaknesses in the British formation, all combined to prove catastrophic for the troops at Isandlwana. In contrast, the Zulus responded to the unexpected discovery of their camp with an immediate and spontaneous advance. Even though the [[induna]]s lost control over the advance, the warriors' training allowed the Zulu troops to form their standard attack formation on the run, with their battle line deployed in reverse of its intended order.<ref>Knight (1992, 2002), p. 41</ref><ref>Colenso, p. 409</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Dabulamanzi.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]]]]\n\nThe Zulu Army was  commanded by ''ESA'' (Princes) [[Ntshingwayo Khoza|Ntshingwayo kaMahole Khoza]] and Mavumengwana kaNdlela Ntuli. The ''inDuna'' [[Dabulamanzi kaMpande]], half brother of Cetshwayo, commanded the Undi Corps after [[Zibhebhu kaMaphitha]], the regular ''inkhosi'', or commander, was wounded.<ref name=morris/>\n\nWhile Chelmsford was in the field seeking them, the entire Zulu army had outmanoeuvred him, moving behind his force with the intention of attacking the British Army on the 23rd. Pulleine had received reports of large forces of Zulus throughout the morning of the 22nd from 8:00am on. [[Vedette (sentry)|Vedettes]] had observed Zulus on the hills to the left front, and Lt. Chard, while he was at the camp, observed a large force of several thousand Zulu moving to the British left around the hill of Isandlwana. Pulleine sent word to Chelmsford, which was received by the General between 9:00am and 10:00am.<ref>Colenso, pp. 287, 288</ref> The main Zulu force was discovered at around 11:00am by men of Lt. Charles Raw's troop of scouts, who chased a number of Zulus into a valley, only then seeing most of the 20,000 men of the main enemy force sitting in total quiet. This valley has generally been thought to be the [[Ngwebeni]] some {{convert|7|mi|km}} from the British camp but may have been closer in the area of the spurs of Nqutu hill. Having been discovered, the Zulu force leapt to the offensive. Raw's men began a [[Withdrawal (military)|fighting retreat]] back to the camp and a messenger was sent to warn Pulleine.\n\nThe Zulu attack then developed in the traditional horns and chest of the buffalo, with the aim of encircling the British position. From Pulleine's vantage point in the camp, at first only the right horn and then the chest (centre) of the attack seemed to be developing. Pulleine sent out first one, then all six companies of the 24th Foot into an extended firing line, with the aim of meeting the Zulu attack head-on and checking it with firepower. Durnford's men, upon meeting elements of the Zulu centre, had retreated to a [[donga (ditch)|donga]], a dried-out watercourse, on the British right flank where they formed a defensive line. The Rocket Battery under Durnford's command, which was not mounted and dropped behind the rest of the force, was isolated and overrun very early in the engagement. The two battalions of native troops were in Durnford's line; while all the officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] carried rifles, only one in 10 in the ranks was armed with a muzzle-loading musket with limited ammunition<ref name=\"Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B\">Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B</ref><ref>Thompson, pp. 17, 22. About 20% of each battalion had some sort of firearm</ref> and many of them started to leave the battlefield at this point.<ref>Morris, p. 371.</ref>\n\nPulleine only made one change to the original disposition after about 20 minutes of firing, bringing in the companies in the firing line slightly closer to the camp. For an hour or so<ref>Smith-Dorrien, Chapter 1B gives a start time for the battle of around 8:00 am with the Zulus falling back behind the hills until noon and the final Zulu advance beginning at 1:00 pm</ref> until after noon, the disciplined British volleys pinned down the Zulu centre, inflicting many casualties and causing the advance to stall. Indeed, morale remained high within the British line. The [[Martini\u2013Henry]] rifle was a powerful weapon and the men were experienced. Additionally, the shell fire of the [[Royal Artillery]] forced some Zulu regiments to take cover behind the reverse slope of a hill. Nevertheless, the left horn of the Zulu advance was moving to outflank and envelop the British right.<ref>Morris, p. 373; Colenso, p. 285.</ref>\n\n[[File:Isandhlwana.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Battle of Isandlwana ([[Charles Edwin Fripp]])]]\n\nDurnford's men, who had been fighting the longest, began to withdraw and their [[rate of fire]] diminished. Durnford's withdrawal exposed the right flank of the British regulars, which, with the general threat of the Zulu encirclement, caused Pulleine to order a withdrawal back to the camp. The regulars' retreat was performed with order and discipline and the men of the 24th conducted a fighting withdrawal into the camp. Durnford's retreat, however, exposed the flank of G Company, 2nd/24th, which was overrun relatively quickly.<ref>Morris, pp. 373\u201374.</ref>\n\nAn officer in advance of Chelmsford's force gave this eyewitness account of the final stage of the battle at about 3:00 pm:\n\n{{quote|In a few seconds we distinctly saw the guns fired again, one after the other, sharp.

The fighting had been [[hand-to-hand combat]] and [[no quarter]] was given to the British regulars.

These historians' view of the expanded battlefield considers Chelmsford to have been the overall commander of the British forces and that responsibility for the defeat lies firmly with him.\n\n[[File:Isandlwanazulumem.JPG|right|thumb|[[Memorial]] erected at the site commemorating the valour of the fallen Zulu [[impi]] at Isandlwana Hill, which is visible in the background<ref>Doyle, p. 131.

Many arguments focus on possible local tactical occurrences, as opposed to the [[military strategy|strategic]] lapses and failings in [[grand tactics]] on the part of high command under Bartle Frere and Chelmsford. Still, the latter comes under scrutiny for mistakes that may have led directly to the British defeat. The initial view, reported by [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]], was that the British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough.  The box lids were screwed down, the screws were rusty and difficult to remove, there were too few screwdrivers, \"standing orders\" insisted that until a box was empty, no other boxes were to be opened, and  the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10\u201312 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution.<ref>{{cite web |first=Horace |last=Smith-Dorrien |url=http://www.richthofen.com/smith-dorrien/dorrien01b.htm |title=Memories of Forty-Eight Years' Service |publisher=Richthofen.com}}</ref> Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest in a letter to his father.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nDonald Morris in ''[[The Washing of the Spears]]'' argues that the men, fighting too far from the camp, ran out of ammunition, starting first with Durnford's men who were holding the right flank and who had been in action longer, which precipitated a slowdown in the rate of fire against the Zulus. This argument suggests that the ammunition was too far from the firing line and that the seventy rounds each man took to the firing line were not sufficient.<ref name=morris>Morris</ref><ref>Laband, p. 4.</ref> A different view, supported with evidence from the battlefield, such as Ian Knight and Lt. Colonel Snook's works, (the latter having written ''How Can Man Die Better?''), suggests that, although Durnford's men probably did run out of ammunition, the majority of men in the firing line did not. The discovery of the British line so far out from the camp has led Ian Knight to conclude that the British were defending too large a perimeter.<ref>Snook, Mike. ''How Can Man Die Better: The Secrets of Isandlwana Revealed''. London: Greenhill Books, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-85367-656-7}}</ref>\n\nThe official interrogation by Horse Guards under the direction of the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]], the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, in August 1879, concluded that the primary cause of the defeat was the \"under estimate formed of the offensive fighting power of the Zulu army\", additionally the investigation questions Chelmsford as to why the camp was not [[laagered]] and why there was a failure to reconnoitre and discover the nearby Zulu army.<ref>Lock, pp. 280\u201381. Doyle, p. 120.</ref> Colenso calls Chelmsford's neglecting to follow his own \"Regulations for Field Forces in South Africa\", which required that a defensible camp be established at every halt, fatal.<ref>Colenso, p. 274.</ref>\n\nNumerous messages, some quite early in the day, had been sent to Chelmsford informing him, initially, of the presence of the Zulu near the camp and, subsequently, of the attack on the camp, with increasingly urgent pleas for help. The most egregious failure to respond occurred at around 1:30 pm when a message from [[George Hamilton-Browne|Hamilton-Browne]] stating, \"For God's sake come back, the camp is surrounded, and things I fear are going badly\", was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Harness of the Royal Artillery and Major Black of the 2/24. They were leading the other four RA guns as well as two companies of the 2/24 and on their own initiative immediately marched back towards Isandlwana and had gone some two miles when they were ordered to return to Mangeni Falls by an aide sent by Chelmsford.<ref>Lock pp. 214\u201315, 252.</ref>\n\nAt long last but too late, finally Chelmsford became convinced of the seriousness of the situation on his left flank and rear when at 3:30pm he joined Hamilton-Browne's NNC and realised the camp had been taken. A surviving officer, Rupert Lonsdale, rode up and described the camp's fall to which Chelmsford replied, \"But I left over 1,000 men to guard the camp\".<ref>Lock, p. 225.</ref> He quickly gathered his scattered forces and marched the column back to Isandlwana but arrived at sundown long after the battle ended and the Zulu army had marched off. The British camped on the field that night but left before sunrise without any examination of the ground as Chelmsford felt that it would demoralize his troops. The column then proceeded to [[Battle of Rorke's Drift|Rorke's Drift]]\n\n[[File:Garnet Wolseley.jpg|thumb|[[Field Marshal]] [[Garnet Wolseley|Lord Wolseley]]]]\nThough Isandlwana was a disaster for the British, the Zulu victory did not end the war. With the defeat of Chelmsford's central column, the invasion of Zululand collapsed and would have to be restaged. Not only were there heavy manpower casualties to the Main Column, but most of the supplies, ammunition and draught animals were lost.<ref>Knight (2002), p. 89</ref> As King Cetshwayo feared, the embarrassment of the defeat would force the policy makers in London, who to this point had not supported the war, to rally to the support of the pro-war contingent in the Natal government and commit whatever resources were needed to defeat the Zulus. Despite local numerical superiority, the Zulus did not have the manpower, technological resources, or logistical capacity to match the British in another, more extended, campaign.<ref>Shillington, Kevin. ''Encyclopedia of African history'', Volume 1, 2005, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}, p. 71, \"...&nbsp;need to tend to cattle and crops&nbsp;...\". Colenso, pp. 294\u201395; Knight, Ian and McBride, Angus. ''Zulu 1816\u20131906'', p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Zulus may have missed an opportunity to exploit their victory and possibly win the war that day on their own territory. The reconnaissance force under Chelmsford was more vulnerable to being defeated by an attack than the camp. It was strung out and somewhat scattered, it had marched with limited rations and ammunition it could not now replace, and it was panicky and demoralized by the defeat at Isandlwana.<ref>Thompson, pp. 47, 63, 75</ref>\n\nNear the end of the battle, about 4,000 Zulu warriors of the unengaged reserve Undi impi, after cutting off the retreat of the survivors to the Buffalo River southwest of Isandlwana, crossed the river and attacked the fortified mission station at [[Rorke's Drift]]. The station was defended by only 140 British soldiers, who nonetheless inflicted considerable casualties and repelled the attack. Elsewhere, the left and right flanks of the invading forces were now isolated and without support. The No. 1 column under the command of [[Charles Pearson (British Army officer)|Charles Pearson]] was besieged for two months by a Zulu force at [[Eshowe]], while the No. 4 column under [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Evelyn Wood]] halted its advance and spent most of the next two months skirmishing in the northwest around Tinta's Kraal.<ref>Lock, pp. 284\u201385</ref><ref>Knight (2002), p. 90</ref>\n\nFollowing Isandlwana and Rorke's Drift, the British and Colonials were in complete panic over the possibility of a counter invasion of Natal by the Zulus.<ref>Colenso, pp. 308\u201311. Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere,'' Vol. ii.,  London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> All the towns of Natal 'laagered' up and fortified and provisions and stores were laid in.<ref>Knight, Ian. ''Zulu War 1879'', Osprey Publishing, 2003, {{ISBN|1-84176-612-7}}, p. 40.</ref> Bartle Frere stoked the fear of invasion despite the fact that, aside from Rorke's Drift, the Zulus made no attempt to cross the border. Immediately following the battle, Zulu Prince Ndanbuko urged them to advance and take the war into the colony but they were restrained by a commander, kaNthati, reminding them of Cetshwayo's prohibiting the crossing the border.<ref name=k86/> Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of Natal, Cetshwayo, still hoping to avoid outright war, had prohibited any crossing of the border in retaliation and was incensed over the violation of the border by the attack on Rorke's Drift.<ref>Colenso, p. 311, \"the Zulus who in the flush of victory crossed into Natal at Rorke's Drift&nbsp;... were called back with the words, 'Against the orders of your king!' \"</ref>\n\nThe British government's reasoning for a new invasion was threefold. The first was [[jingoistic]] to a degree and national honor demanded that the enemy, victors in one battle, should lose the war.<ref>Knight (2003), p. 8, \"Imperial pride ensured that the government in London would have to support British troops in the field, at least until military supremacy had been achieved.\". Colenso, p. 416, \"...&nbsp;the which was to 'wipe out' the disaster of Isandhlawana moved up to the front.\"</ref> The second concerned the domestic political implications at the next parliamentary elections.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\">Knight (2003), p. 67</ref> However, despite the new invasion, the [[Prime Minister of the UK|British Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] lost the [[1880 United Kingdom general election|1880 election]]. Finally, there were considerations affecting the Empire: unless the British were seen to win a clear-cut victory against the Zulus, it would send a signal that the [[British Empire]] was vulnerable and that the defeat of a British field army could alter policy.<ref>Morris, p. 446,</ref> If the Zulu victory at Isandlwana encouraged resistance elsewhere in the Empire,<ref>Martineau, J.. ''Life and Correspondence of Sir Bartle Frere'', Vol. ii., Chapter xix, London, 1895, p. 274.</ref> then committing the resources necessary to defeat the Zulus would, in the long term, prove cheaper than fighting wars that the Zulu success inspired against British [[Imperialism]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Knight 2003, p. 67\"/><ref>Colenso, p. 474, \"A considerable number of Boers who had never willingly accepted the annexation of their country by the English, had taken the opportunity&nbsp;... after the disaster of 22 January&nbsp;... to regain their independence&nbsp;...\"</ref>\n\nAfter Isandlwana, the British field army was heavily reinforced and again invaded Zululand. Sir Garnet Wolseley was sent to take command and relieve Chelmsford, as well as Bartle Frere. Chelmsford, however, avoided handing over command to Wolseley and managed to defeat the Zulus in a number of engagements, the last of which was the [[Battle of Ulundi]], followed by capture of King Cetshwayo. With the fall of the Disraeli government, Bartle Frere was recalled in August 1880 and the policy of Confederation was abandoned.<ref>Knight ''Zulu War 1879'' p. 68.</ref> The British encouraged the subkings of the Zulus to rule their subkingdoms without acknowledging a central Zulu power. By the time King Cetshwayo was allowed to return home, there was no longer an independent Zulu kingdom.<ref>Lock, pp. 287\u201389</ref>\n\nThe measure of respect that the British gained for their opponents as a result of Isandlwana can be seen in that in none of the other engagements of the Zulu War did the British attempt to fight again in their typical [[Line (formation)|linear formation]], known famously as [[The Thin Red Line (Battle of Balaclava)|the Thin Red Line]], in an open-field battle with the main Zulu impi. In the battles that followed, the British, when facing the Zulu, entrenched themselves or formed very close-order formations, such as the  [[Infantry square|square]].<ref>Hall, D.D..''Military History Journal, V.4, No.5, Squares in the Zulu War 1879'', South African Military History Society, {{ISSN|0026-4016}}, June 1979. Details and diagrams of squares used by British</ref>\n\n===Recriminations===\n{{more citations needed|date = January 2013}}\nChelmsford realised that he would need to account to the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would hardly have been time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as it was meant to be temporary.\n\nWolseley wrote on 30 September 1879 when, later in the war, the [[Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial|Prince Imperial of France]] was killed by the Zulu: \"I think this is very unfair, and is merely a repetition of what was done regarding the Isandlwana disaster where the blame was thrown upon Durnford, the real object in both instances being apparently to screen Chelmsford.\"<ref>Lock, p. 300</ref>\n\nLater, Chelmsford launched a new and successful campaign in Zululand, routing the Zulu army, capturing the Royal Kraal of Ulundi, and thus partially retrieving his reputation. He never held another field command.\n\nFollowing the war and his return to the UK, Chelmsford sought an audience with [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], who had become Prime Minister in April 1880, but his request was refused, a very public slight and a clear sign of official disapproval. Chelmsford, however, obtained an audience with [[Queen Victoria]] to personally explain the events. She asked Gladstone to meet Chelmsford; this meeting was brief, and during it Gladstone voiced his displeasure.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bambatha Rebellion]]\n* [[Battle of Adwa]]\n* [[Battle of Blood River]]\n* [[Battle of Rorke's Drift]]\n* [[British military history]]\n* [[Colony of Natal]]\n* [[List of Zulu War Victoria Cross recipients]]\n* [[Martini\u2013Henry]]\n* [[Military history of South Africa]]\n* [[Natal Native Contingent]]\n* ''[[Zulu Dawn]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Colenso|first1=Frances |author2=assisted in those portions of the work that touch on military matters by Lieut.-Colonel Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=London|publisher=Chapman and Hall|archive-url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich|isbn=1-152-31729-6|archive-date=18 June 2007|url-status=live|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Fz1CAAAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book|editor1-last=Doyle|editor1-first= Peter|editor2-last= Bennett|editor2-first= Matthew R.|title=Fields of Battle|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers|year= 2002|isbn=1-4020-0433-8|first=Tony|last= Pollard|chapter=The Mountain is their Monument|pp=118\u2013}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gump|first=James O.|authorlink=James O.

''Treasures of New York: Ralph Walker'' (TV program) [[WLIW]]</ref> and \"Architect of the Century\" by ''[[The New York Times]]'' when he received the [[AIA Gold Medal|Centennial Medal of Honor]] from the [[American Institute of Architects]].  His [[Art Deco]] designs have been called \"bold, spectacularly dynamic\", \"radical\", \"distinctive\", \"theatrical ... very dramatic\", \"syncopated and jazzy\".<ref name=treasures />\n\n==Early life and career==\nWalker was born on November 28, 1889 in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] and was raised in Connecticut and [[Rhode Island]] by a working-class family: his father was a construction worker, and he received his love of the arts from his mother, who exposed him to theatre, where he saw [[operetta]]s and other light entertainment.<ref name=treasures /> He attended Classical High School in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].\n\nIn 1907, at the age of 18, Walker was apprenticed to Providence architect Howard K. Hilton.  The three-year apprenticeship paid one dollar a week for the first year, two a week for the second year and three a week for the third.  While working there Walker attended classes at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  After two years had moved up to a design position, paying nine dollars a week.<ref name=Questionnaire/> He left during his final semester before graduating, and, in 1913, married Stella Forbes, of Providence.  He was a [[Rotch Traveling Scholar]] in 1916.<ref name=Questionnaire/>\n\nWalker practiced in various offices in [[Boston]], [[Montreal]], and [[New York City]], \"in charge of planning and design of churches, monumental buildings, universities and commercial buildings.\"<ref name=Questionnaire/>\n\n==Military service==\nIn [[World War I]], Walker served in the  [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] as a second lieutenant in the Camouflage Section, from 1917 to 1918,<ref name=Questionnaire/> as did many other artists, sculptors and architects.<ref name=treasures />\n\n==Career==\nIn 1919, at age 30, after his return from Europe for his military service, Walker was offered a junior design position with [[McKenzie, Voorhees and Gmelin]], a New York [[HLW International#Predecessor Firms: McKenzie, Voorhees, Gmelin, and Walker (1910-1926)|firm]] that was the [[HLW International#Cyrus L. W. Eidlitz (1885-1910)|successor firm]] to the one begun by [[Cyrus L. W. Eidlitz]].  Walker was to remain there for the remainder of his career.\n\nSkyscraper design was to be the focus of Walker's career, and he was to be influential in determining what they would should look like. He said of it:\n\n<blockquote>The skyscraper is the only means of living in this age of machine. It is an expression and reflection of the age.<ref name=treasures /></blockquote>\n\nAnd of the designer of these buildings:\n\n<blockquote>The architect of the future will have to be a psychologist, because it is as important for the architect to design a building for man to be mentally comfortable in as it is for him to design one in which he will be physically comfortable.<ref name=treasures /></blockquote>\n\nIn his first few years with the firm, Walker used his Beaux-Arts training to provide support for the firm's ongoing commissions for projects like the  Brooklyn Municipal Building,<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/resources/brook_munibldg.shtml Brooklyn Municipal Building] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505073119/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/resources/brook_munibldg.shtml |date=May 5, 2011 }} on NYC.gov</ref> completed in 1924, and the Brooklyn Edison Company Building, completed in 1923.\n\nWith his design for the Barclay-Vesey Building (1922\u20131926), commissioned by [[New York Telephone]] in 1921, Walker became a lead designer and took McKenzie, Voorhees and Gmelin in a new direction.  The Barclay-Vesey Building, now known as the [[Verizon Building]] at 140 West Street in New York City, is credited as being the first skyscraper to use the New York [[1916 Zoning Resolution]] as a design asset.<ref>[[Robert A. M. Stern|Stern, Robert A. M.]], Gilmartin, Patrick and Mellins, Thomas. (1987) ''New York 1930: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Two World Wars''. New York: Rizzoli International Publications.</ref> Inspired in part by [[Hugh Ferriss]]'s theoretical drawings exhibited in 1922, Walker created a massive asymmetrical tower set back from its base. The design led the way for a generation of skyscrapers built using the set-back principle.  It has also been described as the first [[Art Deco]] skyscraper because of its inventive ornament surrounding doorways and windows and elevator foyers.<ref>Robinson, Cervin and [[Rosemarie Haag Bletter|Bletter, Rosemarie Haag]] (1977) ''Skyscraper Style: Art Deco New York''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>  As a result of the success of the design, Walker made partner in the firm and its name was changed to [[Voorhees, Gmelin, and Walker]] in 1926.  Befitting his success, Walker moved to the suburbs of New York, to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].<ref name=treasures />\n\nAfter the completion of the Barclay-Vesey Building, Walker designed several other buildings using its combination of asymmetrical setbacks and towers with Art Deco ornament, including the [[Salvation Army]] Headquarters (1929\u201330) on West 14th Street, the [[Irving Trust]] Bank at [[1 Wall Street]] (1928\u201331),<ref>Daniel Abramson, ''Skyscraper Rivals''. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2000.</ref> and several other telephone buildings throughout New York City and the state, including those in Syracuse and Rochester as well as the [[New Jersey Bell Headquarters Building]].\n  \nDuring the 1930s as Art Deco waned, Walker was deeply involved with the planning of the 1933 [[Century of Progress]] Exposition in Chicago and in the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].\n\nWalker was an active member of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) and became its president in 1949.<ref name=Questionnaire/>  During his two-year presidency he was instrumental in establishing the AIA's College of Fellows<ref>[http://www.aia.org/practicing/groups/cof/AIAS077445 AIA website]</ref> which gained approval in 1952.<ref>American Institute of Architects (2007) ''The History and Directory of the College of Fellows'' Washington, D.C.: AIA.</ref> In 1957, on the occasion of the AIA's 100th anniversary, the AIA recognized Walker's extraordinary service to the profession by creating a special award for him, the [[AIA Gold Medal|AIA Centennial Medal of Honor (Gold Medal)]].

''Treasures of New York: Ralph Walker'' (TV program) [[WLIW]]</ref> and \"Architect of the Century\" by ''[[The New York Times]]'' when he received the [[AIA Gold Medal|Centennial Medal of Honor]] from the [[American Institute of Architects]].  His [[Art Deco]] designs have been called \"bold, spectacularly dynamic\", \"radical\", \"distinctive\", \"theatrical ... very dramatic\", \"syncopated and jazzy\".<ref name=treasures />\n\n==Early life and career==\nWalker was born on November 28, 1889 in [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] and was raised in Connecticut and [[Rhode Island]] by a working-class family: his father was a construction worker, and he received his love of the arts from his mother, who exposed him to theatre, where he saw [[operetta]]s and other light entertainment.<ref name=treasures /> He attended Classical High School in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].\n\nIn 1907, at the age of 18, Walker was apprenticed to Providence architect Howard K. Hilton.  The three-year apprenticeship paid one dollar a week for the first year, two a week for the second year and three a week for the third.  While working there Walker attended classes at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  After two years had moved up to a design position, paying nine dollars a week.<ref name=Questionnaire/> He left during his final semester before graduating, and, in 1913, married Stella Forbes, of Providence.  He was a [[Rotch Traveling Scholar]] in 1916.<ref name=Questionnaire/>\n\nWalker practiced in various offices in [[Boston]], [[Montreal]], and [[New York City]], \"in charge of planning and design of churches, monumental buildings, universities and commercial buildings.\"<ref name=Questionnaire/>\n\n==Military service==\nIn [[World War I]], Walker served in the  [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] of the [[American Expeditionary Force]] as a second lieutenant in the Camouflage Section, from 1917 to 1918,<ref name=Questionnaire/> as did many other artists, sculptors and architects.<ref name=treasures />\n\n==Career==\nIn 1919, at age 30, after his return from Europe for his military service, Walker was offered a junior design position with [[McKenzie, Voorhees and Gmelin]], a New York [[HLW International#Predecessor Firms: McKenzie, Voorhees, Gmelin, and Walker (1910-1926)|firm]] that was the [[HLW International#Cyrus L. W. Eidlitz (1885-1910)|successor firm]] to the one begun by [[Cyrus L. W. Eidlitz]].  Walker was to remain there for the remainder of his career.\n\nSkyscraper design was to be the focus of Walker's career, and he was to be influential in determining what they would should look like. He said of it:\n\n<blockquote>The skyscraper is the only means of living in this age of machine. It is an expression and reflection of the age.<ref name=treasures /></blockquote>\n\nAnd of the designer of these buildings:\n\n<blockquote>The architect of the future will have to be a psychologist, because it is as important for the architect to design a building for man to be mentally comfortable in as it is for him to design one in which he will be physically comfortable.<ref name=treasures /></blockquote>\n\nIn his first few years with the firm, Walker used his Beaux-Arts training to provide support for the firm's ongoing commissions for projects like the  Brooklyn Municipal Building,<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/resources/brook_munibldg.shtml Brooklyn Municipal Building] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505073119/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcas/html/resources/brook_munibldg.shtml |date=2011-05-05 }} on NYC.gov</ref> completed in 1924, and the Brooklyn Edison Company Building, completed in 1923.\n\nWith his design for the Barclay-Vesey Building (1922\u20131926), commissioned by [[New York Telephone]] in 1921, Walker became a lead designer and took McKenzie, Voorhees and Gmelin in a new direction.  The Barclay-Vesey Building, now known as the [[Verizon Building]] at 140 West Street in New York City, is credited as being the first skyscraper to use the New York [[1916 Zoning Resolution]] as a design asset.<ref>[[Robert A. M. Stern|Stern, Robert A. M.]], Gilmartin, Patrick and Mellins, Thomas. (1987) ''New York 1930: Architecture and Urbanism Between the Two World Wars''. New York: Rizzoli International Publications.</ref> Inspired in part by [[Hugh Ferriss]]'s theoretical drawings exhibited in 1922, Walker created a massive asymmetrical tower set back from its base. The design led the way for a generation of skyscrapers built using the set-back principle.  It has also been described as the first [[Art Deco]] skyscraper because of its inventive ornament surrounding doorways and windows and elevator foyers.<ref>Robinson, Cervin and [[Rosemarie Haag Bletter|Bletter, Rosemarie Haag]] (1977) ''Skyscraper Style: Art Deco New York''. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>  As a result of the success of the design, Walker made partner in the firm and its name was changed to [[Voorhees, Gmelin, and Walker]] in 1926.  Befitting his success, Walker moved to the suburbs of New York, to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].<ref name=treasures />\n\nAfter the completion of the Barclay-Vesey Building, Walker designed several other buildings using its combination of asymmetrical setbacks and towers with Art Deco ornament, including the [[Salvation Army]] Headquarters (1929\u201330) on West 14th Street, the [[Irving Trust]] Bank at [[1 Wall Street]] (1928\u201331),<ref>Daniel Abramson, ''Skyscraper Rivals''. New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 2000.</ref> and several other telephone buildings throughout New York City and the state, including those in Syracuse and Rochester as well as the [[New Jersey Bell Headquarters Building]].\n  \nDuring the 1930s as Art Deco waned, Walker was deeply involved with the planning of the 1933 [[Century of Progress]] Exposition in Chicago and in the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].\n\nWalker was an active member of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA) and became its president in 1949.<ref name=Questionnaire/>  During his two-year presidency he was instrumental in establishing the AIA's College of Fellows<ref>[http://www.aia.org/practicing/groups/cof/AIAS077445 AIA website]</ref> which gained approval in 1952.<ref>American Institute of Architects (2007) ''The History and Directory of the College of Fellows'' Washington, D.C.: AIA.</ref> In 1957, on the occasion of the AIA's 100th anniversary, the AIA recognized Walker's extraordinary service to the profession by creating a special award for him, the [[AIA Gold Medal|AIA Centennial Medal of Honor (Gold Medal)]].

Depending on the circumstances, people were stowed away in order to hide themselves, or to be transported as slaves.

Seaports, train stations, and airports often attempt further security by designating restricted areas with signs saying \"Authorized Personnel Only\".\n\nSince the [[September 11 attacks]], it has become more difficult to be a stowaway on board transportation arriving to or departing from the United States. Airport security has dramatically increased, and among the new security measures is trained professionals watching over the fences from which stowaways usually gain entrance to an airport's runway.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Deadly Voyage]]''\n* [[Freedom of Movement]]\n* [[Human mail]]\n* [[Illegal emigration]]\n* [[Marilyn Hartman]]\n* [[Train surfing]] ([[Freighthopping]])\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Category:Stowaways}}\n* [http://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/oamtechreports/1990s/media/AM96-25.pdf Survival at high altitudes: wheel-well passengers]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=8853837&query_hl=3&itool=pubmed_docsum Aviat Space Environ Med. 1996 Aug;67(8):784-6]\n* [http://www.flightsafety.org/hf/hf_may-jun97.pdf The 1996 study was updated and published by The Flight Safety Foundation in 1997]\n\n[[Category:Stowaways|*]]\n[[Category:Crimes]]\n[[Category:Traffic participants]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{short description|One who transports oneself surrepticiously}}\n[[File:Astrakhan trams, 1041 stowaway.jpg|thumb|A stowaway on a tram in [[Astrakhan]], Russia]]\n[[File:Chinasmuggle lg.jpg|thumb|A [[intermodal container|shipping container]] in which 22 stowaways were captured in the [[Port of Seattle]]]]\n\nA '''stowaway''' is a person who secretly boards a [[vehicle]], such as a [[ship]], an [[fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]], a [[train]], [[truck|cargo truck]] or [[bus]].\n\nSometimes, the purpose is to get from one place to another without paying for transportation.

[[Airport]]s, sea [[port]]s and [[train station]]s are typically marked as \"no [[trespass]]ing\" or \"[[private property]]\" zones to anyone but customers and employees. Seaports, train stations, and airports often attempt further security by designating restricted areas with signs saying \"Authorized Personnel Only\".\n\nSince the [[September 11 attacks]], it has become more difficult to be a stowaway on board transportation arriving to or departing from the United States. Airport security has dramatically increased, and among the new security measures is trained professionals watching over the fences from which stowaways usually gain entrance to an airport's runway.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Deadly Voyage]]''\n* [[Freedom of Movement]]\n* [[Human mail]]\n* [[Illegal emigration]]\n* [[Marilyn Hartman]]\n* [[Train surfing]] ([[Freighthopping]])\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Category:Stowaways}}\n* [http://www.faa.gov/data_research/research/med_humanfacs/oamtechreports/1990s/media/AM96-25.pdf Survival at high altitudes: wheel-well passengers]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=8853837&query_hl=3&itool=pubmed_docsum Aviat Space Environ Med. 1996 Aug;67(8):784-6]\n* [http://www.flightsafety.org/hf/hf_may-jun97.pdf The 1996 study was updated and published by The Flight Safety Foundation in 1997]\n\n[[Category:Stowaways|*]]\n[[Category:Crimes]]\n[[Category:Traffic participants]]\n", "name_user": "Alexceltare2", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stowaway"}

The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained the reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6\u20132\u20131 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]].\nMidway through the [[1931 NFL season|1931 season]], the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 81\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 81</ref>\n\n===Wray and Bell era (1933\u20131940)===\nAfter more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement, the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a syndicate headed by [[Bert Bell]] and [[Lud Wray]] and awarded them the assets of the failed Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell-Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2500|1931}}}} today) and assumed a total debt of $11,000 that was owed to three other NFL franchises.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 82\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 82</ref> Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle insignia of the [[National Recovery Administration]]\u2014the centerpiece of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 82\" />\u2014Bell and Wray named the new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. Although this makes it appear that the Yellow Jackets sat out the 1932 season and returned as the Eagles in 1933. However, neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two franchises as the same, citing the aforementioned period of dormancy. Furthermore, almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles' first roster.\n\nThe Eagles, along with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the now-defunct [[Cincinnati Reds (NFL)|Cincinnati Reds]], joined the NFL as [[expansion team]]s. Wray became the Eagles first head coach after being convinced by Bell, his former teammate at [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]], to take the position. The team originally planned to play their home games at Shibe Park, which was the home of the [[History of the Philadelphia Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] baseball club. When negotiations fell through the team managed to make a deal with the Athletics' crosstown rival, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] to play at the [[Baker Bowl]].\n\nThe Eagles played their first game on October 15, [[1933 NFL season|1933]], against the [[1933 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] at the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]]. They lost the game 56-0.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jt-sw.com/football/pro/results.nsf/Teams/1933-phi | title = 1933 Philadelphia Eagles | accessdate = October 27, 2011 | last = Troan | first = John | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121015081415/http://www.jt-sw.com/football/pro/results.nsf/Teams/1933-phi | archive-date = October 15, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> The Eagles struggled over the course of their first decade, never winning more than four games. Their best finish was in their second season, [[1934 NFL season|1934]], when they finished tied for third in the East. For the most part, the Eagles' early rosters were composed of former Penn, [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] and [[Villanova Wildcats football|Villanova]] players who played for a few years before going on to other things.\n[[File:Aerial view of Municipal Stadium, Philadelphia, Pa (65080) (cropped1).jpg|left|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Municipal Stadium]] was the Eagles home field from 1936-1939 and then again in 1941]]\nIn [[1935 NFL season|1935]] Bell proposed an annual [[NFL Draft|college draft]] to equalize talent across the league. The draft was a revolutionary concept in professional sports. Having teams select players in inverse order of their finish in the standings, a practice still followed today, strove to increase fan interest by guaranteeing that even the worst teams would have the opportunity for annual infusions of the best college talent.<ref name=\"NFL Chronology p. 351\">{{cite web | url = http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Chronology_2011.pdf | title = Chronology of Professional Football | accessdate = October 27, 2011 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6DCht2jkd?url=http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/history/pdfs/History/Chronology_2011.pdf | archive-date = December 26, 2012 | url-status = live }}</ref> Between 1927 (the year the NFL changed from a sprawling Midwestern-based association to a narrower, major-market league) and 1934, a triopoly of three teams (the [[Chicago Bears]], [[New York Giants]] and [[Green Bay Packers]]) had won all but one title since [[1927 NFL season|1927]] (the lone exception being the [[Providence Steam Roller]] of 1928). By [[1936 NFL season|1936]] the club had suffered significant financial losses and was sold through a public auction. Bert Bell was the only bidder and became the sole owner of the team. Wray refused a reduction in his salary and left the team. Bell assumed the head coaching position and led the team to a  record of 1-11, for last place in the league.\n\nIn [[1940 NFL season|1940]] the Eagles moved to [[Shibe Park]] (renamed [[Connie Mack Stadium]] in 1954) and played their home games at the stadium through 1957, except for during the 1941 season, which was played at [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|Municipal Stadium]], where they had played from 1936 to 1939. To accommodate football at Shibe Park during the winter, management set up stands in right field, parallel to 20th Street. Some 20 feet high, these \"east stands\" had 22 rows of seats. The goalposts stood along the first base line and in left field. The uncovered east stands enlarged capacity of Shibe Park to over 39,000, but the Eagles rarely drew more than 25,000 to 30,000.<ref>{{cite book |title=To Every Thing a Season: Shibe Park and Urban Philadelphia, 1909\u20131976 |last=Kuklick |first=Bruce |year=1993 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02104-X |page=86 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=1mN2Ejq-5VMC&pg=PA86 |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}</ref> The team finished the 1937 season 2-8-1 and would continue to struggle over the next three seasons. \n[[File:Grand Stand Entrance of Shibe Park.jpg|thumb|[[Shibe Park|Connie Mack Stadium]] was the Eagles home field in 1940 and then from 1942-1957]]\n\n===Greasy Neale era (1941\u20131950)===\n{{See also|1947 NFL Championship Game|1948 NFL Championship Game|1949 NFL Championship Game}}\nIn December 1940, Bell conciliated the sale of [[Art Rooney]]'s Steelers to [[Alexis Thompson (American football owner)|Alexis Thompson]],<ref name=\"Algeo: 16\">Algeo: 16</ref> and then Rooney acquired half of Bell's interest in the Eagles.<ref>Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 183\u2013184; cf.

The [[1942 NFL season|1942]] season showed no improvement as the team went 2-9.\n\n====\"Steagles\" (1943)====\nIn [[1943 NFL season|1943]] when manpower shortages stemming from World War II made it impossible to fill the roster, the team merged with the Pittsburgh Steelers forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\", known as the \"[[Steagles]].\" Greasy Neale coached the team along with Steelers head coach [[Walt Kiesling]]. The team finished the season with a 5\u20134\u20131 record.

An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\nWith the turn of the decade came another turn in team fortunes. In [[1950 NFL season|1950]] the Eagles were slated to open the season against the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] champion [[Cleveland Browns]], who had just (along with the other AAFC franchises) joined the NFL. The Eagles were expected to make short work of the Browns, who at the time were widely considered the dominant team in a lesser league. However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35\u201310 rout. The Eagles never really recovered, and finished 6\u20136.\n\n===McMillin, Millner, Trimble and Devore era (1951-1957)===\nGreasy Neale retired after the 1950 season and was replaced by [[Bo McMillin]]. Two games into the [[1951 Philadelphia Eagles season|1951]] season, McMillin was forced to retire due to terminal [[stomach cancer]]. [[Wayne Millner]] finished out the season before being replaced by [[Jim Trimble]].\n\nWhile the remnants of the great 1940s teams managed to stay competitive for the first few years of the decade, and while younger players like Bobby Walston and [[Sonny Jurgensen]] occasionally provided infusions of talent, the team lacked the stuff of true greatness for most of the 1950s.\n\nAfter the [[1957 Philadelphia Eagles season|1957]] season, the Eagles moved from Connie Mack Stadium to [[Franklin Field]] at the University of Pennsylvania. Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles, whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.<ref name=\"The Eagles Encyclopedia\">{{cite book |title=The Eagles Encyclopedia |last=Didinger |first=Ray |author2=Robert S.

During the [[1959 NFL season|1959]] season the team showed real flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell, who at the time was the commissioner of the NFL, attended a game on October 11 at Franklin Field. The Eagles were facing the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team who Bell also used to own. The Eagles had box seats reserved for him but Bell refused them and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter of the game while sitting behind the end zone, he had suffered a heart attack and died later that day.      [[File:Penn - Franklin Field - 1922.jpg|thumb|232x232px|Franklin Field was the Eagles home field from 1958 to 1970]]\n\n====NFL Champions (1960)====\n[[1960 NFL season|1960]] remains the most celebrated year in Eagles history. Shaw, Van Brocklin and [[Chuck Bednarik]] (each in his last season before retirement) led a team more notable for its grit than its talent (one observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\") to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, WR [[Tommy McDonald (American football)|Tommy McDonald]] (who would later pen a short autobiography titled \"They Pay Me to Catch Footballs\") and TE [[Pete Retzlaff]]. On December 26, 1960, one of the coldest days in recorded Philadelphia history, the Eagles faced [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[Green Bay Packers]] in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1960|NFL title game]] and dealt the mighty Lombardi the sole championship game loss of his storied career. Bednarik lined up at center on offense and at linebacker on defense.

Ownership, however, opted to promote assistant coach [[Nick Skorich]] instead, and Van Brocklin quit the organization in a fit of pique, instead becoming head coach of the expansion [[Minnesota Vikings]]. \nBack up quarterback [[Sonny Jurgensen]] became the starter for the [[1961 NFL season|1961 season]]. The team finished just a half-game behind the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] for first place in the Eastern Conference standings with a 10\u20134 record. Despite the on-the-field success, however, the franchise was in turmoil.\n\nThe [[1962 NFL season|1962]] team was decimated by injury, and managed only three wins and were embarrassed at home in a 49\u20130 loss against the Packers. The off-field chaos would continue through [[1963 NFL season|1963]], as the remaining 65 shareholders out of the original Happy Hundred sold the team to [[Jerry Wolman]], a 36-year-old millionaire Washington developer who outbid local bidders for the team, paying an unprecedented $5.505 million for control of the club. In [[1964 NFL season|1964]] Wolman hired former Cardinals and [[Washington Redskins]] coach [[Joe Kuharich]] to a 15-year contract. Over the next five seasons the team failed to make the playoffs each year.\n\nIn [[1969 NFL season|1969]] [[Leonard Tose]] bought the Eagles from Wolman for $16.155 million<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf |title=Year-by-Year History |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129104352/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf |archivedate=January 29, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|16155000|1969}}}} today), then a record for a professional sports franchise. Tose's first official act was to fire Coach [[Joe Kuharich]] after a disappointing 24\u201341\u20131 record during his five-year reign. He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great [[Pete Retzlaff]] as [[General manager|General Manager]] and [[Jerry Williams (American football)|Jerry Williams]] as coach.\n\n[[File:VeteransStadium1986-2a.jpg|thumb|right|269x269px|Veterans Stadium, Eagles home field from 1971 to 2002.]]\nWith the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] of the NFL and [[American Football League|AFL]] in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the Eagles were placed in the [[NFC East]] Division with their [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|archrivals]] the [[New York Giants]], the [[Washington Redskins]], and the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Their heated [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|rivalry]] with the Giants is the oldest of the [[NFC East]] rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933 and is often named as one of the best rivalries in the NFL.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Birds' Biggest Rival\u2014In a division of fierce foes, the Giants have battled the Eagles as tough as anyone |date=September 17, 2006 |first=Bob |last=Brookover |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |page=D1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Eagles\u2014Giants among top rivalries |date=November 6, 2008 |first=Bob |last=Brookover |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |page=D6}}</ref> 1970 was also the last season for the Eagles at Franklin Field; the team finished the first post-merger season in last place in their division at 3-10-1.\n\nIn 1971 the Eagles moved from Franklin Field to brand-new [[Veterans Stadium]]. In its first season, the \u201cVet\u201d was widely acclaimed as a triumph of ultra-modern sports engineering, a consensus that would be short-lived. Equally short-lived was Williams' tenure as head coach.  After a 3\u201310\u20131 record in 1970 and three consecutive blowout losses to Cincinnati, Dallas and San Francisco to open the [[1971 NFL season|1971 season]], Williams was fired and replaced by assistant coach Ed Khayat, a defensive lineman on the Eagles' 1960 NFL championship team. Williams and Khayat were hampered by Retzlaff's decision to trade longtime starting quarterback [[Norm Snead]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in early 1971, leaving the Eagles a choice between journeyman [[Pete Liske]] and the raw [[Rick Arrington]].\n\nKhayat lost his first two games, but won six of the final nine in 1971 thanks to the exploits of the defense, led by All-Pro safety [[Bill Bradley (American football)|Bill Bradley]], who led the NFL in interceptions (11) and interception return yardage (248).\n\nThe team regressed in [[1972 NFL season|1972]], and Khayat was released after the Eagles finished 2\u201311\u20131. The two wins (both on the road) proved to be surprises, however. Philadelphia beat the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (which had the best record in the AFC a year before) 21\u201320 and the [[Houston Oilers]] 18\u201317 on six field goals by kicker [[Tom Dempsey]]. The latter game became known as the \"Johnny Rodgers Bowl\", because the loser would finish with the worst record in the league and obtain the first overall draft pick of 1973, which was then assumed to be Nebraska wingback [[Johnny Rodgers]]. The Oilers ultimately got the first overall pick, which instead turned out to be University of Tampa defensive end [[John Matuszak]] (who would end up facing Philadelphia in the Super Bowl several years later). With the second pick, the Eagles selected [[USC Trojans football|USC]] tight end [[Charle Young]].\n\n===Mike McCormack era (1973-1975)===\nKhayat was replaced by offensive guru [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]], for the [[1973 NFL season|1973 season]]. Aided by the skills of [[Roman Gabriel]] and towering young receiver [[Harold Carmichael]], they managed to infuse a bit of vitality into a previously moribund offense.\n\nNew general manager [[Jim Murray (American football)|Jim Murray]] also began to add talent on the defensive side of the line, most notably through the addition of future Pro Bowl linebacker [[Bill Bergey]] in [[1974 NFL season|1974]]. Overall, however, the team was still mired in mediocrity. McCormack was fired after a 4\u201310 [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]].\n\n===Dick Vermeil era (1976\u20131982)===\n{{See also|Super Bowl XV}}\nIn {{nfly|1976}}, [[Dick Vermeil]] was hired from [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] to coach the Eagles, who had only one winning season from 1962 to 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O70MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gV8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2239,224559&dq=dick+vermeil&hl=en |title=Eagles search ends with Vermeil |date=February 9, 1976 |work=St Petersburg Times |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117035452/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O70MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gV8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2239,224559&dq=dick+vermeil&hl=en |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVermeil faced numerous obstacles as he attempted to rejuvenate a franchise that had not seriously contended in well over a decade. Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the [[1976 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] finished [[1976 NFL season|1976]] with the same result\u2014a 4\u201310 record\u2014as in 1975. In [[1977 NFL season|1977]] the first seeds of hope begin to sprout. Rifle-armed quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] was obtained by trade with the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for popular tight end Charlie Young. The defense, led by Bergey and defensive coordinator [[Marion Campbell]], began earning a reputation as one of the hardest hitting in the league. [[File:dickvermeil.jpg|thumb|288x288px|right|[[Dick Vermeil]], Eagles head coach from 1976 to 1982]]\nBy the [[1977 NFL season|next year]], the Eagles had fully taken Vermeil's enthusiastic attitude, and made the playoffs for the first time since 1960. Young running back [[Wilbert Montgomery]] became the first Eagle since Steve Van Buren to exceed 1,000 yards in a single season. [[1978 NFL season|1978]] also bore witness to one of the greatest moments in Eagles history: \"[[The Miracle at the Meadowlands]],\" when [[Herman Edwards]] returned a late-game fumble by [[1978 New York Giants season|Giants]]' quarterback [[Joe Pisarcik]] for a touchdown with 20 seconds left, resulting in a 19\u201317 Eagles victory \u2013 the [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] would edge into the playoffs that year with a 9\u20137 season.) In [[1979 NFL season|1979]] the Eagles tied for first place with an 11\u20135 record and Wilbert Montgomery shattered the team rushing records with a total of 1,512 yards\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 20 - Cecil Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|The Eagles playing against the Buccaneers in the 1979 NFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]In [[1980 NFL season|1980]] the team dominated the NFC, facing its chief nemesis, the [[1980 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], in the NFC Championship. The game was played in cold conditions in front of the Birds' faithful fans at [[Veterans Stadium]]. Led by an incredible rushing performance from Montgomery, whose long cutback TD run in the first half is surely one of the most memorable plays in Eagles history, and a gutsy performance from fullback [[Leroy Harris (running back)|Leroy Harris]], who scored the Eagles' only other TD that day, the Birds earned a berth in [[Super Bowl XV]] with a 20\u20137 victory.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 05 - Wilbert Montgomery.jpg|thumb|The Eagles defeated the Cowboys in the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs#Conference championships|1980 NFC Championship Game]] and earned their first Super Bowl appearance.|alt=]]\n\nThe Eagles traveled to [[New Orleans]] for [[Super Bowl XV]] and were heavy favorites to knock off the [[Oakland Raiders]], who were merely a wild card team. Things did not go the Eagles' way, beginning with the disastrous decision by Tose to bring comedian [[Don Rickles]] into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood. Jaworski's first pass was intercepted by Rod Martin, setting up an Oakland touchdown. Later in the first quarter, a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Parker was nullified by an illegal motion penalty. The final score was 27\u201310. Veteran journeyman quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] was named the game's MVP.\n\nThe team got off to a great start in the [[1981 NFL season|1981 season]], winning their first six games. They eventually ended up 10\u20136 and earned a wild card berth. However, they were unable to repeat as NFC champs when they were knocked out in the wild card round by the [[New York Giants]], 27\u201321. After the Eagles finished 3\u20136 in the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]], Vermeil quit the team, citing \"burnout.\"\n\n===Marion Campbell era (1983-1985)===\nDefensive coordinator [[Marion Campbell]], aka \"the Swamp Fox\" replaced Vermeil as the head coach. Campbell had helped to popularize the \"bend-don't-break\" defensive strategy in the 1970s. Philadelphia football struggled through the mid-1980s and was marked by a malaise in fan participation. The team could not produce the same success they once had and failed to make the playoffs in [[1983 NFL season|1983]] and [[1984 NFL season|1984]].\n\nIn [[1985 NFL season|1985]] Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to [[Norman Braman]] and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65&nbsp;million (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|65000000|1985}}}} today) to pay off his more than $25&nbsp;million (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000000|1985}}}} today) in gambling debts at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] casinos. The team once again struggled during the 1985 season and Marion Campbell was fired after week 16 and replaced by assistant head coach/defensive backs coach [[Fred Bruney]] for the last game of the season.\n\nAt the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to [[Memphis Showboats]]' elite pass rusher [[Reggie White]].\n\n===Buddy Ryan era (1986\u20131990)===\n[[File:Reggie White HOF jersey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reggie White]]'s jersey shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio]]In [[1986 NFL season|1986]] the arrival of head coach [[Buddy Ryan]] and his fiery attitude rejuvenated team performance and ignited the fan base. Immediately infusing the team with his tough, hard-as-nails attitude, the Eagles quickly became known for their tough defense and tougher personalities. Ryan began rejuvenating the team by releasing several aging players, including Ron Jaworski. [[Randall Cunningham]] took his place, and despite a 5\u201310\u20131 season, he began showing considerable promise. [[1987 NFL season|1987]] saw another [[1987 NFL strike|strike]], reducing the season by one game. The substitutes who were filling in for the strikers turned in a poor performance, being crushed 41\u201322 by the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. After the strike ended, the regular Eagles [[1981 NFL season|1981]] team won a 37\u201320 revenge game against Dallas. The season record was 7\u20138, three games having been played by substitutes. The [[1988 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] would reach the [[1988\u201389 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1988 NFL season|1988]], but lost to the [[Chicago Bears]], which happened to be Ryan's former team that he helped lead to a [[Super Bowl XX]] victory as defensive coordinator. The game became known as the \"[[Fog Bowl (American football)|Fog Bowl]]\", due to the weather conditions during the game. The Eagles lost this game 20\u201312.\n\nThe following two years would see playoff appearances as well, but the team could not make it past the first round. This failure was very frustrating to many Eagles fans, as the team was commonly acknowledged as among the most talented in the NFL. On offense, the Eagles were led by quarterback Cunningham, one of the most exciting players of his generation; tight end [[Keith Jackson (tight end)|Keith Jackson]]; and running back [[Keith Byars]]. The defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history, and as the best to never win a championship.\n\n[[File:Jerome Brown of the Philadelphia Eagles (ca. 1991).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jerome Brown]], Eagles defensive end from 1987 to 1991]]\nThe two [[1989 NFL season|1989]] matches with Dallas were known as the Bounty Bowls. Both were won easily by the Eagles (the Cowboys finished 1\u201315 that year), and were marked by Ryan insulting new Cowboys coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], putting a \"bounty\" on their kicker, and for Eagles fans throwing snowballs.\n\nOn November 12, 1990, during a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game at the Vet, the [[1990 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] crushed the [[Washington Redskins]] by a score of 28\u201314, with the defense scoring three of the team's four touchdowns. More lopsided than its score would indicate, the game quickly acquired the sobriquet \"[[the Body Bag Game]]\", attesting to the physical damage inflicted by the tough Eagles squad. The Eagles knocked out the starting Washington quarterback, and then seriously injured his replacement as well. Running back [[Brian Mitchell (running back)|Brian Mitchell]], who would later be signed by the Eagles, was forced to play quarterback for the Redskins. The Redskins returned to Veterans Stadium in the first round of the [[1990\u201391 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] and defeated the Eagles 20\u20136, ending their season.\n\n===Rich Kotite era (1991-1994)===\nBuddy Ryan was fired on January 7, 1991, and was replaced by offensive coordinator [[Rich Kotite]]. The team started the [[1991 Philadelphia Eagles season|1991]] season losing starting quarterback Randall Cunningham in Week 1 due to a knee injury. Backup quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] took over the starting role for the rest of the season. Despite having the top rated defense in the league the team failed to make the playoffs, finishing third in the NFC East with a record of 10-6.\n\nOn June 25, 1992 All Pro defensive tackle [[Jerome Brown]] was killed in an automobile accident. The team and fan base became dedicated to \"bring it home for Jerome\" in the [[1992 NFL season|1992]] season. The team finished second in the NFC East with an 11-5 record and earned a Wild Card spot in the playoffs. Kotite did lead the Eagles to a playoff victory against the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the Wild Card game but would ultimately fall to the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional round. To make matters worse they lost all-time sacks leader Reggie White to free agency in the off-season.\n\nAmong the team's offensive stars during that period were quarterback [[Randall Cunningham]], tight end [[Keith Jackson (tight end)|Keith Jackson]], and running back [[Herschel Walker]]. But the \"Gang Green\" defense is possibly what defined the team, led by [[Reggie White]], [[Jerome Brown]], [[Clyde Simmons]], [[Seth Joyner]], [[Wes Hopkins]], [[Mike Golic]], [[Byron Evans]], [[Eric Allen]], [[Andre Waters]] and [[Mark McMillian]]. In [[1993 NFL season|1993]] Kotite's Eagles would fall apart after initially a promising start, and missed the playoffs, going 8\u20138.\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\nBy this point, team owner Norman Braman had become unpopular among most local fans and a polarizing presence in the front office. [[Jeffrey Lurie]] bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994 for an estimated $185&nbsp;million. The club is now estimated to be the 17th most valuable sports team, worth $1.314&nbsp;billion, as evaluated in 2014 by Forbes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdhk/no-11-philadelphia-eagles |title=The World's Most Valuable Sports Teams No. 11 Philadelphia Eagles |work=[[Forbes.com]] |date=July 12, 2011 |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203185913/http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdhk/no-11-philadelphia-eagles/ |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[File:Jeffrey-Lurie August-2010.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Jeffrey Lurie]] has owned the Eagles since 1994]]In Lurie's first season as the owner in [[1994 NFL season|1994]], the team went 7\u20139 and once again missed the playoffs. Rich Kotite was fired and was replaced by [[San Francisco 49ers]] Defensive Coordinator [[Ray Rhodes]], who successfully lobbied 49ers star [[Ricky Watters]] to join the team as a free agent.\n\n===Ray Rhodes era (1995-1998)===\nIn [[1995 NFL season|1995]], Rhodes's first season, the [[1995 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] got off to a slow start by losing 3 out their first 4 games but subsequently rebounded, finishing with a 10\u20136 record and a playoff spot. In the Wild Card Round, the Eagles played at home and overwhelmed the [[Detroit Lions]] 58\u201337, with 31 of Philadelphia's points coming in the second quarter alone. Despite this dominant performance, the Eagles were eliminated in the next round by the Cowboys yet again by a score of 30\u201311. Ironically, this would be [[Randall Cunningham]]'s last game as an Eagle. Cunningham would score the only touchdown of the game and the last Eagles postseason touchdown for six years.\n\n1995 was the end of Cunningham's tenure as starting quarterback. Rhodes benched Cunningham in favor of [[Rodney Peete]], leading to friction between the two. Before the benching, news reports circulated that Lurie and Rhodes tried to trade Cunningham to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. However, no such trade was executed and Cunningham retired shortly after the season.\n\nIn [[1996 NFL season|1996]] the [[1996 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] uniforms changed from the classic shade of [[Kelly green|Kelly Green]] to a darker [[midnight green]]. The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a Week 5 Monday night game at [[Veterans Stadium]] against the hated [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] would witness a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by [[Ty Detmer]] and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season followed an all-too-familiar pattern: 10\u20136 record, and early elimination (a 14\u20130 shutout by the [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]]) in the [[1996\u201397 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. In the [[1996 NFL draft]], future fan favorite and hall of famer [[Brian Dawkins]] was chosen in the 2nd round. The continued early playoff exits led to fans and local media blaming the high priced free agent signings ([[Irving Fryar]], Watters, [[Troy Vincent]], and [[Guy McIntyre]]) for not stepping up in big games, most notably the postseason. Rhodes gradually deteriorated under the stress of the job, and players were beginning to grow tired of his brash demeanor and often autocratic coaching style.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; When Willpower Isn't Enough: Decline of Ray Rhodes's Eagles|first=Mike|last=Freeman|date=November 4, 1998|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215024205/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|archive-date=February 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> After an up-and-down 6\u20139\u20131 campaign in [[1997 NFL season|1997]], the bottom fell out in [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. The Eagles suffered a 3\u201313 record\u2014the worst in franchise history. They were ranked dead last in numerous offensive statistics. Home game attendance was declining, a quarterback controversy was deteriorating an already rudderless locker room, and the players had all but tuned out the embattled coaching staff. Left with little choice after a disastrous season, fan revolt and sagging team morale, Lurie fired Rhodes and hired Green Bay Packers quarterbacks coach [[Andy Reid]] as the new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Eagles_hire_Packers_assistant_Andy_Reid_as_new_head_coach.html|title=Eagles hire Packers assistant Andy Reid as new head coach|first=Phil|last=Sheridan|date=|website=www.philly.com|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030105006/http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Eagles_hire_Packers_assistant_Andy_Reid_as_new_head_coach.html|archive-date=October 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Andy Reid era (1999\u20132012)===\n{{See also|Super Bowl XXXIX}}\nResurgence would come under the leadership of new head coach [[Andy Reid]], who began by drafting [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] with the second overall pick in the [[1999 NFL Draft]]. The Eagles would have had the first overall pick, but it was awarded to the rebooted [[Cleveland Browns]]. Despite clearing up roster space for new talent by releasing unpopular, aging veterans such as Watters and [[Irving Fryar]], Reid was still a virtual unknown at the time of his selection as head coach, and his appointment was met with considerable skepticism in Philadelphia. McNabb was also not considered a good choice to draft by Eagles fans. When he was drafted, many Eagles fans booed the selection, believing that the Eagles should have drafted [[Ricky Williams]]. [[File:Andy Reid 080805-F-9429S-131 crop.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Andy Reid]], Eagles head coach from 1999 to 2012]]\nThe choice proved wise, though: with Reid leading the way and McNabb emerging as one of the game's great players. However, 1999 was a rebuilding year, and the Eagles only won five games and game attendance was still looking stale: as two home games were not sold out \u2013 resulting in local [[Blackout (broadcasting)|TV blackouts]]- while the other six were only sold out due to several small business owners purchasing the remainder of the unsold tickets to spare TV viewers. The Week 5 game, on Sunday, October 10, 1999, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, saw Dallas wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]] suffer a career-ending spinal injury where Eagles fans stood up and cheered as he lay on the field. Even the TV commentators expressed their disgust at this behavior.\n\nThe [[2000 NFL season|2000]] regular season opener in Dallas (September 3), became known in NFL lore as the \"Pickle Juice Game\". Kickoff temperature in [[Texas Stadium]] was 109 degrees Fahrenheit and soared to nearly 120, making it the hottest game in league history, beating a previous record set during a 1997 Cowboys-Cardinals match in Arizona. The nickname came about because an Eagles trainer had been preparing for the projected high temperatures by having the players drink the juice from jars of dill pickles in order to retain body moisture and stave off cramps and heat exhaustion. The experiment proved a success as the Eagles won the game 44\u201314 and the Cowboys had multiple players benched for inability to handle the brutal temperatures (the Eagles had no players benched). The game also had significance because it marked the beginning of Philadelphia's domination of the NFC East and the end of the Cowboys' dominance. The  team finished the season at 11\u20135, reaching the [[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] as a wildcard team, which rejuvenated the fan base and optimism. After brushing aside the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20133, the [[2000 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose a 20\u201310 game against the [[New York Giants]].\n\n[[File:Donovan McNabb.jpg|thumb|right|210x210px|[[Donovan McNabb]], Eagles quarterback from 1999 to 2009]]After compiling an 11\u20135 record in [[2001 NFL season|2001]], the [[2001 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] reached the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] again, this time at the top of their division. In a near-rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Buccaneers]] in a 31\u20139 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] 33\u201319 at [[Soldier Field]]. Reaching the NFC Championship game, they were unable to stop the [[St. Louis Rams]], who defeated them 29\u201324\n\nDespite injuries, McNabb led the [[2002 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] to a 12\u20134 season in [[2002 NFL season|2002]]. Once again, they reached the NFC Championship, but lost at home 27\u201310 to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the last game at [[Veterans Stadium]].\n\nThe [[2003 NFL season|2003]] team lost its first two games, both at their new home. In the opening game of the season, the Eagles were shut out 17\u20130 by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the first regular season game ever played at [[Lincoln Financial Field]]. Once again, the team went 12\u20134 for the season. By reaching the conference championship game in the same year as this defeat, they became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game. They achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown catches all year from their wide receivers, which tied the league low since the regular season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 (this record would be broken in 2004 when the [[New York Giants]]' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes). The Eagle receivers went through both September and October without a TD catch \u2014 the last time an NFL team had done that was in 1945.\n\n[[File:Le Lincoln Financial Field (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|254x254px|Lincoln Financial Field has been the Eagles home field since 2003]]The Eagles actively pursued premier wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]], and acquired him in a controversial three-way deal with the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]], on March 16, 2004.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1760284 Ravens, Niners compensated in settlement-ESPN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113063228/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1760284 |date=January 13, 2016 }} Retrieved 10 July 2012.</ref> The [[2004 NFL season|2004]] season began with a bang as Owens caught three touchdown passes from McNabb in their season opener against the [[New York Giants]]. Owens would end up with exactly 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdown receptions, although his season ended prematurely with an ankle injury an on December 19 game, against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Their 12\u20137 victory in this game gave them home field advantage throughout the conference playoffs for the third year in a row.  The Eagles tied a record by clinching the NFC East division crown (their fourth straight) after only their eleventh game of the season, matching the mark set by the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]] and the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|1997 San Francisco 49ers]]. Their final two regular season games thus rendered meaningless, the Eagles sat out most of their first-string players in these games and lost them both, yet still finished with a 13\u20133 record, their best 16-game season ever.\n\n[[File:Bdawk.jpg|thumb|237x237px|[[Brian Dawkins]], Eagles safety from 1996 to 2008|alt=]]McNabb had his finest season to date, passing for 3,875 yards and 31 touchdowns, with only eight interceptions. This made him the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 or more TD passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single regular season. They then began their playoff run with the Divisional round at home against the sixth-seeded [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Eagles led from the start and never looked back, as McNabb led a very efficient passing attack (21 of 33 for 286 yards and 2 TDs), [[Brian Westbrook]] dominated on the ground with 70 rushing yards, and [[Freddie Mitchell]] performed very well on the receiving corps (5 receptions for 65 yards and a TD), as Philadelphia won 27\u201314, setting up their fourth-straight NFC Championship appearance. Facing the [[Atlanta Falcons]], McNabb threw for 180 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 32 yards. Westbrook rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 39. Winning the game 27\u201310, the Eagles advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], where they faced the [[2004 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14\u201314 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles with ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Patriots won 24\u201321.\n\nBrian Dawkins was one of the premier safeties in the NFL, and earned him the role of Eagles' defensive captain, and a mainstay on the Eagles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heath|first=John|title=Denver's Brian Dawkins: An Ageless Wolverine|url=http://broncotalk.net/2011/10/26409/denver-broncos/denvers-brian-dawkins-an-ageless-wolverine/|publisher=BroncoTalk|accessdate=April 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128221118/http://broncotalk.net/2011/10/26409/denver-broncos/denvers-brian-dawkins-an-ageless-wolverine/|archive-date=January 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe team took a step back in [[2005 NFL season|2005]] with a 6\u201310 record.

For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games, eventually being cut. In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil.  However, Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under coach Reid, with a 10\u20136 record. They won the Wild Card game, but lost in the Divisional Round. In [[2007 NFL season|2007]], they finished 8-8.

A hamstring injury took [[Michael Vick]] out after a 1\u20133 start, but his backup [[Nick Foles]] led the team to a 10\u20136 regular season record, and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles threw 19 touchdowns, which was just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by [[Peyton Manning]]. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single-game, with seven, against the [[Oakland Raiders]], which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by [[Tom Brady]], in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third highest in league history behind only [[Aaron Rodgers]] in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004. He was also only the second quarterback in NFL history to have a game in which he topped 400 passing yards and a perfect [[passer rating]]. [[LeSean McCoy]] finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL. As a whole, the Eagles offense scored 51 touchdowns, most in franchise history, passing the previous season high set back in 1948.

In a week 14 game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]], starting quarterback [[Carson Wentz]] left the game with a torn ACL, and backup [[Nick Foles]], who was re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season.\n\nFoles' first start was a comeback from a 20\u20137 deficit against the [[New York Giants]] where he scored four touchdowns and won the game 34\u201329. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the Dallas Cowboys, and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games. Despite this, the Eagles clinched home-field advantage after the win against Oakland in week 16. Foles led the Eagles past the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the Divisional Round 15\u201310. In the NFC Championship, the Eagles beat the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 38\u20137, despite being betting underdogs for the game. Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns. The Eagles traveled to [[Minneapolis]] to compete in [[Super Bowl LII]], their third attempt at a title, against [[Tom Brady]] and the [[New England Patriots]] in a rematch of [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] from 2005.[[File:Nick Foles 2014 Pro Bowl.jpg|thumb|[[Nick Foles]] was named as [[Super Bowl LII]]'s most valuable player.|200px]][[File:Super Bowl 1F2868F4.jpg|thumb|left|Zach Ertz after catching a touchdown in [[Super Bowl LII]]|235x235px]]\nWith Foles at the helm, the game's first touchdown was scored by the Eagles taking only three plays: a short pass from Foles to [[Nelson Agholor]], a 36-yard run up the middle by [[LeGarrette Blount]], and a 34-yard touchdown pass from Foles to Alshon Jeffery on the left side of the field. The ensuing extra point attempt from Elliott was missed wide right, which made the score 9\u20133 in favor of the Eagles.

Deciding to go for the touchdown, they attempted a similar trick play to the one that had failed for the Patriots earlier. It would become the most memorable play of the game. As Foles stepped up to the running back position, Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end [[Trey Burton]], who then threw the ball to Foles, who was wide open in the right side of the end zone. Foles caught the ball, making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and the ensuing extra point was good, giving the Eagles a 22\u201312 lead, which was taken into the locker room after a short drive by the Patriots. The play came to be known as the [[Philly Special]].<ref name=PBP/> The Eagles won their first [[Vince Lombardi Trophy]] in franchise history,<ref name=PBP /> and their first league championship since 1960, ending the third-longest active championship drought in the NFL at 57 years.\n\n[[File:Super Bowl 402EF3AA.jpg|thumb|Vince Lombardi Trophy presentation after the game.|240x240px|alt=|left]] New England's only lead was by one point in the fourth quarter, 33\u201332. The Eagles rallied back and scored an 11-yard touchdown to tight end [[Zach Ertz]]. The last score of the game was a 46-yard field goal by [[Jake Elliott]] to make the final score 41\u201333. The franchise won their first Super Bowl ever and their first championship since 1960. Foles won [[Super Bowl MVP]] going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown. Foles became the first backup quarterback to start and win a Super Bowl since his opponent Tom Brady won as the backup for [[Drew Bledsoe]] in 2002's [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].\n\nThe combined 74 points scored was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75, set in [[Super Bowl XXIX]] in 1995; this game marked only the second time in the history of the Super Bowl where the teams combined for 70+ points.<ref>{{cite news|last=Stites|first=Adam|title=The Patriots and Eagles gave us the 2nd highest-scoring Super Bowl ever|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2018/2/4/16972266/super-bowl-history-highest-scoring-record-eagles-patriots|website=SB Nation|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 6, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206131539/https://www.sbnation.com/2018/2/4/16972266/super-bowl-history-highest-scoring-record-eagles-patriots|archivedate=February 6, 2018}}</ref> The game also set a record for most yardage by both teams (combined) with 1,151 yards, the most for any single game, regular season or postseason.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The game set many other Super Bowl records as well, including fewest punts from both teams (one), most yards gained by a team (613 for New England) and most points scored by a losing team (33).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nBefore the [[2018 NFL season|2018]] season started, many injuries plagued the team, including quarterback Carson Wentz, who was still recovering from the ACL injury that he sustained the previous season. Nick Foles would be the starting quarterback to begin the season and helped the team win their opening game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]] by a score of 18-12. Throughout the 2018 season many injuries plagued the team, especially in their secondary. [[Jalen Mills]], [[Ronald Darby]], and [[Rodney McLeod]] all went down with injuries during the season. The Eagles had a 4\u20136 record in their first 10 games and looked to have very little chance of making the playoffs, but the Eagles managed to win 5 of their last 6 games, including upset victories over the Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans to go 9\u20137 and make the playoffs as the sixth seed.\n\nIn the Wild Card game against the [[Chicago Bears]] Nick Foles threw 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in a 16\u201315 win. Bears kicker [[Cody Parkey]] missed a game winning field goal that hit left post and the crossbar. The kick was tipped slightly by [[Treyvon Hester]]. This sent the Philadelphia Eagles to a NFC Divisional matchup against the [[New Orleans Saints]]. In the NFC Division match with the Saints, the Eagles ended the first quarter with a 14\u20130 lead. However, the offense was unable to get any more points as the Saints defense got pressure on Nick Foles and the Eagles ended up losing by a score of 20\u201314, ending their opportunity to defend their Super Bowl victory.\n\nIn 2019 the Eagles matched their 9\u20137 record from 2018.

In 1954 the Eagles, along with the [[Baltimore Colts]], became the second team ever in the NFL to put a [[Logo#Sports|logo]] on their [[football helmet|helmets]], with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings took on a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from '69\u201372, the eagle took on a more stylized look.\n\nIn 1973 the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look.\n\nHowever, both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996. The primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \"midnight green.\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed in 1996, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-based style, and the lettering changing from calligraphic to block letters.\n\nSince the 1996 alterations, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly relating to jersey/pant combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at [[Veterans Stadium]], a win over the division-rival [[2002 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010.\n\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though only subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected [[home (sports)|home]] games each season (usually the first home game after a [[bye (sports)|bye]] week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular season home finales, the team wore the green [[road (sports)|road]] pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost both games. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th anniversary uniforms serving as the \"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules at the time (alternate uniforms were permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving]] night game against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]]. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s.\n\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore [[throwback uniform|\"throwback\" jerseys]] in a 2007 game against the [[2007 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on [[flag of Philadelphia|Philadelphia's city flag]], are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and were the same colors used by the former [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] franchise prior to their suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56\u201321.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724212544/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archivedate=July 24, 2010 |title=Eagles Unveil 75th Anniversary Plans |publisher=Philadelphia Eagles |date=April 25, 2007 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they had done it earlier), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion, the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] on November 4, 2007, in order to make the Cowboys wear their blue road jerseys. Upon moving to [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather.\n\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |title=Eagles Announce Plans to Honor 1960 Title Team |publisher=Csnphilly.com |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730121316/http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |archivedate=July 30, 2012}}</ref> In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\n\nFor the 2012 season, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Reebok]] as the NFL's official apparel licensee, but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \"Elite 51\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo). Other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey and resumed wearing white pants with their white jerseys in the regular season.\n\nFor the 2014 season, the Eagles officially adopted the \"Elite 51\u2033 style uniform from Nike. However, they only broke out the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green.\n\nRecently the team has discussed bringing back the \"Kelly Green\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season, which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally, kelly green, silver and white had been the official team colors, until the 1996 season when it changed to the current \"Midnight Green\" uniforms. NFL rules and restrictions require that teams go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, which means it would likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\n\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set. The Eagles won the game 27\u20130. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. In Week 16 of 2016 (also against the Giants), the Eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the [[NFL Color Rush]] program, but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look. The black jerseys/white pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the [[2014 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants.\n\nIn 2018, the Eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all, marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the Eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys.\n\nIn Week 6 of the 2017 season, the Eagles debuted an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and solid white socks in a road game against the [[2017 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. The all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the NFL's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look.\n\n==Rivalries==\n===Dallas Cowboys===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry}}\nThe Cowboys have been one of the Eagles' biggest rivals. The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27\u201325 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 63\u201351. They have been close in recent years, with both teams winning 12 games since 2006. There is a lot of hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 [[Bounty Bowl]]. The rivalry has even spilled over into [[NFL Draft|Draft Weekend]], with Cowboys legend [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] and Eagles legend [[David Akers]] exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in [[2017 NFL Draft|2017]] and [[2018 NFL Draft|2018]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/28/15481002/cowboys-drew-pearson-trolled-eagles-fans-nfl-draft-2017|title=Cowboys legend Drew Pearson hilariously trolled Eagles fans like wrestling heel|first=Jeanna|last=Thomas|date=April 28, 2017|website=SBNation.com|access-date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423203844/https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/28/15481002/cowboys-drew-pearson-trolled-eagles-fans-nfl-draft-2017|archive-date=April 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/the700level/former-eagles-k-david-akers-roasts-cowboys-nfl-draft|title=Akers torches Cowboys before announcing Eagles' pick|author=|date=April 27, 2018|website=NBC Sports Philadelphia|access-date=May 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404080813/https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/the700level/former-eagles-k-david-akers-roasts-cowboys-nfl-draft|archive-date=April 4, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===New York Giants===\n{{Main|Eagles-Giants rivalry}}\nThe rivalry began in 1933 with the founding of the Eagles, and slowly strengthened when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933. The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic [[New York City|New York]]-[[Philadelphia]] rivalry, which is mirrored in [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry]] and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry]].

It started in 1934, when the Washington Redskins were known as the Boston Redskins; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6\u20130. The Redskins lead the all-time series 86\u201380\u20138. Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall.\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Main|Eagles\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe Eagles and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] are both located in [[Pennsylvania]] and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Baltimore Colts]]) moved to the [[American Football Conference]], while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the [[National Football Conference]]. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season, the most recent meeting being in 2016 at Lincoln Financial Field, with the Eagles winning 34\u20133. The Steelers have lost nine straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the [[Super Bowl]] era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 47\u201328\u20133.\n\n==Players==\n{{Main|List of Philadelphia Eagles players}}\n\n===Current roster===\n{{Philadelphia Eagles roster}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|'''Philadelphia Eagles retired numbers'''\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"| No.\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|Player\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|Position\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|Years played\n! style=\"{{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Philadelphia Eagles}};\"|Retired\n|-\n| '''5''' || [[Donovan McNabb]] || [[Quarterback|QB]] || 1999\u20132009 || September 20, 2013\n|-\n| '''15''' || [[Steve Van Buren]] || [[Halfback (American football)|HB]] || 1944\u20131951 || 1951\n|-\n| '''20''' || [[Brian Dawkins]] || [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|S]] || 1996\u20132008 || September 30, 2012\n|-\n| '''40''' || [[Tom Brookshier]] || [[Cornerback|CB]] || 1953\u20131961 || 1962\n|-\n| '''44''' || [[Pete Retzlaff]] || [[Running back|RB]], [[Wide receiver|WR]], [[Tight end|TE]] || 1956\u20131966 || 1965\n|-\n| '''60''' || [[Chuck Bednarik]] || [[Linebacker|LB]], [[Center (American football)|C]] || 1949\u20131962 || \n|-\n| '''70''' || [[Al Wistert]] || [[Offensive tackle|OT]] || 1943\u20131951 || 1952\n|-\n| '''92''' || [[Reggie White]]<sup>(*)</sup> || [[Defensive end|DE]] || 1985\u20131992 || December 5, 2005\n|-\n| '''99''' || [[Jerome Brown]]<sup>(*)</sup> || [[Defensive tackle|DT]] || 1987\u20131991 || September 6, 1992\n|}\n\n'''Notes:'''\n* <sup>(*)</sup> Posthumous honors.\n* Despite not being retired, the Eagles have not issued out [[Randall Cunningham]]'s No. 12 since he left the Eagles in 1995,<ref>{{cite news |author=Didinger, Ray |title=Ray's QB Notes 4: Randall's No. 12 retired? |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/football-philadelphia-eagles/eagles-talk/Rays-QB-Notes-4-Randalls-No-12-retired?blockID=743807 |work=CSN Philly |date=July 21, 2012 |accessdate=August 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130120030648/http://www.csnphilly.com/football-philadelphia-eagles/eagles-talk/Rays-QB-Notes-4-Randalls-No-12-retired?blockID=743807 |archivedate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> [[LeSean McCoy]]'s No. 25 since he left the team in 2015,<ref>{{cite news |author=Gowton, Brandon Lee |title=Eagles announce jersey number for Jay Ajayi |url=https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2017/10/31/16586076/eagles-jay-ajayi-jersey-number-philadelphia-36-nfl-trade-miami-dolphins-running-back-uniform-buy-nfl |publisher=bleedinggreennation.com |date=October 31, 2017 |accessdate=August 21, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180821223212/https://www.bleedinggreennation.com/2017/10/31/16586076/eagles-jay-ajayi-jersey-number-philadelphia-36-nfl-trade-miami-dolphins-running-back-uniform-buy-nfl |archive-date=August 21, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet |user=ZBerm |title=Re: This tweet: It's not a coincidence that Eagles haven't issued No. 25 in five years -- just like they haven't given No. 12 since Randall Cunningham.

The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that \"all profits shall be donated to charity\", all of the team's excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The original Frankford Athletic Association apparently disbanded prior to the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the \"Frankford\" name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.\n\nIn the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association's Yellow Jackets gained the reputation as being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year, Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6\u20132\u20131 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924, thus becoming the [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]].\nMidway through the [[1931 NFL season|1931 season]], the Yellow Jackets went bankrupt and were forced to cease operations.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 81\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 81</ref>\n\n===Wray and Bell era (1933\u20131940)===\nAfter more than a year of searching for a suitable replacement, the NFL granted an expansion franchise to a syndicate headed by [[Bert Bell]] and [[Lud Wray]] and awarded them the assets of the failed Yellow Jackets organization. The Bell-Wray group had to pay an entry fee of $3,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2500|1931}}}} today) and assumed a total debt of $11,000 that was owed to three other NFL franchises.<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 82\">Lyons, 2010 pg. 82</ref> Drawing inspiration from the Blue Eagle insignia of the [[National Recovery Administration]]\u2014the centerpiece of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]]<ref name=\"Lyons, 2010 pg. 82\" />\u2014Bell and Wray named the new franchise the Philadelphia Eagles. Although this makes it appear that the Yellow Jackets sat out the 1932 season and returned as the Eagles in 1933. However, neither the Eagles nor the NFL officially regard the two franchises as the same, citing the aforementioned period of dormancy. Furthermore, almost no Yellow Jackets players were on the Eagles' first roster.\n\nThe Eagles, along with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and the now-defunct [[Cincinnati Reds (NFL)|Cincinnati Reds]], joined the NFL as [[expansion team]]s. Wray became the Eagles first head coach after being convinced by Bell, his former teammate at [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]], to take the position.

An All-American lineman/linebacker from the University of Pennsylvania, Bednarik would go on to become one of the greatest and most beloved players in Eagles history.\n\nWith the turn of the decade came another turn in team fortunes. In [[1950 NFL season|1950]] the Eagles were slated to open the season against the [[All-America Football Conference|AAFC]] champion [[Cleveland Browns]], who had just (along with the other AAFC franchises) joined the NFL. The Eagles were expected to make short work of the Browns, who at the time were widely considered the dominant team in a lesser league. However, the Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards, including 246 passing yards, in a 35\u201310 rout. The Eagles never really recovered, and finished 6\u20136.\n\n===McMillin, Millner, Trimble and Devore era (1951-1957)===\nGreasy Neale retired after the 1950 season and was replaced by [[Bo McMillin]]. Two games into the [[1951 Philadelphia Eagles season|1951]] season, McMillin was forced to retire due to terminal [[stomach cancer]].

Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles, whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000.<ref name=\"The Eagles Encyclopedia\">{{cite book |title=The Eagles Encyclopedia |last=Didinger |first=Ray |author2=Robert S.

During the [[1959 NFL season|1959]] season the team showed real flashes of talent, and finished in second place in the Eastern Division. Former Eagles owner and co-founder Bert Bell, who at the time was the commissioner of the NFL, attended a game on October 11 at Franklin Field. The Eagles were facing the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team who Bell also used to own. The Eagles had box seats reserved for him but Bell refused them and purchased his own tickets to sit with the fans. During the fourth quarter of the game while sitting behind the end zone, he had suffered a heart attack and died later that day.      [[File:Penn - Franklin Field - 1922.jpg|thumb|232x232px|Franklin Field was the Eagles home field from 1958 to 1970]]\n\n====NFL Champions (1960)====\n[[1960 NFL season|1960]] remains the most celebrated year in Eagles history. Shaw, Van Brocklin and [[Chuck Bednarik]] (each in his last season before retirement) led a team more notable for its grit than its talent (one observer later quipped that the team had \"nothing but a championship\") to its first division title since 1949. The team was aided by their two Pro Bowl receivers, WR [[Tommy McDonald (American football)|Tommy McDonald]] (who would later pen a short autobiography titled \"They Pay Me to Catch Footballs\") and TE [[Pete Retzlaff]]. On December 26, 1960, one of the coldest days in recorded Philadelphia history, the Eagles faced [[Vince Lombardi]]'s [[Green Bay Packers]] in the [[NFL Championship Game, 1960|NFL title game]] and dealt the mighty Lombardi the sole championship game loss of his storied career. Bednarik lined up at center on offense and at linebacker on defense.

Ownership, however, opted to promote assistant coach [[Nick Skorich]] instead, and Van Brocklin quit the organization in a fit of pique, instead becoming head coach of the expansion [[Minnesota Vikings]]. \nBack up quarterback [[Sonny Jurgensen]] became the starter for the [[1961 NFL season|1961 season]]. The team finished just a half-game behind the [[1961 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] for first place in the Eastern Conference standings with a 10\u20134 record. Despite the on-the-field success, however, the franchise was in turmoil.\n\nThe [[1962 NFL season|1962]] team was decimated by injury, and managed only three wins and were embarrassed at home in a 49\u20130 loss against the Packers. The off-field chaos would continue through [[1963 NFL season|1963]], as the remaining 65 shareholders out of the original Happy Hundred sold the team to [[Jerry Wolman]], a 36-year-old millionaire Washington developer who outbid local bidders for the team, paying an unprecedented $5.505 million for control of the club. In [[1964 NFL season|1964]] Wolman hired former Cardinals and [[Washington Redskins]] coach [[Joe Kuharich]] to a 15-year contract. Over the next five seasons the team failed to make the playoffs each year.\n\nIn [[1969 NFL season|1969]] [[Leonard Tose]] bought the Eagles from Wolman for $16.155 million<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf |title=Year-by-Year History |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129104352/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/pdf/Y_B_YHISTORY.pdf |archivedate=January 29, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|16155000|1969}}}} today), then a record for a professional sports franchise.

He followed this by naming former Eagles receiving great [[Pete Retzlaff]] as [[General manager|General Manager]] and [[Jerry Williams (American football)|Jerry Williams]] as coach.\n\n[[File:VeteransStadium1986-2a.jpg|thumb|right|269x269px|Veterans Stadium, Eagles home field from 1971 to 2002.]]\nWith the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] of the NFL and [[American Football League|AFL]] in [[1970 NFL season|1970]], the Eagles were placed in the [[NFC East]] Division with their [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|archrivals]] the [[New York Giants]], the [[Washington Redskins]], and the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Their heated [[Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry|rivalry]] with the Giants is the oldest of the [[NFC East]] rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933 and is often named as one of the best rivalries in the NFL.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Birds' Biggest Rival\u2014In a division of fierce foes, the Giants have battled the Eagles as tough as anyone |date=September 17, 2006 |first=Bob |last=Brookover |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |page=D1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Eagles\u2014Giants among top rivalries |date=November 6, 2008 |first=Bob |last=Brookover |newspaper=Philadelphia Inquirer |page=D6}}</ref> 1970 was also the last season for the Eagles at Franklin Field; the team finished the first post-merger season in last place in their division at 3-10-1.\n\nIn 1971 the Eagles moved from Franklin Field to brand-new [[Veterans Stadium]]. In its first season, the \u201cVet\u201d was widely acclaimed as a triumph of ultra-modern sports engineering, a consensus that would be short-lived. Equally short-lived was Williams' tenure as head coach.  After a 3\u201310\u20131 record in 1970 and three consecutive blowout losses to Cincinnati, Dallas and San Francisco to open the [[1971 NFL season|1971 season]], Williams was fired and replaced by assistant coach Ed Khayat, a defensive lineman on the Eagles' 1960 NFL championship team. Williams and Khayat were hampered by Retzlaff's decision to trade longtime starting quarterback [[Norm Snead]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in early 1971, leaving the Eagles a choice between journeyman [[Pete Liske]] and the raw [[Rick Arrington]].\n\nKhayat lost his first two games, but won six of the final nine in 1971 thanks to the exploits of the defense, led by All-Pro safety [[Bill Bradley (American football)|Bill Bradley]], who led the NFL in interceptions (11) and interception return yardage (248).\n\nThe team regressed in [[1972 NFL season|1972]], and Khayat was released after the Eagles finished 2\u201311\u20131. The two wins (both on the road) proved to be surprises, however. Philadelphia beat the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] (which had the best record in the AFC a year before) 21\u201320 and the [[Houston Oilers]] 18\u201317 on six field goals by kicker [[Tom Dempsey]]. The latter game became known as the \"Johnny Rodgers Bowl\", because the loser would finish with the worst record in the league and obtain the first overall draft pick of 1973, which was then assumed to be Nebraska wingback [[Johnny Rodgers]]. The Oilers ultimately got the first overall pick, which instead turned out to be University of Tampa defensive end [[John Matuszak]] (who would end up facing Philadelphia in the Super Bowl several years later). With the second pick, the Eagles selected [[USC Trojans football|USC]] tight end [[Charle Young]].\n\n===Mike McCormack era (1973-1975)===\nKhayat was replaced by offensive guru [[Mike McCormack (American football)|Mike McCormack]], for the [[1973 NFL season|1973 season]]. Aided by the skills of [[Roman Gabriel]] and towering young receiver [[Harold Carmichael]], they managed to infuse a bit of vitality into a previously moribund offense.\n\nNew general manager [[Jim Murray (American football)|Jim Murray]] also began to add talent on the defensive side of the line, most notably through the addition of future Pro Bowl linebacker [[Bill Bergey]] in [[1974 NFL season|1974]]. Overall, however, the team was still mired in mediocrity. McCormack was fired after a 4\u201310 [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]].\n\n===Dick Vermeil era (1976\u20131982)===\n{{See also|Super Bowl XV}}\nIn {{nfly|1976}}, [[Dick Vermeil]] was hired from [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]] to coach the Eagles, who had only one winning season from 1962 to 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O70MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gV8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2239,224559&dq=dick+vermeil&hl=en |title=Eagles search ends with Vermeil |date=February 9, 1976 |work=St Petersburg Times |accessdate=November 5, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117035452/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=O70MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gV8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=2239,224559&dq=dick+vermeil&hl=en |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVermeil faced numerous obstacles as he attempted to rejuvenate a franchise that had not seriously contended in well over a decade. Despite the team's young talent and Gabriel's occasional flashes of brilliance, the [[1976 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] finished [[1976 NFL season|1976]] with the same result\u2014a 4\u201310 record\u2014as in 1975. In [[1977 NFL season|1977]] the first seeds of hope begin to sprout. Rifle-armed quarterback [[Ron Jaworski]] was obtained by trade with the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for popular tight end Charlie Young. The defense, led by Bergey and defensive coordinator [[Marion Campbell]], began earning a reputation as one of the hardest hitting in the league. [[File:dickvermeil.jpg|thumb|288x288px|right|[[Dick Vermeil]], Eagles head coach from 1976 to 1982]]\nBy the [[1977 NFL season|next year]], the Eagles had fully taken Vermeil's enthusiastic attitude, and made the playoffs for the first time since 1960. Young running back [[Wilbert Montgomery]] became the first Eagle since Steve Van Buren to exceed 1,000 yards in a single season. [[1978 NFL season|1978]] also bore witness to one of the greatest moments in Eagles history: \"[[The Miracle at the Meadowlands]],\" when [[Herman Edwards]] returned a late-game fumble by [[1978 New York Giants season|Giants]]' quarterback [[Joe Pisarcik]] for a touchdown with 20 seconds left, resulting in a 19\u201317 Eagles victory \u2013 the [[1978 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] would edge into the playoffs that year with a 9\u20137 season.) In [[1979 NFL season|1979]] the Eagles tied for first place with an 11\u20135 record and Wilbert Montgomery shattered the team rushing records with a total of 1,512 yards\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 20 - Cecil Johnson.jpg|thumb|left|The Eagles playing against the Buccaneers in the 1979 NFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]In [[1980 NFL season|1980]] the team dominated the NFC, facing its chief nemesis, the [[1980 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], in the NFC Championship. The game was played in cold conditions in front of the Birds' faithful fans at [[Veterans Stadium]]. Led by an incredible rushing performance from Montgomery, whose long cutback TD run in the first half is surely one of the most memorable plays in Eagles history, and a gutsy performance from fullback [[Leroy Harris (running back)|Leroy Harris]], who scored the Eagles' only other TD that day, the Birds earned a berth in [[Super Bowl XV]] with a 20\u20137 victory.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 05 - Wilbert Montgomery.jpg|thumb|The Eagles defeated the Cowboys in the [[1980\u201381 NFL playoffs#Conference championships|1980 NFC Championship Game]] and earned their first Super Bowl appearance.|alt=]]\n\nThe Eagles traveled to [[New Orleans]] for [[Super Bowl XV]] and were heavy favorites to knock off the [[Oakland Raiders]], who were merely a wild card team. Things did not go the Eagles' way, beginning with the disastrous decision by Tose to bring comedian [[Don Rickles]] into the pregame locker room to lighten the mood. Jaworski's first pass was intercepted by Rod Martin, setting up an Oakland touchdown. Later in the first quarter, a potential game-tying 40-yard touchdown pass to Rodney Parker was nullified by an illegal motion penalty. The final score was 27\u201310. Veteran journeyman quarterback [[Jim Plunkett]] was named the game's MVP.\n\nThe team got off to a great start in the [[1981 NFL season|1981 season]], winning their first six games. They eventually ended up 10\u20136 and earned a wild card berth. However, they were unable to repeat as NFC champs when they were knocked out in the wild card round by the [[New York Giants]], 27\u201321. After the Eagles finished 3\u20136 in the strike-shortened [[1982 NFL season|1982 season]], Vermeil quit the team, citing \"burnout.\"\n\n===Marion Campbell era (1983-1985)===\nDefensive coordinator [[Marion Campbell]], aka \"the Swamp Fox\" replaced Vermeil as the head coach. Campbell had helped to popularize the \"bend-don't-break\" defensive strategy in the 1970s. Philadelphia football struggled through the mid-1980s and was marked by a malaise in fan participation. The team could not produce the same success they once had and failed to make the playoffs in [[1983 NFL season|1983]] and [[1984 NFL season|1984]].\n\nIn [[1985 NFL season|1985]] Tose was forced to sell the Eagles to [[Norman Braman]] and Ed Leibowitz, highly successful automobile dealers from Florida, for a reported $65&nbsp;million (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|65000000|1985}}}} today) to pay off his more than $25&nbsp;million (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000000|1985}}}} today) in gambling debts at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] casinos. The team once again struggled during the 1985 season and Marion Campbell was fired after week 16 and replaced by assistant head coach/defensive backs coach [[Fred Bruney]] for the last game of the season.\n\nAt the 1985 Supplemental draft, the Eagles acquired the rights to [[Memphis Showboats]]' elite pass rusher [[Reggie White]].\n\n===Buddy Ryan era (1986\u20131990)===\n[[File:Reggie White HOF jersey.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reggie White]]'s jersey shown at Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio]]In [[1986 NFL season|1986]] the arrival of head coach [[Buddy Ryan]] and his fiery attitude rejuvenated team performance and ignited the fan base. Immediately infusing the team with his tough, hard-as-nails attitude, the Eagles quickly became known for their tough defense and tougher personalities. Ryan began rejuvenating the team by releasing several aging players, including Ron Jaworski. [[Randall Cunningham]] took his place, and despite a 5\u201310\u20131 season, he began showing considerable promise. [[1987 NFL season|1987]] saw another [[1987 NFL strike|strike]], reducing the season by one game. The substitutes who were filling in for the strikers turned in a poor performance, being crushed 41\u201322 by the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. After the strike ended, the regular Eagles [[1981 NFL season|1981]] team won a 37\u201320 revenge game against Dallas. The season record was 7\u20138, three games having been played by substitutes. The [[1988 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] would reach the [[1988\u201389 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] in [[1988 NFL season|1988]], but lost to the [[Chicago Bears]], which happened to be Ryan's former team that he helped lead to a [[Super Bowl XX]] victory as defensive coordinator. The game became known as the \"[[Fog Bowl (American football)|Fog Bowl]]\", due to the weather conditions during the game. The Eagles lost this game 20\u201312.\n\nThe following two years would see playoff appearances as well, but the team could not make it past the first round. This failure was very frustrating to many Eagles fans, as the team was commonly acknowledged as among the most talented in the NFL. On offense, the Eagles were led by quarterback Cunningham, one of the most exciting players of his generation; tight end [[Keith Jackson (tight end)|Keith Jackson]]; and running back [[Keith Byars]]. The defense is commonly acknowledged as among the greatest in league history, and as the best to never win a championship.\n\n[[File:Jerome Brown of the Philadelphia Eagles (ca. 1991).jpg|thumb|right|[[Jerome Brown]], Eagles defensive end from 1987 to 1991]]\nThe two [[1989 NFL season|1989]] matches with Dallas were known as the Bounty Bowls. Both were won easily by the Eagles (the Cowboys finished 1\u201315 that year), and were marked by Ryan insulting new Cowboys coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], putting a \"bounty\" on their kicker, and for Eagles fans throwing snowballs.\n\nOn November 12, 1990, during a ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' game at the Vet, the [[1990 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] crushed the [[Washington Redskins]] by a score of 28\u201314, with the defense scoring three of the team's four touchdowns. More lopsided than its score would indicate, the game quickly acquired the sobriquet \"[[the Body Bag Game]]\", attesting to the physical damage inflicted by the tough Eagles squad. The Eagles knocked out the starting Washington quarterback, and then seriously injured his replacement as well. Running back [[Brian Mitchell (running back)|Brian Mitchell]], who would later be signed by the Eagles, was forced to play quarterback for the Redskins. The Redskins returned to Veterans Stadium in the first round of the [[1990\u201391 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] and defeated the Eagles 20\u20136, ending their season.\n\n===Rich Kotite era (1991-1994)===\nBuddy Ryan was fired on January 7, 1991, and was replaced by offensive coordinator [[Rich Kotite]]. The team started the [[1991 Philadelphia Eagles season|1991]] season losing starting quarterback Randall Cunningham in Week 1 due to a knee injury. Backup quarterback [[Jim McMahon]] took over the starting role for the rest of the season. Despite having the top rated defense in the league the team failed to make the playoffs, finishing third in the NFC East with a record of 10-6.\n\nOn June 25, 1992 All Pro defensive tackle [[Jerome Brown]] was killed in an automobile accident. The team and fan base became dedicated to \"bring it home for Jerome\" in the [[1992 NFL season|1992]] season. The team finished second in the NFC East with an 11-5 record and earned a Wild Card spot in the playoffs. Kotite did lead the Eagles to a playoff victory against the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the Wild Card game but would ultimately fall to the Dallas Cowboys in the Divisional round. To make matters worse they lost all-time sacks leader Reggie White to free agency in the off-season.\n\nAmong the team's offensive stars during that period were quarterback [[Randall Cunningham]], tight end [[Keith Jackson (tight end)|Keith Jackson]], and running back [[Herschel Walker]]. But the \"Gang Green\" defense is possibly what defined the team, led by [[Reggie White]], [[Jerome Brown]], [[Clyde Simmons]], [[Seth Joyner]], [[Wes Hopkins]], [[Mike Golic]], [[Byron Evans]], [[Eric Allen]], [[Andre Waters]] and [[Mark McMillian]]. In [[1993 NFL season|1993]] Kotite's Eagles would fall apart after initially a promising start, and missed the playoffs, going 8\u20138.\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\nBy this point, team owner Norman Braman had become unpopular among most local fans and a polarizing presence in the front office. [[Jeffrey Lurie]] bought the Eagles on May 6, 1994 for an estimated $185&nbsp;million. The club is now estimated to be the 17th most valuable sports team, worth $1.314&nbsp;billion, as evaluated in 2014 by Forbes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdhk/no-11-philadelphia-eagles |title=The World's Most Valuable Sports Teams No. 11 Philadelphia Eagles |work=[[Forbes.com]] |date=July 12, 2011 |accessdate=February 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203185913/http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mli45fdhk/no-11-philadelphia-eagles/ |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[File:Jeffrey-Lurie August-2010.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Jeffrey Lurie]] has owned the Eagles since 1994]]In Lurie's first season as the owner in [[1994 NFL season|1994]], the team went 7\u20139 and once again missed the playoffs. Rich Kotite was fired and was replaced by [[San Francisco 49ers]] Defensive Coordinator [[Ray Rhodes]], who successfully lobbied 49ers star [[Ricky Watters]] to join the team as a free agent.\n\n===Ray Rhodes era (1995-1998)===\nIn [[1995 NFL season|1995]], Rhodes's first season, the [[1995 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] got off to a slow start by losing 3 out their first 4 games but subsequently rebounded, finishing with a 10\u20136 record and a playoff spot. In the Wild Card Round, the Eagles played at home and overwhelmed the [[Detroit Lions]] 58\u201337, with 31 of Philadelphia's points coming in the second quarter alone. Despite this dominant performance, the Eagles were eliminated in the next round by the Cowboys yet again by a score of 30\u201311. Ironically, this would be [[Randall Cunningham]]'s last game as an Eagle. Cunningham would score the only touchdown of the game and the last Eagles postseason touchdown for six years.\n\n1995 was the end of Cunningham's tenure as starting quarterback. Rhodes benched Cunningham in favor of [[Rodney Peete]], leading to friction between the two. Before the benching, news reports circulated that Lurie and Rhodes tried to trade Cunningham to the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. However, no such trade was executed and Cunningham retired shortly after the season.\n\nIn [[1996 NFL season|1996]] the [[1996 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] uniforms changed from the classic shade of [[Kelly green|Kelly Green]] to a darker [[midnight green]]. The team got off to a good start, winning three of their first four games. However, a Week 5 Monday night game at [[Veterans Stadium]] against the hated [[Dallas Cowboys|Cowboys]] would witness a season-ending knee injury to Peete, loss of the team's momentum, and the transition to an offense led by [[Ty Detmer]] and Watters. While Detmer played well and Watters rushed for 1,411 yards, the season followed an all-too-familiar pattern: 10\u20136 record, and early elimination (a 14\u20130 shutout by the [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]]) in the [[1996\u201397 NFL playoffs|playoffs]]. In the [[1996 NFL draft]], future fan favorite and hall of famer [[Brian Dawkins]] was chosen in the 2nd round. The continued early playoff exits led to fans and local media blaming the high priced free agent signings ([[Irving Fryar]], Watters, [[Troy Vincent]], and [[Guy McIntyre]]) for not stepping up in big games, most notably the postseason. Rhodes gradually deteriorated under the stress of the job, and players were beginning to grow tired of his brash demeanor and often autocratic coaching style.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; When Willpower Isn't Enough: Decline of Ray Rhodes's Eagles|first=Mike|last=Freeman|date=November 4, 1998|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215024205/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/04/sports/pro-football-when-willpower-isn-t-enough-decline-of-ray-rhodes-s-eagles.html|archive-date=February 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> After an up-and-down 6\u20139\u20131 campaign in [[1997 NFL season|1997]], the bottom fell out in [[1998 NFL season|1998]]. The Eagles suffered a 3\u201313 record\u2014the worst in franchise history. They were ranked dead last in numerous offensive statistics. Home game attendance was declining, a quarterback controversy was deteriorating an already rudderless locker room, and the players had all but tuned out the embattled coaching staff. Left with little choice after a disastrous season, fan revolt and sagging team morale, Lurie fired Rhodes and hired Green Bay Packers quarterbacks coach [[Andy Reid]] as the new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Eagles_hire_Packers_assistant_Andy_Reid_as_new_head_coach.html|title=Eagles hire Packers assistant Andy Reid as new head coach|first=Phil|last=Sheridan|date=|website=www.philly.com|access-date=April 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030105006/http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/Eagles_hire_Packers_assistant_Andy_Reid_as_new_head_coach.html|archive-date=October 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Andy Reid era (1999\u20132012)===\n{{See also|Super Bowl XXXIX}}\nResurgence would come under the leadership of new head coach [[Andy Reid]], who began by drafting [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] with the second overall pick in the [[1999 NFL Draft]]. The Eagles would have had the first overall pick, but it was awarded to the rebooted [[Cleveland Browns]]. Despite clearing up roster space for new talent by releasing unpopular, aging veterans such as Watters and [[Irving Fryar]], Reid was still a virtual unknown at the time of his selection as head coach, and his appointment was met with considerable skepticism in Philadelphia. McNabb was also not considered a good choice to draft by Eagles fans. When he was drafted, many Eagles fans booed the selection, believing that the Eagles should have drafted [[Ricky Williams]]. [[File:Andy Reid 080805-F-9429S-131 crop.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Andy Reid]], Eagles head coach from 1999 to 2012]]\nThe choice proved wise, though: with Reid leading the way and McNabb emerging as one of the game's great players. However, 1999 was a rebuilding year, and the Eagles only won five games and game attendance was still looking stale: as two home games were not sold out \u2013 resulting in local [[Blackout (broadcasting)|TV blackouts]]- while the other six were only sold out due to several small business owners purchasing the remainder of the unsold tickets to spare TV viewers. The Week 5 game, on Sunday, October 10, 1999, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, saw Dallas wide receiver [[Michael Irvin]] suffer a career-ending spinal injury where Eagles fans stood up and cheered as he lay on the field. Even the TV commentators expressed their disgust at this behavior.\n\nThe [[2000 NFL season|2000]] regular season opener in Dallas (September 3), became known in NFL lore as the \"Pickle Juice Game\". Kickoff temperature in [[Texas Stadium]] was 109 degrees Fahrenheit and soared to nearly 120, making it the hottest game in league history, beating a previous record set during a 1997 Cowboys-Cardinals match in Arizona. The nickname came about because an Eagles trainer had been preparing for the projected high temperatures by having the players drink the juice from jars of dill pickles in order to retain body moisture and stave off cramps and heat exhaustion. The experiment proved a success as the Eagles won the game 44\u201314 and the Cowboys had multiple players benched for inability to handle the brutal temperatures (the Eagles had no players benched). The game also had significance because it marked the beginning of Philadelphia's domination of the NFC East and the end of the Cowboys' dominance. The  team finished the season at 11\u20135, reaching the [[2000\u201301 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] as a wildcard team, which rejuvenated the fan base and optimism. After brushing aside the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] 21\u20133, the [[2000 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] moved to the second round of the playoffs, only to lose a 20\u201310 game against the [[New York Giants]].\n\n[[File:Donovan McNabb.jpg|thumb|right|210x210px|[[Donovan McNabb]], Eagles quarterback from 1999 to 2009]]After compiling an 11\u20135 record in [[2001 NFL season|2001]], the [[2001 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] reached the [[2001\u201302 NFL playoffs|playoffs]] again, this time at the top of their division. In a near-rerun of the previous year, they disposed of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Buccaneers]] in a 31\u20139 game. In the second round, the Eagles defeated the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] 33\u201319 at [[Soldier Field]]. Reaching the NFC Championship game, they were unable to stop the [[St. Louis Rams]], who defeated them 29\u201324\n\nDespite injuries, McNabb led the [[2002 Philadelphia Eagles season|Eagles]] to a 12\u20134 season in [[2002 NFL season|2002]]. Once again, they reached the NFC Championship, but lost at home 27\u201310 to the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the last game at [[Veterans Stadium]].\n\nThe [[2003 NFL season|2003]] team lost its first two games, both at their new home. In the opening game of the season, the Eagles were shut out 17\u20130 by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in the first regular season game ever played at [[Lincoln Financial Field]]. Once again, the team went 12\u20134 for the season. By reaching the conference championship game in the same year as this defeat, they became the first team in modern history to get that far in the postseason after having been shut out at home in its first game. They achieved that distinction despite getting only five touchdown catches all year from their wide receivers, which tied the league low since the regular season schedule was lengthened to its present 16 games in 1978 (this record would be broken in 2004 when the [[New York Giants]]' wide receivers caught only two touchdown passes). The Eagle receivers went through both September and October without a TD catch \u2014 the last time an NFL team had done that was in 1945.\n\n[[File:Le Lincoln Financial Field (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|254x254px|Lincoln Financial Field has been the Eagles home field since 2003]]The Eagles actively pursued premier wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]], and acquired him in a controversial three-way deal with the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]], on March 16, 2004.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1760284 Ravens, Niners compensated in settlement-ESPN] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113063228/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=1760284 |date=January 13, 2016 }} Retrieved 10 July 2012.</ref> The [[2004 NFL season|2004]] season began with a bang as Owens caught three touchdown passes from McNabb in their season opener against the [[New York Giants]]. Owens would end up with exactly 1,200 receiving yards and 14 touchdown receptions, although his season ended prematurely with an ankle injury an on December 19 game, against the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Their 12\u20137 victory in this game gave them home field advantage throughout the conference playoffs for the third year in a row.  The Eagles tied a record by clinching the NFC East division crown (their fourth straight) after only their eleventh game of the season, matching the mark set by the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985 Chicago Bears]] and the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|1997 San Francisco 49ers]]. Their final two regular season games thus rendered meaningless, the Eagles sat out most of their first-string players in these games and lost them both, yet still finished with a 13\u20133 record, their best 16-game season ever.\n\n[[File:Bdawk.jpg|thumb|237x237px|[[Brian Dawkins]], Eagles safety from 1996 to 2008|alt=]]McNabb had his finest season to date, passing for 3,875 yards and 31 touchdowns, with only eight interceptions. This made him the first quarterback in NFL history to throw 30 or more TD passes and fewer than 10 interceptions in a single regular season. They then began their playoff run with the Divisional round at home against the sixth-seeded [[Minnesota Vikings]]. The Eagles led from the start and never looked back, as McNabb led a very efficient passing attack (21 of 33 for 286 yards and 2 TDs), [[Brian Westbrook]] dominated on the ground with 70 rushing yards, and [[Freddie Mitchell]] performed very well on the receiving corps (5 receptions for 65 yards and a TD), as Philadelphia won 27\u201314, setting up their fourth-straight NFC Championship appearance. Facing the [[Atlanta Falcons]], McNabb threw for 180 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 32 yards. Westbrook rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 39. Winning the game 27\u201310, the Eagles advanced to [[Super Bowl XXXIX]], where they faced the [[2004 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]. Although McNabb threw 3 touchdown passes and 357 yards in the game, and the score was tied 14\u201314 going into the fourth quarter, the Patriots outscored the Eagles with ten straight points. McNabb completed a 30-yard touchdown pass, and the Eagles defense held the Patriots to a 3 and out, but a crucial interception with 46 seconds left on the clock secured their fate. The Patriots won 24\u201321.\n\nBrian Dawkins was one of the premier safeties in the NFL, and earned him the role of Eagles' defensive captain, and a mainstay on the Eagles.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heath|first=John|title=Denver's Brian Dawkins: An Ageless Wolverine|url=http://broncotalk.net/2011/10/26409/denver-broncos/denvers-brian-dawkins-an-ageless-wolverine/|publisher=BroncoTalk|accessdate=April 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128221118/http://broncotalk.net/2011/10/26409/denver-broncos/denvers-brian-dawkins-an-ageless-wolverine/|archive-date=January 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe team took a step back in [[2005 NFL season|2005]] with a 6\u201310 record.

For obnoxious behavior and a feud with McNabb, Owens was suspended after 7 games, eventually being cut. In [[2006 NFL season|2006]], the team lost McNabb 10 games in and went into turmoil.  However, Westbrook stepped up, and the Eagles earned their fifth NFC East title under coach Reid, with a 10\u20136 record. They won the Wild Card game, but lost in the Divisional Round. In [[2007 NFL season|2007]], they finished 8-8.

A hamstring injury took [[Michael Vick]] out after a 1\u20133 start, but his backup [[Nick Foles]] led the team to a 10\u20136 regular season record, and its seventh NFC East title in 13 seasons. Before throwing his first interception in Week 14, Foles threw 19 touchdowns, which was just one shy of the all-time NFL record of consecutive touchdowns without an interception to start a season, set earlier in the season by [[Peyton Manning]]. Foles also tied Manning for most touchdown passes in a single-game, with seven, against the [[Oakland Raiders]], which also made him the youngest player in NFL history to throw for that many touchdowns in a game. Foles finished the regular season with 27 touchdown passes and only 2 interceptions, giving him the then-best TD-INT ratio in NFL history. (That record was later broken by [[Tom Brady]], in the 2016 season.) He also finished with a 119.0 passer rating, third highest in league history behind only [[Aaron Rodgers]] in 2011 and Peyton Manning in 2004.

[[LeSean McCoy]] finished his Pro Bowl season as the league's top rusher with 1,607 rushing yards (also a franchise record) and 2,146 total yards from scrimmage, also best in the NFL.

In a week 14 game against the [[Los Angeles Rams]], starting quarterback [[Carson Wentz]] left the game with a torn ACL, and backup [[Nick Foles]], who was re-signed in the off-season, took over for the rest of the season.\n\nFoles' first start was a comeback from a 20\u20137 deficit against the [[New York Giants]] where he scored four touchdowns and won the game 34\u201329. Foles struggled in the last two games of the season against the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the Dallas Cowboys, and threw a touchdown and two interceptions in those two games.

In the NFC Championship, the Eagles beat the [[Minnesota Vikings]] 38\u20137, despite being betting underdogs for the game. Foles had his best game since week 15 and threw for 352 passing yards and three touchdowns.

As Foles stepped up to the running back position, Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end [[Trey Burton]], who then threw the ball to Foles, who was wide open in the right side of the end zone. Foles caught the ball, making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl, and the ensuing extra point was good, giving the Eagles a 22\u201312 lead, which was taken into the locker room after a short drive by the Patriots.

The franchise won their first Super Bowl ever and their first championship since 1960. Foles won [[Super Bowl MVP]] going 28 for 43 with 373 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one interception, and one receiving touchdown.

Throughout the 2018 season many injuries plagued the team, especially in their secondary. [[Jalen Mills]], [[Ronald Darby]], and [[Rodney McLeod]] all went down with injuries during the season. The Eagles had a 4\u20136 record in their first 10 games and looked to have very little chance of making the playoffs, but the Eagles managed to win 5 of their last 6 games, including upset victories over the Los Angeles Rams and Houston Texans to go 9\u20137 and make the playoffs as the sixth seed.\n\nIn the Wild Card game against the [[Chicago Bears]] Nick Foles threw 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in a 16\u201315 win. Bears kicker [[Cody Parkey]] missed a game winning field goal that hit left post and the crossbar. The kick was tipped slightly by [[Treyvon Hester]]. This sent the Philadelphia Eagles to a NFC Divisional matchup against the [[New Orleans Saints]]. In the NFC Division match with the Saints, the Eagles ended the first quarter with a 14\u20130 lead.

In 1954 the Eagles, along with the [[Baltimore Colts]], became the second team ever in the NFL to put a [[Logo#Sports|logo]] on their [[football helmet|helmets]], with silver wings on a kelly green helmet. In 1969 the team wore two helmet versions: Kelly green with white wings in road games, and white with kelly green wings at home. From 1970 to '73, they wore the white helmets with Kelly green wings exclusively before switching back to Kelly green helmets with silver wings. By 1974, Joseph A. Scirrotto Jr. designed the silver wings took on a white outline, and this style on a kelly green helmet became standard for over two decades.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1995, the team logo was an eagle in flight carrying a football in its claws, although from '69\u201372, the eagle took on a more stylized look.\n\nIn 1973 the team's name was added below the eagle, returning to its pre-1969 look.\n\nHowever, both the logo and uniforms were radically altered in 1996. The primary kelly green color was changed to a darker shade, officially described as \"midnight green.\" Silver was practically abandoned, as uniform pants moved to either white or midnight green. The traditional helmet wings were changed to a primarily white color, with silver and black accents. The team's logo combination (the eagle and club name lettering) also changed in 1996, with the eagle itself limited to a white (bald eagle) head, drawn in a less realistic, more cartoon-based style, and the lettering changing from calligraphic to block letters.\n\nSince the 1996 alterations, the team has made only minor alterations, mostly relating to jersey/pant combinations worn during specific games. For example, in 1997, against the [[1997 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]], the team wore midnight green jerseys and pants for the first of only two occasions in team history. The second occasion was in 2002, during the final regular season game at [[Veterans Stadium]], a win over the division-rival [[2002 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]. A year later, in the first two games of the 2003 season (both home losses, to the [[2003 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[2003 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]), the Eagles wore white jerseys with white pants. After that, the white jerseys along with white pants were worn exclusively during preseason games from 2004 to 2011, with the exception of 2007 and 2010.\n\nThe 2003 season also saw the first (though only subtle) change to the 1996-style uniform. On both white and green jerseys, black shadows and silver trim were added to both the green and white numbering. The stripe on the pants changed from black-green-black to black-silver-green on the white pants, and from a solid black stripe to one stripe of black, another of silver, with one small white stripe in between for the midnight green pants. The 2003 season also saw the team debut black alternate jerseys, with a green (instead of black) shadow on white numbers, and silver trim. These black jerseys have been worn for two selected [[home (sports)|home]] games each season (usually the first home game after a [[bye (sports)|bye]] week and the season finale). In the 2003 and 2004 regular season home finales, the team wore the green [[road (sports)|road]] pants with the black alternate jerseys, but lost both games. Since then, the Eagles have only worn the black jerseys with the white pants. However, due to the special 75th anniversary uniforms serving as the \"alternates\" for one game in 2007, the Eagles could not wear the alternate black jersey that season per league rules at the time (alternate uniforms were permitted twice per season but only one can be used). The black jerseys with white pants, however, re-appeared for the 2008 [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving]] night game against the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]]. From 2006 to 2013, the Eagles have only worn the alternate black jerseys once a season and for the last November home game, but did not use them in 2007, 2010, and 2011. For the 2007 and 2010 seasons, the Eagles used throwback uniforms in place of the black alternates for their anniversary to commemorate past teams. The team also started wearing black cleats exclusively in 2004, although the rule was relaxed by the mid-2010s.\n\nTo celebrate the team's 75th anniversary, the 2007 uniforms featured a 75th-season logo patch on the left shoulder. In addition, the team wore [[throwback uniform|\"throwback\" jerseys]] in a 2007 game against the [[2007 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Lions]]. The yellow and blue jerseys, the same colors found on [[flag of Philadelphia|Philadelphia's city flag]], are based on those worn by the Philadelphia Eagles in the team's inaugural season, and were the same colors used by the former [[Frankford Yellow Jackets]] franchise prior to their suspension of operations in 1931. The Eagles beat Detroit, 56\u201321.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724212544/http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=12323 |archivedate=July 24, 2010 |title=Eagles Unveil 75th Anniversary Plans |publisher=Philadelphia Eagles |date=April 25, 2007 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Eagles wear their white jerseys at home for preseason games and daytime games in the first half of the regular season from September to mid-October when the temperature is warmer. In night contests in the first half of the regular season, the Eagles do not need to wear white at home since the temperature is cooler. However, there have been exceptions, such as the home opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2003 and the Washington Redskins in 2007 that were played at night. In late October or beginning in November, the Eagles start to wear their colors at home (although they had done it earlier), be it the midnight green jerseys or a third jersey. On one occasion, the Eagles wore white at home after October in a meeting against the [[Dallas Cowboys]] on November 4, 2007, in order to make the Cowboys wear their blue road jerseys. Upon moving to [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in 2003, the Eagles wore white at home for at least their home opener, but in recent years they opted to wear their standard midnight green jerseys even during the warmest of autumn weather.\n\nIn the 2010 season against the Green Bay Packers, on September 12, 2010, the Eagles wore uniforms similar to the ones that were worn by the 1960 championship team in honor the 50th anniversary of that team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |title=Eagles Announce Plans to Honor 1960 Title Team |publisher=Csnphilly.com |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730121316/http://www.csnphilly.com/05/03/10/Eagles-Announce-Plans-to-Honor-1960-Titl/landing.html?blockID=227998&feedID=704 |archivedate=July 30, 2012}}</ref> In weeks 4 and 6 of the 2010 season, the Eagles wore their white jerseys in a match-up against the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons, respectively, before reverting to their midnight green jerseys for the rest of their home games.\n\nFor the 2012 season, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Reebok]] as the NFL's official apparel licensee, but the Eagles decided that they would not be adopting Nike's \"Elite 51\" uniform technology. Aside from the Nike logo replacing the Reebok logo, the only other change is the league-wide revision of the NFL shield on the uniform (replacing the NFL Equipment logo). Other than that the uniforms essentially remain unchanged. The Eagles also revived their black alternate jersey and resumed wearing white pants with their white jerseys in the regular season.\n\nFor the 2014 season, the Eagles officially adopted the \"Elite 51\u2033 style uniform from Nike. However, they only broke out the midnight green jerseys and pants in the second half of that season due to the difficulty of producing their preferred shade of midnight green.\n\nRecently the team has discussed bringing back the \"Kelly Green\" uniforms similar to the uniforms worn in the 1960 NFL Championship season, which were last worn in the 2010 season opener vs. Green Bay. Traditionally, kelly green, silver and white had been the official team colors, until the 1996 season when it changed to the current \"Midnight Green\" uniforms. NFL rules and restrictions require that teams go through a waiting period before any major uniform changes and alterations can be made, which means it would likely be quite some time before any uniform changes are officially made.\n\nIn Week 6 of 2014 against the New York Giants, the team introduced black pants to complement their black jerseys, giving them a blackout uniform set. The Eagles won the game 27\u20130. The victory was their first shutout in 18 years. In Week 16 of 2016 (also against the Giants), the Eagles wore a variation of the all-black look as part of the [[NFL Color Rush]] program, but with solid black socks as opposed to black with white sanitary socks of the original look. The black jerseys/white pants combination was last seen during a preseason road game against the [[2014 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]], after which the black jerseys were paired exclusively with the black pants.\n\nIn 2018, the Eagles' midnight green pants were not worn at all, marking the first such instance since the 1996 rebrand that the Eagles wore only white pants with their primary white or midnight green jerseys.\n\nIn Week 6 of the 2017 season, the Eagles debuted an all-white look with white jerseys, white pants and solid white socks in a road game against the [[2017 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. The all-white look began to be utilized full-time as a road uniform set in 2019 thanks to the NFL's decision to allow teams to wear solid color socks as an alternate look.\n\n==Rivalries==\n===Dallas Cowboys===\n{{Main|Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry}}\nThe Cowboys have been one of the Eagles' biggest rivals. The Eagles won the first game in this rivalry 27\u201325 on September 30, 1960. Dallas leads the all-time series 63\u201351. They have been close in recent years, with both teams winning 12 games since 2006. There is a lot of hostility between the two teams' fan bases, with incidents such as the 1989 [[Bounty Bowl]]. The rivalry has even spilled over into [[NFL Draft|Draft Weekend]], with Cowboys legend [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] and Eagles legend [[David Akers]] exchanging insults at the opposing franchise in [[2017 NFL Draft|2017]] and [[2018 NFL Draft|2018]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/28/15481002/cowboys-drew-pearson-trolled-eagles-fans-nfl-draft-2017|title=Cowboys legend Drew Pearson hilariously trolled Eagles fans like wrestling heel|first=Jeanna|last=Thomas|date=April 28, 2017|website=SBNation.com|access-date=May 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423203844/https://www.sbnation.com/2017/4/28/15481002/cowboys-drew-pearson-trolled-eagles-fans-nfl-draft-2017|archive-date=April 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/the700level/former-eagles-k-david-akers-roasts-cowboys-nfl-draft|title=Akers torches Cowboys before announcing Eagles' pick|author=|date=April 27, 2018|website=NBC Sports Philadelphia|access-date=May 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404080813/https://www.nbcsports.com/philadelphia/the700level/former-eagles-k-david-akers-roasts-cowboys-nfl-draft|archive-date=April 4, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===New York Giants===\n{{Main|Eagles-Giants rivalry}}\nThe rivalry began in 1933 with the founding of the Eagles, and slowly strengthened when both teams came to relative prominence in the 1940s and 1950s. The two teams have played in the same division in the NFL every year since 1933. The ferocity of the rivalry can also be attributed to the geographic [[New York City|New York]]-[[Philadelphia]] rivalry, which is mirrored in [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry]] and the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Flyers\u2013Rangers rivalry]].

It started in 1934, when the Washington Redskins were known as the Boston Redskins; the Redskins defeated the Eagles 6\u20130. The Redskins lead the all-time series 86\u201380\u20138. Since 2010, the rivalry has been very even overall.\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Main|Eagles\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\nThe Eagles and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] are both located in [[Pennsylvania]] and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967 they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Baltimore Colts]]) moved to the [[American Football Conference]], while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the [[National Football Conference]]. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season, the most recent meeting being in 2016 at Lincoln Financial Field, with the Eagles winning 34\u20133. The Steelers have lost nine straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the [[Super Bowl]] era.
