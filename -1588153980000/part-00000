Allah Bakhsh was totally opposed to the Muslim League\u2019s demand for the creation of Pakistan through a division of India on a religious basis.

The structure was at first known as Zeltner's Hall and was surrounded by a picnic park. Following the sale of the entertainment and meeting hall by the Zeltner family, the property was called [[Niblo's Garden]], a familiar name borrowed from an early New York opera house on Broadway, near Prince Street that was razed in 1895. The building was used as a meeting hall by politicians and union members, and served variously as an entertainment hall, skating venue, and amusement park until its destruction by fire in 1929.\n\n==Noted activities==\n\nJudge [[William Jay Gaynor]] and the principal [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]] nominees spoke at a public meeting under the auspices of the Taxpayers\u2019 Protective Union, held at Niblo's Garden, 170th Street and Third Avenue, on October 28, 1909, and on October 21, 1913, mayoral candidate John A. Hennessy spoke to a Niblo's Garden audience of more than 3,000, charging that Tammany candidate Judge Edward E. McCall bought his Supreme Court position.\n\nA riot erupted at the hall and park on June 6, 1914, when more than 200 members of the Bronx Bakers and Confectioners\u2019 Union were involved in late-night fight following the group's annual Summer Night picnic. Rioters used beer bottles and chairs as weapons during a disturbance that erupted in the open air garden at the rear of the dance hall. Several injuries were reported both by bakers and responding Sheriff Deputies, but no one was hospitalized. A December 17, 1916 fight at Niblo's Garden led to a panic among some 500 dance patrons when guns were fired and responding police were attacked. Six arrests were made after the incident, which apparently erupted when hall security officers told several youths to discontinue their \u201cextreme styles of dancing.\u201d\n\nA 1920 disturbance involved fifty men battling for their garments in the coat check room at Niblo's Garden, the Bronx, resulting in a call to the Bathgate Avenue police station. The crowd was moved to the police station, where twenty-five stolen property complaints were made before the incident was finally sorted and garments returned to proper owners with the exception of a single missing coat.\n\nA sales notice in July, 1922 transferring the property to Assets Funding Corporation described Niblo's Garden as \u201cfronting 92 feet on Third Avenue and 323 feet on East 170th by 170 feet in depth. It consists of  about sixteen lots with a three-story building, 92 by 150, which will be used for an entertainment hall, skating, amusement park, etc.\u201d However, an August 5, 1922 announcement marked the sale of Niblo's Garden at the \u201csoutheast corner of Third Avenue and 170th Street\u201d by W. C. Reeves & Co. to the newly formed corporation \u201cClaremont Palace Garden, Inc., which will continue it as a dancing place,\u201d under the incorporators, Donato Piciulo, Joseph Blum, and George Axelrad.\n\nIn 1924 French societies in New York celebrated [[Bastille Day]], July 14, at the Bronx Lyceum. French war veterans and all French societies of the metropolitan district, thirty-five in all, organized the event.\n\nThe Starlight Athletic Club sponsored an amateur boxing tournament in the building in October 1926. A program of ten bouts, which included New York [[bantamweight]] champion Eddie Reid, was held.\n\nFollowing a walkout called by Allied Council of Cleaners and Dyers in February 1928, union organization meetings were held in many locales, including the Lyceum, and in July 1928 New York City supporters of [[William III of England]] marched to the building from Bronx Avenue, in celebration of the 238th anniversary of the Battle of Boynton. Political speeches were made followed by an evening of dancing.\n\n==Destruction==\n\nThree firemen were burned by a fire which destroyed the Bronx Lyceum in an early morning blaze on March 3, 1929. The fire began around 3:45&nbsp;a.m., several hours after a dance by the Lena Lang Circle of the Foresters of America had concluded. It threatened to spread to the warehouse of the Bronx Drug Company, where large quantities of chemicals were stored. The structure was described as being an ''old three-story wood and stucco,\nwhich was the cradle of the careers of many politicians.'' The smoke drove\nforty-eight families in the tenement across the way, at 581 East 170th Street, to the street. Firemen of Engine Company 50, stationed on the roof,\nwet the fire down.\n\nThe building was designed by architect Louis Falk, New York architect.\n\n==References==\n*[[The New York Times]], ''Hints that M'Call Bought Judgeship'', October 22, 1913.\n*The New York Times, ''Fight at Bakers Picnic'', June 7, 1914.\n*The New York Times, ''Bullets Imperil Dancers'', December 18, 1916.\n*The New York Times, ''Fifty Fight for Coats'', November 8, 1920.\n*The New York Times, ''Trading in the Bronx'', July 7, 1922.\n*The New York Times, ''Niblos Garden in Bronx Sold'', August 5, 1922.\n*The New York Times, ''City Brevities'', July 2, 1924, Page 40.\n*The New York Times, ''Amateurs at Bronx Lyceum'', October 29, 1926, Page 26.\n*The New York Times, ''Full Shutdown of Dye Shops Voted'', February 22, 1928, Page 19.\n*The New York Times, ''Orangemen Hold Parade'', July 13, 1928, Page 11.\n*The New York Times, Flames Destroy The Bronx Lyceum'', March 4, 1929, Page 23.\n*\"''A Standard History of Freemasonry in the State of New York''\" by Peter Russ, Lewis Publishing Co., 1899, Page 258.\n{{coord|40.8349|-73.9035|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-NY|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Cultural history of New York City]]\n[[Category:History of the Bronx]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Bronx Lyceum''' was a building in [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]] erected on the southeast corner of Third Avenue and 170th Street by Henry Zeltner in 1870 across the street from his brewery.

The building was used as a meeting hall by politicians and union members, and served variously as an entertainment hall, skating venue, and amusement park until its destruction by fire in 1929.\n\n==Noted activities==\n\nJudge [[William Jay Gaynor]] and the principal [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]] nominees spoke at a public meeting under the auspices of the Taxpayers\u2019 Protective Union, held at Niblo's Garden, 170th Street and Third Avenue, on October 28, 1909, and on October 21, 1913, mayoral candidate John A. Hennessy spoke to a Niblo's Garden audience of more than 3,000, charging that Tammany candidate Judge Edward E. McCall bought his Supreme Court position.\n\nA riot erupted at the hall and park on June 6, 1914, when more than 200 members of the Bronx Bakers and Confectioners\u2019 Union were involved in late-night fight following the group's annual Summer Night picnic. Rioters used beer bottles and chairs as weapons during a disturbance that erupted in the open air garden at the rear of the dance hall. Several injuries were reported both by bakers and responding Sheriff Deputies, but no one was hospitalized. A December 17, 1916 fight at Niblo's Garden led to a panic among some 500 dance patrons when guns were fired and responding police were attacked. Six arrests were made after the incident, which apparently erupted when hall security officers told several youths to discontinue their \u201cextreme styles of dancing.\u201d\n\nA 1920 disturbance involved fifty men battling for their garments in the coat check room at Niblo's Garden, the Bronx, resulting in a call to the Bathgate Avenue police station. The crowd was moved to the police station, where twenty-five stolen property complaints were made before the incident was finally sorted and garments returned to proper owners with the exception of a single missing coat.\n\nA sales notice in July, 1922 transferring the property to Assets Funding Corporation described Niblo's Garden as \u201cfronting 92 feet on Third Avenue and 323 feet on East 170th by 170 feet in depth. It consists of  about sixteen lots with a three-story building, 92 by 150, which will be used for an entertainment hall, skating, amusement park, etc.\u201d However, an August 5, 1922 announcement marked the sale of Niblo's Garden at the \u201csoutheast corner of Third Avenue and 170th Street\u201d by W. C. Reeves & Co. to the newly formed corporation \u201cClaremont Palace Garden, Inc., which will continue it as a dancing place,\u201d under the incorporators, Donato Piciulo, Joseph Blum, and George Axelrad.\n\nIn 1924 French societies in New York celebrated [[Bastille Day]], July 14, at the Bronx Lyceum. French war veterans and all French societies of the metropolitan district, thirty-five in all, organized the event.\n\nThe Starlight Athletic Club sponsored an amateur boxing tournament in the building in October 1926. A program of ten bouts, which included New York [[bantamweight]] champion Eddie Reid, was held.\n\nFollowing a walkout called by Allied Council of Cleaners and Dyers in February 1928, union organization meetings were held in many locales, including the Lyceum, and in July 1928 New York City supporters of [[William III of England]] marched to the building from Bronx Avenue, in celebration of the 238th anniversary of the Battle of Boynton. Political speeches were made followed by an evening of dancing.\n\n==Destruction==\n\nThree firemen were burned by a fire which destroyed the Bronx Lyceum in an early morning blaze on March 3, 1929. The fire began around 3:45&nbsp;a.m., several hours after a dance by the Lena Lang Circle of the Foresters of America had concluded. It threatened to spread to the warehouse of the Bronx Drug Company, where large quantities of chemicals were stored. The structure was described as being an ''old three-story wood and stucco,\nwhich was the cradle of the careers of many politicians.'' The smoke drove\nforty-eight families in the tenement across the way, at 581 East 170th Street, to the street. Firemen of Engine Company 50, stationed on the roof,\nwet the fire down.\n\nThe building was designed by architect Louis Falk, New York architect.\n\n==References==\n*[[The New York Times]], ''Hints that M'Call Bought Judgeship'', October 22, 1913.\n*The New York Times, ''Fight at Bakers Picnic'', June 7, 1914.\n*The New York Times, ''Bullets Imperil Dancers'', December 18, 1916.\n*The New York Times, ''Fifty Fight for Coats'', November 8, 1920.\n*The New York Times, ''Trading in the Bronx'', July 7, 1922.\n*The New York Times, ''Niblos Garden in Bronx Sold'', August 5, 1922.\n*The New York Times, ''City Brevities'', July 2, 1924, Page 40.\n*The New York Times, ''Amateurs at Bronx Lyceum'', October 29, 1926, Page 26.\n*The New York Times, ''Full Shutdown of Dye Shops Voted'', February 22, 1928, Page 19.\n*The New York Times, ''Orangemen Hold Parade'', July 13, 1928, Page 11.\n*The New York Times, Flames Destroy The Bronx Lyceum'', March 4, 1929, Page 23.\n*\"''A Standard History of Freemasonry in the State of New York''\" by Peter Russ, Lewis Publishing Co., 1899, Page 258.\n{{coord|40.8349|-73.9035|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-NY|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Former buildings and structures in the Bronx]]\n[[Category:Cultural history of New York City]]\n[[Category:History of the Bronx]]\n", "name_user": "TheImaCow", "label": "safe", "comment": "removedCategory:Former buildings and structures in the BronxusingHotCat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_Lyceum"}

Antinatalists argue that people should abstain from procreation because it is [[morality|morally]] [[evil|bad]] (some also recognize the procreation of other [[sentience|sentient beings]] as morally bad). In scholarly and in literary writings, various [[ethics|ethical]] foundations have been presented for antinatalism.<ref>K.

He throws them into a form of sorites; but, as such, it is logically faulty and all he wishes to convey is this:  Oblivious of the suffering to which life is subject, man begets children, and is thus the cause of old age and death.  If he would only realize what suffering he would add to by his act, he would desist from the procreation of children; and so stop the operation of old age and death.<ref>H.

In parenthood, the human parent imitates the divine parent, in the sense that education could be understood as a form of pursuit of \"salvation\", the \"right path\" for a child. However, a human being could decide that it is better not to suffer at all than to suffer and be offered the later possibility of salvation from suffering. In Cabrera's opinion, evil is associated not with the [[nothing|lack of being]], but with the suffering and dying of those that are alive. So, on the contrary, evil is only and obviously associated with [[being]].<ref name=autoname1>J.

He is of the opinion that the less faith in the Almighty Creator-God there is, the more urgent the question of anthropodicy becomes. Akerma thinks that for those who want to lead ethical lives, the causation of suffering requires a justification. Man can no longer shed responsibility for the suffering that occurs by appealing to an imaginary entity that sets moral principles. For Akerma, antinatalism is a consequence of the collapse of theodicy endeavours and the failure of attempts to establish an anthropodizee. According to him, there is no metaphysics nor moral theory that can justify the production of new people, and therefore anthropodicy is indefensible as well as theodicy.<ref name=autoname2>K.

According to him, [[consciousness]] has become over-evolved in humans, thereby making us incapable of functioning normally like other animals: cognition gives us more than we can carry. Our frailness and insignificance in the cosmos are visible to us. We want to live, and yet because of how we have evolved, we are the only species whose members are conscious that they are destined to die. We are able to analyze the past and the future, both our situation and that of others, as well as to imagine the suffering of billions of people (as well as of other living beings) and feel [[compassion]] for their suffering. We yearn for justice and meaning in a world that lacks both. This ensures that the lives of conscious individuals are tragic. We have desires: spiritual needs which reality is unable to satisfy, and our species still exists only because we limit our awareness of what that reality actually entails. Human existence amounts to a tangled network of defense mechanisms, which can be observed both individually and socially, in our everyday behavior patterns. According to Zapffe, humanity should cease this self-deception, and the natural consequence would be its [[extinction]] by abstaining from procreation.<ref name=autoname3>P.W.

Cabrera, ''Mal-estar e moralidade: situa\u00e7\u00e3o humana, \u00e9tica e procria\u00e7\u00e3o respons\u00e1vel'', Bras\u00edlia: UnB, 2018 (original Portuguese edition).</ref> He describes procreation as manipulation and harm, a unilateral and non-consensual sending of a human being into a painful, dangerous and morally impeding situation.\n\nCabrera regards procreation as an [[ontology|ontological]] issue of total manipulation: one's very being is manufactured and used; in contrast to intra-worldly cases where someone is placed in a harmful situation. In the case of procreation no chance of defense against that act is even available. According to Cabrera: manipulation in procreation is visible primarily in the unilateral and non-consensual nature of the act, which makes procreation per se inevitably asymmetrical; be it a product of forethought, or a product of neglect. It is always connected with the interests (or disinterests) of other humans, not the created human. In addition, Cabrera points out that in his view the manipulation of procreation is not limited to the act of creation itself, but it is continued in the process of raising the child, during which parents gain great power over the child's life, who is shaped according to their preferences and for their satisfaction. He emphasizes that although it is not possible to avoid manipulation in procreation, it is perfectly possible to avoid procreation itself and that then no moral rule is violated.\n\nCabrera believes that the situation in which one is placed through procreation, human life, is structurally negative in that its constitutive features are inherently adverse. The most prominent of them are, according to Cabrera, the following:\n* (a) The being acquired by a human at birth is decreasing (or \"decaying\"), in the sense of a being that begins to end since its very emergence, following a single and irreversible direction of deterioration and decline, of which complete consummation can occur at any moment between some minutes and around one hundred years.\n* (b) From the moment they come into being, humans are affected by three kinds of frictions: physical pain (in the form of illnesses, accidents and natural catastrophes to which they are always exposed); discouragement (in the form of \"lacking the will\", or the \"mood\" or the \"spirit\", to continue to act, from mild taedium vitae to serious forms of depression), and finally, exposure to the aggressions of other humans (from gossip and slander to various forms of discrimination, persecution and injustice), aggressions that we too can inflict on others, also submitted, like us, to the three kinds of friction.\n* (c) To defend themselves against (a) and (b), human beings are equipped with mechanisms of creation of positive values (ethical, [[aesthetic]], [[religious]], [[entertaining]], [[recreational]], as well as values contained in human realizations of all kinds), which humans must keep constantly active. All positive values that appear within human life are reactive and palliative; they are introduced by the permanent, anxious and uncertain struggle against the decaying life and its three kinds of friction.\n\nCabrera calls the set of these characteristics A\u2013C the \"terminality of being\". He is of the opinion that a huge number of humans around the world cannot withstand this steep struggle against the terminal structure of their being, which leads to destructive consequences for them and others: [[suicide]]s, major or minor [[mental disorder|mental illnesses]], or [[aggression|aggressive behavior]]. He accepts that life may be \u2013 thanks to human's own merits and efforts \u2013 bearable and even very pleasant (though not for all, due to the phenomenon of moral impediment), but also considers it problematic to bring someone into existence so that they may attempt to make their life pleasant by struggling against the difficult and oppressive situation we place them in by procreating. It seems more reasonable, according to Cabrera, simply not to put them in that situation, since the results of their struggle are always uncertain.\n\nCabrera believes that in ethics, including affirmative ethics, there is one overarching concept which he calls the \"Minimal Ethical Articulation\", \"MEA\" (previously translated into English as \"Fundamental Ethical Articulation\" and \"FEA\"): the consideration of other people's interests, not manipulating them and not harming them. Procreation for him is an obvious violation of MEA \u2013 someone is manipulated and placed in a harmful situation as a result of that action. In his view, values included in the MEA are widely accepted by affirmative ethics, they are even their basics, and if approached [[hypocrisy|radically]], they should lead to the refusal of procreation.\n\nFor Cabrera, the worst thing in human life and by extension in procreation is what he calls \"moral impediment\": the structural impossibility of acting in the world without harming or manipulating someone at some given moment (not, of course, everyone at every moment). This impediment does not occur because of an intrinsic \"evil\" of human nature, but because of the structural situation in which the human being has always been. In this situation, we are cornered by various kinds of pain, space for action is limited, and different interests often conflict with each other. We do not have to have bad intentions to treat others with disregard; we are compelled to do so in order to survive, pursue our projects and escape from suffering. Cabrera also draws attention to the fact that life is associated with the constant risk of one experiencing strong physical pain, which is common in human life, for example as a result of a serious illness, and maintains that the mere existence of such possibility impedes us morally, as well as that because of it, we can at any time lose, as a result of its occurrence, the possibility of a dignified, moral functioning even to a minimal extent.\n\n=== Kantian imperative ===\n\nJulio Cabrera,<ref>[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15274/1/LIVRO_PorqueTeAmo.pdf] J.

Akerma, ''Theodicy shading off into Anthropodicy in Milton, Twain and Kant'', ''Tabula Rasa.

They argue that a person can be created for the sake of his parents or other people, but that it is impossible to create someone for his own good; and that therefore, following Kant's recommendation, we should not create new people. Heiko Puls argues that Kant's considerations regarding parental duties and human procreation, in general, imply arguments for an ethically justified antinatalism. Kant, however, according to Puls, rejects this position in his [[teleology]] for [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] reasons.<ref>H.

Shiffrin, ''Wrongful Life, Procreative Responsibility, and the Significance of Harm'', Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 133.</ref>\n\nGerald Harrison and Julia Tanner argue that when we want to significantly affect someone by our action and it is not possible to get their consent, then the default should be to not take such action. The exception is, according to them, actions by which we want to prevent greater harm of a person (for example, pushing someone out of the way of a falling piano). However, in their opinion, such actions certainly do not include procreation, because before taking this action a person does not exist.<ref>[https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3AF8BE47794522E31BE351F4D9822344/S1477175610000436a.pdf/better_not_to_have_children.pdf] G.

In his opinion, it is enough to think that there is no moral right to inflict serious, preventable harms upon others without their consent.<ref>[https://ujcontent.uj.ac.za/vital/access/services/Download/uj:7429/CONTENT1?view=true] A.

Larock, ''Possible preferences and the harm of existence'', University of St. Andrews, 2009.</ref> According to this view:\n* Each person has an interest in acquiring a new satisfied preference.\n* Whenever a person is deprived of a new satisfied preference this violates an interest and thus causes harm.\n\nLarock argues that if a person is deprived of an infinite number of new satisfied [[preference utilitarianism|preferences]], they suffer an infinite number of harms and that such deprivation is death to which procreation leads.\n\n{{quote|All of us are brought into existence, without our consent, and over the course of our lives, we are acquainted with a multitude of goods. Unfortunately, there is a limit to the amount of good each of us will have in our lives. Eventually, each of us will die and we will be permanently cut off from the prospect of any further good. Existence, viewed in this way, seems to be a cruel joke.}}\n\nLarock believes that it is not correct to neutralize his view by stating that death is also an\u00a0infinitely great benefit for us, because it protects us from the infinite number of new frustrated preferences. He proposes a thought experiment in which we have two people, Mary and Tom. The first person, Mary, dies at the age of forty years as a result of complications caused by a [[degenerative disease]]. Mary would live for some more time, if not for the complications, but she would only experience bad things in her life, not good ones. The second person, Tom, dies the same age from the same illness, but in his case, the disease is at such a stage of development that his body would no longer be able to function. According to Larock, it is bad when someone, like in the case of Tom, encounters the impossibility of continuing to derive good things from his life; everybody's life leads to such a point if someone lives long enough and our intuitions do not tell us that this is generally good or even neutral. Therefore, we should reject the view that death is also an infinitely great benefit: because we think that Tom has been unlucky. In the case of Mary, our intuitions tell us that her misfortune is not as great as Tom's misfortune. Her misfortune is reduced by the fact that death saved her from the real prospect of experiencing bad things. We do not have the same intuition in Tom's case. No evil or good future was physically possible for him. Larock thinks that while the impossibility of experiencing future good things seems to us to be a harm, the mere lack of a logical possibility of experiencing future bad things does not seem to be a compensatory benefit to us. If so, there would be nothing strange in recognizing that Tom had not suffered any misfortune. But he is a victim of misfortune, just like Mary. However, Mary's misfortune does not seem to be so great because her death prevents great suffering. Larock is of the opinion that most people will see both cases in this way. This conclusion is supposed to lead to the fact that we recognize that there is an asymmetry between the harms and benefits that death brings.\n\nLarock summarizes his view as follows:\n\n{{quote|The existence of every moral patient in our world rests on a crude moral miscalculation. As I see it, non-procreation is the best means of rectifying this mistake.}}\n\n=== Negative utilitarianism ===\n\n[[Negative utilitarianism]] argues that minimizing suffering has greater moral importance than maximizing happiness.\n\n[[Hermann Vetter]] agrees with the [[The Asymmetry (population ethics)|assumptions]] of [[Jan Narveson]] :<ref>J.

Child will be more or less happy !! Child will be more or less unhappy\n|-\n| Produce the child || No duty fulfilled or violated || Duty violated\n|-\n| Do not produce the child || No duty fulfilled or violated || Duty fulfilled\n|}\n\nBased on this, he concludes that we should not create people:<ref name=autoname4>H.

So we have, instead of (3), the far-reaching consequence: (3') In any case, it is morally preferable not to produce a child.}}\n\nKarim Akerma argues that utilitarianism requires the least metaphysical assumptions and is, therefore, the most convincing ethical theory. He believes that negative utilitarianism is the right one because the good things in life do not compensate for the bad things; first and foremost, the best things do not compensate for the worst things such as, for example, the experiences of terrible pain, the agonies of the wounded, sick or dying. In his opinion, we also rarely know what to do to make people happy, but we know what to do so that people do not suffer: it is enough that they are not created. What is important for Akerma in ethics is the striving for the least amount of suffering people (ultimately no one), not striving for the most amount of happy people, which, according to him, takes place at the expense of immeasurable suffering.<ref>K. Akerma, ''Soll eine Menschheit sein? Eine fundamentalethische Frage'', Cuxhaven-Dartford: Traude Junghans, 1995.</ref><ref name=\"autoname2\" />\n\nBruno Contestabile cites the story \"[[The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas]]\" by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]. In this story, the existence of the utopian city of Omelas and the good fortune of its inhabitants depend on the suffering of one child tortured in an isolated place and who can not be helped. The majority accepts this state of affairs and stay in the city, but there are those who do not agree with it, who do not want to participate in it and thus they \"walk away from Omelas\". Contestabile draws a parallel here: for Omelas to exist, the child must be tortured, and in the same way, the existence of our world is related to the fact that someone is constantly harmed. According to Contestabile, antinatalists can be seen just as \"the ones who walk away from Omelas\", who do not accept such a world, and who do not approve of its perpetuation. He poses the question: is all happiness able to compensate for the extreme suffering of even one person?<ref>B. Contestabile, ''The Denial of the World from an Impartial View'', ''Contemporary Buddhism: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', volume 17, issue 1, Taylor and Francis, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== David Benatar ===\n\nDavid Benatar argues that there is a crucial asymmetry between the good and the bad things, such as pleasure and pain:\n* (1) the presence of pain is bad;\n* (2) the presence of pleasure is good;\n* (3) the absence of pain is good, even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone;\n* (4) the absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a deprivation.<ref>D. Benatar, ''Why it is Better Never to Come Into Existence'', ''American Philosophical Quarterly'', 1997, volume 34, number 3, pp. 345\u2013355.</ref><ref>D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 30\u201340.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Scenario A (X exists) !! Scenario B (X never exists)\n|-\n| (1) Presence of pain (Bad) || (3) Absence of pain (Good)\n|-\n| (2) Presence of pleasure (Good) || (4) Absence of pleasure (Not bad)\n|}\n\nRegarding procreation, the argument follows that coming into existence generates both good and bad experiences, pain and pleasure, whereas not coming into existence entails neither pain nor pleasure. The absence of pain is good, the absence of pleasure is not bad. Therefore, the ethical choice is weighed in favor of non-procreation.\n\nBenatar explains the above asymmetry using four other asymmetries that he considers quite plausible:\n* We have a moral obligation not to create unhappy people and we have no moral obligation to create happy people. The reason why we think there is a moral obligation not to create unhappy people is that the presence of this suffering would be bad (for the sufferers) and the absence of the suffering is good (even though there is nobody to enjoy the absence of suffering). By contrast, the reason we think there is no moral obligation to create happy people is that although their pleasure would be good for them, the absence of pleasure when they do not come into existence will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.\n* It is strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide to create them, and it is not strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide not to create them. That the child may be happy is not a morally important reason to create them. By contrast, that the child may be unhappy is an important moral reason not to create them. If it were the case that the absence of pleasure is bad even if someone does not exist to experience its absence, then we would have a significant moral reason to create a child and to create as many children as possible. And if it were not the case that the absence of pain is good even if someone does not exist to experience this good, then we would not have a significant moral reason not to create a child.\n* Someday we can regret for the sake of a person whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we created them \u2013 a person can be unhappy and the presence of their pain would be a bad thing. But we will never feel regret for the sake of a person whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we did not create them \u2013 a person will not be deprived of happiness, because he or she will never exist, and the absence of happiness will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.\n* We feel sadness by the fact that somewhere people come into existence and suffer, and we feel no sadness by the fact that somewhere people did not come into existence in a place where there are happy people. When we know that somewhere people came into existence and suffer, we feel compassion. The fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and suffer is good. This is because the absence of pain is good even when there is not someone who is experiencing this good. On the other hand, we do not feel sadness by the fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and are not happy. This is because the absence of pleasure is bad only when someone exists to be deprived of this good.\n\nAccording to Benatar, by creating a child, we are responsible not only for this child's suffering, but we may also be co-responsible for the suffering of further offspring of this child.<ref>D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Assuming that each couple has three children, an original pair's cumulative descendants over ten generations amount to 88,572 people. That constitutes a lot of pointless, avoidable suffering. To be sure, full responsibility for it all does not lie with the original couple because each new generation faces the choice of whether to continue that line of descendants. Nevertheless, they bear some responsibility for the generations that ensue. If one does not desist from having children, one can hardly expect one's descendants to do so.<ref>D.

Benatar, D. Wasserman, ''Debating Procreation: Is It Wrong To Reproduce?'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, pp. 87\u2013121.</ref> that can be summarized in his opinion as follows:\n\n{{Block quote|Another route to anti-natalism is via what I call a \"misanthropic\" argument.

De Giraud emphasizes that, across the world, there are millions of existing children who need care.\n\n== Realism ==\n\nSome antinatalists believe that most people do not evaluate reality accurately, which affects the desire to have children.\n\nPeter Wessel Zapffe identifies four repressive mechanisms we use, consciously or not, to restrict our consciousness of life and the world:\n* isolation {{ndash}} an arbitrary dismissal from our consciousness and the consciousness of others about all negative thoughts and feelings associated with the unpleasant facts of our existence. In daily life, this manifests as a tacit agreement to remain silent on certain subjects {{ndash}} especially around children, to prevent instilling in them a fear of the world and what awaits them in life, before they will be able to learn other mechanisms.\n* anchoring {{ndash}} the creation and use of personal values to ensure our attachment to reality, such as parents, home, the street, school, God, the church, the State, morality, fate, the law of life, the people, the future, accumulation of material goods or authority, etc. This can be characterized as creating a defensive structure, \"a fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness\", and defending the structure against threats.\n* distraction {{ndash}} shifting focus to new impressions to flee from circumstances and ideas we consider harmful or unpleasant.\n* sublimation {{ndash}} refocusing the tragic parts of life into something creative or valuable, usually through an aesthetic confrontation for the purpose of catharsis. We focus on the imaginary, dramatic, heroic, lyric or comic aspects of life, to allow ourselves and others an escape from their true impact.\n\nAccording to Zapffe, depressive disorders are often \"messages from a deeper, more immediate sense of life, bitter fruits of a geniality of thought\".<ref name=\"autoname3\" /> Some studies seem to confirm this, it is said about the phenomenon of [[depressive realism]], and Colin Feltham writes about antinatalism as one of its possible consequences.<ref>C. Feltham, ''Depressive Realism: Interdisciplinary perspectives'', Abingdon: Routledge, 2016.</ref>\n\nDavid Benatar citing numerous studies lists three phenomena described by psychologists, which, according to him, are responsible for making our self-assessments about the quality of our lives unreliable:\n* [[Optimism bias|Tendency towards optimism]] (or [[Pollyanna principle]]) \u2013 we have a positively distorted picture of our lives in the past, present and future.\n* Adaptation (or accommodation, habituation) \u2013 we adapt to negative situations and adjust our expectations accordingly.\n* Comparison \u2013 for our self-assessments about the quality of our lives, more important than how our lives go is how our they go in comparison with the lives of others. One of the effects of this is that negative aspects of life that affect everyone are not taken into account when assessing our own well-being. We are also more likely to compare ourselves with those who are worse off than those who are better off.\n\nBenatar concludes:\n\n{{quote|The above psychological phenomena are unsurprising from an evolutionary perspective. They militate against suicide and in favour of reproduction. If our lives are quite as bad as I shall still suggest they are, and if people were prone to see this true quality of their lives for what it is, they might be much more inclined to kill themselves, or at least not to produce more such lives. Pessimism, then, tends not to be naturally selected.<ref>D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 64\u201369.</ref>}}\n\n[[Thomas Ligotti]] draws attention to the similarity between Zapffe's philosophy and [[terror management theory]]. Terror management theory argues that humans are equipped with unique cognitive abilities beyond what is necessary for survival, which includes symbolic thinking, extensive self-consciousness and perception of themselves as temporal beings aware of the finitude of their existence. The desire to live alongside our awareness of the inevitability of death triggers terror in us. Opposition to this fear is among our primary motivations. To escape it, we build defensive structures around ourselves to ensure our symbolic or literal immortality, to feel like valuable members of a meaningful universe, and to focus on protecting ourselves from immediate external threats.<ref>T. Ligotti, ''The Conspiracy against the Human Race: A Contrivance of Horror'', New York: Hippocampus Press, 2010, pp. 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\n== Abortion ==\n\nAntinatalism can lead to a particular position on the morality of [[abortion]].\n\nAccording to David Benatar, one comes into existence in the morally relevant sense when consciousness arises, when a fetus becomes sentient, and up until that time an abortion is moral, whereas continued pregnancy would be immoral. Benatar refers to [[electroencephalography|EEG]] brain studies and studies on [[prenatal perception|the pain perception of the fetus]], which states that fetal consciousness arises no earlier than between twenty-eight and thirty weeks of pregnancy, before which it is incapable of feeling pain.<ref>D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 132\u2013162.</ref> Contrary to that, the latest report from the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] showed that the fetus gains consciousness no earlier than week twenty-four of the pregnancy.<ref>[https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/rcogfetalawarenesswpr0610.pdf] Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, ''Fetal Awareness \u2013 Review of Research and Recommendations for Practice'', London: RCOG Press, 2010.</ref> Some assumptions of this report regarding sentience of the fetus after the second trimester were criticized.<ref>[http://fn.bmj.com/content/96/4/F236.long] M. W. Platt, ''Fetal awareness and fetal pain: the Emperor's new clothes'', ''Archives of Disease in Childhood'', 2011, volume 96, issue 4.</ref> In a similar way argues Karim Akerma. He distinguishes between organisms that do not have mental properties and living beings that have mental properties. According to his view, which he calls the mentalistic view, a living being begins to exist when an organism (or another entity) produces a simple form of consciousness for the first time.<ref>K. Akerma, ''Lebensende und Lebensbeginn: Philosophische Implikationen und mentalistische Begr\u00fcndung des Hirn-Todeskriterium'', Lit: Hamburg 2006.</ref><ref>K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus...'' op. cit., p. 404.</ref>\n\nJulio Cabrera believes that the moral problem of abortion is totally different from the problem of abstention of procreation, because in the case of abortion, there is no longer a non-being, but an already existing being \u2013 the most helpless and defenceless of the parties involved, that someday will have the autonomy to decide, and we cannot decide for them. From the point of view of Cabrera's negative ethics, abortion is immoral for similar reasons as procreation. For Cabrera, the exception in which abortion is morally justified are cases of irreversible illness of the foetus (or some serious \"social illnesses\" like [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|American conquest]] or [[Nazism]]), according to him in such cases we are clearly thinking about the unborn, and not simply of our own interests. In addition, Cabrera believes that under certain circumstances, it is legitimate and comprehensible to commit unethical actions, for example, abortion is a legitimate and comprehensible, when the mother's life is at risk.<ref>[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15274/1/LIVRO_PorqueTeAmo.pdf] J.

Karim Akerma defines antinatalism, that includes non-human sentient animals, as universal antinatalism<ref>K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus...'' op. cit., pp. 100\u2013101.</ref> and he assumes such a position himself:\n\n{{quote|By sterilising animals, we can free them from being slaves to their instincts and from bringing more and more captive animals into the cycle of being born, contracting parasites, ageing, falling ill and dying; eating and being eaten.<ref>[https://www.pro-iure-animalis.de/dokumente/manifest_antinatalismus.pdf] K.

Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 2\u20133 (introduction), 163.</ref>\n\nMagnus Vinding argues that the life of wild animals in their natural environment is generally [[Wild animal suffering|very bad]]. He draws attention to phenomena such as dying before adulthood, starvation, diseases, [[parasites]], [[infanticide]], [[predation]] and being eaten alive. He cites research on what animal life looks like in the wild. One of eight male lion cubs survives into adulthood. Others die as a result of starvation, disease and often fall victims to the teeth and claws of other lions. Attaining adulthood is much rarer for fish. Only one in a hundred male chinook salmon survive into adulthood. Vinding is of the opinion that if human lives and the survival of human children looked like this, current human values would disallow procreation; however, this is not possible when it comes to non-human animals, who are guided by instinct. He takes the view that even if one does not agree that procreation is always morally bad, one should recognize procreation in wildlife as morally bad and something that ought to be prevented (at least in theory, not necessarily in practice). He maintains that non-intervention cannot be defended if we reject [[speciesism]] and that we should reject the unjustifiable [[Appeal to nature|dogma]] stating that what is happening in nature is what should be happening in nature.\n\n{{quote|We cannot allow ourselves to spuriously rationalize away the suffering that takes place in nature, and to forget the victims of the horrors of nature merely because that reality does not fit into our convenient moral theories, theories that ultimately just serve to make us feel consistent and good about ourselves in the face of an incomprehensibly bad reality.<ref>[https://www.smashwords.com/extreader/read/624122/1/the-speciesism-of-leaving-nature-alone-and-the-theoretical-c] M.

He throws them into a form of sorites; but, as such, it is logically faulty and all he wishes to convey is this:  Oblivious of the suffering to which life is subject, man begets children, and is thus the cause of old age and death.  If he would only realize what suffering he would add to by his act, he would desist from the procreation of children; and so stop the operation of old age and death.<ref>H.

In parenthood, the human parent imitates the divine parent, in the sense that education could be understood as a form of pursuit of \"salvation\", the \"right path\" for a child. However, a human being could decide that it is better not to suffer at all than to suffer and be offered the later possibility of salvation from suffering. In Cabrera's opinion, evil is associated not with the [[nothing|lack of being]], but with the suffering and dying of those that are alive. So, on the contrary, evil is only and obviously associated with [[being]].<ref name=autoname1>J.

He is of the opinion that the less faith in the Almighty Creator-God there is, the more urgent the question of anthropodicy becomes. Akerma thinks that for those who want to lead ethical lives, the causation of suffering requires a justification. Man can no longer shed responsibility for the suffering that occurs by appealing to an imaginary entity that sets moral principles. For Akerma, antinatalism is a consequence of the collapse of theodicy endeavours and the failure of attempts to establish an anthropodizee. According to him, there is no metaphysics nor moral theory that can justify the production of new people, and therefore anthropodicy is indefensible as well as theodicy.<ref name=autoname2>K.

According to him, [[consciousness]] has become over-evolved in humans, thereby making us incapable of functioning normally like other animals: cognition gives us more than we can carry. Our frailness and insignificance in the cosmos are visible to us. We want to live, and yet because of how we have evolved, we are the only species whose members are conscious that they are destined to die. We are able to analyze the past and the future, both our situation and that of others, as well as to imagine the suffering of billions of people (as well as of other living beings) and feel [[compassion]] for their suffering. We yearn for justice and meaning in a world that lacks both. This ensures that the lives of conscious individuals are tragic. We have desires: spiritual needs which reality is unable to satisfy, and our species still exists only because we limit our awareness of what that reality actually entails. Human existence amounts to a tangled network of defense mechanisms, which can be observed both individually and socially, in our everyday behavior patterns. According to Zapffe, humanity should cease this self-deception, and the natural consequence would be its [[extinction]] by abstaining from procreation.<ref name=autoname3>P.W.

[https://www.cambridgescholars.com/discomfort-and-moral-impediment] A thirty-page extract on the publisher's website. J. Cabrera, ''Mal-estar e moralidade: situa\u00e7\u00e3o humana, \u00e9tica e procria\u00e7\u00e3o respons\u00e1vel'', Bras\u00edlia: UnB, 2018 (original Portuguese edition).</ref> He describes procreation as manipulation and harm, a unilateral and non-consensual sending of a human being into a painful, dangerous and morally impeding situation.\n\nCabrera regards procreation as an [[ontology|ontological]] issue of total manipulation: one's very being is manufactured and used; in contrast to intra-worldly cases where someone is placed in a harmful situation. In the case of procreation no chance of defense against that act is even available. According to Cabrera: manipulation in procreation is visible primarily in the unilateral and non-consensual nature of the act, which makes procreation per se inevitably asymmetrical; be it a product of forethought, or a product of neglect. It is always connected with the interests (or disinterests) of other humans, not the created human. In addition, Cabrera points out that in his view the manipulation of procreation is not limited to the act of creation itself, but it is continued in the process of raising the child, during which parents gain great power over the child's life, who is shaped according to their preferences and for their satisfaction. He emphasizes that although it is not possible to avoid manipulation in procreation, it is perfectly possible to avoid procreation itself and that then no moral rule is violated.\n\nCabrera believes that the situation in which one is placed through procreation, human life, is structurally negative in that its constitutive features are inherently adverse. The most prominent of them are, according to Cabrera, the following:\n* (a) The being acquired by a human at birth is decreasing (or \"decaying\"), in the sense of a being that begins to end since its very emergence, following a single and irreversible direction of deterioration and decline, of which complete consummation can occur at any moment between some minutes and around one hundred years.\n* (b) From the moment they come into being, humans are affected by three kinds of frictions: physical pain (in the form of illnesses, accidents and natural catastrophes to which they are always exposed); discouragement (in the form of \"lacking the will\", or the \"mood\" or the \"spirit\", to continue to act, from mild taedium vitae to serious forms of depression), and finally, exposure to the aggressions of other humans (from gossip and slander to various forms of discrimination, persecution and injustice), aggressions that we too can inflict on others, also submitted, like us, to the three kinds of friction.\n* (c) To defend themselves against (a) and (b), human beings are equipped with mechanisms of creation of positive values (ethical, [[aesthetic]], [[religious]], [[entertaining]], [[recreational]], as well as values contained in human realizations of all kinds), which humans must keep constantly active. All positive values that appear within human life are reactive and palliative; they are introduced by the permanent, anxious and uncertain struggle against the decaying life and its three kinds of friction.\n\nCabrera calls the set of these characteristics A\u2013C the \"terminality of being\". He is of the opinion that a huge number of humans around the world cannot withstand this steep struggle against the terminal structure of their being, which leads to destructive consequences for them and others: [[suicide]]s, major or minor [[mental disorder|mental illnesses]], or [[aggression|aggressive behavior]]. He accepts that life may be \u2013 thanks to human's own merits and efforts \u2013 bearable and even very pleasant (though not for all, due to the phenomenon of moral impediment), but also considers it problematic to bring someone into existence so that they may attempt to make their life pleasant by struggling against the difficult and oppressive situation we place them in by procreating. It seems more reasonable, according to Cabrera, simply not to put them in that situation, since the results of their struggle are always uncertain.\n\nCabrera believes that in ethics, including affirmative ethics, there is one overarching concept which he calls the \"Minimal Ethical Articulation\", \"MEA\" (previously translated into English as \"Fundamental Ethical Articulation\" and \"FEA\"): the consideration of other people's interests, not manipulating them and not harming them. Procreation for him is an obvious violation of MEA \u2013 someone is manipulated and placed in a harmful situation as a result of that action. In his view, values included in the MEA are widely accepted by affirmative ethics, they are even their basics, and if approached [[hypocrisy|radically]], they should lead to the refusal of procreation.\n\nFor Cabrera, the worst thing in human life and by extension in procreation is what he calls \"moral impediment\": the structural impossibility of acting morally towards everyone in all circumstances. This impediment does not occur because of an intrinsic \"evil\" of human nature, but because of the structural situation in which the human being has always been. In this situation, we are cornered by various kinds of pain, space for action is limited, and different interests often conflict with each other. We do not have to have bad intentions to treat others with disregard; we are compelled to do so in order to survive, pursue our projects and escape from suffering. Cabrera also draws attention to the fact that life is associated with the constant risk of one experiencing strong physical pain, which is common in human life, for example as a result of a serious illness, and maintains that the mere existence of such possibility impedes us morally, as well as that because of it, we can at any time lose, as a result of its occurrence, the possibility of a dignified, moral functioning even to a minimal extent.\n\n=== Kantian imperative ===\n\nJulio Cabrera,<ref>[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15274/1/LIVRO_PorqueTeAmo.pdf] J.

They argue that a person can be created for the sake of his parents or other people, but that it is impossible to create someone for his own good; and that therefore, following Kant's recommendation, we should not create new people. Heiko Puls argues that Kant's considerations regarding parental duties and human procreation, in general, imply arguments for an ethically justified antinatalism. Kant, however, according to Puls, rejects this position in his [[teleology]] for [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] reasons.<ref>H.

The exception is, according to them, actions by which we want to prevent greater harm of a person (for example, pushing someone out of the way of a falling piano). However, in their opinion, such actions certainly do not include procreation, because before taking this action a person does not exist.<ref>[https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3AF8BE47794522E31BE351F4D9822344/S1477175610000436a.pdf/better_not_to_have_children.pdf] G.

In his opinion, it is enough to think that there is no moral right to inflict serious, preventable harms upon others without their consent.<ref>[https://ujcontent.uj.ac.za/vital/access/services/Download/uj:7429/CONTENT1?view=true] A.

Larock, ''Possible preferences and the harm of existence'', University of St. Andrews, 2009.</ref> According to this view:\n* Each person has an interest in acquiring a new satisfied preference.\n* Whenever a person is deprived of a new satisfied preference this violates an interest and thus causes harm.\n\nLarock argues that if a person is deprived of an infinite number of new satisfied [[preference utilitarianism|preferences]], they suffer an infinite number of harms and that such deprivation is death to which procreation leads.\n\n{{quote|All of us are brought into existence, without our consent, and over the course of our lives, we are acquainted with a multitude of goods. Unfortunately, there is a limit to the amount of good each of us will have in our lives. Eventually, each of us will die and we will be permanently cut off from the prospect of any further good. Existence, viewed in this way, seems to be a cruel joke.}}\n\nLarock believes that it is not correct to neutralize his view by stating that death is also an\u00a0infinitely great benefit for us, because it protects us from the infinite number of new frustrated preferences. He proposes a thought experiment in which we have two people, Mary and Tom. The first person, Mary, dies at the age of forty years as a result of complications caused by a [[degenerative disease]]. Mary would live for some more time, if not for the complications, but she would only experience bad things in her life, not good ones. The second person, Tom, dies the same age from the same illness, but in his case, the disease is at such a stage of development that his body would no longer be able to function. According to Larock, it is bad when someone, like in the case of Tom, encounters the impossibility of continuing to derive good things from his life; everybody's life leads to such a point if someone lives long enough and our intuitions do not tell us that this is generally good or even neutral. Therefore, we should reject the view that death is also an infinitely great benefit: because we think that Tom has been unlucky. In the case of Mary, our intuitions tell us that her misfortune is not as great as Tom's misfortune. Her misfortune is reduced by the fact that death saved her from the real prospect of experiencing bad things. We do not have the same intuition in Tom's case. No evil or good future was physically possible for him. Larock thinks that while the impossibility of experiencing future good things seems to us to be a harm, the mere lack of a logical possibility of experiencing future bad things does not seem to be a compensatory benefit to us. If so, there would be nothing strange in recognizing that Tom had not suffered any misfortune. But he is a victim of misfortune, just like Mary. However, Mary's misfortune does not seem to be so great because her death prevents great suffering. Larock is of the opinion that most people will see both cases in this way. This conclusion is supposed to lead to the fact that we recognize that there is an asymmetry between the harms and benefits that death brings.\n\nLarock summarizes his view as follows:\n\n{{quote|The existence of every moral patient in our world rests on a crude moral miscalculation. As I see it, non-procreation is the best means of rectifying this mistake.}}\n\n=== Negative utilitarianism ===\n\n[[Negative utilitarianism]] argues that minimizing suffering has greater moral importance than maximizing happiness.\n\n[[Hermann Vetter]] agrees with the [[The Asymmetry (population ethics)|assumptions]] of [[Jan Narveson]] :<ref>J. Narveson, ''Utilitarianism and New Generations'', ''Mind'', 1967, LXXVI (301), pp. 62\u201367.</ref>\n* (1) There is no moral obligation to produce a child even if we could be sure that it will be very happy throughout its life.\n* (2) There is a moral obligation not to produce a child if it can be foreseen that it will be unhappy.\nHowever, he disagrees with the conclusion that Narveson draws:\n* (3) In general \u2013 if it can be foreseen neither that the child will be unhappy nor that it will bring disutility upon others \u2013 there is no duty to have or not to have a child.\n\nInstead, he presents the following decision-theoretic matrix:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! Child will be more or less happy !! Child will be more or less unhappy\n|-\n| Produce the child || No duty fulfilled or violated || Duty violated\n|-\n| Do not produce the child || No duty fulfilled or violated || Duty fulfilled\n|}\n\nBased on this, he concludes that we should not create people:<ref name=autoname4>H. Vetter, ''The production of children as a problem for utilitarian ethics'', ''Inquiry'', 12, 1969, pp. 445\u2013447.</ref><ref>H. Vetter, ''Utilitarianism and New Generations'', ''Mind'', 1971, LXXX (318), pp. 301\u2013302.</ref>\n\n{{quote|It is seen immediately that the act \"do not produce the child\" dominates the act \"produce the child\" because it has equally good consequences as the other act in one case and better consequences in the other. So it is to be preferred to the other act as long as we cannot exclude with certainty the possibility that the child will be more or less unhappy; and we never can. So we have, instead of (3), the far-reaching consequence: (3') In any case, it is morally preferable not to produce a child.}}\n\nKarim Akerma argues that utilitarianism requires the least metaphysical assumptions and is, therefore, the most convincing ethical theory. He believes that negative utilitarianism is the right one because the good things in life do not compensate for the bad things; first and foremost, the best things do not compensate for the worst things such as, for example, the experiences of terrible pain, the agonies of the wounded, sick or dying. In his opinion, we also rarely know what to do to make people happy, but we know what to do so that people do not suffer: it is enough that they are not created. What is important for Akerma in ethics is the striving for the least amount of suffering people (ultimately no one), not striving for the most amount of happy people, which, according to him, takes place at the expense of immeasurable suffering.<ref>K. Akerma, ''Soll eine Menschheit sein? Eine fundamentalethische Frage'', Cuxhaven-Dartford: Traude Junghans, 1995.</ref><ref name=\"autoname2\" />\n\nBruno Contestabile cites the story \"[[The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas]]\" by [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]. In this story, the existence of the utopian city of Omelas and the good fortune of its inhabitants depend on the suffering of one child tortured in an isolated place and who can not be helped. The majority accepts this state of affairs and stay in the city, but there are those who do not agree with it, who do not want to participate in it and thus they \"walk away from Omelas\". Contestabile draws a parallel here: for Omelas to exist, the child must be tortured, and in the same way, the existence of our world is related to the fact that someone is constantly harmed. According to Contestabile, antinatalists can be seen just as \"the ones who walk away from Omelas\", who do not accept such a world, and who do not approve of its perpetuation. He poses the question: is all happiness able to compensate for the extreme suffering of even one person?<ref>B. Contestabile, ''The Denial of the World from an Impartial View'', ''Contemporary Buddhism: An Interdisciplinary Journal'', volume 17, issue 1, Taylor and Francis, 2016.</ref>\n\n=== David Benatar ===\n\nDavid Benatar argues that there is a crucial asymmetry between the good and the bad things, such as pleasure and pain:\n* (1) the presence of pain is bad;\n* (2) the presence of pleasure is good;\n* (3) the absence of pain is good, even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone;\n* (4) the absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a deprivation.<ref>D. Benatar, ''Why it is Better Never to Come Into Existence'', ''American Philosophical Quarterly'', 1997, volume 34, number 3, pp. 345\u2013355.</ref><ref>D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 30\u201340.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Scenario A (X exists) !! Scenario B (X never exists)\n|-\n| (1) Presence of pain (Bad) || (3) Absence of pain (Good)\n|-\n| (2) Presence of pleasure (Good) || (4) Absence of pleasure (Not bad)\n|}\n\nRegarding procreation, the argument follows that coming into existence generates both good and bad experiences, pain and pleasure, whereas not coming into existence entails neither pain nor pleasure. The absence of pain is good, the absence of pleasure is not bad. Therefore, the ethical choice is weighed in favor of non-procreation.\n\nBenatar explains the above asymmetry using four other asymmetries that he considers quite plausible:\n* We have a moral obligation not to create unhappy people and we have no moral obligation to create happy people. The reason why we think there is a moral obligation not to create unhappy people is that the presence of this suffering would be bad (for the sufferers) and the absence of the suffering is good (even though there is nobody to enjoy the absence of suffering). By contrast, the reason we think there is no moral obligation to create happy people is that although their pleasure would be good for them, the absence of pleasure when they do not come into existence will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.\n* It is strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide to create them, and it is not strange to mention the interests of a potential child as a reason why we decide not to create them. That the child may be happy is not a morally important reason to create them. By contrast, that the child may be unhappy is an important moral reason not to create them. If it were the case that the absence of pleasure is bad even if someone does not exist to experience its absence, then we would have a significant moral reason to create a child and to create as many children as possible. And if it were not the case that the absence of pain is good even if someone does not exist to experience this good, then we would not have a significant moral reason not to create a child.\n* Someday we can regret for the sake of a person whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we created them \u2013 a person can be unhappy and the presence of their pain would be a bad thing. But we will never feel regret for the sake of a person whose existence was conditional on our decision, that we did not create them \u2013 a person will not be deprived of happiness, because he or she will never exist, and the absence of happiness will not be bad, because there will be no one who will be deprived of this good.\n* We feel sadness by the fact that somewhere people come into existence and suffer, and we feel no sadness by the fact that somewhere people did not come into existence in a place where there are happy people. When we know that somewhere people came into existence and suffer, we feel compassion. The fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and suffer is good. This is because the absence of pain is good even when there is not someone who is experiencing this good. On the other hand, we do not feel sadness by the fact that on some deserted island or planet people did not come into existence and are not happy. This is because the absence of pleasure is bad only when someone exists to be deprived of this good.\n\nAccording to Benatar, by creating a child, we are responsible not only for this child's suffering, but we may also be co-responsible for the suffering of further offspring of this child.<ref>D.

That constitutes a lot of pointless, avoidable suffering. To be sure, full responsibility for it all does not lie with the original couple because each new generation faces the choice of whether to continue that line of descendants.

Benatar, D. Wasserman, ''Debating Procreation: Is It Wrong To Reproduce?'', New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, pp. 87\u2013121.</ref> that can be summarized in his opinion as follows:\n\n{{Block quote|Another route to anti-natalism is via what I call a \"misanthropic\" argument. According to this argument, humans are a deeply flawed and a destructive species that is responsible for the suffering and deaths of billions of other humans and non-human animals.

They would say that billions of non-human animals are abused and slaughtered each year by our species for the production of animal products, for experimentation and after the experiments (when they are no longer needed), as a result of the [[destruction of habitats]] or other environmental damage and for sadistic pleasure. They tend to agree with [[animal rights]] thinkers that the harm we do to them is immoral. They consider the human species the most destructive on the planet, arguing that without new humans, there will be no harm caused to other sentient beings by new humans.\n\nSome antinatalists are also [[vegetarians]] or [[vegans]] for moral reasons, and postulate that such views should complement each other as having a common denominator: not causing harm to other sentient beings.<ref>[https://www.pro-iure-animalis.de/index.php/antinatalismus/articles/ist-der-vegetarismus-ein-antinatalismus.html] K.

De Giraud emphasizes that, across the world, there are millions of existing children who need care.\n\n== Realism ==\n\nSome antinatalists believe that most people do not evaluate reality accurately, which affects the desire to have children.\n\nPeter Wessel Zapffe identifies four repressive mechanisms we use, consciously or not, to restrict our consciousness of life and the world:\n* isolation {{ndash}} an arbitrary dismissal from our consciousness and the consciousness of others about all negative thoughts and feelings associated with the unpleasant facts of our existence. In daily life, this manifests as a tacit agreement to remain silent on certain subjects {{ndash}} especially around children, to prevent instilling in them a fear of the world and what awaits them in life, before they will be able to learn other mechanisms.\n* anchoring {{ndash}} the creation and use of personal values to ensure our attachment to reality, such as parents, home, the street, school, God, the church, the State, morality, fate, the law of life, the people, the future, accumulation of material goods or authority, etc. This can be characterized as creating a defensive structure, \"a fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness\", and defending the structure against threats.\n* distraction {{ndash}} shifting focus to new impressions to flee from circumstances and ideas we consider harmful or unpleasant.\n* sublimation {{ndash}} refocusing the tragic parts of life into something creative or valuable, usually through an aesthetic confrontation for the purpose of catharsis. We focus on the imaginary, dramatic, heroic, lyric or comic aspects of life, to allow ourselves and others an escape from their true impact.\n\nAccording to Zapffe, depressive disorders are often \"messages from a deeper, more immediate sense of life, bitter fruits of a geniality of thought\".<ref name=\"autoname3\" /> Some studies seem to confirm this, it is said about the phenomenon of [[depressive realism]], and Colin Feltham writes about antinatalism as one of its possible consequences.<ref>C. Feltham, ''Depressive Realism: Interdisciplinary perspectives'', Abingdon: Routledge, 2016.</ref>\n\nDavid Benatar citing numerous studies lists three phenomena described by psychologists, which, according to him, are responsible for making our self-assessments about the quality of our lives unreliable:\n* [[Optimism bias|Tendency towards optimism]] (or [[Pollyanna principle]]) \u2013 we have a positively distorted picture of our lives in the past, present and future.\n* Adaptation (or accommodation, habituation) \u2013 we adapt to negative situations and adjust our expectations accordingly.\n* Comparison \u2013 for our self-assessments about the quality of our lives, more important than how our lives go is how our they go in comparison with the lives of others. One of the effects of this is that negative aspects of life that affect everyone are not taken into account when assessing our own well-being. We are also more likely to compare ourselves with those who are worse off than those who are better off.\n\nBenatar concludes:\n\n{{quote|The above psychological phenomena are unsurprising from an evolutionary perspective. They militate against suicide and in favour of reproduction. If our lives are quite as bad as I shall still suggest they are, and if people were prone to see this true quality of their lives for what it is, they might be much more inclined to kill themselves, or at least not to produce more such lives. Pessimism, then, tends not to be naturally selected.<ref>D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 64\u201369.</ref>}}\n\n[[Thomas Ligotti]] draws attention to the similarity between Zapffe's philosophy and [[terror management theory]]. Terror management theory argues that humans are equipped with unique cognitive abilities beyond what is necessary for survival, which includes symbolic thinking, extensive self-consciousness and perception of themselves as temporal beings aware of the finitude of their existence. The desire to live alongside our awareness of the inevitability of death triggers terror in us. Opposition to this fear is among our primary motivations. To escape it, we build defensive structures around ourselves to ensure our symbolic or literal immortality, to feel like valuable members of a meaningful universe, and to focus on protecting ourselves from immediate external threats.<ref>T. Ligotti, ''The Conspiracy against the Human Race: A Contrivance of Horror'', New York: Hippocampus Press, 2010, pp. 112\u2013113.</ref>\n\n== Abortion ==\n\nAntinatalism can lead to a particular position on the morality of [[abortion]].\n\nAccording to David Benatar, one comes into existence in the morally relevant sense when consciousness arises, when a fetus becomes sentient, and up until that time an abortion is moral, whereas continued pregnancy would be immoral. Benatar refers to [[electroencephalography|EEG]] brain studies and studies on [[prenatal perception|the pain perception of the fetus]], which states that fetal consciousness arises no earlier than between twenty-eight and thirty weeks of pregnancy, before which it is incapable of feeling pain.<ref>D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 132\u2013162.</ref> Contrary to that, the latest report from the [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]] showed that the fetus gains consciousness no earlier than week twenty-four of the pregnancy.<ref>[https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/rcogfetalawarenesswpr0610.pdf] Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, ''Fetal Awareness \u2013 Review of Research and Recommendations for Practice'', London: RCOG Press, 2010.</ref> Some assumptions of this report regarding sentience of the fetus after the second trimester were criticized.<ref>[http://fn.bmj.com/content/96/4/F236.long] M. W. Platt, ''Fetal awareness and fetal pain: the Emperor's new clothes'', ''Archives of Disease in Childhood'', 2011, volume 96, issue 4.</ref> In a similar way argues Karim Akerma. He distinguishes between organisms that do not have mental properties and living beings that have mental properties. According to his view, which he calls the mentalistic view, a living being begins to exist when an organism (or another entity) produces a simple form of consciousness for the first time.<ref>K. Akerma, ''Lebensende und Lebensbeginn: Philosophische Implikationen und mentalistische Begr\u00fcndung des Hirn-Todeskriterium'', Lit: Hamburg 2006.</ref><ref>K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus...'' op. cit., p. 404.</ref>\n\nJulio Cabrera believes that the moral problem of abortion is totally different from the problem of abstention of procreation, because in the case of abortion, there is no longer a non-being, but an already existing being \u2013 the most helpless and defenceless of the parties involved, that someday will have the autonomy to decide, and we cannot decide for them. From the point of view of Cabrera's negative ethics, abortion is immoral for similar reasons as procreation. For Cabrera, the exception in which abortion is morally justified are cases of irreversible illness of the foetus (or some serious \"social illnesses\" like [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|American conquest]] or [[Nazism]]), according to him in such cases we are clearly thinking about the unborn, and not simply of our own interests. In addition, Cabrera believes that under certain circumstances, it is legitimate and comprehensible to commit unethical actions, for example, abortion is a legitimate and comprehensible, when the mother's life is at risk.<ref>[http://repositorio.unb.br/bitstream/10482/15274/1/LIVRO_PorqueTeAmo.pdf] J.

Karim Akerma defines antinatalism, that includes non-human sentient animals, as universal antinatalism<ref>K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus...'' op. cit., pp. 100\u2013101.</ref> and he assumes such a position himself:\n\n{{quote|By sterilising animals, we can free them from being slaves to their instincts and from bringing more and more captive animals into the cycle of being born, contracting parasites, ageing, falling ill and dying; eating and being eaten.<ref>[https://www.pro-iure-animalis.de/dokumente/manifest_antinatalismus.pdf] K.

[http://akerma.de/Antinatalist%20Manifesto_Karim%20Akerma.pdf] English translation.</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\nDavid Benatar emphasizes that his asymmetry applies to all sentient beings, and mentions that humans play a role in deciding how many animals there will be: humans breed other species of animals and are able to sterilize other species of animals.<ref>D. Benatar, ''Better...'', op. cit., pp. 2\u20133 (introduction), 163.</ref>\n\nMagnus Vinding argues that the life of wild animals in their natural environment is generally [[Wild animal suffering|very bad]]. He draws attention to phenomena such as dying before adulthood, starvation, diseases, [[parasites]], [[infanticide]], [[predation]] and being eaten alive. He cites research on what animal life looks like in the wild. One of eight male lion cubs survives into adulthood. Others die as a result of starvation, disease and often fall victims to the teeth and claws of other lions. Attaining adulthood is much rarer for fish. Only one in a hundred male chinook salmon survive into adulthood. Vinding is of the opinion that if human lives and the survival of human children looked like this, current human values would disallow procreation; however, this is not possible when it comes to non-human animals, who are guided by instinct. He takes the view that even if one does not agree that procreation is always morally bad, one should recognize procreation in wildlife as morally bad and something that ought to be prevented (at least in theory, not necessarily in practice). He maintains that non-intervention cannot be defended if we reject [[speciesism]] and that we should reject the unjustifiable [[Appeal to nature|dogma]] stating that what is happening in nature is what should be happening in nature.\n\n{{quote|We cannot allow ourselves to spuriously rationalize away the suffering that takes place in nature, and to forget the victims of the horrors of nature merely because that reality does not fit into our convenient moral theories, theories that ultimately just serve to make us feel consistent and good about ourselves in the face of an incomprehensibly bad reality.<ref>[https://www.smashwords.com/extreader/read/624122/1/the-speciesism-of-leaving-nature-alone-and-the-theoretical-c] M.

[[next United Kingdom general election]], various organisations are expected to carry out [[opinion polling]] to gauge voting intention. Results of such polls are displayed in this article. Most of the polling companies listed are members of the [[British Polling Council]] (BPC) and abide by its disclosure rules.\n\nThe date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|previous general election]], held on 12 December 2019, to the present day. Under current [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011|fixed-term legislation]], the next general election is scheduled to be held in May 2024,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tufft|first1=Ben|title=When will the next UK General Election be held?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/generalelection/when-will-the-next-uk-general-election-be-held-10236102.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=29 December 2019|quote=The act specifies that future elections will be held on the first Thursday of May, every five years.|date=8 May 2015}}</ref> though the government has pledged to repeal this law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/12/full-transcript-the-queens-speech/|title=Full transcript: The Queen\u2019s Speech|date=19 December 2019|accessdate=30 January 2020|work=The Spectator}}</ref>\n\nMost opinion polls do not cover [[Northern Ireland]], since its major political parties are different from those in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n== Graphical summary ==\n{{Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election}}\n\n== National poll results==\nPoll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading party's colour. The 'party lead' column shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. In the instance of a tie, no figure is shaded but both are displayed in bold. In the instance a pollster does not provide a result for a party, that party will be displayed with a '\u2013'.\n\nThe parties with the largest numbers of votes in the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]] are listed here.

It opened on 30th April 1996 and was built during 1995-96 by [[Custom Coasters International]], who wanted a ride to showcase their company in Europe. Megafobia features a [[Twister roller coaster|twister style layout]].\n\nMegafobia was the first white-knuckle attraction to be installed at Oakwood Theme Park (then Oakwood Leisure Park) in West Wales and transformed the park's fortunes from a small family leisure park to a major UK theme park. Until the construction of [[Wicker Man (roller coaster)|Wicker Man]] commenced at [[Alton Towers]] in 2017, it was also the most recent wooden roller coaster to be built in the UK.\n\nOn 30 April 2016 it celebrated 20 Years at Oakwood.\n\n==Ride experience==\nOut of the station, trains make a left turn and small dip before climbing the 85 foot tall lift hill. At the top, the track makes a 180 degree left turn, before diving down the first drop. The first drop passes through the structure, and is followed by a sweeping left curve and an airtime hill crossing over the lift hill. After this airtime hill, the track hits a 180 degree left turn, to face back towards the lift hill. The camera is situated at the exit of this turn. The track heads back towards the lift hill, passing over an airtime hill and drop that cross under the lift hill and over the first drop. The track then makes a three-quarter right turn that passes through the lift hill's structure. Leaving the lift hill structure, the train passes through an airtime hill and crosses over the exit from the first turnaround before turning around on a 180 degree right turn and drop. The track weaves under itself and traces back along the earlier pass through the lift hill structure before making a drop and turn to the right. After passing under the second hill, the track makes another right turn and then makes another drop before hitting the final brake run. Trains then pass through the transfer track and storage area before returning to the station.\n==Similar rides==\n[[Rampage (roller coaster)|Rampage]] at [[Alabama Adventure]], also built by [[Custom Coasters International]], has an almost identical layout to Megafobia. The biggest deviation is the station and brake run. Rampage places the final brake run under the first airtime hill, with trains then making a slight left, passing through the transfer track parallel to the second hill, then going through a dip drop and 180 degree right turn before sliding down another drop into the station. There is thus a slight right turn from the station to the lift hill instead of a left turn. \n== Awards ==\nMegafobia has consistently been rated among the top wooden coasters in the [[Golden Ticket Awards]].\n\n{{GTA table\n| type       = wood\n| accessdate = September 24, 2015\n| 1998       = 5\n| 1999       = 10\n| 2000       = 9\n| 2001       = 10\n| 2002       = 9\n| 2003       = 9\n| 2004       = 14\n| 2005       = 13\n| 2006       = 24\n| 2007       = 25\n| 2008       = 22\n| 2009       = 25\n| 2010       = 30\n| 2011       = 20\n| 2012       = 27\n| 2013       = 30\n| 2014       = 33\n| 2015       = 27\n| 2016       = 35\n| 2017       = \u2013\n| 2018       = 46\n| 2019       = 44\n}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Megafobia Oakwood Theme Park.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References == \n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100709141609/http://www.oakwoodthemepark.co.uk/rides/megafobia.asp Megafobia] at Oakwood's website\n{{Custom coasters international roller coasters}}\n{{John Wardley}}\n\n[[Category:Roller coasters in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Roller coasters introduced in 1996]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox roller coaster\n|name=Megafobia\n|image=Megafobia-1.jpg    <!--Use ONLY the filename, not a full [[Image:]] link-->\n|caption=Megafobia\n|location=Oakwood Theme Park        <!--Must not be linked, will auto-categorize the coaster.-->\n|section=          <!--Must not be linked.-->\n|type=Wood             <!--Must be \"Steel\" or \"Wood\", nothing else.
