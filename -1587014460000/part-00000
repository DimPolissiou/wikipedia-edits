While best known for its role as the British and [[British Empire|Commonwealth]] forces' primary infantry LMG in [[World War II]], it was also used in the [[Korean War]] and saw service throughout the latter half of the 20th century, including the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. Although fitted with a [[bipod]], it could also be mounted on a tripod or be vehicle-mounted.\n\nThe Bren gun was a licensed version of the Czechoslovak ZGB 33 light machine gun which, in turn, was a modified version of the [[ZB vz. 26]], which [[British Army]] officials had tested during a firearms service competition in the 1930s. The later Bren gun featured a distinctive top-mounted curved box magazine, conical flash hider, and quick change barrel. The name ''Bren'' was derived from [[Brno]], the Czechoslovak city in [[Moravia]], where the Zb vz. 26 was designed (in the [[Zbrojovka Brno|Zbrojovka Brno Factory]]) and [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], site of the British [[Royal Small Arms Factory]]. The designer was [[V\u00e1clav Holek]], a gun inventor and design engineer.\n\nIn the 1950s, many Bren guns were re-barrelled to accept the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] cartridge and modified to feed from the magazine for the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|L1]] (Commonwealth version of the [[FN FAL]]) rifle as the L4 light machine gun. It was replaced in the British Army as the section LMG by the [[FN MAG#British versions|L7]] [[general-purpose machine gun]] (GPMG), a heavier [[Belt (firearm)|belt-fed]] weapon. This was supplemented in the 1980s by the [[SA80#L86 LSW|L86 Light Support Weapon]] firing the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] round, leaving the Bren gun in use only as a pintle mount on some vehicles. The Bren gun was manufactured by [[Ordnance Factories Organisation|Indian Ordnance Factories]] as the \"Gun Machine 7.62mm 1B\"<ref name=\"Ordnance Factory Board\">{{cite web|url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/weapons/wsc/16.htm|title=Ordnance Factory Board|work=ofbindia.gov.in}}</ref> before it was discontinued in 2012.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=66}}\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Canadian sniper in Ortona.jpg|thumb|left|At the [[Battle of Ortona]], December 1943]]\n[[File:Australian assault on pillbox, January 1943, Papua, Giropa Point.jpg|thumb|left|Australian assault on a pillbox at Giropa Point, January 1943]]\n[[File:A member of No. 9 Commando at Anzio, equipped for a patrol with his Bren gun, 5 March 1944.

The Vickers was heavy and required a supply of water to keep it in operation, which tended to relegate it to static defence and indirect fire support. The Lewis, although lighter, was still heavy and was prone to frequent stoppages; its barrel could not be changed in the field, which meant that sustained firing resulted in overheating until it stopped altogether. In 1922, to find a replacement for the Lewis, the Small Arms Committee of the British Army ran competitive trials  between the [[Madsen machine gun|Madsen]], the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR), the [[Hotchkiss M1909 Ben\u00e9t\u2013Merci\u00e9 machine gun|Hotchkiss]], the [[Farquhar-Hill rifle|Beardmore-Farquhar]], and the Lewis itself. Although the BAR was recommended, the sheer number of Lewis guns available and the difficult financial conditions meant that nothing was done. Various new models of light machine gun were tested as they became available, and in 1930, a further set of extensive trials commenced, overseen by [[Frederick Hubert Vinden]].<ref>{{cite news |last=B.S.C. |first= |date=10 February 1977 |title=Brigadier F.H. Vinden |newspaper=The Times |location=London }}</ref> This time the weapons tested included the [[SIG Neuhausen KE7]], the [[Vickers-Berthier]] and the Czechoslovak ZB vz.26. The Vickers-Berthier was later adopted by the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] because it could be manufactured at once, rather than wait for the British Lewis production run to finish; it too saw extensive service in World War II.{{sfn|Grant|2013|pp=9\u201311}}\n\nFollowing these trials, the British Army adopted the Czechoslovak ZB vz.26 light machine gun manufactured in [[Brno]] in 1935, although a slightly modified model, the ZB vz. 27, rather than the ZB vz. 26 which had been submitted for the trials. The design was modified to British requirements under new designation ZGB 33, which was then licensed for British manufacture under the Bren name. The major changes were in the magazine and barrel and the lower pistol grip assembly which went from a swivelling grip frame pivoted on the front of the trigger guard to a sliding grip frame which included the forward tripod mount and sliding ejection port cover. The magazine was curved in order to feed the rimmed [[.303 British|.303 SAA]] (\"Small Arms Ammunition\") cartridge, a change from the various [[rimless]] [[Mauser]]-design [[cartridge (firearm)|cartridges]] such as the [[8\u00d757mm IS|8mm Mauser]] round previously used by Czech designs. These modifications were categorised in various numbered designations, ZB vz. 27, ZB vz. 30, ZB vz. 32, and finally the ZGB 33, which was licensed for manufacture under the Bren name.\n\nThe Bren was a gas-operated weapon, which used the same .303 ammunition as the standard British [[bolt-action rifle]], the [[Lee\u2013Enfield]], firing at a rate of between 480 and 540 rounds per minute (rpm), depending on the model. Propellant gases vented from a port towards the muzzle end of the barrel through a regulator (visible in the photo, just in front of the bipod) with four quick-adjustment apertures of different sizes, intended to tailor the gas volume to different ambient temperatures (smallest flow at high temperature, e.g. summer desert, largest at low temperature, e.g. winter Arctic). The vented gas drove a piston which in turn actuated the breech block. Each gun came with a spare barrel that could be quickly changed when the barrel became hot during sustained fire, though later guns featured a [[chromium|chrome]]-lined barrel, which reduced the need for a spare. To change barrels, the release catch in front of the magazine was rotated to unlock the barrel. The carrying handle above the barrel was used to grip and remove the hot barrel without burning the hands.\n\nThe Bren was magazine-fed, which slowed its rate of fire and required more frequent reloading than British belt-fed machine guns such as the larger .303 Vickers machine gun. The slower rate of fire prevented more rapid overheating of the Bren's air-cooled barrel, and the Bren was much lighter than belt-fed machine guns, which typically had cooling jackets, often liquid filled. The magazines also prevented the ammunition from getting dirty, which was more of a problem with the Vickers with its 250-round canvas belts. The [[Sight (device)|sights]] were offset to the left, to avoid the magazine on the top of the weapon. The position of the sights meant that the Bren could be fired only from the right shoulder.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=40}}\n\n==Service==\n===Second World War===\n[[File:Anti-aircraft BrenGun.jpg|thumb|[[British Indian Army|Indian]] troops man a Bren gun on an anti-aircraft tripod, [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]] April 1941]]\nIn the British and Commonwealth armies, the Bren was generally issued on a scale of one per rifle section.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=28}} An infantry battalion also had a \"carrier\" platoon, equipped with [[Universal Carrier]]s, each of which carried a Bren gun.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=32}} Parachute battalions from 1944 had an extra Bren in the AT platoon.<ref>[http://www.bayonetstrength.150m.com/British/Airborne/british_parachute_battalion%201944%20to%201945.htm The British Parachute Battalion, circa 1944 to 1945] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101104240/http://www.bayonetstrength.150m.com/British/Airborne/british_parachute_battalion%201944%20to%201945.htm |date=January 1, 2009 }}.</ref> The 66-man \"Assault Troop\" of [[British Commandos]] had a nominal establishment of four Bren guns. Realising the need for additional section-level firepower, the British Army endeavoured to issue the Bren in great numbers, with a stated goal of one Bren to every four private soldiers.{{sfn|Dunlap|1948|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}} The Bren was operated by a two-man crew, sometimes commanded by a [[Lance Corporal]] as an infantry section's \"gun group\", the remainder of the section forming the \"rifle group\". The gunner or \"Number 1\" carried and fired the Bren, and a loader or \"Number 2\" carried extra magazines, a spare barrel and a tool kit.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=29}} Number 2 helped reload the gun and replace the barrel when it overheated, and spotted targets for Number 1.\n\nGenerally, the Bren was fired from the prone position using the attached bipod.<ref>\"It [the L4A4 Bren] is normally fired from the shoulder in the lying position, supported by the bipod, although it may be fired from other positions to engage targets at close range\". Chapter 1, Section 1, para 102, Australian Army Manual of Land Warfare, Part 2, Infantry Training, Vol 4 Pam 6, Machine Gun 7.62mm L4A4, Australian Government 1979.</ref> On occasion, a Bren gunner would use his weapon on the move supported by a sling, much like an automatic rifle, and from standing or kneeling positions. Using the sling, Australian soldiers regularly fired the Bren from the hip, for instance in the [[marching fire]] tactic, a form of [[suppressive fire]] moving forward in assault. A [[Victoria Cross]] was awarded to Private [[Bruce Kingsbury]] for such use at Isurava, New Guinea, in 1942, during the Australians' fighting retreat from Kokoda.\n\n[[File:Bren gunner of the Royal Scots 06-11-1944.jpg|thumb|left|Bren gunner of the [[Royal Scots]] in [[North Brabant]], the Netherlands, 1944]]\nEach British soldier's equipment normally included two magazines for his section's Bren gun. The large ammunition pouches on the [[1937 Pattern Web Equipment]] were designed around the Bren magazine. Every soldier would be trained to fire the Bren in case of an emergency, though these soldiers did not receive a Bren proficiency badge.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nThe Bren had an effective range of around {{convert|600|yd|m}} when fired from a prone position with a [[bipod]].{{sfn|Dunlap|1948|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}}\n\nFor a light machine gun of the interwar and early World War II era, the Bren was about average in weight. On long marches in non-operational areas it was often partially disassembled and its parts were carried by two soldiers. The top-mounted magazine vibrated and moved during fire, making the weapon more visible in combat, and many Bren gunners used paint or improvised canvas covers to disguise the prominent magazine.{{sfn||George|1948|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}}\n\nThe 30-round magazine was in practice usually filled with 27 or 28 rounds to prevent jams and avoid wearing out the magazine spring. Care needed to be taken when loading the magazine to ensure that each round went ahead of the previous round, so that the .303 cartridge rims did not overlap the wrong way, which would cause a jam. The spent [[cartridge case]]s were [[Downward ejection|ejected downwards]], which was an improvement on the Lewis gun, which ejected sideways, since the glint of them flying through the air could compromise a concealed firing position.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Bren2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bren carried by a Canadian soldier in 1945]]\nIn general, the Bren was considered a reliable and effective light machine gun, though in North Africa it was reported to jam regularly unless kept very clean and free of sand or dirt.{{sfn|Dunlap|1948|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}} It was popular with British troops, who respected its reliability and combat effectiveness. The quality of the materials used would generally ensure minimal jamming. When the gun did jam through fouling caused by prolonged firing, the operator could adjust the four-position gas regulator to feed more gas to the piston increasing the power to operate the mechanism. The barrel needed to be unlocked and slid forward slightly to allow the regulator to be turned. It was even said that all problems with the Bren could simply be cleared by hitting the gun, turning the regulator or doing both. It was \"by general consent the finest light machine gun in the world of its period, and the most useful weapon provided to the (French) \"maquis\" ... accurate up to 1,000 meters, and (it) could withstand immense maltreatment and unskilled use. \"Resistants\" were constantly pleading for maximum drops of Brens\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hastings |author-link=Max Hastings |first=Max |title=Das Reich: The March of the 2nd SS Panzer Division through France, June 1944 |edition=2 |origyear=1981 |year=2013 |publisher=Zenith Press |location=Minneapolis, United States |isbn=978-0-7603-4491-0 |page=236}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tysklandsbrigaden, \u00f8velse Skandia III - Fo30141603020010.jpg|thumb|Bren with 100 round detachable [[pan magazine]].

This became a greater issue when it was discovered that only 2,300 of the 30,000 Bren guns issued to the British Expeditionary Force came back to Britain after the defeat of France. As the result, cost savings and increased rate of production became two main goals for subsequent variant designs. The Bren Mk II design simplified production by replacing the drum rear sight with a ladder design, making the bipod legs non-adjustable, simplifying the gun butt, reducing the use of stainless steel, among other steps that reduced the cost by 20% to 25%; Mk II was approved in September 1940 and entered production in 1941. While the Bren Mk III design also aimed at reducing cost, it also had the concurrent goal of being lightened for jungle warfare; the final product weighed 19 pounds and 5 ounces (3 pounds lighter than the original Bren Mk I design); it was standardised in July 1944 and saw a production of 57,600. Also standardised in July 1944 was the Bren Mk IV, which was further lightened to 19 pounds and 2 ounces; however, it did not enter production until July 1945, and only 250 were built before the end of the war. While Enfield was able to produce only 400 Bren Mk I guns each month, with the various simplification efforts production numbers rose to 1,000 guns per week by 1943. Among the variant designs were two speciality prototypes that never entered production: The belt-fed Taden gun for stationary defence use, and the ultra-simplified [[Besal]] gun to be produced in case a German invasion of Britain actually took place (which would hinder British production efforts). Later designs of production Bren guns featured chrome-lined barrels that offered less resistance, preventing overheating and reducing the need for quick changes of barrels.<ref name = 'WW2DB'>{{cite| title=Bren Machine Gun|first=C. Peter|last=Chen|url= https://ww2db.com/weapon.php?q=40|website= ww2db.com}}</ref>\n\nBren guns were produced outside of Britain as well. In Canada, the John Inglis plant in Toronto began tooling its facilities for production in 1938; the first of 186,000 examples was completed in Mar 1940. Some of the Inglis-built Bren guns were chambered for the 7.92-millimeter Mauser ammunition; these were destined for export to Nationalist Chinese forces rather than for British and Commonwealth forces. In Australia, the Lithgow Small Arms Factory in New South Wales began building Bren guns in 1940; a total of 17,249 were built. In India, the factory at Ishapore began building Bren guns in 1942 (it had produced Vickers-Berthier machine guns prior to this time), and would continue producing them for decades long after the end of WW2. Many of the Bren guns produced at Ishapore went to Indian troops, who had lost a great number of automatic weapons during the disastrous campaigns against the Japanese in Malaya and Burma; 17th Indian Infantry Division, for example, found itself with only 56 Bren guns after fleeing out of Burma in 1942.<ref name = 'WW2DB'/>\n\nA complicated tripod mount was available to allow the Bren to be used as an indirect-fire weapon, but this was rarely used in the field. The Bren was also used on many vehicles, including on [[Universal Carrier]]s, to which it gave the alternative name \"Bren Gun Carrier\", and on tanks and armoured cars. It could not be used as a co-axial weapon on tanks, as the magazine restricted its depression and was awkward to handle in confined spaces, and it was therefore used on a [[pintle mount]] only. (The belt fed [[Vickers light machine gun|Vickers]] or [[Besa machine gun|Besa]], the latter being another Czechoslovak machine gun design adopted by the British, were instead used as co-axial weapons.) An unfortunate problem occurred when the Bren was fired from the [[Dingo Scout Car]]; the hot cartridge cases tended to be ejected down the neck of the driver, whose position was next to the pintle. A canvas bag was designed to catch the cartridges and overcome the problem, but it seems to have been rarely issued.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=41}}\n\n[[File:1944 Bren light machine gun.jpg|thumb|left|Bren gun mounted on a tripod, 2010]]\nThe Bren was also employed in the [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] role. The tripod could be adjusted to allow high angle fire. There were also several designs of less-portable mountings, including the ''Gallows'' and ''Mottley'' mounts. A 100-round [[Magazine (firearm)#Pan|pan magazine]] was available for the Bren for use in the anti-aircraft role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cairdpublications.com/scrap/armbitguns/images/Bren%20Guns.jpg|format=JPG|title=Image|website=Cairdpublications.com|accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref> The Bren's direct ancestor, the Czechoslovak ZB vz. 26, was also used in World War&nbsp;II by German and Romanian forces, including units of the [[Waffen SS]]. Many [[8\u00d757mm IS|7.92 mm]] ZB light machine guns were shipped to China, where they were employed first against the Japanese in World War II, and later against UN forces in Korea, including British and Commonwealth units. Some ex-Chinese Czech ZB weapons were also in use in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]]. Production of a 7.92&nbsp;mm round model for the Far East was carried out by Inglis of Canada. The Bren was also delivered to the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the [[lend-lease]] program<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glantz|first1=David M.|title=Colossus reborn : the Red Army at war, 1941\u20131943|date=2005|publisher=Univ.

In the [[Operation Banner|conflict in Northern Ireland]] (1969\u20131998), a British Army squad typically carried the L4A4 version of the Bren as the squad automatic weapon in the 1970s.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=26}} During the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, [[40 Commando]] [[Royal Marines]] carried one LMG and one GPMG per section. Its final operational deployment with the British Army, on a limited scale, was to the [[First Gulf War]] in 1991.{{sfn|Grant|2013|pp=26 and 59}}\n\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 09.JPG|left|thumb]]\nWhen the British Army adopted the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62 mm]] [[NATO]] cartridge, the Bren was re-designed to 7.62&nbsp;mm calibre, fitted with a new bolt, barrel and magazine. It was redesignated as the L4 light machine gun (in various sub-versions) and remained in British Army service into the 1990s. A slotted flash hider similar to that of the contemporary L1 rifle and [[FN MAG#British subvariants|L7 general purpose machine gun]] replaced the conical flash hider. The change from a rimmed to rimless cartridge and nearly straight magazine improved feeding considerably, and allowed use of 20-round magazines from the 7.62&nbsp;mm [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]]. The 30-round magazine from the L4 also fitted the L1A1 rifle, but the magazine spring was not always strong enough to provide enough upward pressure to feed rounds correctly, this being remedied by stretching the magazine springs.\n\nCompletion of the move to a [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56 mm]] NATO cartridge led to Army removing the Bren/L4 from the list of approved weapons and then withdrawing it from service.\n\nThe Mark III Bren remained in limited use with the [[Irish Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] of the Irish Defence Forces until 2006, when the 7.62&nbsp;mm GPMG replaced it. The Bren was popular with the soldiers who fired it (known as Brenners) as it was light and durable, and had a reputation for accuracy.

Weight 22lb, 2oz.\n\nFeatures:\n* Drum-pattern rear aperture sight\n* Buttstrap for use over-the-shoulder when firing\n* Rear grip under butt\n* Telescoping bipod\n* Folding cocking handle\n\nAn Enfield-made .303 Bren Mk 1 was converted to [[7.92\u00d757mm_Mauser#British_military_ammunition|7.92mm BESA]] in 1938 due to the suggestion of a possibility of a British Army change over to a rimless cartridge for machine guns being mooted.{{efn-lr|Note: this was the cartridge that the original Zb 27 and Zb 30 supplied to Britain for testing had been chambered in. Guns made at BRNO chambered to .303 for the British trials were designated 'ZGB 30' at a cost of \u00a3175 per-gun with two barrels and with spares and accessories. Further British requests for modifications led to the ZGB 32, ZGB 33, and ZGB 34, the last being accepted for production as the Bren with the first Enfield production gun being completed in September 1937.}}\n\n===Mark 2===\nIntroduced 1941. A simplified version of the Mk1 more suited to wartime production with original design features subsequently found to be unnecessary deleted.{{efn-lr|Note: a number of features present in the original pre-war design were found to be seldom if-ever used in action. For example, the then-current continental fashion of holding the gun placed the firer's free left hand under the butt, whereas British practice was to place the firer's free hand on top of the butt stock thus making the rear grip superfluous.}}  Produced by Inglis of Canada and the Monotype Group through a number of component manufacturing factories. Sometimes known as the \"Garage hands\" model. Overall length 45.5 inches, 25 inch barrel length. Weight 23 lb, 3 oz.\n\n'''Features:'''\n* Folding-leaf rear sight\n* Buttstrap deleted\n* Rear grip deleted\n* Fixed height bipod\n* Fixed cocking handle\n\nThe Bren Mk2 was much simplified in the body, which although still being milled from a solid billet of steel, required significantly fewer milling operations than the Mk1, resulting in a much cleaner appearance. The bipod was simplified in design as well as not having extending legs. Most Mk2 bipods resembled a simple A-frame and were more 'soldier proof'. The Mk2 also featured a slightly higher rate of fire than the Mk1.\n\nThe woodwork on the Mk2 was simplified by being less ornate and ergonomic, which sped up the manufacturing process. The barrel was also simplified by means of a non-stepped removable flash hider and, in some cases, a barrel fore-end that was matte instead of highly polished. The buffered buttplate of the Mk1 was omitted and replaced with a sheet metal buttplate.\n\nA small number of Inglis-made .303 Bren Mk 2 were converted post-war to fire the [[.280 British|.280]] 7 mm Mk 1Z round used by the [[EM-2 rifle]].\n\nThe Inglis version of the Bren Mk 2 chambered for the [[30-06]] cartridge and known as the M41 was also manufactured in [[Formosa]] in 1952.\n\n===Mark 3===\nA shorter and lighter Bren made by Enfield from 1944 for the war in the East and for Airborne Forces. This was similar to the Mk2 but with the light weight features of the early Mk1. With the main distinguishing feature being a shorter barrel and serrated area in front of the barrel nut.  Overall length 42.9 inches, 22.25 inch barrel length. Weight 19 lb, 5 oz.\n\n===Mark 4===\nAs with the Mk3 but this was a conversion of a Mk2. Overall length 42.9 inches, 22.25 inch barrel length. Weight 19 lb, 2 oz.\n\n===L4===\n[[File:Keeping Watch.jpg|thumbnail|left|L4 or Machine Gun 1B in Indian service]]\n\nA conversion of the Bren to 7.62mm NATO from 1958. Indian Army variants may be new-build, not conversions. L4 Brens can easily be identified by their different magazine. The British-issue L4 magazine is of 30-round capacity and has a slight curve. The L4 magazine was interchangeable with the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|L1A1 SLR]] magazine, so the L4 Bren also can be seen fitted with straight 20-round magazines from the SLR or with the straight 30-round magazine from the Australian [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle#Australia|L2A1]] or Canadian C2A1 heavy-barrel SLR. The flash suppressor was changed from the cone type of .303 variants to a slotted type similar in appearance to that used on the SLR and L7 GPMG. All L4s are chambered for [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] rimless ammunition.\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:LMG Bren.jpg|thumb|Indian army soldier manning LMG during anti terror operation in Kashmir Valley]]\n[[File:Assam Police LMG.jpg|thumb|Assam Police constable manning Indian version of Bren LMG]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Taden was belt-fed with spade grips and would have replaced both the Bren and the Vickers machine gun. Although reliable{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} it was not accepted due to the US-driven standardization within NATO on the larger [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] round.<ref>[http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/Assault.htm Assault rifles and their ammunition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602021550/http://www.quarry.nildram.co.uk/Assault.htm |date=June 2, 2014 }}.</ref>\n\n===Semiautomatic Bren guns===\nMany nations' militaries have disposed of their Bren guns as surplus to their needs. Surplus Brens have been imported to the United States for sale to collectors, but due to US gun laws restricting the importation of automatic weapons such guns must be legally destroyed by cutting up the receivers. A number of US gunsmiths have manufactured new semiautomatic Brens by welding the pieces of destroyed receivers back together, with modifications to prevent the use of full automatic parts, and fitting new fire-control components capable of only semiautomatic fire. The balance of the parts are surplus Bren parts. Such \"semiautomatic machine guns\" are legally considered rifles under US Federal law and the laws of most states.\n\n==World War II production==\n[[File:VeronicaFoster-RonnieBrenGunGirl-smoke.jpg|thumb|right|<center>[[Veronica Foster|\"Ronnie, the Bren Gun Girl\"]], poses with the finished product at the John Inglis plant, Toronto, 1941</center>]]\n* RSAF Enfield, UK: 400 per month.\n** 1943: 1,000 per week.\n* [[John Inglis and Company]], Canada: A contract was signed with the British and Canadian governments in March 1938 to supply 5,000 Bren machine guns to Great Britain and 7,000 Bren machine guns to Canada.

While best known for its role as the British and [[British Empire|Commonwealth]] forces' primary infantry LMG in [[World War II]], it was also used in the [[Korean War]] and saw service throughout the latter half of the 20th century, including the 1982 [[Falklands War]]. Although fitted with a [[bipod]], it could also be mounted on a tripod or be vehicle-mounted.\n\nThe Bren gun was a licensed version of the Czechoslovak ZGB 33 light machine gun which, in turn, was a modified version of the [[ZB vz. 26]], which [[British Army]] officials had tested during a firearms service competition in the 1930s. The later Bren gun featured a distinctive top-mounted curved box magazine, conical flash hider, and quick change barrel. The name ''Bren'' was derived from [[Brno]], the Czechoslovak city in [[Moravia]], where the Zb vz. 26 was designed (in the [[Zbrojovka Brno|Zbrojovka Brno Factory]]) and [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], site of the British [[Royal Small Arms Factory]]. The designer was [[V\u00e1clav Holek]], a gun inventor and design engineer.\n\nIn the 1950s, many Bren guns were re-barrelled to accept the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO]] cartridge and modified to feed from the magazine for the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|L1]] (Commonwealth version of the [[FN FAL]]) rifle as the L4 light machine gun. It was replaced in the British Army as the section LMG by the [[FN MAG#British versions|L7]] [[general-purpose machine gun]] (GPMG), a heavier [[Belt (firearm)|belt-fed]] weapon. This was supplemented in the 1980s by the [[SA80#L86 LSW|L86 Light Support Weapon]] firing the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] round, leaving the Bren gun in use only as a pintle mount on some vehicles. The Bren gun was manufactured by [[Ordnance Factories Organisation|Indian Ordnance Factories]] as the \"Gun Machine 7.62mm 1B\"<ref name=\"Ordnance Factory Board\">{{cite web|url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/weapons/wsc/16.htm|title=Ordnance Factory Board|work=ofbindia.gov.in}}</ref> before it was discontinued in 2012.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=66}}\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Canadian sniper in Ortona.jpg|thumb|left|At the [[Battle of Ortona]], December 1943]]\n[[File:Australian assault on pillbox, January 1943, Papua, Giropa Point.jpg|thumb|left|Australian assault on a pillbox at Giropa Point, January 1943]]\n[[File:A member of No. 9 Commando at Anzio, equipped for a patrol with his Bren gun, 5 March 1944.

The Vickers was heavy and required a supply of water to keep it in operation, which tended to relegate it to static defence and indirect fire support. The Lewis, although lighter, was still heavy and was prone to frequent stoppages; its barrel could not be changed in the field, which meant that sustained firing resulted in overheating until it stopped altogether. In 1922, to find a replacement for the Lewis, the Small Arms Committee of the British Army ran competitive trials  between the [[Madsen machine gun|Madsen]], the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR), the [[Hotchkiss M1909 Ben\u00e9t\u2013Merci\u00e9 machine gun|Hotchkiss]], the [[Farquhar-Hill rifle|Beardmore-Farquhar]], and the Lewis itself. Although the BAR was recommended, the sheer number of Lewis guns available and the difficult financial conditions meant that nothing was done. Various new models of light machine gun were tested as they became available, and in 1930, a further set of extensive trials commenced, overseen by [[Frederick Hubert Vinden]].<ref>{{cite news |last=B.S.C. |first= |date=10 February 1977 |title=Brigadier F.H. Vinden |newspaper=The Times |location=London }}</ref> This time the weapons tested included the [[SIG Neuhausen KE7]], the [[Vickers-Berthier]] and the Czechoslovak ZB vz.26. The Vickers-Berthier was later adopted by the [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] because it could be manufactured at once, rather than wait for the British Lewis production run to finish; it too saw extensive service in World War II.{{sfn|Grant|2013|pp=9\u201311}}\n\nFollowing these trials, the British Army adopted the Czechoslovak ZB vz.26 light machine gun manufactured in [[Brno]] in 1935, although a slightly modified model, the ZB vz. 27, rather than the ZB vz. 26 which had been submitted for the trials. The design was modified to British requirements under new designation ZGB 33, which was then licensed for British manufacture under the Bren name. The major changes were in the magazine and barrel and the lower pistol grip assembly which went from a swivelling grip frame pivoted on the front of the trigger guard to a sliding grip frame which included the forward tripod mount and sliding ejection port cover. The magazine was curved in order to feed the rimmed [[.303 British|.303 SAA]] (\"Small Arms Ammunition\") cartridge, a change from the various [[rimless]] [[Mauser]]-design [[cartridge (firearm)|cartridges]] such as the [[8\u00d757mm IS|8mm Mauser]] round previously used by Czech designs. These modifications were categorised in various numbered designations, ZB vz. 27, ZB vz. 30, ZB vz. 32, and finally the ZGB 33, which was licensed for manufacture under the Bren name.\n\nThe Bren was a gas-operated weapon, which used the same .303 ammunition as the standard British [[bolt-action rifle]], the [[Lee\u2013Enfield]], firing at a rate of between 480 and 540 rounds per minute (rpm), depending on the model. Propellant gases vented from a port towards the muzzle end of the barrel through a regulator (visible in the photo, just in front of the bipod) with four quick-adjustment apertures of different sizes, intended to tailor the gas volume to different ambient temperatures (smallest flow at high temperature, e.g. summer desert, largest at low temperature, e.g. winter Arctic). The vented gas drove a piston which in turn actuated the breech block. Each gun came with a spare barrel that could be quickly changed when the barrel became hot during sustained fire, though later guns featured a [[chromium|chrome]]-lined barrel, which reduced the need for a spare. To change barrels, the release catch in front of the magazine was rotated to unlock the barrel. The carrying handle above the barrel was used to grip and remove the hot barrel without burning the hands.\n\nThe Bren was magazine-fed, which slowed its rate of fire and required more frequent reloading than British belt-fed machine guns such as the larger .303 Vickers machine gun. The slower rate of fire prevented more rapid overheating of the Bren's air-cooled barrel, and the Bren was much lighter than belt-fed machine guns, which typically had cooling jackets, often liquid filled. The magazines also prevented the ammunition from getting dirty, which was more of a problem with the Vickers with its 250-round canvas belts. The [[Sight (device)|sights]] were offset to the left, to avoid the magazine on the top of the weapon. The position of the sights meant that the Bren could be fired only from the right shoulder.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=40}}\n\n==Service==\n===Second World War===\n[[File:Anti-aircraft BrenGun.jpg|thumb|[[British Indian Army|Indian]] troops man a Bren gun on an anti-aircraft tripod, [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]] April 1941]]\nIn the British and Commonwealth armies, the Bren was generally issued on a scale of one per rifle section.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=28}} An infantry battalion also had a \"carrier\" platoon, equipped with [[Universal Carrier]]s, each of which carried a Bren gun.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=32}} Parachute battalions from 1944 had an extra Bren in the AT platoon.<ref>[http://www.bayonetstrength.150m.com/British/Airborne/british_parachute_battalion%201944%20to%201945.htm The British Parachute Battalion, circa 1944 to 1945] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101104240/http://www.bayonetstrength.150m.com/British/Airborne/british_parachute_battalion%201944%20to%201945.htm |date=January 1, 2009 }}.</ref> The 66-man \"Assault Troop\" of [[British Commandos]] had a nominal establishment of four Bren guns. Realising the need for additional section-level firepower, the British Army endeavoured to issue the Bren in great numbers, with a stated goal of one Bren to every four private soldiers.{{sfn|Dunlap|1948|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}} The Bren was operated by a two-man crew, sometimes commanded by a [[Lance Corporal]] as an infantry section's \"gun group\", the remainder of the section forming the \"rifle group\". The gunner or \"Number 1\" carried and fired the Bren, and a loader or \"Number 2\" carried extra magazines, a spare barrel and a tool kit.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=29}} Number 2 helped reload the gun and replace the barrel when it overheated, and spotted targets for Number 1.\n\nGenerally, the Bren was fired from the prone position using the attached bipod.<ref>\"It [the L4A4 Bren] is normally fired from the shoulder in the lying position, supported by the bipod, although it may be fired from other positions to engage targets at close range\". Chapter 1, Section 1, para 102, Australian Army Manual of Land Warfare, Part 2, Infantry Training, Vol 4 Pam 6, Machine Gun 7.62mm L4A4, Australian Government 1979.</ref> On occasion, a Bren gunner would use his weapon on the move supported by a sling, much like an automatic rifle, and from standing or kneeling positions. Using the sling, Australian soldiers regularly fired the Bren from the hip, for instance in the [[marching fire]] tactic, a form of [[suppressive fire]] moving forward in assault. A [[Victoria Cross]] was awarded to Private [[Bruce Kingsbury]] for such use at Isurava, New Guinea, in 1942, during the Australians' fighting retreat from Kokoda.\n\n[[File:Bren gunner of the Royal Scots 06-11-1944.jpg|thumb|left|Bren gunner of the [[Royal Scots]] in [[North Brabant]], the Netherlands, 1944]]\nEach British soldier's equipment normally included two magazines for his section's Bren gun. The large ammunition pouches on the [[1937 Pattern Web Equipment]] were designed around the Bren magazine. Every soldier would be trained to fire the Bren in case of an emergency, though these soldiers did not receive a Bren proficiency badge.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}\n\nThe Bren had an effective range of around {{convert|600|yd|m}} when fired from a prone position with a [[bipod]].{{sfn|Dunlap|1948|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}}\n\nFor a light machine gun of the interwar and early World War II era, the Bren was about average in weight. On long marches in non-operational areas it was often partially disassembled and its parts were carried by two soldiers. The top-mounted magazine vibrated and moved during fire, making the weapon more visible in combat, and many Bren gunners used paint or improvised canvas covers to disguise the prominent magazine.{{sfn||George|1948|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}}\n\nThe 30-round magazine was in practice usually filled with 27 or 28 rounds to prevent jams and avoid wearing out the magazine spring. Care needed to be taken when loading the magazine to ensure that each round went ahead of the previous round, so that the .303 cartridge rims did not overlap the wrong way, which would cause a jam. The spent [[cartridge case]]s were [[Downward ejection|ejected downwards]], which was an improvement on the Lewis gun, which ejected sideways, since the glint of them flying through the air could compromise a concealed firing position.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Bren2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bren carried by a Canadian soldier in 1945]]\nIn general, the Bren was considered a reliable and effective light machine gun, though in North Africa it was reported to jam regularly unless kept very clean and free of sand or dirt.{{sfn|Dunlap|1948|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}} It was popular with British troops, who respected its reliability and combat effectiveness. The quality of the materials used would generally ensure minimal jamming. When the gun did jam through fouling caused by prolonged firing, the operator could adjust the four-position gas regulator to feed more gas to the piston increasing the power to operate the mechanism. The barrel needed to be unlocked and slid forward slightly to allow the regulator to be turned. It was even said that all problems with the Bren could simply be cleared by hitting the gun, turning the regulator or doing both. It was \"by general consent the finest light machine gun in the world of its period, and the most useful weapon provided to the (French) \"maquis\" ... accurate up to 1,000 meters, and (it) could withstand immense maltreatment and unskilled use. \"Resistants\" were constantly pleading for maximum drops of Brens\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hastings |author-link=Max Hastings |first=Max |title=Das Reich: The March of the 2nd SS Panzer Division through France, June 1944 |edition=2 |origyear=1981 |year=2013 |publisher=Zenith Press |location=Minneapolis, United States |isbn=978-0-7603-4491-0 |page=236}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tysklandsbrigaden, \u00f8velse Skandia III - Fo30141603020010.jpg|thumb|Bren with 100 round detachable [[pan magazine]].

This became a greater issue when it was discovered that only 2,300 of the 30,000 Bren guns issued to the British Expeditionary Force came back to Britain after the defeat of France. As the result, cost savings and increased rate of production became two main goals for subsequent variant designs. The Bren Mk II design simplified production by replacing the drum rear sight with a ladder design, making the bipod legs non-adjustable, simplifying the gun butt, reducing the use of stainless steel, among other steps that reduced the cost by 20% to 25%; Mk II was approved in September 1940 and entered production in 1941. While the Bren Mk III design also aimed at reducing cost, it also had the concurrent goal of being lightened for jungle warfare; the final product weighed 19 pounds and 5 ounces (3 pounds lighter than the original Bren Mk I design); it was standardised in July 1944 and saw a production of 57,600. Also standardised in July 1944 was the Bren Mk IV, which was further lightened to 19 pounds and 2 ounces; however, it did not enter production until July 1945, and only 250 were built before the end of the war. While Enfield was able to produce only 400 Bren Mk I guns each month, with the various simplification efforts production numbers rose to 1,000 guns per week by 1943. Among the variant designs were two speciality prototypes that never entered production: The belt-fed Taden gun for stationary defence use, and the ultra-simplified [[Besal]] gun to be produced in case a German invasion of Britain actually took place (which would hinder British production efforts). Later designs of production Bren guns featured chrome-lined barrels that offered less resistance, preventing overheating and reducing the need for quick changes of barrels.<ref name = 'WW2DB'>{{cite| title=Bren Machine Gun|first=C. Peter|last=Chen|url= https://ww2db.com/weapon.php?q=40|website= ww2db.com}}</ref>\n\nBren guns were produced outside of Britain as well. In Canada, the John Inglis plant in Toronto began tooling its facilities for production in 1938; the first of 186,000 examples was completed in Mar 1940. Some of the Inglis-built Bren guns were chambered for the 7.92-millimeter Mauser ammunition; these were destined for export to Nationalist Chinese forces rather than for British and Commonwealth forces. In Australia, the Lithgow Small Arms Factory in New South Wales began building Bren guns in 1940; a total of 17,249 were built. In India, the factory at Ishapore began building Bren guns in 1942 (it had produced Vickers-Berthier machine guns prior to this time), and would continue producing them for decades long after the end of WW2. Many of the Bren guns produced at Ishapore went to Indian troops, who had lost a great number of automatic weapons during the disastrous campaigns against the Japanese in Malaya and Burma; 17th Indian Infantry Division, for example, found itself with only 56 Bren guns after fleeing out of Burma in 1942.<ref name = 'WW2DB'/>\n\nA complicated tripod mount was available to allow the Bren to be used as an indirect-fire weapon, but this was rarely used in the field. The Bren was also used on many vehicles, including on [[Universal Carrier]]s, to which it gave the alternative name \"Bren Gun Carrier\", and on tanks and armoured cars. It could not be used as a co-axial weapon on tanks, as the magazine restricted its depression and was awkward to handle in confined spaces, and it was therefore used on a [[pintle mount]] only. (The belt fed [[Vickers light machine gun|Vickers]] or [[Besa machine gun|Besa]], the latter being another Czechoslovak machine gun design adopted by the British, were instead used as co-axial weapons.) An unfortunate problem occurred when the Bren was fired from the [[Dingo Scout Car]]; the hot cartridge cases tended to be ejected down the neck of the driver, whose position was next to the pintle. A canvas bag was designed to catch the cartridges and overcome the problem, but it seems to have been rarely issued.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=41}}\n\n[[File:1944 Bren light machine gun.jpg|thumb|left|Bren gun mounted on a tripod, 2010]]\nThe Bren was also employed in the [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] role. The tripod could be adjusted to allow high angle fire. There were also several designs of less-portable mountings, including the ''Gallows'' and ''Mottley'' mounts. A 100-round [[Magazine (firearm)#Pan|pan magazine]] was available for the Bren for use in the anti-aircraft role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cairdpublications.com/scrap/armbitguns/images/Bren%20Guns.jpg|format=JPG|title=Image|website=Cairdpublications.com|accessdate=4 July 2018}}</ref> The Bren's direct ancestor, the Czechoslovak ZB vz. 26, was also used in World War&nbsp;II by German and Romanian forces, including units of the [[Waffen SS]]. Many [[8\u00d757mm IS|7.92 mm]] ZB light machine guns were shipped to China, where they were employed first against the Japanese in World War II, and later against UN forces in Korea, including British and Commonwealth units. Some ex-Chinese Czech ZB weapons were also in use in the early stages of the [[Vietnam War]]. Production of a 7.92&nbsp;mm round model for the Far East was carried out by Inglis of Canada.

In the [[Operation Banner|conflict in Northern Ireland]] (1969\u20131998), a British Army squad typically carried the L4A4 version of the Bren as the squad automatic weapon in the 1970s.{{sfn|Grant|2013|p=26}} During the [[Falklands War]] in 1982, [[40 Commando]] [[Royal Marines]] carried one LMG and one GPMG per section. Its final operational deployment with the British Army, on a limited scale, was to the [[First Gulf War]] in 1991.{{sfn|Grant|2013|pp=26 and 59}}\n\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 09.JPG|left|thumb]]\nWhen the British Army adopted the [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|7.62 mm]] [[NATO]] cartridge, the Bren was re-designed to 7.62&nbsp;mm calibre, fitted with a new bolt, barrel and magazine. It was redesignated as the L4 light machine gun (in various sub-versions) and remained in British Army service into the 1990s. A slotted flash hider similar to that of the contemporary L1 rifle and [[FN MAG#British subvariants|L7 general purpose machine gun]] replaced the conical flash hider. The change from a rimmed to rimless cartridge and nearly straight magazine improved feeding considerably, and allowed use of 20-round magazines from the 7.62&nbsp;mm [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]]. The 30-round magazine from the L4 also fitted the L1A1 rifle, but the magazine spring was not always strong enough to provide enough upward pressure to feed rounds correctly, this being remedied by stretching the magazine springs.\n\nCompletion of the move to a [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO|5.56 mm]] NATO cartridge led to Army removing the Bren/L4 from the list of approved weapons and then withdrawing it from service.\n\nThe Mark III Bren remained in limited use with the [[Irish Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] of the Irish Defence Forces until 2006, when the 7.62&nbsp;mm GPMG replaced it. The Bren was popular with the soldiers who fired it (known as Brenners) as it was light and durable, and had a reputation for accuracy. The most notable use of the Bren by Irish forces was in the [[Congo Crisis]] during the 1960s, when the Bren was the regular army's standard section automatic weapon.\n\nBren guns were in service with the [[Rhodesian Security Forces]] during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], including a substantial number re-chambered for 7.62&nbsp;mm cartridges similar to those examples in the British Army.<ref name=\"Moorcraft\">{{Cite book|title=The Rhodesian War: A Military History |last1=Moorcraft |first1=Paul L |last2=McLaughlin |first2=Peter |publisher=Stackpole Books |location=Mechanicsburg |date=2010 |origyear=2008 |isbn=978-0811707251 |page=92}}</ref> The Rhodesian Bren guns continued to see frequent action until the 1970s, when they were largely replaced by the [[FN MAG]].<ref name=\"Fireforce\">{{cite book |last=Chris Cocks|authorlink=|title=Fireforce: One Man's War in the Rhodesian Light Infantry|edition= July 1, 2001|pages= 139\u2013141 |publisher=Covos Day|isbn= 978-1-919874-32-6}}</ref> A few were captured and re-issued by the [[Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army]] (ZIPRA).<ref name=\"Impasse\">{{cite book|title=A matter of weeks rather than months: The Impasse between Harold Wilson and Ian Smith: Sanctions, Aborted Settlements and War 1965\u20131969|last=Wood|first=J R T|date=April 2008|location=Victoria, British Columbia|publisher=Trafford Publishing|isbn=978-1-4251-4807-2|page=411}}</ref> Some examples were still in service with reservists of the [[British South Africa Police]] in 1980, and were inherited by the [[Zimbabwe Republic Police]] upon the country's internationally recognised independence.<ref name=\"Cocks2\">{{cite book |title=Out of Action |edition=Second |last=Cocks |first=Chris |location=Johannesburg |publisher=30\u00b0 South Publishers |date=2008 |origyear=1999 |isbn=978-1920143206|page=48}}</ref> Zimbabwean policemen continued to deploy Bren guns during operations against ZIPRA dissidents throughout the early 1980s.<ref name=\"Cocks2\"/>\n\nThe [[South African Defence Force]] deployed Bren guns during the [[South African Border War]] alongside the more contemporary FN MAG as late as 1978.<ref name=\"Captor\">{{Cite journal\n|title=Representing history through film with reference to the documentary film Captor and Captive: Perspectives on a 1978 Border War incident.|last=Jooste|first=Rina |url=https://scholar.sun.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10019.1/85668/jooste_representing_2013.pdf|location=Stellenbosch|publisher=Stellenbosch University|year=2013|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 102.jpg|thumb|L4]]\n===Mark 1===\nIntroduced September 1937; the original Bren, based on the Czechoslovak gun.

Sometimes known as the \"Garage hands\" model. Overall length 45.5 inches, 25 inch barrel length. Weight 23 lb, 3 oz.\n\n'''Features:'''\n* Folding-leaf rear sight\n* Buttstrap deleted\n* Rear grip deleted\n* Fixed height bipod\n* Fixed cocking handle\n\nThe Bren Mk2 was much simplified in the body, which although still being milled from a solid billet of steel, required significantly fewer milling operations than the Mk1, resulting in a much cleaner appearance. The bipod was simplified in design as well as not having extending legs. Most Mk2 bipods resembled a simple A-frame and were more 'soldier proof'. The Mk2 also featured a slightly higher rate of fire than the Mk1.\n\nThe woodwork on the Mk2 was simplified by being less ornate and ergonomic, which sped up the manufacturing process. The barrel was also simplified by means of a non-stepped removable flash hider and, in some cases, a barrel fore-end that was matte instead of highly polished. The buffered buttplate of the Mk1 was omitted and replaced with a sheet metal buttplate.\n\nA small number of Inglis-made .303 Bren Mk 2 were converted post-war to fire the [[.280 British|.280]] 7 mm Mk 1Z round used by the [[EM-2 rifle]].\n\nThe Inglis version of the Bren Mk 2 chambered for the [[30-06]] cartridge and known as the M41 was also manufactured in [[Formosa]] in 1952.\n\n===Mark 3===\nA shorter and lighter Bren made by Enfield from 1944 for the war in the East and for Airborne Forces. This was similar to the Mk2 but with the light weight features of the early Mk1. With the main distinguishing feature being a shorter barrel and serrated area in front of the barrel nut.  Overall length 42.9 inches, 22.25 inch barrel length. Weight 19 lb, 5 oz.\n\n===Mark 4===\nAs with the Mk3 but this was a conversion of a Mk2. Overall length 42.9 inches, 22.25 inch barrel length. Weight 19 lb, 2 oz.\n\n===L4===\n[[File:Keeping Watch.jpg|thumbnail|left|L4 or Machine Gun 1B in Indian service]]\n\nA conversion of the Bren to 7.62mm NATO from 1958. Indian Army variants may be new-build, not conversions. L4 Brens can easily be identified by their different magazine. The British-issue L4 magazine is of 30-round capacity and has a slight curve. The L4 magazine was interchangeable with the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle|L1A1 SLR]] magazine, so the L4 Bren also can be seen fitted with straight 20-round magazines from the SLR or with the straight 30-round magazine from the Australian [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle#Australia|L2A1]] or Canadian C2A1 heavy-barrel SLR. The flash suppressor was changed from the cone type of .303 variants to a slotted type similar in appearance to that used on the SLR and L7 GPMG.

Surplus Brens have been imported to the United States for sale to collectors, but due to US gun laws restricting the importation of automatic weapons such guns must be legally destroyed by cutting up the receivers. A number of US gunsmiths have manufactured new semiautomatic Brens by welding the pieces of destroyed receivers back together, with modifications to prevent the use of full automatic parts, and fitting new fire-control components capable of only semiautomatic fire. The balance of the parts are surplus Bren parts. Such \"semiautomatic machine guns\" are legally considered rifles under US Federal law and the laws of most states.\n\n==World War II production==\n[[File:VeronicaFoster-RonnieBrenGunGirl-smoke.jpg|thumb|right|<center>[[Veronica Foster|\"Ronnie, the Bren Gun Girl\"]], poses with the finished product at the John Inglis plant, Toronto, 1941</center>]]\n* RSAF Enfield, UK: 400 per month.\n** 1943: 1,000 per week.\n* [[John Inglis and Company]], Canada: A contract was signed with the British and Canadian governments in March 1938 to supply 5,000 Bren machine guns to Great Britain and 7,000 Bren machine guns to Canada.

{"title_page": "Real number", "text_new": "{{About||the real numbers used in descriptive set theory|Baire space (set theory)|the computing datatype|Floating-point number}}\n{{short description|Number representing a continuous quantity}}\n{{more footnotes|date=April 2016}}\n[[File:Latex real numbers.svg|right|thumb|120px|A symbol for the set of real numbers]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''real number''' is a value of a continuous [[quantity]] that can represent a distance along a [[line (geometry)|line]]. The adjective ''real'' in this context was introduced in the 17th century by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], who distinguished between real and [[imaginary number|imaginary]] [[Zero of a function|roots]] of [[polynomial]]s. The real numbers include all the [[rational number]]s, such as the [[integer]] \u22125 and the [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] 4/3, and all the [[irrational number]]s, such as {{sqrt|2}} (1.41421356..., the [[square root of 2]], an irrational [[algebraic number]]).  Included within the irrationals are the [[transcendental number]]s, such as [[pi|{{pi}}]] (3.14159265...).   In addition to measuring distance, real numbers can be used to measure quantities such as [[time]], [[mass]], [[energy]], [[velocity]], and many more.\n\nReal numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long [[line (geometry)|line]] called the [[number line]] or [[real line]], where the points corresponding to [[integer]]s are equally spaced. Any real number can be determined by a possibly infinite [[decimal representation]], such as that of 8.632, where each consecutive digit is measured in units one tenth the size of the previous one. The [[real line]] can be thought of as a part of the [[complex plane]], and [[complex number]]s include real numbers.\n\n[[File:Real number line.svg|thumb|center|350px|Real numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long [[number line]]]]\n\nThese descriptions of the real numbers are not sufficiently rigorous by the modern standards of pure mathematics. The discovery of a suitably rigorous definition of the real numbers\u2014indeed, the realization that a better definition was needed\u2014was one of the most important developments of 19th-century mathematics. The current standard axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique [[Dedekind-complete]] [[ordered field]] {{nowrap|('''R''' ; + ; \u00b7 ; <),}} [[up to]] an [[isomorphism]],{{efn|More precisely, given two complete totally ordered fields, there is a ''unique'' isomorphism between them. This implies that the identity is the unique field automorphism of the reals that is compatible with the ordering.}} whereas popular constructive definitions of real numbers include declaring them as [[equivalence class]]es of [[Cauchy sequence]]s of rational numbers, [[Dedekind cut]]s, or infinite [[decimal representation]]s, together with precise interpretations for the arithmetic operations and the order relation. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.\n\nThe set of all real numbers is [[uncountable set|uncountable]]; that is: while both the set of all [[natural number]]s and the set of all real numbers are [[infinite set]]s, there can be no [[one-to-one function]] from the real numbers to the natural numbers: the [[cardinality]] of the set of all real numbers (denoted <math>\\mathfrak c</math> and called [[cardinality of the continuum]]) is strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers (denoted <math>\\aleph_0</math> [[aleph number#Aleph-naught|'aleph-naught']]). The statement that there is no subset of the reals with cardinality strictly greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math> and strictly smaller than <math>\\mathfrak c</math> is known as the [[continuum hypothesis]] (CH). It is known to be neither provable nor refutable using the axioms of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] including the [[axiom of choice]] (ZFC), the standard foundation of modern mathematics, in the sense that some models of ZFC satisfy CH, while others violate it.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Number-systems.svg|thumb|Real numbers (\u211d) include the [[rational number]]s (\u211a), which include the [[integer]]s (\u2124), which include the [[natural number]]s (\u2115)]]\n\n[[Fraction (mathematics)#Common, vulgar, or simple fractions|Simple fractions]] were used by the [[History of Egypt|Egyptians]] around 1000&nbsp;BC; the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] \"[[Shulba Sutras]]\" (\"The rules of chords\") in, {{nowrap|{{abbr|c.|circa}} 600 BC}}, include what may be the first \"use\" of [[irrational number]]s. The concept of irrationality was implicitly accepted by early [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]] since [[Manava]] {{nowrap|({{abbr|c.|circa}} 750\u2013690 BC)}}, who were aware that the [[square root]]s of certain numbers such as 2 and 61 could not be exactly determined.<ref>T.

The first rigorous definition was published by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1871. In 1874, he showed that the set of all real numbers is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]] but the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is [[countable|countably infinite]]. Contrary to widely held beliefs, his first method was not his famous [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]], which he published in 1891. See [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]].\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Main|Construction of the real numbers}}\n\nThe real number system <math>(\\mathbf{R} ; {}+{} ; {}\\cdot{} ; {}<{})</math> can be defined [[Axiomatic system|axiomatically]] up to an [[isomorphism]], which is described hereafter. There are also many ways to construct \"the\" real number system, for example, starting from natural numbers, then defining rational numbers algebraically, and finally defining real numbers as equivalence classes of their [[Cauchy sequence]]s or as [[Dedekind cut]]s, which are certain subsets of rational numbers. Another possibility is to start from some rigorous axiomatization of Euclidean geometry (Hilbert, Tarski, etc.) and then define the real number system geometrically. All these constructions of the real numbers have been shown to be equivalent, that is the resulting number systems are [[isomorphic]].\n\n=== Axiomatic approach ===\n\nLet '''R''' denote the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all real numbers. Then:\n* The set '''R'''  is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], meaning that [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] are defined and have the usual properties.\n* The field '''R'''  is [[ordered field|ordered]], meaning that there is a [[total order]] \u2265 such that, for all real numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'':\n** if ''x'' \u2265 ''y'' then ''x'' + ''z'' \u2265 ''y'' + ''z'';\n** if ''x'' \u2265 0 and ''y'' \u2265 0 then ''xy'' \u2265 0.\n* The order is [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]]; that is: every [[empty set|non-empty]] subset ''S'' of '''R'''  with an [[upper bound]] in '''R''' has a [[supremum|least upper bound]] (also called supremum) in '''R''' .\n\nThe last property is what differentiates the reals from the [[rational number|rationals]] (and from [[Ordered field#Examples of ordered fields|other, more exotic ordered fields]]). For example, the set of rationals with square less than 2 has a rational upper bound (e.g., 1.5) but no rational least upper bound, because the [[square root]] of 2 is not rational.\n\nThese properties imply [[Archimedean property]] (which is not implied by other definitions of completeness). That is, the set of [[integer]]s is not upper-bounded in the reals. In fact, if this were false, then the integers would have a least upper bound ''N''; then, ''N'' \u2013 1 would not be an upper bound, and there would be an integer ''n'' such that {{nowrap|''n'' > ''N'' \u2013 1}}, and thus {{nowrap|''n'' + 1 > ''N''}}, which is a contradiction with the upper-bound property of ''N''.\n\nThe real numbers are uniquely specified by the above properties. More precisely, given any two Dedekind-complete ordered fields '''R'''<sub>1</sub> and '''R'''<sub>2</sub>, there exists a unique field [[isomorphism]] from '''R'''<sub>1</sub> to '''R'''<sub>2</sub>, allowing us to think of them as essentially the same mathematical object.\n\nFor another axiomatization of \u211d, see [[Tarski's axiomatization of the reals]].\n\n=== Construction from the rational numbers ===\n\nThe real numbers can be constructed as a [[Complete metric space|completion]] of the rational numbers in such a way that a sequence defined by a decimal or binary expansion like (3; 3.1; 3.14; 3.141; 3.1415; ...) [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] to a unique real number, in this case {{pi}}. For details and other constructions of real numbers, see [[construction of the real numbers]].\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Basic properties ===\n* Any non-[[0 (number)|''zero'']] real number is either [[negative number|''negative'']] or [[positive number|''positive'']].\n* The sum and the product of two non-negative real numbers is again a non-negative real number, i.e., they are closed under these operations, and form a ''positive cone'', thereby giving rise to a [[linear order]] of the real numbers along a [[number line]].\n* The real numbers make up an [[infinite set]] of numbers that cannot be [[injective function|injectively]] mapped to the infinite set of [[natural number]]s, i.e., there are [[uncountable set|uncountably]] infinitely many real numbers, whereas the natural numbers are called [[countable set|countably infinite]]. This establishes that in some sense, there are ''more'' real numbers than there are elements in any countable set.\n* There is a hierarchy of countably infinite subsets of the real numbers, e.g., the [[integer]]s, the [[rational number|rationals]], the [[algebraic number]]s and the [[computable number]]s, each set being a proper subset of the next in the sequence. The [[complement (set theory)|complements]] of all these sets ([[irrational number|irrational]], [[transcendental number|transcendental]], and non-computable real numbers) with respect to the reals, are all uncountably infinite sets.\n* Real numbers can be used to express [[measurement]]s of [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. They may be expressed by [[decimal representation]]s, most of them having an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the [[decimal point]]; these are often represented like 324.823122147..., where the [[Ellipsis#In mathematical notation|ellipsis]] (three dots) indicates that there would still be more digits to come. This hints to the fact that we can precisely denote only a few, selected real numbers with finitely many symbols.\n\nMore formally, the real numbers have the two basic properties of being an [[ordered field]], and having the [[least upper bound axiom|least upper bound]] property. The first says that real numbers comprise a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], with addition and multiplication as well as division by non-zero numbers, which can be [[total order|totally ordered]] on a number line in a way compatible with addition and multiplication. The second says that, if a non-empty set of real numbers has an [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]], then it has a real [[supremum|least upper bound]]. The second condition distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers: for example, the set of rational numbers whose square is less than 2 is a set with an upper bound (e.g. 1.5) but no (rational) least upper bound: hence the rational numbers do not satisfy the least upper bound property.\n\n=== Completeness ===\n{{Main|Completeness of the real numbers}}\n\nA main reason for using real numbers is that the reals contain all [[limit (mathematics)|limits]]. More precisely, a sequence of real numbers has a limit, which is a real number, if (and only if) its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to each other.\nThis is formally defined in the following, and means that the reals are [[completeness (topology)|complete]] (in the sense of [[metric space]]s or [[uniform space]]s, which is a different sense than the Dedekind completeness of the order in the previous section). :\n\nA [[sequence]] (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) of real numbers is called a ''[[Cauchy sequence]]'' if for any {{nowrap|\u03b5 > 0}} there exists an integer ''N'' (possibly depending on \u03b5) such that the [[distance]] {{nowrap|{{!}}''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2212 ''x<sub>m</sub>''{{!}}}} is less than \u03b5 for all ''n'' and ''m'' that are both greater than ''N''. This definition, originally provided by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], formalizes the fact that the ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to each other.\n\nA sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) ''converges to the limit'' ''x'' if its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to ''x'', that is, if for any {{nowrap|\u03b5 > 0}} there exists an integer ''N'' (possibly depending on \u03b5) such that the distance {{nowrap|{{!}}''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2212 ''x''{{!}}}} is less than \u03b5 for ''n'' greater than ''N''.\n\nEvery convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, and the converse is true for real numbers, and this means that the [[topological space]] of the real numbers is complete.\n\nThe set of rational numbers is not complete. For example, the sequence (1; 1.4; 1.41; 1.414; 1.4142; 1.41421; ...), where each term adds a digit of the decimal expansion of the positive [[square root]] of 2, is Cauchy but it does not converge to a rational number (in the real numbers, in contrast, it converges to the positive [[square root]] of 2).\n\nThe completeness property of the reals is the basis on which [[calculus]], and, more generally [[mathematical analysis]] are built. In particular, the test that a sequence is a Cauchy sequence allows proving that a sequence has a limit, without computing it, and even without knowing it.\n\nFor example, the standard series of the [[exponential function]]\n:<math>e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\n\nconverges to a real number for every ''x'', because the sums\n:<math>\\sum_{n=N}^{M} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\n\ncan be made arbitrarily small (independently of ''M'') by choosing ''N'' sufficiently large. This proves that the sequence is Cauchy, and thus converges, showing that <math>e^x</math> is well defined for every ''x''.\n\n=== \"The complete ordered field\" ===\n\nThe real numbers are often described as \"the complete ordered field\", a phrase that can be interpreted in several ways.\n\nFirst, an order can be [[complete lattice|lattice-complete]]. It is easy to see that no ordered field can be lattice-complete, because it can have no largest element (given any element ''z'', {{nowrap|''z'' + 1}} is larger), so this is not the sense that is meant.\n\nAdditionally, an order can be [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]], as defined in the section '''Axioms'''. The uniqueness result at the end of that section justifies using the word \"the\" in the phrase \"complete ordered field\" when this is the sense of \"complete\" that is meant. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Dedekind cuts, since that construction starts from an ordered field (the rationals) and then forms the Dedekind-completion of it in a standard way.\n\nThese two notions of completeness ignore the field structure. However, an [[ordered group]] (in this case, the additive group of the field) defines a [[uniform space|uniform]] structure, and uniform structures have a notion of [[completeness (topology)]]; the description in the previous section '''Completeness''' is a special case. (We refer to the notion of completeness in uniform spaces rather than the related and better known notion for [[metric space]]s, since the definition of metric space relies on already having a characterization of the real numbers.) It is not true that '''R''' is the ''only'' uniformly complete ordered field, but it is the only uniformly complete ''[[Archimedean field]]'', and indeed one often hears the phrase \"complete Archimedean field\" instead of \"complete ordered field\". Every uniformly complete Archimedean field must also be Dedekind-complete (and vice versa), justifying using \"the\" in the phrase \"the complete Archimedean field\". This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Cauchy sequences (the construction carried out in full in this article), since it starts with an Archimedean field (the rationals) and forms the uniform completion of it in a standard way.\n\nBut the original use of the phrase \"complete Archimedean field\" was by [[David Hilbert]], who meant still something else by it. He meant that the real numbers form the ''largest'' Archimedean field in the sense that every other Archimedean field is a subfield of '''R'''. Thus '''R''' is \"complete\" in the sense that nothing further can be added to it without making it no longer an Archimedean field. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from [[surreal number]]s, since that construction starts with a proper class that contains every ordered field (the surreals) and then selects from it the largest Archimedean subfield.\n\n=== Advanced properties ===\n{{See also|Real line}}\n\nThe reals are [[uncountable]]; that is: there are strictly more real numbers than [[natural number]]s, even though both sets are [[Infinite set|infinite]]. In fact, the [[cardinality of the continuum|cardinality of the reals]] equals that of the set of subsets (i.e. the power set) of the natural numbers, and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] states that the latter set's cardinality is strictly greater than the cardinality of '''N'''. Since the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable, [[almost all]] real numbers are [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. The non-existence of a subset of the reals with cardinality strictly between that of the integers and the reals is known as the [[continuum hypothesis]]. The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor be disproved; it is [[logical independence|independent]] from the [[axiomatic set theory|axioms of set theory]].\n\nAs a topological space, the real numbers are [[separable space|separable]]. This is because the set of rationals, which is countable, is dense in the real numbers. The irrational numbers are also dense in the real numbers, however they are uncountable and have the same cardinality as the reals.\n\nThe real numbers form a [[metric space]]: the distance between ''x'' and ''y'' is defined as the [[absolute value]] {{nowrap|{{!}}''x'' \u2212 ''y''{{!}}}}. By virtue of being a [[total order|totally ordered]] set, they also carry an [[order topology]]; the [[topology]] arising from the metric and the one arising from the order are identical, but yield different presentations for the topology\u2014in the order topology as ordered intervals, in the metric topology as epsilon-balls. The Dedekind cuts construction uses the order topology presentation, while the Cauchy sequences construction uses the metric topology presentation. The reals are a [[contractible]] (hence [[connected space|connected]] and [[simply connected]]), [[separable space|separable]] and [[complete space|complete]] metric space of [[Hausdorff dimension]]&nbsp;1. The real numbers are [[local compactness|locally compact]] but not [[compact space|compact]]. There are various properties that uniquely specify them; for instance, all unbounded, connected, and separable [[total order|order topologies]] are necessarily [[homeomorphic]] to the reals.\n\nEvery nonnegative real number has a [[square root]] in '''R''', although no negative number does. This shows that the order on '''R''' is determined by its algebraic structure. Also, every polynomial of odd degree admits at least one real root: these two properties make '''R''' the premier example of a [[real closed field]]. Proving this is the first half of one proof of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].\n\nThe reals carry a canonical [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]], the [[Lebesgue measure]], which is the [[Haar measure]] on their structure as a [[topological group]] normalized such that the [[unit interval]] [0;1] has measure 1. There exist sets of real numbers that are not Lebesgue measurable, e.g. [[Vitali set]]s.\n\nThe supremum axiom of the reals refers to subsets of the reals and is therefore a second-order logical statement. It is not possible to characterize the reals with [[first-order logic]] alone: the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] implies that there exists a countable dense subset of the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences in first-order logic as the real numbers themselves. The set of [[hyperreal number]]s <!-- is equal in cardinality to '''R''' and also -->satisfies the same first order sentences as '''R'''. Ordered fields that satisfy the same first-order sentences as '''R''' are called [[nonstandard model]]s of '''R'''. This is what makes [[nonstandard analysis]] work; by proving a first-order statement in some nonstandard model (which may be easier than proving it in '''R'''), we know that the same statement must also be true of '''R'''.\n\nThe [[field (mathematics)|field]] '''R''' of real numbers is an [[extension field]] of the field '''Q''' of rational numbers, and '''R''' can therefore be seen as a [[vector space]] over '''Q'''. [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of choice]] guarantees the existence of a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of this vector space: there exists a set ''B'' of real numbers such that every real number can be written uniquely as a finite [[linear combination]] of elements of this set, using rational coefficients only, and such that no element of ''B'' is a rational linear combination of the others. However, this existence theorem is purely theoretical, as such a base has never been explicitly described.\n\nThe [[well-ordering theorem]] implies that the real numbers can be [[well-order]]ed if the axiom of choice is assumed: there exists a [[total order]] on '''R''' with the property that every [[empty set|non-empty]] [[subset]] of '''R''' has a [[least element]] in this ordering. (The standard ordering \u2264 of the real numbers is not a well-ordering since e.g. an [[open interval]] does not contain a least element in this ordering.) Again, the existence of such a well-ordering is purely theoretical, as it has not been explicitly described. If [[V=L]] is assumed in addition to the axioms of ZF, a well ordering of the real numbers can be shown to be explicitly definable by a formula.<ref>{{citation |last=Moschovakis |first=Yiannis N. |title=Descriptive set theory |work=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics |volume=100 |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Co. |location=Amsterdam; New York |year=1980 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/descriptivesetth0000mosc/page/ xii, 637] |isbn=978-0-444-85305-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/descriptivesetth0000mosc/page/ }}, chapter V.</ref>\n\nA real number may be either [[computable number|computable]] or uncomputable; either [[Algorithmically random sequence|algorithmically random]] or not; and either [[Algorithmically random sequence#Stronger than Martin-L\u00f6f randomness|arithmetically random]] or not.\n\n== Applications and connections to other areas ==\n\n=== Real numbers and logic ===\n\nThe real numbers are most often formalized using the [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel]] axiomatization of set theory, but some mathematicians study the real numbers with other logical foundations of mathematics.

The set of [[definable number]]s is broader, but still only countable.\n\n=== \"Reals\" in set theory ===\n\nIn [[set theory]], specifically [[descriptive set theory]], the [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] is used as a surrogate for the real numbers since the latter have some topological properties (connectedness) that are a technical inconvenience. Elements of Baire space are referred to as \"reals\".\n\n== Vocabulary and notation ==\n\nMathematicians use the symbol '''R''', or, alternatively, \u211d, the [[R|letter \"R\"]] in [[blackboard bold]] (encoded in [[Unicode]] as {{unichar|211D|DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL R|html=}}), to represent the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all real numbers. As this set is naturally endowed with the structure of a [[field (mathematics)|field]], the expression ''field of real numbers'' is frequently used when its algebraic properties are under consideration.\n\nThe sets of positive real numbers and negative real numbers are often noted '''R'''<sup>+</sup> and '''R'''<sup>\u2212</sup>,<ref name=Schumacher96>{{harvnb|Schumacher|1996|loc=pp. 114\u201315}}</ref> respectively; '''R'''<sub>+</sub> and '''R'''<sub>\u2212</sub> are also used.<ref name=\"nombres-reels-ens-paris\">[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] of [[Paris]], [http://culturemath.ens.fr/maths/pdf/logique/reels.pdf \u201c{{lang|fr|Nombres r\u00e9els}}\u201d (\u201cReal numbers\u201d)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508122311/http://culturemath.ens.fr/maths/pdf/logique/reels.pdf |date=2014-05-08 }}, p. 6</ref> The non-negative real numbers can be noted '''R'''<sub>\u22650</sub> but one often sees this set noted '''R'''<sup>+</sup> \u222a {0}.<ref name=Schumacher96 /> In French mathematics, the ''positive real numbers'' and ''negative real numbers'' commonly include [[zero]], and these sets are noted respectively \u211d<sub>+</sub> and \u211d<sub>\u2212</sub>.<ref name=\"nombres-reels-ens-paris\"/> In this understanding, the respective sets without zero are called strictly positive real numbers and strictly negative real numbers, and are noted \u211d<sub>+</sub>* and \u211d<sub>\u2212</sub>*.<ref name=\"nombres-reels-ens-paris\"/>\n\nThe notation '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> refers to the [[Cartesian product]] of ''n'' copies of '''R''', which is an ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[vector space]] over the field of the real numbers; this vector space may be identified to the ''n''-[[dimension]]al space of [[Euclidean geometry]] as soon as a [[coordinate system]] has been chosen in the latter. For example, a value from '''R'''<sup>3</sup> consists of three real numbers and specifies the [[coordinates]] of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in 3\u2011dimensional space.\n\nIn mathematics, ''real'' is used as an adjective, meaning that the underlying field is the field of the real numbers (or ''the real field''). For example, ''real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]'', ''real [[polynomial]]'' and ''real [[Lie algebra]]''. The word is also used as a [[noun]], meaning a real number (as in \"the set of all reals\").\n\n== Generalizations and extensions ==\n\nThe real numbers can be generalized and extended in several different directions:\n* The [[complex number]]s contain solutions to all [[polynomial]] equations and hence are an [[algebraically closed field]] unlike the real numbers. However, the complex numbers are not an [[ordered field]].\n* The [[affinely extended real number system]] adds two elements +\u221e and \u2212\u221e. It is a [[compact space]]. It is no longer a field, or even an additive group, but it still has a [[total order]]; moreover, it is a [[complete lattice]].\n* The [[real projective line]] adds only one value \u221e. It is also a compact space. Again, it is no longer a field, or even an additive group. However, it allows division of a non-zero element by zero. It has [[cyclic order]] described by a [[separation relation]].\n* The [[Long line (topology)|long real line]] pastes together \u2135<sub>1</sub>* + \u2135<sub>1</sub> copies of the real line plus a single point (here \u2135<sub>1</sub>* denotes the reversed ordering of \u2135<sub>1</sub>) to create an ordered set that is \"locally\" identical to the real numbers, but somehow longer; for instance, there is an order-preserving embedding of \u2135<sub>1</sub> in the long real line but not in the real numbers. The long real line is the largest ordered set that is complete and locally Archimedean. As with the previous two examples, this set is no longer a field or additive group.\n* Ordered fields extending the reals are the [[hyperreal number]]s and the [[surreal number]]s; both of them contain [[infinitesimal]] and infinitely large numbers and are therefore [[non-Archimedean ordered field]]s.\n* [[Self-adjoint operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]] (for example, self-adjoint square complex [[matrix (math)|matrices]]) generalize the reals in many respects: they can be ordered (though not totally ordered), they are complete, all their [[eigenvector|eigenvalues]] are real and they form a real [[associative algebra]]. [[Positive-definite]] operators correspond to the positive reals and [[normal operator]]s correspond to the complex numbers.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Continued fraction]]\n* [[Real analysis]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Georg Cantor|Cantor, Georg]] (1874). \"{{lang|de|\u00dcber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen}}\".

The adjective ''real'' in this context was introduced in the 17th century by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], who distinguished between real and [[imaginary number|imaginary]] [[Zero of a function|roots]] of [[polynomial]]s. The real numbers include all the [[rational number]]s, such as the [[integer]] \u22125 and the [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] 4/3, and all the [[irrational number]]s, such as {{sqrt|2}} (1.41421356..., the [[square root of 2]], an irrational [[algebraic number]]).  Included within the irrationals are the [[transcendental number]]s, such as [[pi|{{pi}}]] (3.14159265...).   In addition to measuring distance, real numbers can be used to measure quantities such as [[time]], [[mass]], [[energy]], [[velocity]], and many more.\n\nReal numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long [[line (geometry)|line]] called the [[number line]] or [[real line]], where the points corresponding to [[integer]]s are equally spaced. Any real number can be determined by a possibly infinite [[decimal representation]], such as that of 8.632, where each consecutive digit is measured in units one tenth the size of the previous one. The [[real line]] can be thought of as a part of the [[complex plane]], and [[complex number]]s include real numbers.\n\n[[File:Real number line.svg|thumb|center|350px|Real numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long [[number line]]]]\n\nThese descriptions of the real numbers are not sufficiently rigorous by the modern standards of pure mathematics. The discovery of a suitably rigorous definition of the real numbers\u2014indeed, the realization that a better definition was needed\u2014was one of the most important developments of 19th-century mathematics. The current standard axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique [[Dedekind-complete]] [[ordered field]] {{nowrap|('''R''' ; + ; \u00b7 ; <),}} [[up to]] an [[isomorphism]],{{efn|More precisely, given two complete totally ordered fields, there is a ''unique'' isomorphism between them. This implies that the identity is the unique field automorphism of the reals that is compatible with the ordering.}} whereas popular constructive definitions of real numbers include declaring them as [[equivalence class]]es of [[Cauchy sequence]]s of rational numbers, [[Dedekind cut]]s, or infinite [[decimal representation]]s, together with precise interpretations for the arithmetic operations and the order relation. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent.\n\nThe set of all real numbers is [[uncountable set|uncountable]]; that is: while both the set of all [[natural number]]s and the set of all real numbers are [[infinite set]]s, there can be no [[one-to-one function]] from the real numbers to the natural numbers: the [[cardinality]] of the set of all real numbers (denoted <math>\\mathfrak c</math> and called [[cardinality of the continuum]]) is strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers (denoted <math>\\aleph_0</math> [[aleph number#Aleph-naught|'aleph-naught']]). The statement that there is no subset of the reals with cardinality strictly greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math> and strictly smaller than <math>\\mathfrak c</math> is known as the [[continuum hypothesis]] (CH). It is known to be neither provable nor refutable using the axioms of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] including the [[axiom of choice]] (ZFC), the standard foundation of modern mathematics, in the sense that some models of ZFC satisfy CH, while others violate it.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Number-systems.svg|thumb|Real numbers (\u211d) include the [[rational number]]s (\u211a), which include the [[integer]]s (\u2124), which include the [[natural number]]s (\u2115)]]\n\n[[Fraction (mathematics)#Common, vulgar, or simple fractions|Simple fractions]] were used by the [[History of Egypt|Egyptians]] around 1000&nbsp;BC; the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] \"[[Shulba Sutras]]\" (\"The rules of chords\") in, {{nowrap|{{abbr|c.|circa}} 600 BC}}, include what may be the first \"use\" of [[irrational number]]s.

The first rigorous definition was published by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1871. In 1874, he showed that the set of all real numbers is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]] but the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is [[countable|countably infinite]]. Contrary to widely held beliefs, his first method was not his famous [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]], which he published in 1891. See [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]].\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Main|Construction of the real numbers}}\n\nThe real number system <math>(\\mathbf{R} ; {}+{} ; {}\\cdot{} ; {}<{})</math> can be defined [[Axiomatic system|axiomatically]] up to an [[isomorphism]], which is described hereafter. There are also many ways to construct \"the\" real number system, for example, starting from natural numbers, then defining rational numbers algebraically, and finally defining real numbers as equivalence classes of their [[Cauchy sequence]]s or as [[Dedekind cut]]s, which are certain subsets of rational numbers. Another possibility is to start from some rigorous axiomatization of Euclidean geometry (Hilbert, Tarski, etc.) and then define the real number system geometrically. All these constructions of the real numbers have been shown to be equivalent, that is the resulting number systems are [[isomorphic]].\n\n=== Axiomatic approach ===\n\nLet '''R''' denote the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all real numbers. Then:\n* The set '''R'''  is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], meaning that [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] are defined and have the usual properties.\n* The field '''R'''  is [[ordered field|ordered]], meaning that there is a [[total order]] \u2265 such that, for all real numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'':\n** if ''x'' \u2265 ''y'' then ''x'' + ''z'' \u2265 ''y'' + ''z'';\n** if ''x'' \u2265 0 and ''y'' \u2265 0 then ''xy'' \u2265 0.\n* The order is [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]]; that is: every [[empty set|non-empty]] subset ''S'' of '''R'''  with an [[upper bound]] in '''R''' has a [[supremum|least upper bound]] (also called supremum) in '''R''' .\n\nThe last property is what differentiates the reals from the [[rational number|rationals]] (and from [[Ordered field#Examples of ordered fields|other, more exotic ordered fields]]). For example, the set of rationals with square less than 2 has a rational upper bound (e.g., 1.5) but no rational least upper bound, because the [[square root]] of 2 is not rational.\n\nThese properties imply [[Archimedean property]] (which is not implied by other definitions of completeness). That is, the set of [[integer]]s is not upper-bounded in the reals. In fact, if this were false, then the integers would have a least upper bound ''N''; then, ''N'' \u2013 1 would not be an upper bound, and there would be an integer ''n'' such that {{nowrap|''n'' > ''N'' \u2013 1}}, and thus {{nowrap|''n'' + 1 > ''N''}}, which is a contradiction with the upper-bound property of ''N''.\n\nThe real numbers are uniquely specified by the above properties. More precisely, given any two Dedekind-complete ordered fields '''R'''<sub>1</sub> and '''R'''<sub>2</sub>, there exists a unique field [[isomorphism]] from '''R'''<sub>1</sub> to '''R'''<sub>2</sub>, allowing us to think of them as essentially the same mathematical object.\n\nFor another axiomatization of \u211d, see [[Tarski's axiomatization of the reals]].\n\n=== Construction from the rational numbers ===\n\nThe real numbers can be constructed as a [[Complete metric space|completion]] of the rational numbers in such a way that a sequence defined by a decimal or binary expansion like (3; 3.1; 3.14; 3.141; 3.1415; ...) [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] to a unique real number, in this case {{pi}}. For details and other constructions of real numbers, see [[construction of the real numbers]].\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Basic properties ===\n* Any non-[[0 (number)|''zero'']] real number is either [[negative number|''negative'']] or [[positive number|''positive'']].\n* The sum and the product of two non-negative real numbers is again a non-negative real number, i.e., they are closed under these operations, and form a ''positive cone'', thereby giving rise to a [[linear order]] of the real numbers along a [[number line]].\n* The real numbers make up an [[infinite set]] of numbers that cannot be [[injective function|injectively]] mapped to the infinite set of [[natural number]]s, i.e., there are [[uncountable set|uncountably]] infinitely many real numbers, whereas the natural numbers are called [[countable set|countably infinite]]. This establishes that in some sense, there are ''more'' real numbers than there are elements in any countable set.\n* There is a hierarchy of countably infinite subsets of the real numbers, e.g., the [[integer]]s, the [[rational number|rationals]], the [[algebraic number]]s and the [[computable number]]s, each set being a proper subset of the next in the sequence. The [[complement (set theory)|complements]] of all these sets ([[irrational number|irrational]], [[transcendental number|transcendental]], and non-computable real numbers) with respect to the reals, are all uncountably infinite sets.\n* Real numbers can be used to express [[measurement]]s of [[Continuous function|continuous]] quantities. They may be expressed by [[decimal representation]]s, most of them having an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the [[decimal point]]; these are often represented like 324.823122147..., where the [[Ellipsis#In mathematical notation|ellipsis]] (three dots) indicates that there would still be more digits to come. This hints to the fact that we can precisely denote only a few, selected real numbers with finitely many symbols.\n\nMore formally, the real numbers have the two basic properties of being an [[ordered field]], and having the [[least upper bound axiom|least upper bound]] property. The first says that real numbers comprise a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], with addition and multiplication as well as division by non-zero numbers, which can be [[total order|totally ordered]] on a number line in a way compatible with addition and multiplication. The second says that, if a non-empty set of real numbers has an [[Upper and lower bounds|upper bound]], then it has a real [[supremum|least upper bound]]. The second condition distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers: for example, the set of rational numbers whose square is less than 2 is a set with an upper bound (e.g. 1.5) but no (rational) least upper bound: hence the rational numbers do not satisfy the least upper bound property.\n\n=== Completeness ===\n{{Main|Completeness of the real numbers}}\n\nA main reason for using real numbers is that the reals contain all [[limit (mathematics)|limits]]. More precisely, a sequence of real numbers has a limit, which is a real number, if (and only if) its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to each other.\nThis is formally defined in the following, and means that the reals are [[completeness (topology)|complete]] (in the sense of [[metric space]]s or [[uniform space]]s, which is a different sense than the Dedekind completeness of the order in the previous section). :\n\nA [[sequence]] (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) of real numbers is called a ''[[Cauchy sequence]]'' if for any {{nowrap|\u03b5 > 0}} there exists an integer ''N'' (possibly depending on \u03b5) such that the [[distance]] {{nowrap|{{!}}''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2212 ''x<sub>m</sub>''{{!}}}} is less than \u03b5 for all ''n'' and ''m'' that are both greater than ''N''. This definition, originally provided by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], formalizes the fact that the ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to each other.\n\nA sequence (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) ''converges to the limit'' ''x'' if its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to ''x'', that is, if for any {{nowrap|\u03b5 > 0}} there exists an integer ''N'' (possibly depending on \u03b5) such that the distance {{nowrap|{{!}}''x<sub>n</sub>'' \u2212 ''x''{{!}}}} is less than \u03b5 for ''n'' greater than ''N''.\n\nEvery convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, and the converse is true for real numbers, and this means that the [[topological space]] of the real numbers is complete.\n\nThe set of rational numbers is not complete. For example, the sequence (1; 1.4; 1.41; 1.414; 1.4142; 1.41421; ...), where each term adds a digit of the decimal expansion of the positive [[square root]] of 2, is Cauchy but it does not converge to a rational number (in the real numbers, in contrast, it converges to the positive [[square root]] of 2).\n\nThe completeness property of the reals is the basis on which [[calculus]], and, more generally [[mathematical analysis]] are built. In particular, the test that a sequence is a Cauchy sequence allows proving that a sequence has a limit, without computing it, and even without knowing it.\n\nFor example, the standard series of the [[exponential function]]\n:<math>e^x = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\n\nconverges to a real number for every ''x'', because the sums\n:<math>\\sum_{n=N}^{M} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\n\ncan be made arbitrarily small (independently of ''M'') by choosing ''N'' sufficiently large. This proves that the sequence is Cauchy, and thus converges, showing that <math>e^x</math> is well defined for every ''x''.\n\n=== \"The complete ordered field\" ===\n\nThe real numbers are often described as \"the complete ordered field\", a phrase that can be interpreted in several ways.\n\nFirst, an order can be [[complete lattice|lattice-complete]]. It is easy to see that no ordered field can be lattice-complete, because it can have no largest element (given any element ''z'', {{nowrap|''z'' + 1}} is larger), so this is not the sense that is meant.\n\nAdditionally, an order can be [[Dedekind completion|Dedekind-complete]], as defined in the section '''Axioms'''. The uniqueness result at the end of that section justifies using the word \"the\" in the phrase \"complete ordered field\" when this is the sense of \"complete\" that is meant. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Dedekind cuts, since that construction starts from an ordered field (the rationals) and then forms the Dedekind-completion of it in a standard way.\n\nThese two notions of completeness ignore the field structure. However, an [[ordered group]] (in this case, the additive group of the field) defines a [[uniform space|uniform]] structure, and uniform structures have a notion of [[completeness (topology)]]; the description in the previous section '''Completeness''' is a special case. (We refer to the notion of completeness in uniform spaces rather than the related and better known notion for [[metric space]]s, since the definition of metric space relies on already having a characterization of the real numbers.) It is not true that '''R''' is the ''only'' uniformly complete ordered field, but it is the only uniformly complete ''[[Archimedean field]]'', and indeed one often hears the phrase \"complete Archimedean field\" instead of \"complete ordered field\". Every uniformly complete Archimedean field must also be Dedekind-complete (and vice versa), justifying using \"the\" in the phrase \"the complete Archimedean field\". This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Cauchy sequences (the construction carried out in full in this article), since it starts with an Archimedean field (the rationals) and forms the uniform completion of it in a standard way.\n\nBut the original use of the phrase \"complete Archimedean field\" was by [[David Hilbert]], who meant still something else by it. He meant that the real numbers form the ''largest'' Archimedean field in the sense that every other Archimedean field is a subfield of '''R'''. Thus '''R''' is \"complete\" in the sense that nothing further can be added to it without making it no longer an Archimedean field. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from [[surreal number]]s, since that construction starts with a proper class that contains every ordered field (the surreals) and then selects from it the largest Archimedean subfield.\n\n=== Advanced properties ===\n{{See also|Real line}}\n\nThe reals are [[uncountable]]; that is: there are strictly more real numbers than [[natural number]]s, even though both sets are [[Infinite set|infinite]]. In fact, the [[cardinality of the continuum|cardinality of the reals]] equals that of the set of subsets (i.e. the power set) of the natural numbers, and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] states that the latter set's cardinality is strictly greater than the cardinality of '''N'''. Since the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable, [[almost all]] real numbers are [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. The non-existence of a subset of the reals with cardinality strictly between that of the integers and the reals is known as the [[continuum hypothesis]]. The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor be disproved; it is [[logical independence|independent]] from the [[axiomatic set theory|axioms of set theory]].\n\nAs a topological space, the real numbers are [[separable space|separable]]. This is because the set of rationals, which is countable, is dense in the real numbers. The irrational numbers are also dense in the real numbers, however they are uncountable and have the same cardinality as the reals.\n\nThe real numbers form a [[metric space]]: the distance between ''x'' and ''y'' is defined as the [[absolute value]] {{nowrap|{{!}}''x'' \u2212 ''y''{{!}}}}. By virtue of being a [[total order|totally ordered]] set, they also carry an [[order topology]]; the [[topology]] arising from the metric and the one arising from the order are identical, but yield different presentations for the topology\u2014in the order topology as ordered intervals, in the metric topology as epsilon-balls. The Dedekind cuts construction uses the order topology presentation, while the Cauchy sequences construction uses the metric topology presentation. The reals are a [[contractible]] (hence [[connected space|connected]] and [[simply connected]]), [[separable space|separable]] and [[complete space|complete]] metric space of [[Hausdorff dimension]]&nbsp;1. The real numbers are [[local compactness|locally compact]] but not [[compact space|compact]]. There are various properties that uniquely specify them; for instance, all unbounded, connected, and separable [[total order|order topologies]] are necessarily [[homeomorphic]] to the reals.\n\nEvery nonnegative real number has a [[square root]] in '''R''', although no negative number does. This shows that the order on '''R''' is determined by its algebraic structure. Also, every polynomial of odd degree admits at least one real root: these two properties make '''R''' the premier example of a [[real closed field]]. Proving this is the first half of one proof of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].\n\nThe reals carry a canonical [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]], the [[Lebesgue measure]], which is the [[Haar measure]] on their structure as a [[topological group]] normalized such that the [[unit interval]] [0;1] has measure 1. There exist sets of real numbers that are not Lebesgue measurable, e.g. [[Vitali set]]s.\n\nThe supremum axiom of the reals refers to subsets of the reals and is therefore a second-order logical statement. It is not possible to characterize the reals with [[first-order logic]] alone: the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] implies that there exists a countable dense subset of the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences in first-order logic as the real numbers themselves. The set of [[hyperreal number]]s <!-- is equal in cardinality to '''R''' and also -->satisfies the same first order sentences as '''R'''. Ordered fields that satisfy the same first-order sentences as '''R''' are called [[nonstandard model]]s of '''R'''. This is what makes [[nonstandard analysis]] work; by proving a first-order statement in some nonstandard model (which may be easier than proving it in '''R'''), we know that the same statement must also be true of '''R'''.\n\nThe [[field (mathematics)|field]] '''R''' of real numbers is an [[extension field]] of the field '''Q''' of rational numbers, and '''R''' can therefore be seen as a [[vector space]] over '''Q'''. [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of choice]] guarantees the existence of a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of this vector space: there exists a set ''B'' of real numbers such that every real number can be written uniquely as a finite [[linear combination]] of elements of this set, using rational coefficients only, and such that no element of ''B'' is a rational linear combination of the others. However, this existence theorem is purely theoretical, as such a base has never been explicitly described.\n\nThe [[well-ordering theorem]] implies that the real numbers can be [[well-order]]ed if the axiom of choice is assumed: there exists a [[total order]] on '''R''' with the property that every [[empty set|non-empty]] [[subset]] of '''R''' has a [[least element]] in this ordering. (The standard ordering \u2264 of the real numbers is not a well-ordering since e.g. an [[open interval]] does not contain a least element in this ordering.) Again, the existence of such a well-ordering is purely theoretical, as it has not been explicitly described. If [[V=L]] is assumed in addition to the axioms of ZF, a well ordering of the real numbers can be shown to be explicitly definable by a formula.<ref>{{citation |last=Moschovakis |first=Yiannis N. |title=Descriptive set theory |work=Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics |volume=100 |publisher=North-Holland Publishing Co. |location=Amsterdam; New York |year=1980 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/descriptivesetth0000mosc/page/ xii, 637] |isbn=978-0-444-85305-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/descriptivesetth0000mosc/page/ }}, chapter V.</ref>\n\nA real number may be either [[computable number|computable]] or uncomputable; either [[Algorithmically random sequence|algorithmically random]] or not; and either [[Algorithmically random sequence#Stronger than Martin-L\u00f6f randomness|arithmetically random]] or not.\n\n== Applications and connections to other areas ==\n\n=== Real numbers and logic ===\n\nThe real numbers are most often formalized using the [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel]] axiomatization of set theory, but some mathematicians study the real numbers with other logical foundations of mathematics.

In this approach, infinitesimals are (non-\"standard\") elements of the set of the real numbers (rather than being elements of an extension thereof, as in Robinson's theory).\n\nThe [[continuum hypothesis]] posits that the cardinality of the set of the real numbers is <math>\\aleph_1</math>; i.e. the smallest infinite [[cardinal number]] after <math>\\aleph_0</math>, the cardinality of the integers. [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] proved in 1963 that it is an axiom independent of the other axioms of set theory; that is: one may choose either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as an axiom of set theory, without contradiction.\n\n=== In physics ===\n\nIn the physical sciences, most physical constants such as the universal gravitational constant, and physical variables, such as position, mass, speed, and electric charge, are modeled using real numbers. In fact, the fundamental physical theories such as [[classical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]] and the [[standard model]] are described using mathematical structures, typically [[smooth manifolds]] or [[Hilbert spaces]], that are based on the real numbers, although actual measurements of physical quantities are of finite [[accuracy and precision]].\n\nPhysicists have occasionally suggested that a more fundamental theory would replace the real numbers with quantities that do not form a continuum, but such proposals remain speculative.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=John Archibald|author-link=John Archibald Wheeler|date=1986|title=Hermann Weyl and the Unity of Knowledge: In the linkage of four mysteries\u2014the \"how come\" of existence, time, the mathematical continuum, and the discontinuous yes-or-no of quantum physics\u2014may lie the key to deep new insight|jstor=27854250|journal=[[American Scientist]]|volume=74|issue=4|pages=366\u201375|bibcode=1986AmSci..74..366W}}<br />{{cite journal|first=Ingemar|last=Bengtsson|title=The Number Behind the Simplest SIC-POVM|journal=[[Foundations of Physics]]|year=2017|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1031\u201341|doi=10.1007/s10701-017-0078-3|arxiv=1611.09087|bibcode=2017FoPh...47.1031B}}</ref>\n\n=== In computation ===\n\nWith some [[Symbolic computation|exceptions]], most calculators do not operate on real numbers.

Real numbers satisfy the [[Field (mathematics)#Definition and illustration|usual rules of arithmetic]], but [[Floating-point arithmetic#Accuracy problems|floating-point numbers do not]].\n\nComputers cannot directly store arbitrary real numbers with infinitely many digits. The achievable precision is limited by the number of bits allocated to store a number, whether as [[floating-point number]]s or [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary-precision numbers]]. However, [[computer algebra system]]s can operate on [[irrational number|irrational quantities]] exactly by manipulating formulas for them (such as <math>\\sqrt{2},</math> <math>\\arcsin (2/23),</math> or <math>\\textstyle\\int_0^1 x^x \\,dx</math>) rather than their rational or decimal approximation.<ref>{{Citation |publisher=A K Peters |isbn=978-1-56881-158-1 |volume=1 |last=Cohen |first=Joel S. |title=Computer algebra and symbolic computation: elementary algorithms |year=2002 |page=32}}</ref> It is not in general possible to determine whether two such expressions are equal (the [[constant problem]]).\n\nA real number is called ''[[computable number|computable]]'' if there exists an algorithm that yields its digits.

Moreover, the equality of two computable numbers is an [[undecidable problem]]. Some [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]] accept the existence of only those reals that are computable. The set of [[definable number]]s is broader, but still only countable.\n\n=== \"Reals\" in set theory ===\n\nIn [[set theory]], specifically [[descriptive set theory]], the [[Baire space (set theory)|Baire space]] is used as a surrogate for the real numbers since the latter have some topological properties (connectedness) that are a technical inconvenience. Elements of Baire space are referred to as \"reals\".\n\n== Vocabulary and notation ==\n\nMathematicians use the symbol '''R''', or, alternatively, \u211d, the [[R|letter \"R\"]] in [[blackboard bold]] (encoded in [[Unicode]] as {{unichar|211D|DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL R|html=}}), to represent the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all real numbers. As this set is naturally endowed with the structure of a [[field (mathematics)|field]], the expression ''field of real numbers'' is frequently used when its algebraic properties are under consideration.\n\nThe sets of positive real numbers and negative real numbers are often noted '''R'''<sup>+</sup> and '''R'''<sup>\u2212</sup>,<ref name=Schumacher96>{{harvnb|Schumacher|1996|loc=pp. 114-115}}</ref> respectively; '''R'''<sub>+</sub> and '''R'''<sub>\u2212</sub> are also used.<ref name=\"nombres-reels-ens-paris\">[[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] of [[Paris]], [http://culturemath.ens.fr/maths/pdf/logique/reels.pdf \u201c{{lang|fr|Nombres r\u00e9els}}\u201d (\u201cReal numbers\u201d)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508122311/http://culturemath.ens.fr/maths/pdf/logique/reels.pdf |date=2014-05-08 }}, p. 6</ref> The non-negative real numbers can be noted '''R'''<sub>\u22650</sub> but one often sees this set noted '''R'''<sup>+</sup> \u222a {0}.<ref name=Schumacher96 /> In French mathematics, the ''positive real numbers'' and ''negative real numbers'' commonly include [[zero]], and these sets are noted respectively \u211d<sub>+</sub> and \u211d<sub>\u2212</sub>.<ref name=\"nombres-reels-ens-paris\"/> In this understanding, the respective sets without zero are called strictly positive real numbers and strictly negative real numbers, and are noted \u211d<sub>+</sub>* and \u211d<sub>\u2212</sub>*.<ref name=\"nombres-reels-ens-paris\"/>\n\nThe notation '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> refers to the [[Cartesian product]] of ''n'' copies of '''R''', which is an ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[vector space]] over the field of the real numbers; this vector space may be identified to the ''n''-[[dimension]]al space of [[Euclidean geometry]] as soon as a [[coordinate system]] has been chosen in the latter. For example, a value from '''R'''<sup>3</sup> consists of three real numbers and specifies the [[coordinates]] of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in 3\u2011dimensional space.\n\nIn mathematics, ''real'' is used as an adjective, meaning that the underlying field is the field of the real numbers (or ''the real field''). For example, ''real [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]'', ''real [[polynomial]]'' and ''real [[Lie algebra]]''. The word is also used as a [[noun]], meaning a real number (as in \"the set of all reals\").\n\n== Generalizations and extensions ==\n\nThe real numbers can be generalized and extended in several different directions:\n* The [[complex number]]s contain solutions to all [[polynomial]] equations and hence are an [[algebraically closed field]] unlike the real numbers. However, the complex numbers are not an [[ordered field]].\n* The [[affinely extended real number system]] adds two elements +\u221e and \u2212\u221e. It is a [[compact space]]. It is no longer a field, or even an additive group, but it still has a [[total order]]; moreover, it is a [[complete lattice]].\n* The [[real projective line]] adds only one value \u221e. It is also a compact space. Again, it is no longer a field, or even an additive group. However, it allows division of a non-zero element by zero. It has [[cyclic order]] described by a [[separation relation]].\n* The [[Long line (topology)|long real line]] pastes together \u2135<sub>1</sub>* + \u2135<sub>1</sub> copies of the real line plus a single point (here \u2135<sub>1</sub>* denotes the reversed ordering of \u2135<sub>1</sub>) to create an ordered set that is \"locally\" identical to the real numbers, but somehow longer; for instance, there is an order-preserving embedding of \u2135<sub>1</sub> in the long real line but not in the real numbers. The long real line is the largest ordered set that is complete and locally Archimedean. As with the previous two examples, this set is no longer a field or additive group.\n* Ordered fields extending the reals are the [[hyperreal number]]s and the [[surreal number]]s; both of them contain [[infinitesimal]] and infinitely large numbers and are therefore [[non-Archimedean ordered field]]s.\n* [[Self-adjoint operator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]] (for example, self-adjoint square complex [[matrix (math)|matrices]]) generalize the reals in many respects: they can be ordered (though not totally ordered), they are complete, all their [[eigenvector|eigenvalues]] are real and they form a real [[associative algebra]]. [[Positive-definite]] operators correspond to the positive reals and [[normal operator]]s correspond to the complex numbers.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Continued fraction]]\n* [[Real analysis]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Georg Cantor|Cantor, Georg]] (1874). \"{{lang|de|\u00dcber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen}}\".
