Rickard''''', 572 U.S. ___ (2014), is a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case involving the [[use of force]] by [[police officer]]s during high-speed [[car chase]]s. After first holding that it had [[jurisdiction]] to hear the case, the Court held that the conduct of the police officers involved in the case did not violate the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]].\n\nAt midnight on July 18, 2004, Donald Rickard led police officers on a high-speed car chase which ended in a parking lot, where officers fired fifteen shots into Rickard's car as he continued to flee. Rickard and his passenger both died from a combination of gunshot wounds and injuries sustained when the car eventually crashed. Rickard's daughter sued the officers who shot Rickard, arguing that they had used [[excessive force]] in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers moved for [[summary judgment]] based on [[qualified immunity]] because they believed their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the car chase. The district court denied this motion, and the court of appeals affirmed.\n\nOn May 27, 2014, the Supreme Court reversed, holding that the officers did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In a unanimous (9\u20130) decision authored by [[Justice Samuel Alito]],{{efn|name=opinionbreakdown}} the Court found that Rickard's actions posed a \"grave public safety risk\" and that the officers \"acted reasonably in using deadly force to end that risk\". The Court also found that the number of shots fired was also reasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\". Finally, the Court found that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity because their actions did not violate clearly established law at the time of the incident.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Prior case law ===\nThe [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits unreasonable [[Search and seizure|searches and seizures]] by the federal government, and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] extends this prohibition to state governments under the [[Incorporation of the Bill of Rights|incorporation doctrine]]. In the course of their duties, police officers must sometimes make split-second decisions in situations where they believe there is a serious threat to the lives of themselves or the public. The [[use of force]] by police officers to counter such threats constitutes a seizure in the eyes of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court has previously held in such cases as ''[[Tennessee v. Garner]]'' (1985) and ''[[Graham v. Connor]]'' (1989) that the use of force, including deadly force, by a police officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment if it is \"objectively reasonable\" in light of the circumstances confronting them.<ref>Ross, p. 246</ref>\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has also examined the use of force against fleeing motorists specifically. In ''[[Brosseau v. Haugen]]'' (2004), the Supreme Court upheld the use of force by a police officer who fired her gun into the back of a suspect's car after chasing the suspect on foot.<ref>Ross, p. 247\u201348</ref> The Court has also held in ''[[Scott v. Harris]]'' (2007) that a \"police officer's attempt to terminate a dangerous high-speed car chase that threatens the lives of innocent bystanders does not violate the Fourth Amendment, even when it places the fleeing motorist at risk of serious injury or death.\"<ref>''Scott v.

Connor''.<ref>Ross, p. 248</ref>\n\nIf a person believes that the use of force against them is unjustified, [[42 U.S.C. \u00a71983]] allows them to file a civil action, claiming a violation of their constitutional rights. In general, police officers are protected from individual liability from these claims by the [[qualified immunity]] doctrine, which prevents government officials, including police officers, from being held individually liable for federal civil rights violations unless their conduct violated clearly established law at the time in question.<ref>Ross, p. 248</ref> In ''[[Johnson v. Jones]]'' (1995), the Supreme Court held that a defendant entitled to qualified immunity in these kinds of cases cannot immediately appeal a [[United States district court|district court]]'s order regarding a motion for [[summary judgment]] \"insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact for trial\".<ref>''Johnson v.

There was also a passenger named Kelly Allen in the car's passenger seat. During the [[traffic stop]], the lieutenant asked Rickard to step out of the car because he appeared nervous and failed to produce a driver license when asked. Instead of doing so, Rickard decided to speed away from the officer. The lieutenant, later joined by other officers, pursued Rickard in a high-speed car chase down [[Interstate 40]], exceeding speeds over 100 miles per hour.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 2.</ref> The entire chase lasted approximately five minutes. According to a video of the car chase, Rickard nearly struck 29 other drivers, struck two different patrol cars, and nearly struck another patrol car. Rickard drove east, crossing the Mississippi River into Tennessee. The officers attempted unsuccessfully to use a \"[[rolling roadblock]]\" to stop Rickard.<ref name=\":2\">Ross, p. 251.</ref>\n\nAfter exiting Interstate 40, Rickard collided with the cruiser of one of the officers and spun out into a parking lot in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"plumhoff3\" /> After Rickard temporarily stopped next to a building, officers approached Rickard's car on foot; Rickard then began to back up, and an officer pounded against his passenger-side window with his firearm.<ref name=\":2\" /> Rickard then collided with another police cruiser, and even though Rickard's bumper was flush against the cruiser, he continued to use his accelerator. At this point, Sergeant Vance Plumhoff fired three shots into Rickard's car. Then, as Rickard continued \"fleeing down\" a street, officers fired twelve additional shots in the direction of Rickard's car, making the total number of shots fired in the incident fifteen. Rickard then lost control and crashed into a building. He and Allen died from a combination of gunshot wounds and crash injuries.<ref name=\"plumhoff3\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 3.</ref>\n\n=== Lower court proceedings ===\n\nWhitne Rickard, Rickard's [[Minor (law)|minor]] daughter, filed a legal action under [[42 U.S.C. \u00a71983]] against Plumhoff and the other officers, as well as the chief of police and the mayor, alleging that the officers had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by using excessive force against her father and his passenger.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"plumhoff3\" /> The officers filed a motion for [[summary judgment]] on the basis of [[qualified immunity]]. The [[U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee]] denied this motion, holding that the officers' conduct violated clearly established law at the time of the incident. Before the case could proceed, the officers appealed the district court's denial to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]], which initially dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, citing the Supreme Court's decision in ''Johnson v. Jones'', but later vacated that judgment and instead affirmed the District Court's holding.<ref name=\"plumhoff4\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 4.</ref>\n\n== Supreme Court ==\n[[File:Samuel Alito official photo.jpg|thumb|Justice Samuel Alito wrote the unanimous opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Plumhoff v.

Writing for a unanimous Court,{{Efn|The Court's decision was unanimous (9\u20130) except that Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] did not join parts III\u2013A and III\u2013B, and Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] did not join part III\u2013B\u20132.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 1.</ref> The Supreme Court's opinion is divided as follows. \n* Part I describes the facts of the case and the lower court proceedings.\n* In Part II, the Court holds that it has jurisdiction to hear this case.\n* In Part III\u2013A, the Court explains why it was beginning its legal analysis with whether a constitutional right was actually violated.\n* In Part III\u2013B\u20131, the Court holds that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by using deadly force to end the high-speed car chase.\n* In Part III\u2013B\u20132, the Court rejects the argument that number of shots fired in this case was unreasonable, even if it was reasonable to use deadly force.\n* In Part III\u2013C, the Court holds that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".|name=opinionbreakdown|group=}} Alito began by addressing whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the case as an [[interlocutory appeal]].{{Efn|An [[interlocutory appeal]] is a type of appeal that occurs in the middle of a trial court's proceeding, while other aspects of the case are still pending. In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', the police officers appealed the district court's order denying [[summary judgment]] on qualified immunity. Because the officers appealed the case immediately after this order, without waiting for the case to proceed to trial, the appeal is considered \"interlocutory\".}} In general, federal law (specifically 28 U.S.C. \u00a71291) only allows courts of appeals to hear appeals from the \"final decisions\" of district courts, and Alito acknowledged that an order denying summary judgment \"is generally not a final decision within the meaning of \u00a71291 and is thus generally not immediately appealable\".<ref name=\":0\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 5.</ref> However, summary judgments based on qualified immunity are an exception to this general rule, since qualified immunity is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Alito rejected the respondent's argument that the Court's decision in ''Johnson v. Jones'' prevents the Court from having jurisdiction in this case, stating that in ''Johnson'', the summary judgment order was not appealable because \"it merely decided 'a question of evidence sufficiency', ''i.e.'' which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6.</ref> In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', however, the officers raised legal issues, and Alito stated that \"deciding legal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate courts\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMoving onto the legal questions, Alito first explained that he was beginning his analysis of whether the officers' violated \"clearly established law\" by first answering whether the officers' actually violated the Fourth Amendment, citing the Court's decision in ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]'' (2001).<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 7.</ref> Examining the facts of the case \"from the perspective 'of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight'\", Alito concluded that the officers had acted reasonably and had not violated the Fourth Amendment.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 8\u201310.</ref> Alito wrote there was \"no basis for reaching a different conclusion\" from the Court's decision in ''Scott v. Harris'', stating that \"Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 10.</ref> Furthermore, Alito rejected the respondent's argument that even if the officers were justified in using deadly force, the degree of force that the officers used when firing 15 shots into Rickard's car was unreasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\".<ref name=\":1\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 11.</ref> The presence of a passenger in Rickard's car does not affect this analysis because the question in the case is \"whether petitioners violated Rickard\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, not Allen\u2019s\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, Alito wrote that even if the officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 12.</ref>\n\n== Analysis and reception ==\n\n=== Implications ===\n\nIn a legal analysis published in ''[[Criminal Justice Review]]'', a peer-reviewed academic journal published by [[SAGE Publishing]], Darrell L. Ross of [[Valdosta State University]] discussed the legal and practical implications of ''Plumhoff''. According to Ross, \"lower courts are reminded of how to assess issues pertaining to qualified immunity, particularly in use of force cases\".<ref name=\":3\">Ross p. 254</ref> Specifically, the \"correct standard, as reiterated by the Court\u2014which was never discussed by the Sixth Circuit\u2014is whether the right was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood what he or she is doing violates that right.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAdditionally, Ross wrote that police are also reminded of the Court's principles regarding the use of deadly force in accordance with ''Graham'', especially as it pertains to fleeing motorists. Specifically, Ross wrote, \"Whether force appears reasonable is measured from the perspective of the officer at the moment the officer decided to use it.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Ross also emphasized the implications of the Court's analysis over the number of rounds fired. Ross commented that police officers \"are not trained or required to shoot to wound, nor are they trained to shoot warning shots prior to responding with deadly force.\"<ref name=\":4\">Ross, p. 255</ref> According to Ross, \"Justice Alito confirmed the fact officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is stopped ...\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Finally, Ross wrote, \"Police administrators are encouraged to review and revise their current use of force and pursuit policies consistent with this decision.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Ross recommended that \"administrators should provide training to their officers on use of force legal issues and principles that emerge from ''Rickard'', ''Graham'', ''Scott'', and ''Brosseau''\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Reactions and criticism ===\n\n[[Erwin Chemerinsky]], the dean of the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]], wrote an opinion piece published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which he described the Court's decision as \"deeply disturbing\", arguing that there are alternatives to shooting at fleeing vehicles and that the Court has \"weakened accountability by ruling that a local government can be held liable only if it is proved that the city\u2019s or county\u2019s own policy violated the Constitution\".<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |last1=Chemerinsky |first1=Erwin |title=Opinion {{!}} How the Supreme Court Protects Bad Cops |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/opinion/how-the-supreme-court-protects-bad-cops.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 August 2014 |page=A23}}</ref> In the article, Chemerinsky also opposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, arguing that it poses an unreasonable burden for individuals alleging violations of constitutional rights.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\nIn a blog post published in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Jonathan R. Nash, a professor of law at [[Emory University School of Law]], argued that the Court's decision in ''Plumhoff'' was inconsistent with the precedent it set in ''Scott'', commenting that the Court \"jettisoned ''Scott''<nowiki/>'s careful balancing in favor of an approach designed to give the police substantial leeway in terminating chases\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|title=High-speed police pursuits and deadly force|last=Nash|first=Jonathan R.|date=August 19, 2014|website=The Hill|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414175726/https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|archive-date=April 14, 2018|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> Nash stated there were differences between the facts in ''Plumhoff'' versus the facts in ''Scott'', which he felt should have compelled the Court to a different conclusion. For example, in ''Scott'', the police used a maneuver that caused the driver to spin out of control, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', the police used their firearms. Additionally, in ''Scott'', the driver was the only one in the fleeing car, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', Rickard had a passenger.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n; Sources\n* ''Plumhoff v.

The officers attempted unsuccessfully to use a \"[[rolling roadblock]]\" to stop Rickard.<ref name=\":2\">Ross, p. 251.</ref>\n\nAfter exiting Interstate 40, Rickard collided with the cruiser of one of the officers and spun out into a parking lot in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].<ref name=\"plumhoff3\" /> After Rickard temporarily stopped next to a building, officers approached Rickard's car on foot; Rickard then began to back up, and an officer pounded against his passenger-side window with his firearm.<ref name=\":2\" /> Rickard then collided with another police cruiser, and even though Rickard's bumper was flush against the cruiser, he continued to use his accelerator. At this point, Sergeant Vance Plumhoff fired three shots into Rickard's car. Then, as Rickard continued \"fleeing down\" a street, officers fired twelve additional shots in the direction of Rickard's car, making the total number of shots fired in the incident fifteen. Rickard then lost control and crashed into a building. He and Allen died from a combination of gunshot wounds and crash injuries.<ref name=\"plumhoff3\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 3.</ref>\n\n=== Lower court proceedings ===\n\nWhitne Rickard, Rickard's [[Minor (law)|minor]] daughter, filed a legal action under [[42 U.S.C. \u00a71983]] against Plumhoff and the other officers, as well as the chief of police and the mayor, alleging that the officers had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by using excessive force against her father and his passenger.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"plumhoff3\" /> The officers filed a motion for [[summary judgment]] on the basis of [[qualified immunity]]. The [[U.S. District Court for the Western District of Tennessee]] denied this motion, holding that the officers' conduct violated clearly established law at the time of the incident. Before the case could proceed, the officers appealed the district court's denial to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]], which initially dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, citing the Supreme Court's decision in ''Johnson v. Jones'', but later vacated that judgment and instead affirmed the District Court's holding.<ref name=\"plumhoff4\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 4.</ref>\n\n== Supreme Court ==\n[[File:Samuel Alito official photo.jpg|thumb|Justice Samuel Alito wrote the unanimous opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court in ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'']]\nThe officers petitioned the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted [[certiorari]] on November 15, 2013, in order to review two questions: (1) \"whether the Sixth Circuit wrongly denied qualified immunity to Petitioners by analyzing whether the force used in 2004 was distinguishable from factually similar force ruled permissible three years later in ''Scott v. Harris''\", and (2) \"whether the Sixth Circuit erred in denying qualified immunity by finding the use of force was not reasonable as a matter of law\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/12-01117qp.pdf|title=12-1117 Plumhoff v.

Writing for a unanimous Court,{{Efn|The Court's decision was unanimous (9\u20130) except that Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] did not join parts III\u2013A and III\u2013B, and Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] did not join part III\u2013B\u20132.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 1.</ref> The Supreme Court's opinion is divided as follows. \n* Part I describes the facts of the case and the lower court proceedings.\n* In Part II, the Court holds that it has jurisdiction to hear this case.\n* In Part III\u2013A, the Court explains why it was beginning its legal analysis with whether a constitutional right was actually violated.\n* In Part III\u2013B\u20131, the Court holds that the police did not violate the Fourth Amendment by using deadly force to end the high-speed car chase.\n* In Part III\u2013B\u20132, the Court rejects the argument that number of shots fired in this case was unreasonable, even if it was reasonable to use deadly force.\n* In Part III\u2013C, the Court holds that even if the officers' conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".|name=opinionbreakdown|group=}} Alito began by addressing whether the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to hear the case as an [[interlocutory appeal]].{{Efn|An [[interlocutory appeal]] is a type of appeal that occurs in the middle of a trial court's proceeding, while other aspects of the case are still pending. In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', the police officers appealed the district court's order denying [[summary judgment]] on qualified immunity. Because the officers appealed the case immediately after this order, without waiting for the case to proceed to trial, the appeal is considered \"interlocutory\".}} In general, federal law (specifically 28 U.S.C. \u00a71291) only allows courts of appeals to hear appeals from the \"final decisions\" of district courts, and Alito acknowledged that an order denying summary judgment \"is generally not a final decision within the meaning of \u00a71291 and is thus generally not immediately appealable\".<ref name=\":0\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 5.</ref> However, summary judgments based on qualified immunity are an exception to this general rule, since qualified immunity is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Alito rejected the respondent's argument that the Court's decision in ''Johnson v. Jones'' prevents the Court from having jurisdiction in this case, stating that in ''Johnson'', the summary judgment order was not appealable because \"it merely decided 'a question of evidence sufficiency', ''i.e.'' which facts a party may, or may not, be able to prove at trial\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6.</ref> In the case of ''Plumhoff v. Rickard'', however, the officers raised legal issues, and Alito stated that \"deciding legal issues of this sort is a core responsibility of appellate courts\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nMoving onto the legal questions, Alito first explained that he was beginning his analysis of whether the officers' violated \"clearly established law\" by first answering whether the officers' actually violated the Fourth Amendment, citing the Court's decision in ''[[Saucier v. Katz]]'' (2001).<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 7.</ref> Examining the facts of the case \"from the perspective 'of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with 20/20 vision of hindsight'\", Alito concluded that the officers had acted reasonably and had not violated the Fourth Amendment.<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 8\u201310.</ref> Alito wrote there was \"no basis for reach a different conclusion\" from the Court's decision in ''Scott v. Harris'', stating that \"Rickard's outrageously reckless driving posed a grave public safety risk\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 10.</ref> Furthermore, Alito rejected the respondent's argument that even if the officers were justified in using deadly force, the degree of force that the officers used when firing 15 shots into Rickard's car was unreasonable, writing that \"if police officers are justified in firing at a suspect in order to end a severe threat to public safety, the officers need not stop shooting until the threat has ended\".<ref name=\":1\">''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 11.</ref> The presence of a passenger in Rickard's car does not affect this analysis because the question in the case is \"whether petitioners violated Rickard\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, not Allen\u2019s\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Finally, Alito wrote that even if the officers' conduct had violated the Fourth Amendment, they \"would still be entitled to summary judgment based on qualified immunity\".<ref>''Plumhoff'', 572 U.S. ___ at 12.</ref>\n\n== Analysis and reception ==\n\n=== Implications ===\n\nIn a legal analysis published in ''[[Criminal Justice Review]]'', a peer-reviewed academic journal published by [[SAGE Publishing]], Darrell L. Ross of [[Valdosta State University]] discussed the legal and practical implications of ''Plumhoff''. According to Ross, \"lower courts are reminded of how to assess issues pertaining to qualified immunity, particularly in use of force cases\".<ref name=\":3\">Ross p. 254</ref> Specifically, the \"correct standard, as reiterated by the Court\u2014which was never discussed by the Sixth Circuit\u2014is whether the right was sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood what he or she is doing violates that right.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAdditionally, Ross wrote that police are also reminded of the Court's principles regarding the use of deadly force in accordance with ''Graham'', especially as it pertains to fleeing motorists. Specifically, Ross wrote, \"Whether force appears reasonable is measured from the perspective of the officer at the moment the officer decided to use it.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Ross also emphasized the implications of the Court's analysis over the number of rounds fired. Ross commented that police officers \"are not trained or required to shoot to wound, nor are they trained to shoot warning shots prior to responding with deadly force.\"<ref name=\":4\">Ross, p. 255</ref> According to Ross, \"Justice Alito confirmed the fact officers are trained to keep shooting until the threat is stopped ...\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Finally, Ross wrote, \"Police administrators are encouraged to review and revise their current use of force and pursuit policies consistent with this decision.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Ross recommended that \"administrators should provide training to their officers on use of force legal issues and principles that emerge from ''Rickard'', ''Graham'', ''Scott'', and ''Brosseau''\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Reactions and criticism ===\n\n[[Erwin Chemerinsky]], the dean of the [[University of California, Irvine School of Law]], wrote an opinion piece published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', in which he described the Court's decision as \"deeply disturbing\", arguing that there are alternatives to shooting at fleeing vehicles and that the Court has \"weakened accountability by ruling that a local government can be held liable only if it is proved that the city\u2019s or county\u2019s own policy violated the Constitution\".<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news |last1=Chemerinsky |first1=Erwin |title=Opinion {{!}} How the Supreme Court Protects Bad Cops |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/opinion/how-the-supreme-court-protects-bad-cops.html |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times |date=26 August 2014 |page=A23}}</ref> In the article, Chemerinsky also opposed the doctrine of qualified immunity, arguing that it poses an unreasonable burden for individuals alleging violations of constitutional rights.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\nIn a blog post published in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Jonathan R. Nash, a professor of law at [[Emory University School of Law]], argued that the Court's decision in ''Plumhoff'' was inconsistent with the precedent it set in ''Scott'', commenting that the Court \"jettisoned ''Scott''<nowiki/>'s careful balancing in favor of an approach designed to give the police substantial leeway in terminating chases\".<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|title=High-speed police pursuits and deadly force|last=Nash|first=Jonathan R.|date=August 19, 2014|website=The Hill|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414175726/https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/the-judiciary/215291-high-speed-police-pursuits-and-deadly-force|archive-date=April 14, 2018|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> Nash stated there were differences between the facts in ''Plumhoff'' versus the facts in ''Scott'', which he felt should have compelled the Court to a different conclusion. For example, in ''Scott'', the police used a maneuver that caused the driver to spin out of control, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', the police used their firearms. Additionally, in ''Scott'', the driver was the only one in the fleeing car, whereas in ''Plumhoff'', Rickard had a passenger.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n; Sources\n* ''Plumhoff v.

Cherry III]] and starring [[Jim Varney]]. This is the first film to feature [[Gailard Sartain]]'s character, Chuck along with [[Bill Byrge]] as his brother, Bobby. They made their first appearance in the television series ''[[Hey Vern, It's Ernest!]]'', which was in production at the same time as this film. ''Ernest Saves Christmas'' is the third film to feature Varney's character [[Ernest P. Worrell]], and chronicles Ernest's attempt to help find a replacement for an aging [[Santa Claus]].\n\n==Plot==\nA man claiming to be [[Santa Claus]] arrives in [[Orlando, Florida]], where [[Ernest P. Worrell]] is working as a [[taxicab]] driver. He picks up Santa, who tells Ernest that he is on his way to inform a local celebrity named Joe Carruthers that he has been chosen to be the new Santa Claus. Joe hosts a local children's program with emphasis on manners and integrity.\n\nWhile they are driving, a runaway teenage girl who says she is named Harmony Starr joins Ernest and Santa in the taxicab. When they get to their destination, Santa possesses no legal currency (only play money), so in his giving Christmas spirit, Ernest lets him ride for free. The decision gets Ernest fired from his job. Ernest later discovers that Santa left his magic sack in the taxicab, and Ernest begins a quest to find the old man and return it to him.\n\nAt the Orlando Children's Museum, Santa tries talking to Joe, but is rudely interrupted and rebuffed by Joe's [[talent agent|agent]] Marty Brock. Santa begins to worry when he discovers his sack is missing, and becomes more discouraged because of his increasing forgetfulness, a result of being 151 years old. Santa tries to explain his predicament, but Joe does not believe him and Marty has Santa arrested. Ernest poses as an employee of the governor with Harmony as the governor's niece, and the two help Santa escape from jail by convincing the police chief that Santa must be taken to an insane asylum. Santa explains to Ernest and Harmony that he was handed down the job of Santa Claus in 1889 and has enjoyed it ever since, but the magic grows weaker over time. The only way to restore its full strength is to pass it on to someone else which is why he must find Joe and make him the new Santa Claus by 7 pm. Ernest disguises himself as a snake rancher so he can sneak Santa into a movie studio. Marty presses Joe to quit his children's job and instead land a part in a horror film titled ''Christmas Slay'', about an alien which terrorizes children on Christmas Eve, a concept that offends Santa so deeply he punches the director.\n\nMeanwhile, while all these events are taking place, two holding dock workers receive several large crates marked for release to \"Helper Elves\".  The two dock workers argue over the shipping papers and the contents of the crates.  The crates are revealed to contain flying reindeer.  The dock workers seek help from the local animal control services only to be told that there is nothing animal control can do to help when they arrive and are shocked to see the reindeer walking on the ceiling of the warehouse.   \n\nSanta later tracks down Joe at his home. He explains about passing the position of Santa Claus over to him because otherwise the magic will eventually die. Santa also explains that from Orlando, Joe must leave to deliver the presents by 7 pm; if he leaves any later, he will run into daylight before he finishes. Joe declines, but later is overcome by conscience when the film director wants him to use foul language, which he refuses to say in front of the children on the set.\n\nErnest and Harmony (whose real name is later revealed by Santa to be Pamela Trenton) discover the magic power of Santa's sack, and Pamela starts to abuse it. She steals the sack, and attempts to run away again. However, on Christmas Eve, her conscience prevails, and she rushes back to find Ernest and Santa and return the sack. Ernest meets Santa's elves at the airport and they retrieve the reindeer from the dock workers and Santa's sleigh from the holding dock. Because they are short on time, Ernest decides to fly the sleigh to the children's museum, much to the helpers' objection. Having trouble controlling it at first, the reindeer and the sleigh fly all over the sky. At a meeting, Joe sees the reindeer and sleigh flying and it convinces him that everything Santa told him is real. Joe turns down the acting job and leaves to find Santa.\n\nJoe finds Santa at 6:57 pm at the children's museum and tells Santa that he wants the job. Very pleased, Santa transforms Joe into the new Santa Claus. The new Santa uses his new magic to make it snow in Orlando. Ernest and the helpers arrive at the museum at 6:58. Pamela has called her mother and has decided to come home. The new Santa decides to have Pamela be his special helper and then take her to her home, and allows Ernest to be the sleigh driver for the night. The old Santa resumes his former identity, Seth Applegate, and spends Christmas Eve with an elderly museum employee named Mary Morrissey. The new Santa takes off at 7 pm to deliver the gifts.\n\nAn ending scene shows the two holding dock workers receiving a large crate with shipping papers marked \"E. Bunny\" and arguing over the name spelling when two large rabbit ears suddenly burst through the top of the crate just before the film credits begin to roll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Ernest P.

Marty presses Joe to quit his children's job and instead land a part in a horror film titled ''Christmas Slay'', about an alien which terrorizes children on Christmas Eve, a concept that offends Santa so deeply he punches the director.\n\nMeanwhile, while all these events are taking place, two holding dock workers receive several large crates marked for release to \"Helper Elves\".  The two dock workers argue over the shipping papers and the contents of the crates.  The crates are revealed to contain flying reindeer.  The dock workers seek help from the local animal control services only to be told that there is nothing animal control can do to help when they arrive and are shocked to see the reindeer walking on the ceiling of the warehouse.   \n\nSanta later tracks down Joe at his home. He explains about passing the position of Santa Claus over to him because otherwise the magic will eventually die. Santa also explains that from Orlando, Joe must leave to deliver the presents by 7 pm; if he leaves any later, he will run into daylight before he finishes. Joe declines, but later is overcome by conscience when the film director wants him to use foul language, which he refuses to say in front of the children on the set.\n\nErnest and Harmony (whose real name is later revealed by Santa to be Pamela Trenton) discover the magic power of Santa's sack, and Pamela starts to abuse it. She steals the sack, and attempts to run away again. However, on Christmas Eve, her conscience prevails, and she rushes back to find Ernest and Santa and return the sack. Ernest meets Santa's elves at the airport and they retrieve the reindeer from the dock workers and Santa's sleigh from the holding dock. Because they are short on time, Ernest decides to fly the sleigh to the children's museum, much to the helpers' objection. Having trouble controlling it at first, the reindeer and the sleigh fly all over the sky. At a meeting, Joe sees the reindeer and sleigh flying and it convinces him that everything Santa told him is real. Joe turns down the acting job and leaves to find Santa.\n\nJoe finds Santa at 6:57 pm at the children's museum and tells Santa that he wants the job. Very pleased, Santa transforms Joe into the new Santa Claus. The new Santa uses his new magic to make it snow in Orlando. Ernest and the helpers arrive at the museum at 6:58. Pamela has called her mother and has decided to come home. The new Santa decides to have Pamela be his special helper and then take her to her home, and allows Ernest to be the sleigh driver for the night. The old Santa resumes his former identity, Seth Applegate, and spends Christmas Eve with an elderly museum employee named Mary Morrissey. The new Santa takes off at 7 pm to deliver the gifts.\n\nAn ending scene shows the two holding dock workers receiving a large crate with shipping papers marked \"E. Bunny\" and arguing over the name spelling when two large rabbit ears suddenly burst through the top of the crate just before the film credits begin to roll.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jim Varney]] as [[Ernest P.

In consequence of some conversation with Dr. Rush, in the year 1798-99, I had promised some day to write him a letter giving him my view of the Christian system.  I have reflected often on it since, and even sketched the outlines in my own mind.  I should first take a general view of the moral doctrines of the most remarkable of the ancient philosophers, of whose ethics we have sufficient information to make an estimate, say [[Pythagoras]], [[Epicurus]], [[Epictetus]], [[Socrates]], Cicero, [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Antoninus (philosopher)|Antoninus]].  I should do justice to the branches of morality they have treated well; but point out the importance of those in which they are deficient.  I should then take a view of the deism and ethics of the Jews, and show in what a degraded state they were, and the necessity they presented of a reformation.  '''I should proceed to a view of the life, character, and doctrines of Jesus, who sensible of incorrectness of their ideas of the Deity, and of morality, endeavored to bring them to the principles of a pure deism, and juster notions of the attributes of God, to reform their moral doctrines to the standard of reason, justice and philanthropy, and to inculcate the belief of a future state.  This view would purposely omit the question of his divinity, and even his inspiration.  To do him justice, it would be necessary to remark the disadvantages his doctrines had to encounter, not having been committed to writing by himself, but by the most unlettered of men, by memory, long after they had heard them from him; when much was forgotten, much misunderstood, and presented in every paradoxical shape.'''  Yet such are the fragments remaining as to show a master workman, and that his system of morality was the most benevolent and sublime probably that has been ever taught, and consequently more perfect than those of any of the ancient philosophers.  His character and doctrines have received still greater injury from those who pretend to be his special disciples, and who have disfigured and sophisticated his actions and precepts, from views of personal interest, so as to induce the unthinking part of mankind to throw off the whole system in disgust, and to pass sentence as an impostor on the most innocent, the most benevolent, the most eloquent and sublime character that ever has been exhibited to man ...}}\n</ref>\nHe expressed similar ideas in an 1817 letter to John Adams.<ref name=1817Adams>\n{{Cite book |url=http://www.constitution.org/tj/jeff15.txt |work=The Writings of Thomas Jefferson |editor=Albert Ellery Bergh |publisher=The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association, & A.A.

The Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist churches did not receive tax support. As Jefferson wrote in his ''Notes on Virginia'', pre-Revolutionary colonial law held that \"if a person brought up a Christian denies the being of a God, or the Trinity ... he is punishable on the first offense by incapacity to hold any office.\"<ref>Jefferson, Thomas.

Its goal was complete separation of church and state; it declared the opinions of men to be beyond the jurisdiction of the civil magistrate. He asserted that the mind is not subject to coercion, \"that our civil rights have no dependence on religious opinions,\" and that the opinions of men are not the concern of civil government.  Over time, this became one of the American charters of freedom.<ref>Qtd. in [[Gordon S. Wood|Wood]], ''The American Revolution'', p. 130.</ref>  This elevated declaration of the freedom of the mind was hailed in Europe as \"an example of legislative wisdom and liberality never before known.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fPQfNx2TQLAC&pg=RA1-PA45&lpg=RA1-PA45&dq=%22an+example+of+legislative+wisdom+and+liberality+ |first=Richard |last=Price |date=July 26, 1786 |title=''The Correspondence of Richard Price''.

In 1786, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed Jefferson's [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|''Bill for Religious Freedom'']], which he had first submitted in 1779. It was one of only three accomplishments he put in his epitaph. The law read: <blockquote>\"No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\"<ref>Merrill D. Peterson, ed., ''Thomas Jefferson: Writings'' (1984), p. 347</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his 1787 ''Notes on the State of Virginia'', Jefferson stated: <blockquote>\"Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth. ... Our sister states of Pennsylvania and New York, however, have long subsisted without any establishment at all. The experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has answered beyond conception. They flourish infinitely. Religion is well supported; of various kinds, indeed, but all good enough; all sufficient to preserve peace and order: or if a sect arises, whose tenets would subvert morals, good sense has fair play, and reasons and laughs it out of doors, without suffering the state to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more disturbed with religious dissensions. On the contrary, their harmony is unparalleled, and can be ascribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, because there is no other circumstance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy discovery, that the way to silence religious disputes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of those tyrannical laws.\"<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwedo/k12/psd/colony/tjnotes.htm |title=Notes on the State of Virginia |access-date=2008-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103010939/http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwedo/k12/psd/colony/tjnotes.htm |archive-date=2009-01-03 |url-status=dead }}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Accusations of being an infidel ==\nDuring the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential campaign]], the ''New England Palladium'' wrote, \"Should the infidel Jefferson be elected to the Presidency, the seal of death is that moment set on our holy religion, our churches will be prostrated, and some infamous 'prostitute', under the title of [[Cult of Reason|goddess of reason]], will preside in the sanctuaries now devoted to the worship of the most High.\"<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.trivia-library.com/b/u-s-president-thomas-jefferson-quotes-about-jefferson.htm |title=New England Palladium, 1800 remarks about Jefferson |year=1800 |accessdate=2008-12-31}}\n</ref>\n[[Federalist]]s attacked Jefferson as a \"howling atheist\" and [[infidel]], claiming that his attraction to the religious and political extremism of the [[French Revolution]] disqualified him from public office.<ref>\n{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/godless_kra_1996_00_7218 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/godless_kra_1996_00_7218/page/91 91] |quote=jefferson atheist test. |title=The Godless Constitution: The Case against Religious Correctness |author= Isaac Kramnick, and Robert Laurence Moore |publisher=W.

It was an accusation commonly levelled at Deists, although they believe in a deity. It was also directed at those thought to be harming the Christian faith in which they were raised.\n\nWhile opposed to the institutions of organized religion, Jefferson consistently expressed his belief in God. For example, he invoked the notion of divine justice in 1782 in his opposition to slavery,<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/jefferson/ch18.html |title=Notes on the State of Virginia, Q.XVIII |year=1782 |quote=This is so true, that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour.

That they are not to be violated but with his wrath?

In a 1787 letter to his nephew and ward, Peter Carr, who was at school, Jefferson offered the following advice:\n\n{{quote|Fix Reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion.

Jefferson's phrase has been cited several times by the Supreme Court in its interpretation of the [[Establishment Clause]], including in cases such as ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' (1878), ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (1947), and ''[[McCollum v.

In an 1822 letter to [[Benjamin Waterhouse]] he wrote, \"I rejoice that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief, which has surrendered its conscience to neither kings or priests, the genuine doctrine of only one God is reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die a Unitarian.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/lit/jeff17.htm |title=1822 Letter to Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse |date=June 26, 1822}} (meaning, at least, that they would not be \"a Trinitarian\")</ref>\n\nJefferson named the teachings of both [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Conyers Middleton]] (an English clergyman who questioned miracles and revelation, emphasizing Christianity's role as a mainstay of social order) as the basis for his own faith.

When we shall have done away the incomprehensible jargon of the Trinitarian arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three; when we shall have knocked down the artificial scaffolding, reared to mask from view the simple structure of Jesus; when, in short, we shall have unlearned everything which has been taught since His day, and got back to the pure and simple doctrines He inculcated, we shall then be truly and worthily His disciples; and my opinion is that if nothing had ever been added to what flowed purely from His lips, the whole world would at this day have been Christian. I know that the case you cite, of Dr. Drake, has been a common one. The religion-builders have so distorted and deformed the doctrines of Jesus, so muffled them in mysticisms, fancies and falsehoods, have caricatured them into forms so monstrous and inconceivable, as to shock reasonable thinkers, to revolt them against the whole, and drive them rashly to pronounce its Founder an impostor.

In consequence of some conversation with Dr. Rush, in the year 1798-99, I had promised some day to write him a letter giving him my view of the Christian system.  I have reflected often on it since, and even sketched the outlines in my own mind.  I should first take a general view of the moral doctrines of the most remarkable of the ancient philosophers, of whose ethics we have sufficient information to make an estimate, say [[Pythagoras]], [[Epicurus]], [[Epictetus]], [[Socrates]], Cicero, [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Antoninus (philosopher)|Antoninus]].  I should do justice to the branches of morality they have treated well; but point out the importance of those in which they are deficient.  I should then take a view of the deism and ethics of the Jews, and show in what a degraded state they were, and the necessity they presented of a reformation.  '''I should proceed to a view of the life, character, and doctrines of Jesus, who sensible of incorrectness of their ideas of the Deity, and of morality, endeavored to bring them to the principles of a pure deism, and juster notions of the attributes of God, to reform their moral doctrines to the standard of reason, justice and philanthropy, and to inculcate the belief of a future state.  This view would purposely omit the question of his divinity, and even his inspiration.  To do him justice, it would be necessary to remark the disadvantages his doctrines had to encounter, not having been committed to writing by himself, but by the most unlettered of men, by memory, long after they had heard them from him; when much was forgotten, much misunderstood, and presented in every paradoxical shape.'''  Yet such are the fragments remaining as to show a master workman, and that his system of morality was the most benevolent and sublime probably that has been ever taught, and consequently more perfect than those of any of the ancient philosophers.  His character and doctrines have received still greater injury from those who pretend to be his special disciples, and who have disfigured and sophisticated his actions and precepts, from views of personal interest, so as to induce the unthinking part of mankind to throw off the whole system in disgust, and to pass sentence as an impostor on the most innocent, the most benevolent, the most eloquent and sublime character that ever has been exhibited to man ...}}\n</ref>\nHe expressed similar ideas in an 1817 letter to John Adams.<ref name=1817Adams>\n{{Cite book |url=http://www.constitution.org/tj/jeff15.txt |work=The Writings of Thomas Jefferson |editor=Albert Ellery Bergh |publisher=The Thomas Jefferson Memorial Association, & A.A.

But if the moral precepts, innate in man, and made a part of his physical constitution, as necessary for a social being, '''if the sublime doctrines of philanthropism and deism taught us by Jesus of Nazareth,''' in which all agree, constitute true religion, then, without it, this would be, as you again say, 'something not fit to be named even, indeed, a hell'.}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter to Adams dated August 22, 1813, Jefferson wrote that:<ref name=deistrevealed />\n\n{{quote|You are right in supposing, in one of yours, that I had not read much of Priestley's Predestination, his No-soul system, or his controversy with Horsley. but I have read his Corruptions of Christianity, & Early opinions of Jesus, over and over again; and I rest on them, and on Middleton's writings, especially his letters from Rome, and to Waterland, as the basis of my own faith. these writings have never been answered, nor can be answered, by quoting historical proofs, as they have done. for these facts therefore I cling to their learning, so much superior to my own.}}\n\n== Disestablishment of religion in Virginia ==<!-- this section deals only with TJ's efforts to ensure religion was disestablished in VA.

The inscription, as he stipulated, reads ''Here was buried Thomas Jefferson, author of the [[Declaration of American Independence]], of the Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom, and father of the [[University of Virginia]].'']]\nFor Jefferson, [[separation of church and state]] was a necessary reform of the religious tyranny whereby a religion received state endorsement, and those not of that religion were denied rights, and even punished.\n\nFollowing the Revolution, Jefferson played a leading role in the disestablishment of religion in Virginia. Previously as the established state church, the Anglican Church received tax support and no one could hold office who was not an Anglican. The Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist churches did not receive tax support. As Jefferson wrote in his ''Notes on Virginia'', pre-Revolutionary colonial law held that \"if a person brought up a Christian denies the being of a God, or the Trinity ... he is punishable on the first offense by incapacity to hold any office.\"<ref>Jefferson, Thomas.

Its goal was complete separation of church and state; it declared the opinions of men to be beyond the jurisdiction of the civil magistrate. He asserted that the mind is not subject to coercion, \"that our civil rights have no dependence on religious opinions,\" and that the opinions of men are not the concern of civil government.  Over time, this became one of the American charters of freedom.<ref>Qtd. in [[Gordon S. Wood|Wood]], ''The American Revolution'', p. 130.</ref>  This elevated declaration of the freedom of the mind was hailed in Europe as \"an example of legislative wisdom and liberality never before known.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fPQfNx2TQLAC&pg=RA1-PA45&lpg=RA1-PA45&dq=%22an+example+of+legislative+wisdom+and+liberality+ |first=Richard |last=Price |date=July 26, 1786 |title=''The Correspondence of Richard Price''.

In 1786, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed Jefferson's [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|''Bill for Religious Freedom'']], which he had first submitted in 1779. It was one of only three accomplishments he put in his epitaph. The law read: <blockquote>\"No man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained, molested, or burdened in his body or goods, nor shall otherwise suffer, on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\"<ref>Merrill D. Peterson, ed., ''Thomas Jefferson: Writings'' (1984), p. 347</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn his 1787 ''Notes on the State of Virginia'', Jefferson stated: <blockquote>\"Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth. ... Our sister states of Pennsylvania and New York, however, have long subsisted without any establishment at all. The experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has answered beyond conception. They flourish infinitely. Religion is well supported; of various kinds, indeed, but all good enough; all sufficient to preserve peace and order: or if a sect arises, whose tenets would subvert morals, good sense has fair play, and reasons and laughs it out of doors, without suffering the state to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more disturbed with religious dissensions. On the contrary, their harmony is unparalleled, and can be ascribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, because there is no other circumstance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy discovery, that the way to silence religious disputes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of those tyrannical laws.\"<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwedo/k12/psd/colony/tjnotes.htm |title=Notes on the State of Virginia |access-date=2008-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103010939/http://www.lva.lib.va.us/whatwedo/k12/psd/colony/tjnotes.htm |archive-date=2009-01-03 |url-status=dead }}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Accusations of being an infidel ==\nDuring the [[1800 United States presidential election|1800 presidential campaign]], the ''New England Palladium'' wrote, \"Should the infidel Jefferson be elected to the Presidency, the seal of death is that moment set on our holy religion, our churches will be prostrated, and some infamous 'prostitute', under the title of [[Cult of Reason|goddess of reason]], will preside in the sanctuaries now devoted to the worship of the most High.\"<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.trivia-library.com/b/u-s-president-thomas-jefferson-quotes-about-jefferson.htm |title=New England Palladium, 1800 remarks about Jefferson |year=1800 |accessdate=2008-12-31}}\n</ref>\n[[Federalist]]s attacked Jefferson as a \"howling atheist\" and [[infidel]], claiming that his attraction to the religious and political extremism of the [[French Revolution]] disqualified him from public office.<ref>\n{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/godless_kra_1996_00_7218 |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/godless_kra_1996_00_7218/page/91 91] |quote=jefferson atheist test. |title=The Godless Constitution: The Case against Religious Correctness |author= Isaac Kramnick, and Robert Laurence Moore |publisher=W.

It was an accusation commonly levelled at Deists, although they believe in a deity. It was also directed at those thought to be harming the Christian faith in which they were raised.\n\nWhile opposed to the institutions of organized religion, Jefferson consistently expressed his belief in God. For example, he invoked the notion of divine justice in 1782 in his opposition to slavery,<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/jefferson/ch18.html |title=Notes on the State of Virginia, Q.XVIII |year=1782 |quote=This is so true, that of the proprietors of slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labour.  And can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are of the gift of God?  That they are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that his justice can not sleep forever: that considering numbers, nature and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange of situation is among possible events: that it may become probable by supernatural interference!\"}}</ref> and invoked divine Providence in his second inaugural address.<ref>\n[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres17.html \"Jefferson's Second Inaugural Address\"], Bartleby Quotes</ref>\n\nJefferson did not shrink from questioning the existence of God. In a 1787 letter to his nephew and ward, Peter Carr, who was at school, Jefferson offered the following advice:\n\n{{quote|Fix Reason firmly in her seat, and call to her tribunal every fact, every opinion.

Jefferson's phrase has been cited several times by the Supreme Court in its interpretation of the [[Establishment Clause]], including in cases such as ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'' (1878), ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]'' (1947), and ''[[McCollum v. Board of Education]]'' (1948).\n\nIn an 1802 letter to the [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] [[Baptist]] Association, he wrote:\n\n{{quote|Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\", thus building a [[Separation of church and state in the United States|wall of separation]] between church and State.<ref>[[Wikisource:Letter to the Danbury Baptists - January 1, 1802]], January 1, 1802</ref>}}\n\nIn Jefferson's March 4, 1805, Drafts of Address of Second Inaugural he stated:\n\n{{quote|In matters of religion, I have considered that its free exercise is placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the general government.

In an 1822 letter to [[Benjamin Waterhouse]] he wrote, \"I rejoice that in this blessed country of free inquiry and belief, which has surrendered its conscience to neither kings or priests, the genuine doctrine of only one God is reviving, and I trust that there is not a young man now living in the United States who will not die a Unitarian.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/lit/jeff17.htm |title=1822 Letter to Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse |date=June 26, 1822}} (meaning, at least, that they would not be \"a Trinitarian\")</ref>\n\nJefferson named the teachings of both [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Conyers Middleton]] (an English clergyman who questioned miracles and revelation, emphasizing Christianity's role as a mainstay of social order) as the basis for his own faith. He became friends with Priestley, who lived in Philadelphia. In a letter to John Adams dated August 22, 1813, Jefferson wrote,\n\n{{quote|You are right in supposing, in one of yours, that I had not read much of Priestley's ''Predestination'', his no-soul system, or his controversy with Horsley. But I have read his [[An History of the Corruptions of Christianity|''Corruptions of Christianity'']], and ''Early Opinions of Jesus'', over and over again; and I rest on them, and on Middleton's writings, especially his ''Letters from Rome'', and ''To Waterland'', as the basis of my own faith. These writings have never been answered, nor can be answered by quoting historical proofs, as they have done. For these facts, therefore, I cling to their learning, so much superior to my own.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=807&chapter=88112&layout=html&Itemid=27 |title=letter in reply to John Adams |location=Monticello |date=August 22, 1813 |accessdate=2011-02-22}} Note: [[Conyers Middleton]]'s name is often omitted when this quote is cited; thereby leading to the inference that Jefferson is relying solely upon Priestley. Middleton defended Deist [[Matthew Tindal]]'s ''Christianity as Old as the Creation'' against attacks by [[Daniel Waterland]].</ref>}}\n\nJefferson continued to express his strong objections to the doctrines of the virgin birth, the divinity of Jesus, and the Trinity. In a letter to Adams (April 11, 1823), Jefferson wrote, \"And the day will come, when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the Supreme Being as His Father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of [[Minerva]] in the brain of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNIcAQAAIAAJ&lpg=PA284&pg=PA284#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Letter to John Adams |location=Monticello |date=April 1823 |accessdate=2012-05-28|last1=Jefferson |first1=Thomas }}</ref>\n\nIn an 1821 letter he wrote:\n\n{{quote|No one sees with greater pleasure than myself the progress of reason in its advances towards rational Christianity. When we shall have done away the incomprehensible jargon of the Trinitarian arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three; when we shall have knocked down the artificial scaffolding, reared to mask from view the simple structure of Jesus; when, in short, we shall have unlearned everything which has been taught since His day, and got back to the pure and simple doctrines He inculcated, we shall then be truly and worthily His disciples; and my opinion is that if nothing had ever been added to what flowed purely from His lips, the whole world would at this day have been Christian. I know that the case you cite, of Dr. Drake, has been a common one. The religion-builders have so distorted and deformed the doctrines of Jesus, so muffled them in mysticisms, fancies and falsehoods, have caricatured them into forms so monstrous and inconceivable, as to shock reasonable thinkers, to revolt them against the whole, and drive them rashly to pronounce its Founder an impostor. Had there never been a commentator, there never would have been an infidel. ... I have little doubt that the whole of our country will soon be rallied to the unity of the Creator, and, I hope, to the pure doctrines of Jesus also.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNIcAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Letter to Timothy Pickering, Esq. |location=Monticello |date=February 27, 1821 |accessdate=2010-01-18|last1=Jefferson |first1=Thomas }}</ref>}}\n\nJefferson once wrote to the minister of the First Parish Church (Unitarian) in Portland, Maine, asking for services for him and a small group of friends. The church responded that it did not have clergy to send to the South. In an 1825 letter to Waterhouse, Jefferson wrote,\n\n<blockquote>I am anxious to see the doctrine of one god commenced in our state. But the population of my neighborhood is too slender, and is too much divided into other sects to maintain any one preacher well. I must therefore be contented to be an Unitarian by myself, altho I know there are many around me who would become so, if once they could hear the questions fairly stated.<ref name=1825water>{{cite web |url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaead/published/uva-sc/viu01679.document |author=Thomas Jefferson |title=letter to Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse|date=January 8, 1825}} The copy of this 1825 Thomas Jefferson letter to Waterhouse (1754\u20131846) is in an unknown hand.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen followers of [[Richard Price]] and Priestley began debating over the existence of free-will and the soul (Priestley had taken the materialist position),<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/priestly.htm |title=Joseph Priestley |year=2008 |encyclopedia=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |first=Elizabeth |last=Kingston |accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref> Jefferson expressed reservations that Unitarians were finding it important to dispute doctrine with one another.

How much wiser are the Quakers, who, agreeing in the fundamental doctrines of the gospel, schismatize about no mysteries, and, keeping within the pale of common sense, suffer no speculative differences of opinion, any more than of feature, to impair the love of their brethren.}}</ref>\n\nIn Jefferson's time, Unitarianism was generally considered a branch of Christianity. Originally it questioned the [[doctrine of the Trinity]] and the [[pre-existence of Christ]]. During the period 1800\u20131850, Unitarianism began also to question the existence of [[miracles]], the [[inspiration of Scripture]], and the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]], though not yet the [[resurrection of Jesus]].<ref>R. K. Webb, \"Miracles in English Unitarian Thought\", in Mark S. Micale, Robert L. Dietle, Peter Gay, editors, ''Enlightenment, Passion, Modernity: Historical Essays in European Thought and Culture'', 2000</ref> Contemporary Unitarianism no longer implies belief in a deity; some Unitarians are theists and some are not. Modern Unitarians consider Jefferson both a kindred spirit and an important figure in their history.

He never joined a Unitarian congregation: there were none near his home in Virginia during his lifetime. He regularly attended Joseph Priestley's Pennsylvania church when he was nearby, and said that Priestley's theology was his own, and there is no doubt Priestley should be identified as Unitarian. Jefferson remained a member of the Episcopal congregation near his home, but removed himself from those available to become godparents, because he was not sufficiently in agreement with the Trinitarian theology.

After [[Jochen Rindt]] was killed at the [[1970 Italian Grand Prix]], the Brazilian became Lotus's lead driver in only his fifth Grand Prix. He enjoyed considerable success with Lotus, winning the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]] in [[1972 Formula One season|1972]] at the age of 25, a youngest F1 world champion record that he held for 33 years. He later moved to [[McLaren]] for [[1974 Formula One season|1974]], winning the title once again. He surprised the paddock by moving to his brother's [[Fittipaldi Automotive]] team prior to the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 season]], being replaced by [[James Hunt]]. Success eluded him during his final years in Formula One, with the Fittipaldi cars not competitive enough to fight for victories. Fittipaldi took two more podium finishes, before retiring in [[1980 Formula One season|1980]].\n\nFollowing his Formula One career, Fittipaldi moved to the American [[Champ Car|CART]] series, achieving successful results, including the [[1989 CART PPG Indy Car World Series|1989 CART title]] and two wins at the [[Indianapolis 500]] (in [[1989 Indianapolis 500|1989]] and [[1993 Indianapolis 500|1993]], the final at an unprecedented 46 years old).\n\nSince his retirement from [[Indy Car]] racing in [[1996 PPG Indy Car World Series|1996]], Fittipaldi races only occasionally. In 2008, he was one of only three people in history to have a Corvette production car named in his honor. At age 67, he entered the [[2014 6 Hours of S\u00e3o Paulo]].\n\n==Early and personal life==\nEmerson Fittipaldi was born in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]].

In his second season in single-seaters, Fittipaldi won the Brazilian Formula Vee title at age 21. He left for Europe in 1969, with the ambition to convince team owners of his talent in three months. After some podiums and his first victories in [[Formula Ford]], Fittipaldi was first trained and then subsequently engaged by the Jim Russell Driving School [[Formula Three]] team. He won nine F3 races on the Jim Russell [[Lotus 59]] in the MCD Lombard Championship to become the 1969 champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/emerson-fittipaldi|title=Emerson Fittipaldi|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Formula Two===\nFor [[1970 European Formula Two season|1970]], Fittipaldi moved up to F2 by joining the Lotus semi-works Team Bardahl campaigning [[Lotus 59|Lotus 59B]]. With six finishes in the points and four on the podium, he ended the eight-race season in third place behind [[Clay Regazzoni]] and [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]]. While this result was very impressive for the newcomer to the series, the spotlight was on Fittipaldi that year because of his activities in Formula One instead.\n\n===Formula One===\nBased on the success of [[Cosworth DFV]] and [[Lotus 49]]/[[Lotus 49B|49B]] in 1968, [[Team Lotus]] was enjoying the reputation as one of the top F1 teams with the inflow of sponsorship money, and [[Colin Chapman]] used the third seat on the team for championship races as the testing ground for younger drivers. This was in contrast to the team's tradition to use non-championship F1 events for the purpose.\n\nThe third seat was given to [[Alex Soler-Roig]] in the early 1970, and then to Fittipaldi starting with the [[1970 British Grand Prix|British GP]] in July, with [[Jochen Rindt]] and [[John Miles (auto racer)|John Miles]] as the regular seat holders. Fittipaldi scored a fourth place as the No. 3 driver at the next [[1970 German Grand Prix|German GP]] where the No. 1 Jochen Rindt won, and the No. 2 John Miles retired.\n\n[[Team Lotus]] plans for the season drastically changed when Jochen Rindt was killed at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in September and became the only driver to win the championship posthumously. John Miles also left the team, and Fittipaldi was promoted to be the Lotus No. 1 driver on his fifth F1 race at the [[1970 United States Grand Prix|United States GP]] with [[Reine Wisell]] and [[Pete Lovely]] as the teammates. Fittipaldi proved up to the task and won this first post-Rindt race for Lotus.\n\nIn his first full year as Lotus's lead driver in 1971, Fittipaldi finished sixth in the Drivers' Championship as the team further developed the previous season's [[Lotus 72]]. Armed with what was arguably the greatest Formula one design of all time, the Lotus 72D, Fittipaldi proved dominant in 1972 as he won five of 11 races and claimed the F1 Drivers' Championship.\n\nAt 25 he was then the [[List of Formula One driver records#Youngest world Drivers' Championship winners|youngest champion]] in F1 history. It appeared he might do it again in 1973. But after three wins in four attempts with the 72D, he began to struggle in the new 72E that was unveiled mid-year. It resulted in the reverse of the previous year, with Stewart beating Fittipaldi for the Drivers' Championship.\n\nFittipaldi left Lotus to sign with the promising [[Team McLaren|McLaren]] team. Driving the highly efficient [[McLaren M23]], he had three victories in 1974, reached the podium four other times, and beat out [[Clay Regazzoni]] in a close battle for his second championship. The following season, he notched two more victories and four other podiums, but was second to a dominant [[Niki Lauda]]. However, at the height of his F1 success, Fittipaldi shocked everyone by leaving McLaren to race for older brother [[Wilson Fittipaldi J\u00fanior|Wilson Fittipaldi]]'s [[Copersucar]]-sponsored [[Fittipaldi Automotive]] team.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nHe remained with the team for five seasons but only managed a best finish of second. Fittipaldi decided to retire from racing at the end of 1980.

The 38-year-old spent his first season acclimatising to IndyCars, driving for two teams before joining [[Patrick Racing]] as an injury replacement. He stayed five years with the team, recording six victories and solid finishes in the overall standings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/emerson-fittipaldi|title=Emerson Fittipaldi|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989 he had five wins and finished in the top five in every race he completed, giving him a CART championship. Among his wins was a dominant performance in the [[1989 Indianapolis 500]] where he led 158 of 200 laps and won by two laps, but only after a dramatic duel with [[Al Unser, Jr.]] in the closing laps of the race. Unser ran down Fittipaldi after a late-race restart and passed him for the lead on lap 196. Three laps later, Fittipaldi used lapped traffic to his advantage to pull alongside Unser on the backstretch. Neither driver would give way, and the two cars touched wheels as they went through turn three side by side. Unser's car spun out of control to hit the outside wall, while Fittipaldi was able to maintain sufficient control to keep his car moving straight. In spite of the altercation, Unser saluted Fittipaldi from the infield as Fittipaldi passed by on the final lap.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/29/sports/fittipaldi-wins-indy-500-after-collision-with-unser.html/|title=Fittipaldi Wins Indy 500 After Collision With Unser|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 May 1989|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:fittipaldi indy.jpg|thumb|right|Emerson Fittipaldi racing in the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1994 ]]\n[[Roger Penske]] hired Fittipaldi for his [[Penske Racing|racing team]] in 1990 and he continued to be among the top drivers in CART, winning at least one race with Penske for six straight years.

He was only the second driver to not drink milk at Indianapolis since the tradition was founded in 1936 (and firmly established in 1956). Fittipaldi owned several orange groves in his native Brazil, and wanted to promote the citrus industry. Fan reaction was negative to the break in tradition despite the fact that Fittipaldi chased the juice with milk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.usatoday.com/2016/05/25/four-days-to-the-100th-indy-500-emerson-fittipaldi-and-the-orange-juice/|title=Four days to the 100th Indianapolis 500: Emerson Fittipaldi and the Orange Juice|work=[[USA Today]]|date=25 May 2016|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> As a result of drinking the juice, Fittipaldi forfeited $5,000 from the winner's purse and publicly apologized to the American Dairy Association.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/06/03/Auto-Racing-Notebook/4794739080000/|title=Auto Racing Notebook|work=UPI Archives|date=3 June 1993|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFan reaction to the milk snub was highly negative, and he was booed a week later at [[ABC Supply Company A.J. Foyt 225|Milwaukee]], a center of the American dairy industry. In the years that followed, many fans continued to hold the action against him. In interviews since, Fittipaldi explained his action, and apologised for the wave of negativity that followed. Fittipaldi returned to Indianapolis to drive the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] [[Pace Car]] for the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]].

December 1946) is a semi-retired Brazilian [[Auto racing|automobile racing driver]] who won both the [[Formula One]] World Championship and the [[Indianapolis 500]] twice each and the [[Champcars|CART]] championship once.\n\nMoving up from [[Formula Two]], Fittipaldi made his race debut for [[Team Lotus]] as a third driver at the [[1970 British Grand Prix]]. After [[Jochen Rindt]] was killed at the [[1970 Italian Grand Prix]], the Brazilian became Lotus's lead driver in only his fifth Grand Prix. He enjoyed considerable success with Lotus, winning the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|World Drivers' Championship]] in [[1972 Formula One season|1972]] at the age of 25, a youngest F1 world champion record that he held for 33 years. He later moved to [[McLaren]] for [[1974 Formula One season|1974]], winning the title once again. He surprised the paddock by moving to his brother's [[Fittipaldi Automotive]] team prior to the [[1976 Formula One season|1976 season]], being replaced by [[James Hunt]]. Success eluded him during his final years in Formula One, with the Fittipaldi cars not competitive enough to fight for victories. Fittipaldi took two more podium finishes, before retiring in [[1980 Formula One season|1980]].\n\nFollowing his Formula One career, Fittipaldi moved to the American [[Champ Car|CART]] series, achieving successful results, including the [[1989 CART PPG Indy Car World Series|1989 CART title]] and two wins at the [[Indianapolis 500]] (in [[1989 Indianapolis 500|1989]] and [[1993 Indianapolis 500|1993]], the final at an unprecedented 46 years old).\n\nSince his retirement from [[Indy Car]] racing in [[1996 PPG Indy Car World Series|1996]], Fittipaldi races only occasionally. In 2008, he was one of only three people in history to have a Corvette production car named in his honor. At age 67, he entered the [[2014 6 Hours of S\u00e3o Paulo]].\n\n==Early and personal life==\nEmerson Fittipaldi was born in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]].

Both his parents had raced production cars shortly after the [[Second World War]] and Wilson Sr was also responsible for the first [[Mil Milhas Brasil|Mil Milhas]] race in 1956, in S\u00e3o Paulo, having been inspired by the 1949 [[Italy|Italian]] [[Mille Miglia]].

He is the uncle of TUDOR United Sports Car Championship driver [[Christian Fittipaldi]]. He was married to Maria Helena from 1970-82. They had three children.

In September 1997, while recovering from injuries in a crash at [[Michigan International Speedway]] a year earlier, he was flying his private plane across his orange tree farm in the state of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]. The plane lost power and plunged {{convert|90|m|ft}} to the ground, leaving him with serious back injuries. Though Fittipaldi had converted to Christianity the year prior, his beliefs were reinforced after the crash.

In his second season in single-seaters, Fittipaldi won the Brazilian Formula Vee title at age 21. He left for Europe in 1969, with the ambition to convince team owners of his talent in three months. After some podiums and his first victories in [[Formula Ford]], Fittipaldi was first trained and then subsequently engaged by the Jim Russell Driving School [[Formula Three]] team. He won nine F3 races on the Jim Russell [[Lotus 59]] in the MCD Lombard Championship to become the 1969 champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/database/drivers/emerson-fittipaldi|title=Emerson Fittipaldi|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Formula Two===\nFor [[1970 European Formula Two season|1970]], Fittipaldi moved up to F2 by joining the Lotus semi-works Team Bardahl campaigning [[Lotus 59|Lotus 59B]]. With six finishes in the points and four on the podium, he ended the eight-race season in third place behind [[Clay Regazzoni]] and [[Derek Bell (racing driver)|Derek Bell]]. While this result was very impressive for the newcomer to the series, the spotlight was on Fittipaldi that year because of his activities in Formula One instead.\n\n===Formula One===\nBased on the success of [[Cosworth DFV]] and [[Lotus 49]]/[[Lotus 49B|49B]] in 1968, [[Team Lotus]] was enjoying the reputation as one of the top F1 teams with the inflow of sponsorship money, and [[Colin Chapman]] used the third seat on the team for championship races as the testing ground for younger drivers. This was in contrast to the team's tradition to use non-championship F1 events for the purpose.\n\nThe third seat was given to [[Alex Soler-Roig]] in the early 1970, and then to Fittipaldi starting with the [[1970 British Grand Prix|British GP]] in July, with [[Jochen Rindt]] and [[John Miles (auto racer)|John Miles]] as the regular seat holders. Fittipaldi scored a fourth place as the No. 3 driver at the next [[1970 German Grand Prix|German GP]] where the No. 1 Jochen Rindt won, and the No. 2 John Miles retired.\n\n[[Team Lotus]] plans for the season drastically changed when Jochen Rindt was killed at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] in September and became the only driver to win the championship posthumously. John Miles also left the team, and Fittipaldi was promoted to be the Lotus No. 1 driver on his fifth F1 race at the [[1970 United States Grand Prix|United States GP]] with [[Reine Wisell]] and [[Pete Lovely]] as the teammates. Fittipaldi proved up to the task and won this first post-Rindt race for Lotus.\n\nIn his first full year as Lotus's lead driver in 1971, Fittipaldi finished sixth in the Drivers' Championship as the team further developed the previous season's [[Lotus 72]]. Armed with what was arguably the greatest Formula one design of all time, the Lotus 72D, Fittipaldi proved dominant in 1972 as he won five of 11 races and claimed the F1 Drivers' Championship.\n\nAt 25 he was then the [[List of Formula One driver records#Youngest world Drivers' Championship winners|youngest champion]] in F1 history. It appeared he might do it again in 1973. But after three wins in four attempts with the 72D, he began to struggle in the new 72E that was unveiled mid-year. It resulted in the reverse of the previous year, with Stewart beating Fittipaldi for the Drivers' Championship.\n\nFittipaldi left Lotus to sign with the promising [[Team McLaren|McLaren]] team. Driving the highly efficient [[McLaren M23]], he had three victories in 1974, reached the podium four other times, and beat out [[Clay Regazzoni]] in a close battle for his second championship. The following season, he notched two more victories and four other podiums, but was second to a dominant [[Niki Lauda]]. However, at the height of his F1 success, Fittipaldi shocked everyone by leaving McLaren to race for older brother [[Wilson Fittipaldi J\u00fanior|Wilson Fittipaldi]]'s [[Copersucar]]-sponsored [[Fittipaldi Automotive]] team.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nHe remained with the team for five seasons but only managed a best finish of second. Fittipaldi decided to retire from racing at the end of 1980. He has since said that his last two years in Formula One were very unhappy: \"I was too involved in the problems of trying to make the team work, and I neglected my marriage and my personal life\",<ref>Ludvigsen, Karl (2002) [https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/185960837X 'Emerson Fittipaldi'] p. 136 Haynes Group. {{ISBN|1-85960-837-X}}</ref> although at the time he cited the deaths of many of his colleagues as his reason.<ref>\"Fittipaldi to Retire\", ''The Times'', 12 December 1980, pg. 20</ref> He was only 33, but had been racing in Formula One for a decade.

Among his wins was a dominant performance in the [[1989 Indianapolis 500]] where he led 158 of 200 laps and won by two laps, but only after a dramatic duel with [[Al Unser, Jr.]] in the closing laps of the race. Unser ran down Fittipaldi after a late-race restart and passed him for the lead on lap 196. Three laps later, Fittipaldi used lapped traffic to his advantage to pull alongside Unser on the backstretch. Neither driver would give way, and the two cars touched wheels as they went through turn three side by side. Unser's car spun out of control to hit the outside wall, while Fittipaldi was able to maintain sufficient control to keep his car moving straight. In spite of the altercation, Unser saluted Fittipaldi from the infield as Fittipaldi passed by on the final lap.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/29/sports/fittipaldi-wins-indy-500-after-collision-with-unser.html/|title=Fittipaldi Wins Indy 500 After Collision With Unser|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 May 1989|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:fittipaldi indy.jpg|thumb|right|Emerson Fittipaldi racing in the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1994 ]]\n[[Roger Penske]] hired Fittipaldi for his [[Penske Racing|racing team]] in 1990 and he continued to be among the top drivers in CART, winning at least one race with Penske for six straight years.

He was only the second driver to not drink milk at Indianapolis since the tradition was founded in 1936 (and firmly established in 1956). Fittipaldi owned several orange groves in his native Brazil, and wanted to promote the citrus industry. Fan reaction was negative to the break in tradition despite the fact that Fittipaldi chased the juice with milk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.usatoday.com/2016/05/25/four-days-to-the-100th-indy-500-emerson-fittipaldi-and-the-orange-juice/|title=Four days to the 100th Indianapolis 500: Emerson Fittipaldi and the Orange Juice|work=[[USA Today]]|date=25 May 2016|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref> As a result of drinking the juice, Fittipaldi forfeited $5,000 from the winner's purse and publicly apologized to the American Dairy Association.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/06/03/Auto-Racing-Notebook/4794739080000/|title=Auto Racing Notebook|work=UPI Archives|date=3 June 1993|accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nFan reaction to the milk snub was highly negative, and he was booed a week later at [[ABC Supply Company A.J.

In interviews since, Fittipaldi explained his action, and apologised for the wave of negativity that followed. Fittipaldi returned to Indianapolis to drive the [[Chevrolet Corvette]] [[Pace Car]] for the [[2008 Indianapolis 500]].

It originally ran as the miniseries \"Killer\" from 6 until 20 September 1983, before a full series was commissioned that ran from 2 July 1985 until 7 November 2010. The series revolved around a group of detectives initially in the [[Maryhill]] [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] of [[Strathclyde Police]], though various storylines were set in other parts of [[Greater Glasgow]] and in other areas of [[Scotland]]. The team operated out of the fictional John Street police station. [[Mark McManus]], who played the title character [[Jim Taggart]], died in 1994; however the series continued under the same name.\n\n''Taggart'' was one of the UKs longest-running television dramas and the longest-running police drama after the cancellation of ''[[The Bill]]''.\n\nThe series theme music is \"[[No Mean City]]\" sung by [[Maggie Bell]].\n\n==History==\nThe Scottish BAFTA-winning [[pilot episode]] \"Killer\", directed by [[Laurence Moody]] and broadcast in 1983, introduced the character [[Detective Chief Inspector]] [[Jim Taggart]] (played by [[Mark McManus]] until his death in 1994), a tough and experienced detective who had worked his way up through the ranks. His original sidekick was [[Detective Sergeant]] Peter Livingstone ([[Neil Duncan]]). Livingstone represented the new breed of young graduates entering the police force and frequently had a difficult relationship with Taggart as a result. Taggart's boss in the pilot was Superintendent Robert Murray ([[Tom Watson (actor)|Tom Watson]]). This humour was continued in the subsequent series when Taggart's boss after the second episode, \"Dead Ringer\", being Superintendent Jack McVitie ([[Iain Anders]]). Another important character was Taggart's wife Jean (Harriet Buchan), whose physical disability did not prevent her from pursuing a number of interests in life, while her cynical husband stuck mainly to his job. Throughout the McManus era, there was nearly always a sub-plot in every episode which involved the domestic life of the Taggarts, which on occasion became intertwined with the case being investigated. The most memorable of these was the Taggarts' ongoing care of Jean's senile Aunt Hettie (Sheila Donald), whom Jim despises and begrudges staying in his house.This sub-plot ran through 1990\u201391 until the Hettie character was finally killed off in the 1991 season finale, \"Violent Delights\".\n\nIn 1987 the character of Michael Jardine ([[James MacPherson (actor)|James MacPherson]]) was introduced. [[Neil Duncan]] left the series in 1987 and in 1990 a new female sidekick [[Jackie Reid]] ([[Blythe Duff]]) was introduced.\n\nMcManus died in 1994 during the filming of an episode. Taggart's absence in the broadcast story was explained by his being in meetings with the [[Chief Constable]] throughout. In 1995 the episode \"Black Orchid\" opened with Taggart's funeral. Despite the death of the title character the series went unchanged. Jardine was promoted to Detective Inspector and DC Stuart Fraser ([[Colin McCredie]]) was introduced, becoming the long-suffering sidekick to Jardine, former long-suffering sidekick to Taggart. Fraser was later revealed to be gay. McCredie had made an early appearance in ''Taggart'' when he played a suspect part of a youth gang. DI Robbie Ross ([[John Michie]]) joined the team in 1998. Michie had made an early appearance in ''Taggart'' in 1990 when he played a suspect called Robby Meiklejohn in an episode called \"Love Knot\".\n\nWhen MacPherson left the series in 2002 his character was killed off and replaced with DCI Matt Burke, formerly of [[Special Branch]], played by [[Alex Norton]], who had previously appeared in the series playing murder suspect George Bryce in 1986 in the episode \"Knife Edge\".\n\nMuch was made of the platonic love between Jardine and Reid. The two were shown to share a brother/sister-like bond. Both pursued a number of relationships with other characters over the years. Reid even got married but later separated from her husband, who then died. The personal relationships of the police officers in this series were shown as nothing to be envious of: Reid once described herself, Burke, Ross and Fraser as three divorcees and a celibate homosexual in the episode \"Penthouse and Pavement\".\n\nAfter filming was completed on series 26 in December 2009, [[Colin McCredie]] was informed that he and his character would not be returning for filming of the next series.\n\n===ITV/STV dispute===\n[[ITV plc]] the company that operates the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network franchises in England Wales and southern Scotland failed to announce whether it planned to show any new episodes of Taggart prompting [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] to suspend production of the programme in September 2009. [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] announced in November 2009 that it would produce new episodes of Taggart for broadcast in 2010 regardless of whether [[ITV plc]] decided to screen it.\n\nIn February 2010 it was announced that [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] had put their wider commercial differences to one side to make a new series, which Scottish viewers got to see first. The two broadcasters co-commissioned a six-part series of the show [[UKTV]] also invested in return for repeat rights. New episodes of Taggart debuted on [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] in autumn 2010 before being broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] across the rest of the UK in 2011. The [[UKTV]] Channel [[Alibi]] showed the episodes in 2013. Online catch-up of the new series was not available to users of [[STV Player]] until the show had been broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]].\n\n==Format and broadcast information==\nThe format of the show changed over the years. Originally the show ran with three one-hour episodes to each story. This was later changed starting with the last transmitted story in 1998 to a regular pattern of two-hour stand-alone stories and beginning in July 2002 these were shortened to 60 minutes. After a two-hour special episode in January 2003 episodes were again lengthened starting in October this time to 90 minutes continuing through the 2008 New Year special \"Genesis\". After this the show became a series of one-hour stand-alone stories for the first time since 2003.\n\nFans of the show were often frustrated by the erratic scheduling of the show. Although blocks or series of the show were filmed together they were often not shown together as with other series. Instead they were fitted into the schedule whenever there was a gap, meaning that they were often not shown in consecutive weeks or on one set night of the week. Often months passed between episodes of the same series being shown. This was very much the case in Australia with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]] showing episodes featuring the three lead actors in haphazard order with current or recent shows.This made it very difficult to understand the history of the show.\n\n===DVD releases===\nThe DVD rights in the UK for many ''Taggart'' episodes the earlier series in particular are held by Clearvision. However some episodes in particular those from 2002 onwards have been released on DVD in the UK by [[Acorn Media UK]]. There are also Region 1 and Region 4 releases for [[Northern America]] and [[Australasia]] markets. Some of the DVD releases are now quite rare and deleted and there has been no [[Blu-ray]] release at present.\n\n==Cast of final series==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Blythe Duff]] as WPC/DC/DS/DI [[Jackie Reid]] (1984\u20132010)<ref group=\"n\" name=\"Duff\">Duff played an Uncredited Police Woman from 1984 until 1990 when she was named as Jackie Reid</ref>\n* [[John Michie]] as DI Robert \"Robbie\" Ross (1998\u20132010)\n* [[Alex Norton]] as DCI Matt Burke (2002\u20132010)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Siobhan Redmond]] as Chief Supt.

It originally ran as the miniseries \"Killer\" from 6 until 20 September 1983, before a full series was commissioned that ran from 2 July 1985 until 7 November 2010. The series revolved around a group of detectives initially in the [[Maryhill]] [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] of [[Strathclyde Police]], though various storylines were set in other parts of [[Greater Glasgow]] and in other areas of [[Scotland]]. The team operated out of the fictional John Street police station. [[Mark McManus]], who played the title character [[Jim Taggart]], died in 1994; however the series continued under the same name.\n\n''Taggart'' was one of the UKs longest-running television dramas and the longest-running police drama after the cancellation of ''[[The Bill]]''.\n\nThe series theme music is \"[[No Mean City]]\" sung by [[Maggie Bell]].\n\n==History==\nThe Scottish BAFTA-winning [[pilot episode]] \"Killer\", directed by [[Laurence Moody]] and broadcast in 1983, introduced the character [[Detective Chief Inspector]] [[Jim Taggart]] (played by [[Mark McManus]] until his death in 1994), a tough and experienced detective who had worked his way up through the ranks. His original sidekick was [[Detective Sergeant]] Peter Livingstone ([[Neil Duncan]]). Livingstone represented the new breed of young graduates entering the police force and frequently had a difficult relationship with Taggart as a result. Taggart's boss in the pilot was Superintendent Robert Murray ([[Tom Watson (actor)|Tom Watson]]). This humour was continued in the subsequent series when Taggart's boss after the second episode, \"Dead Ringer\", being Superintendent Jack McVitie ([[Iain Anders]]). Another important character was Taggart's wife Jean (Harriet Buchan), whose physical disability did not prevent her from pursuing a number of interests in life, while her cynical husband stuck mainly to his job. Throughout the McManus era, there was nearly always a sub-plot in every episode which involved the domestic life of the Taggarts, which on occasion became intertwined with the case being investigated. The most memorable of these was the Taggarts' ongoing care of Jean's senile Aunt Hettie (Sheila Donald), whom Jim despises and begrudges staying in his house.This sub-plot ran through 1990\u201391 until the Hettie character was finally killed off in the 1991 season finale, \"Violent Delights\".\n\nIn 1987 the character of Michael Jardine ([[James MacPherson (actor)|James MacPherson]]) was introduced. [[Neil Duncan]] left the series in 1987 and in 1990 a new female sidekick [[Jackie Reid]] ([[Blythe Duff]]) was introduced.\n\nMcManus died in 1994 during the filming of an episode. Taggart's absence in the broadcast story was explained by his being in meetings with the [[Chief Constable]] throughout. In 1995 the episode \"Black Orchid\" opened with Taggart's funeral. Despite the death of the title character the series went unchanged. Jardine was promoted to Detective Inspector and DC Stuart Fraser ([[Colin McCredie]]) was introduced, becoming the long-suffering sidekick to Jardine, former long-suffering sidekick to Taggart. Fraser was later revealed to be gay. McCredie had made an early appearance in ''Taggart'' when he played a suspect part of a youth gang. DI Robbie Ross ([[John Michie]]) joined the team in 1998. Michie had made an early appearance in ''Taggart'' in 1990 when he played a suspect called Robby Meiklejohn in an episode called \"Love Knot\".\n\nWhen MacPherson left the series in 2002 his character was killed off and replaced with DCI Matt Burke, formerly of [[Special Branch]], played by [[Alex Norton]], who had previously appeared in the series playing murder suspect George Bryce in 1986 in the episode \"Knife Edge\".\n\nMuch was made of the platonic love between Jardine and Reid. The two were shown to share a brother/sister-like bond. Both pursued a number of relationships with other characters over the years. Reid even got married but later separated from her husband, who then died. The personal relationships of the police officers in this series were shown as nothing to be envious of: Reid once described herself, Burke, Ross and Fraser as three divorcees and a celibate homosexual in the episode \"Penthouse and Pavement\".\n\nAfter filming was completed on series 26 in December 2009, [[Colin McCredie]] was informed that he and his character would not be returning for filming of the next series.\n\n===ITV/STV dispute===\n[[ITV plc]] the company that operates the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network franchises in England Wales and southern Scotland failed to announce whether it planned to show any new episodes of Taggart prompting [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] to suspend production of the programme in September 2009. [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] announced in November 2009 that it would produce new episodes of Taggart for broadcast in 2010 regardless of whether [[ITV plc]] decided to screen it.\n\nIn February 2010 it was announced that [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] had put their wider commercial differences to one side to make a new series, which Scottish viewers got to see first. The two broadcasters co-commissioned a six-part series of the show [[UKTV]] also invested in return for repeat rights. New episodes of Taggart debuted on [[STV (TV channel)|STV]] in autumn 2010 before being broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] across the rest of the UK in 2011. The [[UKTV]] Channel [[Alibi]] showed the episodes in 2013. Online catch-up of the new series was not available to users of [[STV Player]] until the show had been broadcast on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]].\n\n==Format and broadcast information==\nThe format of the show changed over the years. Originally the show ran with three one-hour episodes to each story. This was later changed starting with the last transmitted story in 1998 to a regular pattern of two-hour stand-alone stories and beginning in July 2002 these were shortened to 60 minutes. After a two-hour special episode in January 2003 episodes were again lengthened starting in October this time to 90 minutes continuing through the 2008 New Year special \"Genesis\". After this the show became a series of one-hour stand-alone stories for the first time since 2003.\n\nFans of the show were often frustrated by the erratic scheduling of the show. Although blocks or series of the show were filmed together they were often not shown together as with other series. Instead they were fitted into the schedule whenever there was a gap, meaning that they were often not shown in consecutive weeks or on one set night of the week. Often months passed between episodes of the same series being shown. This was very much the case in Australia with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]] showing episodes featuring the three lead actors in haphazard order with current or recent shows.This made it very difficult to understand the history of the show.\n\n===DVD releases===\nThe DVD rights in the UK for many ''Taggart'' episodes the earlier series in particular are held by Clearvision. However some episodes in particular those from 2002 onwards have been released on DVD in the UK by [[Acorn Media UK]]. There are also Region 1 and Region 4 releases for [[Northern America]] and [[Australasia]] markets. Some of the DVD releases are now quite rare and deleted and there has been no [[Blu-ray]] release at present.\n\n==Cast of final series==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Blythe Duff]] as WPC/DC/DS/DI [[Jackie Reid]] (1984\u20132010)<ref group=\"n\" name=\"Duff\">Duff played an Uncredited Police Woman from 1984 until 1990 when she was named as Jackie Reid</ref>\n* [[John Michie]] as DI Robert \"Robbie\" Ross (1998\u20132010)\n* [[Alex Norton]] as DCI Matt Burke (2002\u20132010)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Siobhan Redmond]] as Chief Supt.

He finds himself in the orbit of Arthur Daley, a middle-aged car salesman and self-described entrepreneur working on the edge of (and often beyond) the law in pursuit of a quick profit. Terry works for Arthur as an assistant/bodyguard (known as a 'minder'), and is often loaned out by Arthur to work for others in a similar capacity. Over the course of the first three series, the focus of the show shifts so that the ever-scheming Arthur moves from a supporting character to co-lead with Terry.\n\nSeries 1\u20137 (first broadcast from 1979 to 1985, then in 1989) feature both Terry and Arthur. Two TV films were also made between series 6 and 7, broadcast on Christmas Day 1985 and Boxing Day 1988. Terry was written out of the show after series 7.\n\nSeries 8\u201310 (first broadcast in 1991, 1993 and 1994) focus on Arthur Daley, older but no wiser, and his nephew Ray Daley as his new minder/assistant. Series 11 (first broadcast in 2009) was a short-lived revival of the program with a completely new cast.\n\n== Series 1 ==\n*Broadcast: 29 October 1979 \u2013 21 January 1980 ([[ITV Network|ITV]])\n*Regular cast: [[Dennis Waterman]] as Terry McCann, [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] as Arthur Daley, [[Glynn Edwards]] as Dave Harris\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Episode\n!Title\n!First aired\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#addfad;\"\n|| 1\n||\"Gunfight at the OK Laundrette\"\n|| 29 October 1979\n|-  \n| colspan=\"3\" |Terry is caught up in an armed robbery at a [[laundrette]] owned by gangster-turned-successful businessman Alfie Cavallo.

He finds himself in the orbit of Arthur Daley, a middle-aged car salesman and self-described entrepreneur working on the edge of (and often beyond) the law in pursuit of a quick profit. Terry works for Arthur as an assistant/bodyguard (known as a 'minder'), and is often loaned out by Arthur to work for others in a similar capacity. Over the course of the first three series, the focus of the show shifts so that the ever-scheming Arthur moves from a supporting character to co-lead with Terry.\n\nSeries 1\u20137 (first broadcast from 1979 to 1985, then in 1989) feature both Terry and Arthur. Two TV films were also made between series 6 and 7, broadcast on Christmas Day 1985 and Boxing Day 1988. Terry was written out of the show after series 7.\n\nSeries 8\u201310 (first broadcast in 1991, 1993 and 1994) focus on Arthur Daley, older but no wiser, and his nephew Ray Daley as his new minder/assistant. Series 11 (first broadcast in 2009) was a short-lived revival of the program with a completely new cast.\n\n== Series 1 ==\n*Broadcast: 29 October 1979 \u2013 21 January 1980 ([[ITV Network|ITV]])\n*Regular cast: [[Dennis Waterman]] as Terry McCann, [[George Cole (actor)|George Cole]] as Arthur Daley, [[Glynn Edwards]] as Dave Harris\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Episode\n!Title\n!First aired\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#addfad;\"\n|| 1\n||\"Gunfight at the OK Laundrette\"\n|| 29 October 1979\n|-  \n| colspan=\"3\" |Terry is caught up in an armed robbery at a [[laundrette]] owned by gangster-turned-successful businessman Alfie Cavallo.

The Chautauqua movement may be regarded as a successor to the [[Lyceum movement]] earlier in the 19th century.  As the Chautauqua assemblies began to compete for the best performers and lecturers, [[Lyceum movement|lyceum bureaus]] assisted with bookings.

In ''We Called it Culture'', Victoria and Robert Case wrote of the new itinerant Chautauqua:\n\n<blockquote>\"The credit\u2013or blame\u2013for devising the Frankenstein mechanism which was both to exalt and to destroy Chautauqua, the tent circuit, must be given to two youths of similar temperament, imagination, and a common purpose.

Booth's descriptions of prison life would move her audiences to tears and rouse them to reform.  [[Jane Addams]] spoke on social problems and her work at [[Hull House]].  [[Helen Potter]] is another notable woman in the Chautaquas. Potter performed a variety of roles, including men and women. As Gentile notes: \"Potter's choice of subjects is noteworthy for its variety and for the fact that she was credible in her impersonations of men as well as of women. In retrospect, Potter's impersonations are of special interest as examples of the kind of recycling or refertilization of inspiration that occurs throughout the history of the one-person show.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cast of One: One-person Shows from the Chautauqua Platform to the Broadway Stage|last=Gentile|first=John|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Champaign, IL|pages=43}}</ref> On a lighter note, author [[Opie Read|Opie Read's]] stories and homespun philosophy endeared him to audiences.  Other well-known speakers and lecturers in Chautauqua events of various forms included Member of the U.S. House of Representatives [[Champ Clark]] from Missouri, Missouri Governor [[Herbert S. Hadley]], and [[Robert La Follette, Sr.|\"Fighting Bob\" La Follette]] (governor of Wisconsin at the time).<ref name=\"Tapia\"/>\n\n==Religious expression==\nChristian instruction, preaching, and worship were a strong part of the Chautauqua experience.  Although the Chautauqua movement was founded by [[Methodists]], [[nondenominational]]ism was a Chautauqua principle from the beginning, and prominent Catholics like [[Catherine Doherty]] took part.  In 1892, Lutheran Church theologian [[Theodore Emanuel Schmauk]] was one of the organizers of the Pennsylvania Chautauqua.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nEarly religious expression in Chautauqua was usually of a general nature, comparable to the later [[Moral Re-Armament]] movement.  Later on, in the first half of the 20th century, [[Fundamentalism]] was the content of an increasing number of Chautauqua sermons and lectures. However, the great number of Chautauquas, as well as the absence of any central authority over them, meant that religious patterns varied greatly among the different Chautauquas.  Some were so religiously oriented that they were essentially [[Summer camp|church camps]], while more [[secularity|secular]] Chautauquas resembled [[summer school]] and competed with [[vaudeville]] in theaters and [[circus]] tent shows with their animal acts and [[trapeze]] acrobats. People involved in the Chautauqua movement believed that both secular and spiritual knowledge radiate from God and are both equally important.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nOne example, [[Lakeside, Ohio|Lakeside Chautauqua]], is privately owned but affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]]. In contrast, the [[Colorado Chautauqua]], is entirely [[nondenominational]] and mostly [[secularity|secular]] in its orientation.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n== Competition with vaudeville ==\nIn the 1890s, both Chautauqua and vaudeville were gaining popularity and establishing themselves as important forms of entertainment. While Chautauqua had its roots in Sunday-school and valued morality and education highly, vaudeville grew out of minstrel shows, variety acts, and crude humor, and so the two movements found themselves at odds. Chautauqua was considered wholesome, family entertainment and appealed to the educated classes and religious folk. Vaudeville, on the other hand, was considered by many to be anti-intellectual and appealed to the lower, less educated classes. There was a hard distinction between the two, and neither generally shared performers or audiences.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, vaudeville managers began a push for more \"refinement\", as well as a loosening of Victorian-era morals from the Chautauqua side. Over time, as vaudeville became more respectable, Chautauqua became more liberal and secular. The boundaries between the two began to blur, and soon many Chautauqua performers began to try to broaden their appeal and become more than just platform readers so they could cross over to the vaudeville side, taking part in both forms in their eagerness to gain more money and fame.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cast of One: One-Person Shows from the Chautauqua Platform to the Broadway Stage|last=Gentile|first=John, S.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1989|isbn=0-252-01584-3|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/castofoneonepers00gent/page/47 47\u201351]|url=https://archive.org/details/castofoneonepers00gent/page/47}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nMusic was important to Chautauqua, with [[Band (music)|band music]] in particular demand. [[John Philip Sousa]] prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Bohumir Kryl|Bohumir Kryl's]] [[Bohemian]] Band was frequently seen on the circuit. One of the numbers featured by Kryl was the \u201c[[Anvil Chorus]]\u201d from ''[[Il Trovatore]]'' with four husky timpanists in leather aprons hammering on anvils shooting sparks (enhanced through [[special effects]]) across the darkened stage.  [[Spirituals]] were also popular.  White audiences appreciated seeing African-Americans performing other than [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]].  Other musical features of the Chautauqua included groups like the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers|Jubilee Singers]] singing a mix of spirituals and popular tunes, and other singers and [[instrumental]] groups like [[American Quartette]] playing popular music, ballads, and songs from the \"old country\". Entertainers on the Chautauqua circuit such as [[Charles Ross Taggart]], billed as \"The Man From Vermont\" and \"The Old Country Fiddler\", played violin, sang, was a ventriloquist and comedian, and told tall tales about life in rural [[New England]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nOpera became a part of the Chautauqua experience in 1926 when the [[American Opera Company]], an outgrowth of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, began touring the country. Under the direction of Russian tenor [[Vladimir Rosing]], the AOC presented five operas in one week at the Chautauqua Amphitheater.<ref>Chautauqua Opera \u2013 History. Opera.ciweb.org.

Manifestos such as the \"Populist Party Platform\"<ref>''People's Party Platform,'' Omaha Morning World-Herald, 5 July 1892</ref> voiced a disdain for political corruption and championed the plight of the common people in the face of the rich and powerful.  Other favorite political reform topics in Chautauqua lectures included [[temperance movement|temperance]] (even [[prohibition]]), [[women's suffrage]], and [[child labor laws]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHowever, the Chautauqua movement usually avoided taking political stands as such, instead inviting public officials of all the major political parties to lecture, assuring a balanced program for the members of the assembly.  For example, during the 1936 season at the [[Chautauqua Institution]], in anticipation of the national election held that year for president, visitors heard addresses by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challenger [[Alf Landon]], and from two [[third party (politics)|third-party]] candidates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madisoniannews.com/features/chautauqua-elling-house-hosts-first-chautauqua-2019|title=Chautauqua!

Within a decade, ''Chautauqua assemblies'' (or simply ''Chautauquas''), named for the original location in New York, sprang up in various locations across North America.  The Chautauqua movement may be regarded as a successor to the [[Lyceum movement]] earlier in the 19th century.  As the Chautauqua assemblies began to compete for the best performers and lecturers, [[Lyceum movement|lyceum bureaus]] assisted with bookings.

The boundaries between the two began to blur, and soon many Chautauqua performers began to try to broaden their appeal and become more than just platform readers so they could cross over to the vaudeville side, taking part in both forms in their eagerness to gain more money and fame.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cast of One: One-Person Shows from the Chautauqua Platform to the Broadway Stage|last=Gentile|first=John, S.|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=1989|isbn=0-252-01584-3|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/castofoneonepers00gent/page/47 47\u201351]|url=https://archive.org/details/castofoneonepers00gent/page/47}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nMusic was important to Chautauqua, with [[Band (music)|band music]] in particular demand. [[John Philip Sousa]] prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Bohumir Kryl|Bohumir Kryl\u2019s]] [[Bohemian]] Band was frequently seen on the circuit. One of the numbers featured by Kryl was the \u201c[[Anvil Chorus]]\u201d from ''[[Il Trovatore]]'' with four husky timpanists in leather aprons hammering on anvils shooting sparks (enhanced through [[special effects]]) across the darkened stage.  [[Spirituals]] were also popular.  White audiences appreciated seeing African-Americans performing other than [[minstrel show|minstrelsy]].  Other musical features of the Chautauqua included groups like the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers|Jubilee Singers]] singing a mix of spirituals and popular tunes, and other singers and [[instrumental]] groups like [[American Quartette]] playing popular music, ballads, and songs from the \"old country\". Entertainers on the Chautauqua circuit such as [[Charles Ross Taggart]], billed as \"The Man From Vermont\" and \"The Old Country Fiddler\", played violin, sang, was a ventriloquist and comedian, and told tall tales about life in rural [[New England]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nOpera became a part of the Chautauqua experience in 1926 when the [[American Opera Company]], an outgrowth of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, began touring the country. Under the direction of Russian tenor [[Vladimir Rosing]], the AOC presented five operas in one week at the Chautauqua Amphitheater.<ref>Chautauqua Opera \u2013 History. Opera.ciweb.org.

Manifestos such as the \"Populist Party Platform\"<ref>''People's Party Platform,'' Omaha Morning World-Herald, 5 July 1892</ref> voiced a disdain for political corruption and championed the plight of the common people in the face of the rich and powerful.  Other favorite political reform topics in Chautauqua lectures included [[temperance movement|temperance]] (even [[prohibition]]), [[women's suffrage]], and [[child labor laws]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHowever, the Chautauqua movement usually avoided taking political stands as such, instead inviting public officials of all the major political parties to lecture, assuring a balanced program for the members of the assembly.  For example, during the 1936 season at the [[Chautauqua Institution]], in anticipation of the national election held that year for president, visitors heard addresses by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challenger [[Alf Landon]], and from two [[third party (politics)|third-party]] candidates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.madisoniannews.com/features/chautauqua-elling-house-hosts-first-chautauqua-2019|title=Chautauqua!
