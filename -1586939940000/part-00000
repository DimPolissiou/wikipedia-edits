Two sisters died in infancy before his own birth, and his only brother, born in 1679, lived only five months.

In this connection, he was seriously hit by a musket ball near [[Landau]], a wound that never healed completely. In his youth, before acceding to the margraviate, he created the suburb Saint George in The Lake (German: ''St. Georgen am See''). It was intended to be a self-contained city (today in the district of [[Bayreuth]]) built in baroque style with a castle in the lake. In the artificially-created Brandenburg Pond (German: ''Brandenburger Weiher''), fed by the [[Warme Steinach|Steinach]] tributary, he installed a ski jump and organized naval battles with real ships. On 17 November 1705, he created the [[Order of the Red Eagle]] (German: ''Roter Adlerorden''), then known as the ''Ordre de la Sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9'', and celebrated the anniversary of its foundation every year with splendid festivities. The Order of the Red Eagle also possessed its own church, the Sophienkirche. 18th-century coats of arms of the Order are displayed there to this day.\n\nThe margrave was an enthusiastic hunter who built the Emperor's Hunting Seat (German: ''Kaiserhammer'') and the Thiergarten. In addition, he is considered the builder of the [[Hermitage Museum (Bayreuth)|Hermitage Museum]] and Schloss Neust\u00e4dtlein.

They had five children:\n\n#Christiane Sophie Wilhelmine (b. Bayreuth, 6 January 1701 - d. Kulmbach, 15 July 1749). The only surviving child of her parents, she was involved in a scandal that led to the birth of twins born out of wedlock.  Both died shortly after their birth in 1724. For her indiscretion, she was banished to her uncle's court in [[Kulmbach]], where she died, unmarried and childless, twenty-five years later. Before her departure from her father's court, was allowed to imbed her ''petschaft'' (a necklace with a seal) in the wall of her room in the Schloss Himmelkron.

It was the first permanent theatre ever built in [[England]]. It was built in 2022 after the [[Red Lion (theatre)|Red Lion]], and the first successful one. Built by actor-manager [[James Burbage]], near the family home in Holywell Street, The Theatre is considered the first theatre built in London for the sole purpose of theatrical productions. The Theatre's history includes a number of important acting troupes including the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], which employed [[Shakespeare]] as actor and playwright. After a dispute with the landlord, the theatre was dismantled and the timbers used in the construction of the [[Globe Theatre]] on [[Bankside]].\n\n==History==\nThe Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], not wanting to attract crowds of strangers. In 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city.<ref name=Ordish>{{citation |title= Early London Theatres: In the Fields | year=1899 | first= Thomas | last=Fairman Ordish | publisher = Elliot Stock | location=London | page=30 | url=https://archive.org/details/earlylondonthea02ordigoog }}</ref> This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later [[Liberty of the Clink|the Clink]], and at [[Newington Butts]] near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey.<ref name=Ordish /> The Theatre was constructed in 1576 by James Burbage in partnership with his brother-in-law, one [[John Brayne]], (the owner of the Red Lion)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowsher|first1=Julian|last2=Miller|first2=Pat|title=The Rose and the Globe\u2014Playhouses of Shakespeare's Bankside, Southwark|year=2010|publisher=Museum of London|isbn=978-1-901992-85-4|page=19}}</ref> on property that had originally been the grounds of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] [[Halliwell Priory]] (or Holywell). Brayne had advanced Burbage the money needed to build The Theatre, and in return, Brayne received a portion of the profits and owned some of the property (Burbage married Brayne's daughter Ellen in 1575).<ref name=\"Stephen 1973\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Burbage, James|volume=7|page=285}}</ref> The Theatre was in Shoreditch, beyond the northern boundary of the City of London and outside the jurisdiction of civil authorities, who were often opposed to the [[theatre]]. This area in the \"suburbs of sin\" was notorious for licentious behaviour, brothels and gaming houses. A year later the [[Curtain Theatre]] was built nearby, making the area London's first theatrical and entertainment district.<ref>Mullaney, 1988.</ref> \"When Burbage and Brayne mortgaged The Theatre, Brayne had just recently resolved another fight with one of his brothers-in-law over a different mortgage\" <ref>{{cite web|last=Berry|first=Herbert|title=Brayne and his other brother-in-law|url=http://galegroup.com|work=Shakespeare Studies|publisher=Literature Resource Center|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> Brayne and Burbage had never written a contract, which eventually led to many quarrels concerning who spent what on getting The Theatre started.<ref name=\"Berry, Herbert 1660\">Berry, Herbert.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nThroughout the building of The Theatre, Burbage and Brayne continually became indebted to each other. To fix this they constructed schemes to keep the building of The Theatre going. John Hind was one of the creditors for the construction of The Theatre, however, almost nothing else is known about him except that there was also a contract between him and Burbage/Brayne which entailed that he arrange players for them. One of their schemes was to put on plays in The Theatre while it was still being built, to raise money for further construction.<ref>Mateer, David. \"New Light on the Early History of the Theatre in Shoreditch [With Texts].\" ''English Literary Renaissance'' 36.3 (2006): 335\u2013375.

The building was a [[polygon]]al wooden building with three [[auditorium|galleries]] surrounding an open yard. From one side of the polygon extended a [[thrust stage]]. The Theatre is said to have cost \u00a3700 to construct, which is a considerable sum for the age.<ref>Egan, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe open yard in front of the stage was cobbled and provided standing room for those who paid a [[history of the English penny|penny]]. For another penny, the attendees were allowed into the galleries where they could either stand or, for a third penny, procure a stool. One of the galleries, though sources do not state which, was divided into small compartments that could be used by the wealthy and aristocrats. The playhouse was a timber building with a tile roof; other materials used to construct the Theatre were brick, sand, lime, lead, and iron.  Owing to a lack of paperwork not much is truly known about the Theatre's appearance, but it has been described as an \"amphitheater\".<ref name=\"Berry, Herbert 1660\"/>\n\nThe Theatre opened in the autumn of 1576, possibly as a venue for [[Leicester's Men]], the acting company of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] of which James Burbage was a member. In the 1580s the [[Admiral's Men]], of which James Burbage's son, [[Richard Burbage|Richard]] was a member, took up residence. After a disagreement between the company and young Burbage, most of the company left for the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] which was under the management of [[Philip Henslowe]].\n\nIn 1594, Richard Burbage became the leading actor of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] which performed at The Theatre until 1597. Poet, playwright and actor William Shakespeare was also in the employ of the company and some of his  early plays had their premi\u00e8re at The Theatre.  \"At Christmas 1594 [Richard] was summoned with two other members of his company, William Kempe and William Shakespeare, to act before the queen at Greenwich Palace... Numerous performances before Queen Elizabeth followed, and Shakespeare doubtless often accompanied Burbage on many subsequent professional visits to one or other of the royal palaces.\"<ref name=\"Stephen 1973\"/> Richard's most noted role is\u2014which holds close to his namesake \u2014 his part as Richard in Shakespeare's [[Richard III]]. After the Burbages stripped The Theatre of its materials to erect The Globe, many of Shakespeare's plays were performed at the famous theatre in the summer and the Blackfriars house, another of the Burbage's theatres, was used as a winter playhouse.<ref name=\"Stephen 1973\"/>\n\nTowards the end of 1596, problems arose with the property's landlord, Giles Allen. Consequently, in 1597, the Lord Chamberlain's Men were forced to stop playing at The Theatre and moved to the nearby [[Curtain Theatre|Curtain]]. The lease had been granted to [[Richard Burbage]] and his brother [[Cuthbert Burbage]] upon the death of their father. The lease that the late James Burbage had obtained from Allen in 1576 was to last only twenty years, but when that day did come, in 1596, Allen \"stipulated that the playhouse should only be applied to theatrical purposes for another five years. This stipulation was contested by Burbage, and he and his sons began a harassing lawsuit with Allen. But before the dispute had gone very far Burbage died (in the spring of 1597) and the suit was continued by his sons Richard and Cuthbert.\"<ref name=\"Stephen 1973\"/> The sight of the deserted Theatre prompted these lines from a minor satirist of the day:\n{{quote|<poem>...But see yonder,\nOne like the unfrequented Theatre\nWalks in dark silence and vast solitude.</poem>|Edward Guilpin, ''Skialetheia'', 1598}}\n\nBrayne's widow, [[Margaret Brayne]], and former business partner, Robert Myles, filed a lawsuit against the Burbages after Brayne's death in 1586. When Brayne passed the Burbages halted their payments to Margaret for their debt. When they filed lawsuit, Margaret and Robert showed up at The Theatre demanding half of everything inside of it\u2014in disagreement, Richard Burbage physically assaulted Robert Myles, and Robert and Margaret left empty handed.

It was the first permanent theatre ever built in [[England]]. It was built in 1576 after the [[Red Lion (theatre)|Red Lion]], and the first successful one. Built by actor-manager [[James Burbage]], near the family home in Holywell Street, The Theatre is considered the first theatre built in London for the sole purpose of theatrical productions. The Theatre's history includes a number of important acting troupes including the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]], which employed [[Shakespeare]] as actor and playwright. After a dispute with the landlord, the theatre was dismantled and the timbers used in the construction of the [[Globe Theatre]] on [[Bankside]].\n\n==History==\nThe Mayor and Corporation of London banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the [[Plague (disease)|plague]], not wanting to attract crowds of strangers. In 1575 they formally expelled all players from the city.<ref name=Ordish>{{citation |title= Early London Theatres: In the Fields | year=1899 | first= Thomas | last=Fairman Ordish | publisher = Elliot Stock | location=London | page=30 | url=https://archive.org/details/earlylondonthea02ordigoog }}</ref> This prompted the construction of playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later [[Liberty of the Clink|the Clink]], and at [[Newington Butts]] near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey.<ref name=Ordish /> The Theatre was constructed in 1576 by James Burbage in partnership with his brother-in-law, one [[John Brayne]], (the owner of the Red Lion)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowsher|first1=Julian|last2=Miller|first2=Pat|title=The Rose and the Globe\u2014Playhouses of Shakespeare's Bankside, Southwark|year=2010|publisher=Museum of London|isbn=978-1-901992-85-4|page=19}}</ref> on property that had originally been the grounds of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] [[Halliwell Priory]] (or Holywell). Brayne had advanced Burbage the money needed to build The Theatre, and in return, Brayne received a portion of the profits and owned some of the property (Burbage married Brayne's daughter Ellen in 1575).<ref name=\"Stephen 1973\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Burbage, James|volume=7|page=285}}</ref> The Theatre was in Shoreditch, beyond the northern boundary of the City of London and outside the jurisdiction of civil authorities, who were often opposed to the [[theatre]]. This area in the \"suburbs of sin\" was notorious for licentious behaviour, brothels and gaming houses. A year later the [[Curtain Theatre]] was built nearby, making the area London's first theatrical and entertainment district.<ref>Mullaney, 1988.</ref> \"When Burbage and Brayne mortgaged The Theatre, Brayne had just recently resolved another fight with one of his brothers-in-law over a different mortgage\" <ref>{{cite web|last=Berry|first=Herbert|title=Brayne and his other brother-in-law|url=http://galegroup.com|work=Shakespeare Studies|publisher=Literature Resource Center|accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> Brayne and Burbage had never written a contract, which eventually led to many quarrels concerning who spent what on getting The Theatre started.<ref name=\"Berry, Herbert 1660\">Berry, Herbert.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000.</ref>\n\nThroughout the building of The Theatre, Burbage and Brayne continually became indebted to each other. To fix this they constructed schemes to keep the building of The Theatre going. John Hind was one of the creditors for the construction of The Theatre, however, almost nothing else is known about him except that there was also a contract between him and Burbage/Brayne which entailed that he arrange players for them. One of their schemes was to put on plays in The Theatre while it was still being built, to raise money for further construction.<ref>Mateer, David. \"New Light on the Early History of the Theatre in Shoreditch [With Texts].\" ''English Literary Renaissance'' 36.3 (2006): 335\u2013375.

The building was a [[polygon]]al wooden building with three [[auditorium|galleries]] surrounding an open yard. From one side of the polygon extended a [[thrust stage]]. The Theatre is said to have cost \u00a3700 to construct, which is a considerable sum for the age.<ref>Egan, 2005.</ref>\n\nThe open yard in front of the stage was cobbled and provided standing room for those who paid a [[history of the English penny|penny]]. For another penny, the attendees were allowed into the galleries where they could either stand or, for a third penny, procure a stool. One of the galleries, though sources do not state which, was divided into small compartments that could be used by the wealthy and aristocrats. The playhouse was a timber building with a tile roof; other materials used to construct the Theatre were brick, sand, lime, lead, and iron.  Owing to a lack of paperwork not much is truly known about the Theatre's appearance, but it has been described as an \"amphitheater\".<ref name=\"Berry, Herbert 1660\"/>\n\nThe Theatre opened in the autumn of 1576, possibly as a venue for [[Leicester's Men]], the acting company of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] of which James Burbage was a member. In the 1580s the [[Admiral's Men]], of which James Burbage's son, [[Richard Burbage|Richard]] was a member, took up residence. After a disagreement between the company and young Burbage, most of the company left for the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] which was under the management of [[Philip Henslowe]].\n\nIn 1594, Richard Burbage became the leading actor of the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] which performed at The Theatre until 1597. Poet, playwright and actor William Shakespeare was also in the employ of the company and some of his  early plays had their premi\u00e8re at The Theatre.  \"At Christmas 1594 [Richard] was summoned with two other members of his company, William Kempe and William Shakespeare, to act before the queen at Greenwich Palace... Numerous performances before Queen Elizabeth followed, and Shakespeare doubtless often accompanied Burbage on many subsequent professional visits to one or other of the royal palaces.\"<ref name=\"Stephen 1973\"/> Richard's most noted role is\u2014which holds close to his namesake \u2014 his part as Richard in Shakespeare's [[Richard III]]. After the Burbages stripped The Theatre of its materials to erect The Globe, many of Shakespeare's plays were performed at the famous theatre in the summer and the Blackfriars house, another of the Burbage's theatres, was used as a winter playhouse.<ref name=\"Stephen 1973\"/>\n\nTowards the end of 1596, problems arose with the property's landlord, Giles Allen. Consequently, in 1597, the Lord Chamberlain's Men were forced to stop playing at The Theatre and moved to the nearby [[Curtain Theatre|Curtain]]. The lease had been granted to [[Richard Burbage]] and his brother [[Cuthbert Burbage]] upon the death of their father. The lease that the late James Burbage had obtained from Allen in 1576 was to last only twenty years, but when that day did come, in 1596, Allen \"stipulated that the playhouse should only be applied to theatrical purposes for another five years. This stipulation was contested by Burbage, and he and his sons began a harassing lawsuit with Allen. But before the dispute had gone very far Burbage died (in the spring of 1597) and the suit was continued by his sons Richard and Cuthbert.\"<ref name=\"Stephen 1973\"/> The sight of the deserted Theatre prompted these lines from a minor satirist of the day:\n{{quote|<poem>...But see yonder,\nOne like the unfrequented Theatre\nWalks in dark silence and vast solitude.</poem>|Edward Guilpin, ''Skialetheia'', 1598}}\n\nBrayne's widow, [[Margaret Brayne]], and former business partner, Robert Myles, filed a lawsuit against the Burbages after Brayne's death in 1586. When Brayne passed the Burbages halted their payments to Margaret for their debt. When they filed lawsuit, Margaret and Robert showed up at The Theatre demanding half of everything inside of it\u2014in disagreement, Richard Burbage physically assaulted Robert Myles, and Robert and Margaret left empty handed. However, this was not the end as Myles attempted to bring down the Burbages in another two lawsuits, which both ended in failure. \"The old disputes of the Theatre were overtaken by the new litigation of the Alleyns-the original owners, when the Burbages dismantled the Theatre and rebuilt it as the Globe.\" <ref>Capp, Bernard. \"The Burbages At Law (Again).\" Notes & Queries 47.4 (2000): 433.

From there to its confluence with the [[Danube]] northeast of the city of [[Smederevo]], the Velika Morava is 185&nbsp;km long.<ref name=\"Yearbook\"/> With its longer branch, the West Morava, it is 493&nbsp;km long. The South Morava, which represents the natural headwaters of the Morava, used to be longer than the West Morava, but due to the regulations of river bed and [[Land improvement|melioration]], it is shorter nowadays.\n\nAt one time (regulations were made on all three branches making them shorter) the Morava was over 600&nbsp;km long. Today, the most distant water source in the Morava watershed is the source of the [[Ibar River]], the right and longest tributary of the Zapadna Morava, originating in [[Montenegro]], which gives the Ibar-West Morava-Great Morava river system a length of 550&nbsp;km, which still makes it the longest waterway in the [[Balkan Peninsula]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Morava river.PNG|right|thumb|175px|Velika Morava and Ju\u017ena Morava]]\n\nThe drainage basin of the Velika Morava is 6,126&nbsp;km\u00b2, and of the whole Morava system is 38,207&nbsp;km\u00b2<ref name=ICPDR/> (of that, 1,237&nbsp;km\u00b2 are in Bulgaria and 44&nbsp;km\u00b2 are in the Republic of Macedonia). This drainage basin covers 42,38% the area of Serbia. Velika Morava flows through the most fertile and densely populated area of Central Serbia, called the Morava river valley or [[Pomoravlje (region)|Pomoravlje]]. Pomoravlje was formed in a fossil bay of a vast, ancient [[Pannonian Sea]] which dried out 200,000 years ago. Through about half of its length it passes though the beautiful Bagrdan gorge (Bagrdanska klisura). In past centuries, it was known for its seemingly endless forests, but there is almost nothing left today of those old woods. It flows into the Danube between the villages of Kuli\u010d & Dubravica, in the coal mining basin of [[Kostolac]], one of two major mines in its drainage basin (the other one being [[Resava coal basin]], in valley of the Velika Morava's right tributary [[Resava (river)|Resava]]). The average discharge of the Velika Morava on its confluence with Danube is 255 m\u00b3/s (120 m\u00b3/s brought by Zapadna Morava, 100 m\u00b3/s by Ju\u017ena Morava, and 35 m\u00b3/s amounted by the Velika Morava itself).\n\n== Tributaries ==\n\nTributaries of the Velika Morava are short, the longest one being the [[Jasenica (river)|Jasenica]] (79&nbsp;km) and others rarely exceeding 50&nbsp;km. Right tributaries are: Jovanova\u010dka reka, Crnica, Ravanica, [[Resava (river)|Resava]] and [[Resavica River (Morava)|Resavica]] (or Resav\u010dina). Left tributaries are more numerous, including: Kaleni\u0107ka reka, [[Lugomir]], [[Belica River]], [[Lepenica (Great Morava)|Lepenica]], Ra\u010da, and [[Jasenica (river)|Jasenica]]. Many of them don't carry much water, but in rainy years, they are known for causing major floods, which has been a big problem for the entire Morava river system. Before it meets the Danube, the Velika Morava splits, creating a 47&nbsp;km long arm called the [[Jezava]], which flows into the Danube separately, in the town of [[Smederevo]]. It's joined by a longer (51&nbsp;km) river, the [[Ralja (river)|Ralja]], from the left.\n\n==Improvements==\nThe Velika Morava represents a textbook example of a [[meandering river]]. It used to be 245&nbsp;km long, but directly from its origin to the Danube, there is only 118&nbsp;km in distance; its [[meandering ratio]] is 118:245, one of the highest in Europe.\n\nThe river bed is 80\u2013200 m wide, and the depth as much as 10 m. Notorious for its flooding, the Morava has changed its course many times, and old river bends have become small lakes, known as ''moravi\u0161te''. Ju\u017ena Morava, with extremely high erosion in its drainage basin, brings huge amounts of silt which is elevating Velika Morava's river bed, making floods even more frequent.\n\nBeginning in 1966, huge works began on all three rivers to prevent future floodings. Series of reservoirs were made on tributaries (lakes [[Bovan (Aleksinac)|Bovan]], [[Lake \u0106elije|\u0106elije]], and others) and meanders were cut through, making river courses straightened, which made them shorter (in the case of the Velika Morava, from 245 to 185&nbsp;km). It was projected that it would shorten by as much as 152&nbsp;km, and that it would become navigable again.\n\nThe Morava and its tributaries still flood often, so its bed remains elevated, despite dozens of gravel-digging companies in cities and villages near the river's upper course ([[Lozovik]], [[Lugav\u010dina]], [[Lu\u010dica (Po\u017earevac)|Lu\u010dica]], [[Velika Plana]], etc.).\n\n==Navigation==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}\nToday, Velika Morava is navigable for only 3&nbsp;km from its mouth. In the past it was navigable all the way to the city of [[\u0106uprija]], for about 3/4 of its length. But, as mentioned before, Velika Morava gets buried under the materials brought by the Ju\u017ena Morava.\n\nWhen the [[Land improvement|melioration]] program began in 1966, it was projected it would become navigable again, in the first phase to [[\u0106uprija]], and in the next all the way to [[Stala\u0107]], making it 100% navigable. None of this was accomplished. From time to time, the idea of digging [[Danube]]-Morava-[[Vardar]]-[[Aegean Sea]]<ref>http://danube-cooperation.com/danubius/2011/11/28/morava-vardar-axios-navigation-route/</ref><ref>See [[Thessaloniki#Economy]]</ref> a navigable canal pops up in the media.\n\nTechnical problems of making this waterway would be enormous (neither the Morava nor the Vardar are navigable), the usefulness of its creation is debatable (whether the route would be used much), and the estimated costs are deemed prohibitive.\n\n==Settlements==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nAlthough Morava valley has always been the most populous part of Serbia, disastrous floodings prevented people from settling on the river banks itself. The only urban settlement on the river banks is \u0106uprija, but it often suffers from floods (including several times in the 1990s).\n\nOther urban settlements, built a little further away from the river itself, include: [[Para\u0107in]], [[Jagodina]], [[Bato\u010dina]], [[Lapovo]], [[Svilajnac]], [[Velika Plana]], [[Po\u017earevac]] and [[Smederevo]]. Smaller places and villages include: [[Varvarin]], Glogovac, Markovac, Veliko Ora\u0161je, Milo\u0161evac and [[Lozovik]].\n\n==Tradition==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nThe Romans called it ''Margus'' (in addition to that, the Zapadna Morava was named ''Brongus'', and Ju\u017ena Morava was ''Angrus''). The modern-day city of \u0106uprija existed in Roman times as ''Horreum Margi'' (meaning \"The Granary of Margus\").\n\nIn Serbian history, its valley became the cradle of the modern Serbian state in the beginning of the 19th century (so called \"Moravian Serbia\"; Moravska Srbija).

From there to its confluence with the [[Danube]] northeast of the city of [[Smederevo]], the Velika Morava is 185&nbsp;km long.<ref name=\"Yearbook\"/> With its longer branch, the West Morava, it is 493&nbsp;km long. The South Morava, which represents the natural headwaters of the Morava, used to be longer than the West Morava, but due to the regulations of river bed and [[Land improvement|melioration]], it is shorter nowadays.\n\nAt one time (regulations were made on all three branches making them shorter) the Morava was over 600&nbsp;km long. Today, the most distant water source in the Morava watershed is the source of the [[Ibar River]], the right and longest tributary of the Zapadna Morava, originating in [[Montenegro]], which gives the Ibar-West Morava-Great Morava river system a length of 550&nbsp;km, which still makes it the longest waterway in the [[Balkan Peninsula]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Morava river.PNG|right|thumb|175px|Velika Morava and Ju\u017ena Morava]]\n\nThe drainage basin of the Velika Morava is 6,126&nbsp;km\u00b2, and of the whole Morava system is 38,207&nbsp;km\u00b2<ref name=ICPDR/> (of that, 1,237&nbsp;km\u00b2 are in Bulgaria and 44&nbsp;km\u00b2 are in the Republic of Macedonia). This drainage basin covers 42,38% the area of Serbia. Velika Morava flows through the most fertile and densely populated area of Central Serbia, called the Morava river valley or [[Pomoravlje (region)|Pomoravlje]]. Pomoravlje was formed in a fossil bay of a vast, ancient [[Pannonian Sea]] which dried out 200,000 years ago. Through about half of its length it passes through beautiful Bagrdan gorge (Bagrdanska klisura). In past centuries, it was known for its seemingly endless forests, but there is almost nothing left today of those old woods. It flows into the Danube between the villages of Kuli\u010d & Dubravica, in the coal mining basin of [[Kostolac]], one of two major mines in its drainage basin (the other one being [[Resava coal basin]], in valley of the Velika Morava's right tributary [[Resava (river)|Resava]]). The average discharge of the Velika Morava on its confluence with Danube is 255 m\u00b3/s (120 m\u00b3/s brought by Zapadna Morava, 100 m\u00b3/s by Ju\u017ena Morava, and 35 m\u00b3/s amounted by the Velika Morava itself).\n\n== Tributaries ==\n\nTributaries of the Velika Morava are short, the longest one being the [[Jasenica (river)|Jasenica]] (79&nbsp;km) and others rarely exceeding 50&nbsp;km. Right tributaries are: Jovanova\u010dka reka, Crnica, Ravanica, [[Resava (river)|Resava]] and [[Resavica River (Morava)|Resavica]] (or Resav\u010dina). Left tributaries are more numerous, including: Kaleni\u0107ka reka, [[Lugomir]], [[Belica River]], [[Lepenica (Great Morava)|Lepenica]], Ra\u010da, and [[Jasenica (river)|Jasenica]]. Many of them don't carry much water, but in rainy years, they are known for causing major floods, which has been a big problem for the entire Morava river system. Before it meets the Danube, the Velika Morava splits, creating a 47&nbsp;km long arm called the [[Jezava]], which flows into the Danube separately, in the town of [[Smederevo]]. It's joined by a longer (51&nbsp;km) river, the [[Ralja (river)|Ralja]], from the left.\n\n==Improvements==\nThe Velika Morava represents a textbook example of a [[meandering river]]. It used to be 245&nbsp;km long, but directly from its origin to the Danube, there is only 118&nbsp;km in distance; its [[meandering ratio]] is 118:245, one of the highest in Europe.\n\nThe river bed is 80\u2013200 m wide, and the depth as much as 10 m. Notorious for its flooding, the Morava has changed its course many times, and old river bends have become small lakes, known as ''moravi\u0161te''. Ju\u017ena Morava, with extremely high erosion in its drainage basin, brings huge amounts of silt which is elevating Velika Morava's river bed, making floods even more frequent.\n\nBeginning in 1966, huge works began on all three rivers to prevent future floodings. Series of reservoirs were made on tributaries (lakes [[Bovan (Aleksinac)|Bovan]], [[Lake \u0106elije|\u0106elije]], and others) and meanders were cut through, making river courses straightened, which made them shorter (in the case of the Velika Morava, from 245 to 185&nbsp;km). It was projected that it would shorten by as much as 152&nbsp;km, and that it would become navigable again.\n\nThe Morava and its tributaries still flood often, so its bed remains elevated, despite dozens of gravel-digging companies in cities and villages near the river's upper course ([[Lozovik]], [[Lugav\u010dina]], [[Lu\u010dica (Po\u017earevac)|Lu\u010dica]], [[Velika Plana]], etc.).\n\n==Navigation==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2018}}\nToday, Velika Morava is navigable for only 3&nbsp;km from its mouth. In the past it was navigable all the way to the city of [[\u0106uprija]], for about 3/4 of its length. But, as mentioned before, Velika Morava gets buried under the materials brought by the Ju\u017ena Morava.\n\nWhen the [[Land improvement|melioration]] program began in 1966, it was projected it would become navigable again, in the first phase to [[\u0106uprija]], and in the next all the way to [[Stala\u0107]], making it 100% navigable. None of this was accomplished. From time to time, the idea of digging [[Danube]]-Morava-[[Vardar]]-[[Aegean Sea]]<ref>http://danube-cooperation.com/danubius/2011/11/28/morava-vardar-axios-navigation-route/</ref><ref>See [[Thessaloniki#Economy]]</ref> a navigable canal pops up in the media.\n\nTechnical problems of making this waterway would be enormous (neither the Morava nor the Vardar are navigable), the usefulness of its creation is debatable (whether the route would be used much), and the estimated costs are deemed prohibitive.\n\n==Settlements==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nAlthough Morava valley has always been the most populous part of Serbia, disastrous floodings prevented people from settling on the river banks itself. The only urban settlement on the river banks is \u0106uprija, but it often suffers from floods (including several times in the 1990s).\n\nOther urban settlements, built a little further away from the river itself, include: [[Para\u0107in]], [[Jagodina]], [[Bato\u010dina]], [[Lapovo]], [[Svilajnac]], [[Velika Plana]], [[Po\u017earevac]] and [[Smederevo]]. Smaller places and villages include: [[Varvarin]], Glogovac, Markovac, Veliko Ora\u0161je, Milo\u0161evac and [[Lozovik]].\n\n==Tradition==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nThe Romans called it ''Margus'' (in addition to that, the Zapadna Morava was named ''Brongus'', and Ju\u017ena Morava was ''Angrus''). The modern-day city of \u0106uprija existed in Roman times as ''Horreum Margi'' (meaning \"The Granary of Margus\").\n\nIn Serbian history, its valley became the cradle of the modern Serbian state in the beginning of the 19th century (so called \"Moravian Serbia\"; Moravska Srbija). Many songs were written in celebration of Morava and its fertility, but most of them also talked about casualties and damages done by the river during floods.\n\nSongs are even made today about it; the most famous are: ''Oj Moravo'' (\"Oh, Morava\"), ''Moravo, tija reko'' (\"Morava, you quiet river\"), ''Uz Moravu vetar duva'' (\"Wind blows up the Morava\"), ''Na Moravi vodenica stara'' (\"Old mill on Morava\"), ''Moravac kolo'' (\"Morava [[kolo (dance)|kolo]]\"), etc.\n\n''Oj Moravo'' may be the most characteristic:\n\n:'Oj Moravo, moje selo ravno,\n:Kad si ravno \u0161to si vodoplavno\n\n:Ki\u0161a pade, te Morava do\u0111e,\n:Te poplavi moje selo ravno\n\n:A u selu Jovanove dvore,\n:I u dvoru Jovanovu ljubu'\n\n:''Oh, Morava, my plain village,''\n:''If it's so plain, why do you flood it''\n\n:''Rains came, so Morava rose,''\n:''And flooded my plain village''\n\n:''And in the village it flooded Jovan's home,''\n:''And in it, his loving wife'''\n\n==Works cited==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* ''Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija'', Third edition (1985); Prosveta; {{ISBN|86-07-00001-2}}\n* Jovan \u0110.

This combination of coat allows it to regulate its core temperature more efficiently, while the coat is dense enough to repel rupture from wolf bites.<ref name=\"Kangalbreed\"/>\nFurther differences between the KIF standard and those used internationally are found in the guidelines for coat and colour. The registered Kangal Shepherd Dog organizations in Turkey, Cynology Federation Of Turkey (KIF)\u2014to an extent\u2014and Ankara Kangal Derne\u011fi (ANKADER) do not regard coat colour as a breed defining feature. Brindle, recessive black tan pattern, white markings and a longer coat are regarded as Kangal and are not usually indicative of cross breeding, as the KIF standard as significant restrictions on accepted color and is more restrictive with respect to white markings than any of the other international standards, as white markings are only accepted on the chest and on the tip of the tail, whereas standards from other kennel clubs allow white markings on the feet and legs. Rather it is head structure and morphology that differentiate Kangal from other \u00c7oban K\u00f6pegi.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn contrast other kennel clubs describe coat and colour as perhaps the most visible traits that distinguish the Kangal from the [[Akbash dog|Akbash]] and [[Anatolian Shepherd Dog|Anatolian]]. The coat must be short and dense, not long or feathery, and of a pale fawn or tan color with varying amounts of sable guard hairs. All Kangal Shepherd Dogs have a [[Melanistic mask|black facial mask]], and black or shaded ears. White at certain points (chest, chin, toes) may or may not be allowed, depending on the standard. Some heavily sabled Kangals also have darker legs and chests. Most importantly, the coat should not be broken, [[brindle]]d, or spotted. Cropping of the ears is done for several reasons, including the cultural demonstration of ownership vice feral dog, for appearance and for protection, as long ears can be vulnerable in a physical confrontation with a predator.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The cropping of ears is illegal in the UK.\n<gallery>\nFile:TurkishKangal.jpg|A Kangal with cropped ears\nFile:Kangal dog puppy eating yoghurt.jpg|Kangal dog puppy eating yogurt\nFile:Kangal-welpen-de 010.jpg|The Kangal dog can be a good house dog if effectively trained from birth\nFile:Cobra-BlackMamba 2.jpg\nKral jrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Temperament==\nThe Kangal Shepherd Dog is calm, controlled, independent, powerful and protective. They may be aloof towards strangers, but a well-socialized [https://www.allaboutdogs.net/kangal-dog/ Kangal Dog] is friendly with visitors and especially children. They must never be shy or vicious. A well-trained Kangal Shepherd Dog is sensitive and alert to changing situations, responding to threats with judicious warnings and courageous action if necessary. They make good guardians of livestock and humans alike, but they may not be suitable for inexperienced dog owners, as the independent intelligence of the Kangal makes for a difficult pupil.\n\n=== Protective behavior ===\n[[File:Kangal dog with spikey collar, Turkey.jpg|thumb|Kangal Shepherd Dog on duty]]\nA working Kangal Shepherd Dog on duty will station itself on a high vantage point overlooking its flock. On hot days, the dog will dig itself a hollow in the ground to keep cool. Novices learn by staying close to older dogs. The dogs will work in pairs or teams depending on the size of the flock, taking up positions around the sheep and changing their positions as needed. The intensity of their patrols around the sheep increases at nightfall.\n\nWhen suspicious, a Kangal Shepherd Dog will stand with its tail and ears erect and give an alarm call, inciting the sheep to gather around it for protection. The Kangal Shepherd Dog's first instinct is to place itself between the perceived threat and the sheep or master. Once the sheep are safely behind it, the Kangal Shepherd Dog confronts the intruder. When faced with a [[wolf]], the Kangal Shepherd Dog sometimes is successful in intimidating the enemy, but it will resort to a physical confrontation if the predator stands its ground.<ref name=\"Kangalbreed\"/> Specialized wolf killers are known as \"kurt\u00e7ul kangal\" in their homeland.\n\n== Kangal/Anatolian Shepherd ==\nThe UK Kennel Club announced it will recognise the Kangal Shepherd Dog as a breed with effect from July 2013.

This combination of coat allows it to regulate its core temperature more efficiently, while the coat is dense enough to repel rupture from wolf bites.<ref name=\"Kangalbreed\"/>\nFurther differences between the KIF standard and those used internationally are found in the guidelines for coat and colour. The registered Kangal Shepherd Dog organizations in Turkey, Cynology Federation Of Turkey (KIF)\u2014to an extent\u2014and Ankara Kangal Derne\u011fi (ANKADER) do not regard coat colour as a breed defining feature. Brindle, recessive black tan pattern, white markings and a longer coat are regarded as Kangal and are not usually indicative of cross breeding, as the KIF standard as significant restrictions on accepted color and is more restrictive with respect to white markings than any of the other international standards, as white markings are only accepted on the chest and on the tip of the tail, whereas standards from other kennel clubs allow white markings on the feet and legs. Rather it is head structure and morphology that differentiate Kangal from other \u00c7oban K\u00f6pegi.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn contrast other kennel clubs describe coat and colour as perhaps the most visible traits that distinguish the Kangal from the [[Akbash dog|Akbash]] and [[Anatolian Shepherd Dog|Anatolian]]. The coat must be short and dense, not long or feathery, and of a pale fawn or tan color with varying amounts of sable guard hairs. All Kangal Shepherd Dogs have a [[Melanistic mask|black facial mask]], and black or shaded ears. White at certain points (chest, chin, toes) may or may not be allowed, depending on the standard. Some heavily sabled Kangals also have darker legs and chests. Most importantly, the coat should not be broken, [[brindle]]d, or spotted. Cropping of the ears is done for several reasons, including the cultural demonstration of ownership vice feral dog, for appearance and for protection, as long ears can be vulnerable in a physical confrontation with a predator.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The cropping of ears is illegal in the UK.\n<gallery>\nFile:TurkishKangal.jpg|A Kangal with cropped ears\nFile:Kangal dog puppy eating yoghurt.jpg|Kangal dog puppy eating yogurt\nFile:Kangal-welpen-de 010.jpg|The Kangal dog can be a good house dog if effectively trained from birth\nFile:Cobra-BlackMamba 2.jpg\nKral jrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Temperament==\nThe Kangal Shepherd Dog is calm, controlled, independent, powerful and protective. They may be aloof towards strangers, but a well-socialized [https://www.allaboutdogs.net/kangal-dog/ Kangal Dog] is friendly with visitors and especially children. They must never be shy or vicious. A well-trained Kangal Shepherd Dog is sensitive and alert to changing situations, responding to threats with judicious warnings and courageous action if necessary. They make good guardians of livestock and humans alike, but they may not be suitable for inexperienced dog owners, as the independent intelligence of the Kangal makes for a difficult pupil.\n\n=== Protective behavior ===\n[[File:Kangal dog with spikey collar, Turkey.jpg|thumb|Kangal Shepherd Dog on duty]]\nA working Kangal Shepherd Dog on duty will station itself on a high vantage point overlooking its flock. On hot days, the dog will dig itself a hollow in the ground to keep cool. Novices learn by staying close to older dogs. The dogs will work in pairs or teams depending on the size of the flock, taking up positions around the sheep and changing their positions as needed. The intensity of their patrols around the sheep increases at nightfall.\n\nWhen suspicious, a Kangal Shepherd Dog will stand with its tail and ears erect and give an alarm call, inciting the sheep to gather around it for protection. The Kangal Shepherd Dog's first instinct is to place itself between the perceived threat and the sheep or master. Once the sheep are safely behind it, the Kangal Shepherd Dog confronts the intruder. When faced with a [[wolf]], the Kangal Shepherd Dog sometimes is successful in intimidating the enemy, but it will resort to a physical confrontation if the predator stands its ground.<ref name=\"Kangalbreed\"/> Specialized wolf killers are known as \"kurt\u00e7ul kangal\" in their homeland.\n\n== Kangal/Anatolian Shepherd ==\nThe UK Kennel Club announced it will recognise the Kangal Shepherd Dog as a breed with effect from July 2013.

It is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and is a [[listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I]] [[listed building]]. The house was built between 1776 and 1783 for [[Sir Francis Sykes, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Sykes]] and designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr]] in the [[Palladian style]] at a time when Palladianism was giving way to the newly fashionable [[neoclassicism]]. Thus, the interiors are in a neoclassical [[Robert Adam|\"Adamesque\"]] style.\n\nNever fully completed, the house passed through a succession of owners. In 1910 it was standing empty and in 1914, it was requisitioned by the British Government as an army convalescent hospital. It was again sold in 1928 and quickly sold again. In 1929, following a failed attempt to dismantle and rebuild the house in the USA, it was stripped of many of its fixtures and fittings and all but abandoned.\n\nDuring World War II, the house was again requisitioned and served as a barracks, a training ground for tanks, and finally a prisoner of war camp\u2014all activities unsuited to the preservation of an already semi-derelict building. In 1952, a time when hundreds of British country houses were being demolished, it was said of Basildon Park \"to say it was derelict, is hardly good enough, no window was left intact and most were repaired with cardboard or plywood.\"<ref name=\"Basildon Park p4\">Lady Iliffe writing in ''Basildon Park'', p4.</ref>\n\nToday, Basildon Park is as notable for its mid-twentieth-century renaissance and restoration, by [[Langton Iliffe, 2nd Baron Iliffe|Lord and Lady Iliffe]], as it is for its architecture. In 1978, the Iliffes gave the house, together with its park and a large endowment for its upkeep, to the National Trust in the hope that \"The National Trust will protect it and its park for future generations to enjoy.\"<ref name=\"Basildon Park p4\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Charles ffane, 1st Viscount fane by John Vanderbank.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Charles Fane, 1st Viscount Fane|Charles ffane]], (1676-1744), PC (I), DL (Berks), created Viscount Fane in 1718. Inherited Basildon from his father [[Henry Fane (died 1706)|Sir Henry Fane]], KB, in 1705/6. His wife, who died in 1762, built the renowned<ref>Elizabeth Montagu, the Queen of the Bluestockings: Her Correspondence from 1720 to 1761, Volume 1</ref> grotto at the riverside ''New House'', which also served as the mansion's [[dower house]].]]\n\nBasildon is first documented in 1311 when it was granted by the crown to Elias de Colleshull.<ref name=\"Pugh, p34\">Pugh, p34.</ref> During the 16th and early 17th centuries, the manor of Basildon was held by the Yonge family. In 1654, the Basildon estate was purchased probably on behalf of Royalist Colonel [[George Fane]] by his brother-in-law [[Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath|the 5th Earl of Bath]] who died the same year (confusion as to for whom bought caused the political state of the country at the time and by George Fane's premature death). Lord Bath's widow, the former Lady Rachael Fane, bequeathed the estate to her nephew [[Henry Fane (died 1706)|Sir Henry Fane]], George Fane's son. Little is known of Basildon during the Fane ownership, but a mansion house was built with Gothic lodges. These lodges survive and serve the present house. The manor remained a Fane possession until it was offered for sale in 1766 by the heirs of the [[Charles, 2nd Viscount Fane|2nd Viscount Fane]], essentially, his two married sisters [[Dorothy Montagu, Countess of Sandwich|Dorothy Montagu]] and [[Jerome, 2nd Count de Salis|Mary de Salis]].<ref name=\"Pugh, p34\"/><ref>English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest.</ref>\n[[File:CoverofLettertoCharlesffane1714.jpg|thumb|60px|<sub>Cover of a letter: ''To Charles ffane, Esq., att Basseldon, neare Reading, Berks'', April 1714.<ref>Fane de Salis MSS</ref></sub>]]\n[[File:MaryStanhopeMaryffane.jpg|thumb|60px|<sub>Viscountess Fane (1686-1762). Mary Stanhope, sister of [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|James Stanhope]], who married [[Charles Fane, 1st Viscount Fane|Charles, 1st Viscount Fane]] in 1707, and was thus associated with Basildon for 55 years.</sub>]]\t\n\nThe estate was purchased in 1771 by Sir Francis Sykes. Having made a fortune in India, Sykes returned to England to realise his social and political ambitions. For these to be fulfilled, Sykes required a grand estate conveniently close to London; he built Basildon Park to serve that purpose.\n\n=== 18th century ===\nBasildon Park was built for Sir [[Sir Francis Sykes, 1st Baronet|Francis Sykes]]. Born in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1732, the son of a yeoman farmer, he left his native country to make his fortune in India. He joined the [[British East India Company]] and amassed a fortune in [[Bengal]], at the court of the [[Nawab of Bengal|Nawab]]. He later became Governor of [[Kasimbazar]] and became what was then known as a [[Nawab|nabob]], a title derived from the Indian \"Nawab.\"\n\n[[File:Francis Sykes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sir Francis Sykes, for whom Basildon Park was built.]]\n\nReturning to England in 1769, possessed of vast wealth (estimated at between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000) he purchased [[Ackworth Park]] in his native [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\">Sykes, Oxford DNB.</ref> In 1770, he acquired the Gillingham Manor estate, Dorset, an estate of some {{convert|2200|acre|km2}}. This purchase enabled him to become Member of Parliament for the constituency of Shaftsbury. To further his political aspirations he required a house suitable for entertaining and indicative of his wealth conveniently nearer to London than the distant counties of Yorkshire and Dorset.\n\nBasildon fitted Sykes' requirement well, not only politically, but also socially. At this time this area of Berkshire was home to so many of the newly rich returned from India that it was referred to as \"the English Hindoostan.\"<ref name=\"Pugh, p34\"/> Sykes' close friend [[Warren Hastings]] was already resident in the area, and another friend, [[Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive|the 1st Lord Clive]], (better known as Clive of India) had himself attempted to buy Basildon in 1767.<ref>Pugh, p36</ref>\n\nFrom the moment Sykes purchased the Basildon site in 1771, his good fortune changed. The commencement of work on the house was delayed until 1776 as a result of the crash of the East India Company's shares, which caused Sykes to lose \u00a310,000 in a single day.<ref>Pugh, p36.</ref> Shortly afterwards, his and Clive's activities as part of the Bengal Administration were investigated by Parliament. Sykes as the Bengali Tax Collector had levied unjust taxes and was publicly censured. Two years later, in 1774, while Sykes was still a subject of public opprobrium, his finances suffered further when allegations of corruption pertaining to his constituency were made against him. As a result, he lost his parliamentary seat and was forced to pay \u00a311,000 in compensation.<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\"/>\n\nFinally, in 1776, work on Basildon began and lasted for the remainder of Sykes' life. Although his finances continued to dwindle and he was throughout his life to be vilified as an \"archetypal nabob\", he managed to regain his political and social lives.<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\"/> He was created a baronet in 1781, and became MP for Wallingford in 1784.<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\"/> As Sykes aged, work on Basildon slowed. This may have been for financial reasons or just because of a lack of momentum due to family disappointments. A younger son was drowned in 1786 and Sykes' heir proved to be dissipated and a further drain on Sykes' resources.<ref name=\"Pugh, p37\">Pugh, p37.</ref>\n\nSykes died at his London house on 11 January 1804. His body was returned to Basildon for burial in [[St Bartholomew's Church, Lower Basildon]].<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\"/> and placed in a previously owned 14th century chest tomb.<ref>{{PastScape\n | mnumber = 241309\n | mname = St Bartholomews Church\n | accessdate = 2 July 2010\n }}</ref> At Basildon Park, the principal rooms remained unfinished.\n\n=== 19th century ===\n[[File:JameMorrison 1789-1857.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The entrepreneur [[James Morrison (businessman)|James Morrison]]. His ownership of the mansion saw it completed and filled with treasures.]]\nOn Sir Francis Sykes' death, Basildon was inherited by his son, Sir Francis Sykes (2nd Baronet) who died a few weeks later. The house then passed to his grandson, the five-year-old Sir Francis (3rd Baronet). By this time, the Sykes fortune was almost spent and Basildon was already mortgaged. The family finances suffered further as a result of the 3rd Baronet's association with the extravagant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. Aged just 14, he entertained the Prince at Basildon. As a result of the Prince's occupation of the North side of the second floor, where the best bedrooms are located, for many years afterwards this range of rooms were known as \"The Regent's Side\" as opposed to the family's less formal rooms on the South side of the floor.<ref>Pugh, p24.</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1820s, Sykes was suffering serious financial problems, and in 1829, the estate was placed on the market.<ref name=\"Pugh, p37\"/> The house was not quickly sold, as Sykes refused to accept any price less than \u00a3100,000. During this period, the house was often let. However, Sykes and his family were in residence between 1834 and 1835 when the future Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] was a house-guest at Basildon. Disraeli, who was the lover of Sykes' wife Henrietta, immortalised her along with some descriptions of Basildon and its rooms in his novel, ''[[Henrietta Temple: A Love Story]]''.<ref>Pugh, p ?</ref> Another romantic attachment of Lady Sykes was to result in her husband being immortalised in a novel, this time in a less flattering light. Lady Sykes had been conducting an affair with the painter [[Daniel Maclise]]. Her husband publicly denounced Maclise, causing an unacceptable high society scandal. As a result, [[Charles Dickens]], a friend of Maclise, then writing ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', based his villainous and cruel character [[Bill Sikes]] on Sir Francis.<ref>Williams.</ref>\n\nIn 1838, as ''Oliver Twist'' was published, Sykes, out of funds and publicly humiliated, finally sold Basildon Park for just \u00a33,000 less than the \u00a3100,000 he had been seeking.\n\nBasildon's interiors were now finally completed and the estate had a seventy-year period of security. The new owner was [[James Morrison (businessman)|James Morrison]], a Hampshire born, self-made millionaire. From humble beginnings as an employee of a London haberdasher, he had married his employer's daughter, entered into partnership with his father-in-law and expanded the business. By 1820, Morrison was possessed of a fortune he was investing wisely to become one of Victorian England's wealthiest men. A politician, between 1830 and 1847, he was one time MP for [[St Ives (UK Parliament constituency)|St Ives]], [[Ipswich]] and the [[Inverness]] [[burgh]]s.\n\nIn addition to Basildon, Morrison owned several estates, including [[Fonthill Gifford|Fonthill]] and [[Islay]]. The mansions provided a setting for his huge art collection, which included works by [[John Constable|Constable]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and many Italian and Dutch [[old master]]s. Basildon was to be the setting for some of his finest works.\n\nTo create that setting, Morrison employed the architect [[John Buonarotti Papworth]]. At Basildon, Papworth combined the roles of architect and interior decorator, helping to create what Morrison described as \"a casket for my pictorial gems.\"<ref>Pugh, p39.</ref> Many of Papworth's more ambitious plans were not realised; the demolition and replacement by colonnades of the yards, the conversion of a courtyard into a sculpture gallery, and the creation of a carriage ramp to the [[piano nobile]] on the East front were all declined by Morrison. However, the house was fitted up with a hot water system and fire precautions, and the decoration of the principal reception rooms was completed in suitably classical styles.\n\nMorrison died at Basildon on 30 October 1857.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:BasildonRoseGarden.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The South Pavilion and corps de logis. In 1978, the South Pavilion (the former laundry) was converted into a private house for Lord and Lady Iliffe following their donation of the main house to the National Trust.]]\nBasildon Park was occupied by James Morrison's unmarried daughter, Ellen, until her death in 1910. Her demise marked the beginning of a downward turn in Basildon's history. The house and estate were inherited by a nephew, James Morrison. Initially, he improved the estate and its buildings, commissioning the architect [[Edwin Lutyens]] to design workers' cottages in the neighbouring villages. However, he never occupied the house, using it only for occasional shooting parties.<ref name=\"Pugh, p42\">Pugh, p42.</ref> In 1914, the house was requisitioned by the British Government and used as a convalescent home for injured soldiers, suffering the attendant damage which accompanies institutional use.\n\nDuring the war Basildon's owner served with distinction, obtaining the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and, according to [[Harold Macmillan]], always \"insisted on walking rather than crawling under enemy fire.\"<ref>Pugh. p42.</ref> Surprisingly, considering the form in which his courage manifested itself, Morrison survived the war. However, his love of shooting, a lavish lifestyle and three marriages led to such a serious decline in his fortunes that in 1929, he was forced to sell the Basildon estate.<ref name=\"Pugh, p42\"/><ref name=\"The Times pg. 16\">The Times, Tuesday, 16 July 1929; pg. 16; Issue 45256</ref>\n\nThe new purchaser was the 1st Lord Iliffe. He wished to expand and consolidate his estate at nearby Yattendon, where he had built a new house. He immediately annexed the estate from house and park back, stripped the mansion of some doors and fireplaces for his London house, and placed the house back on the market.<ref name=\"Pugh, p42\"/>\n\nThus it was that in 1929 Basildon Park was purchased by a property developer, George Ferdinando.<ref name=\"Pugh, p2\">Pugh, p2.</ref> who bought the estate as park land. George Ferdinando was 65 when he bought the house and as his children were grown up his wife was unwilling to take on another large house and so he produced a sales notice, the idea being to sell the house as one lot in America. Encouraged by the then current fashion amongst wealthy American citizens for inhabiting ancient European houses and palazzi, Ferdinando produced a sales brochure advertising Basildon to any American citizen for $1,000,000. For this sum, he promised to \"carefully take it down\" and \"re-erect in America\", thus providing an opportunity to \"Any patriotic American wishing to benefit his native state by presenting this imposing building \u2026 ready for occupation as a private residence, museum, college building or public library.\"<ref name=\"Pugh, p2\"/> Fortunately he had a change of heart and decided instead to convert the old sawmill at the top of the park into a house for himself and his wife. George also persuaded one of his sons Eric to return from America where he was a cotton grower with his young family to live in the south pavilion then called the east wing. Eric then oversaw the return of fixtures and fittings such as the stair balustrade, the renovation and running of the house and estate. No evidence is available to say whether it was George Ferdinando, the first Lord Iliffe or the executors of the Morrison estate who sold off the dining room fixtures. However elements from the Dining Room have been reused in the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York and doorcases designed by John Carr are in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],<ref>[[Yvonne Hackenbroch]], ''The Untermyer Collection: Furniture'' 1958, fig. 387.</ref>  the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]],<ref>The Dining-Room chimneypiece and decorative paintings and the doorcases are noted in John Harris, ''Moving Rooms: The Trade in Architectural Salvages'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007:235.</ref> and the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.<ref>A doorcase from the \"Drawing Room\", noted in Quincy Lee, \"Catalogue of British Old Master Paintings in the Collection of the Louisiana State University Museum of Art\" ([http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04152009-092929/unrestricted/leethesis.pdf on-line text]).</ref><ref name=\"Pugh, p43\">Pugh, p43.</ref>\n\nWorld War II saw Basildon used as a billet for troops, while the park became a training ground for troops deployed in tank and ground warfare. George Ferdinando continued to live at Basildon during this time. Eric served in the navy during the war and on his return set about mending the walls that had been damaged by bridging units used on the river and the huge holes left in the demolition area. The house was then requisitioned for the Ministry of Works, whose caretaker stole the lead from the roofs.<ref name=\"Pugh, p14\">Pugh, p14.</ref> He was caught and imprisoned for two years. Unfortunately the ministry were only willing to pay back one tenth of the cost of the repair to the roof and other damage done including a fire. Having lived at Basildon now for twenty years George moved to Shoreham-by-sea in Sussex where he died in 1949,<ref>Probate, George Samuel Ferdinando. Ancestry.com.

Surname Range : ''Eaborn-Gysin, 1950.''</ref> but was buried in Basildon. Unable to foot the cost of repairing the house and the inheritance tax the house had to be sold and Eric and family moved to the converted barn house formerly part of the estate. The second Lord Iliffe, who lived in the area, visited the house at this point which was in rather a sad state. However, encouraged by the potential she saw in the mansion, Lady Iliffe persuaded her husband to buy it. This was the beginning of Basildon Park's salvation and renaissance.\n\nUnder the direction of the Iliffes (later the [[Langton Iliffe, 2nd Baron Iliffe|2nd Baron and Lady Iliffe]]), Basildon was completely restored and refurnished. This was achieved over a period of 25 years. Many fixtures and fittings were purchased from similar houses in a greater state of dereliction prior to their demolition. While often the Iliffes found great bargains, obtaining 18th-century mahogany doors and marble fireplaces, at other times their luck was less favourable; Lady Iliffe recalled attending the [[Mentmore Towers]] auction of 1975 with the intention of buying marble topped console tables for Basildon, but through economic necessity returned with only a coal-scuttle.<ref name=\"Lady Iliffe p4\">Lady Iliffe, ''Basildon Park'', p4.</ref>\n\n== Architectural appraisal ==\n\n[[File:BasildonParkedited.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The corps de logis at the centre of the West facade.]]\nBasildon Park was begun in 1772; the architect, [[John Carr of York]], was one of the leading architects in northern England. His work was initially influenced by the Palladian architects, the [[Earl of Burlington]] and [[William Kent]] and later by the neoclassicism of [[Robert Adam]].<ref>[http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&id=00000000007 The Royal Institution of Great Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622073857/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&id=00000000007 |date=22 June 2010 }}</ref> At Basildon, Carr's most southerly commission,<ref name=\"Pugh, p6\">Pugh, p6.</ref> both these architectural influences can be discerned. It has been speculated that the principal facade, the West Front, was inspired by [[Palladio]]'s [[Villa Emo]].<ref>Pugh, p6, mentions this speculation as \"probable.\"</ref> Whatever the inspiration, it was one Carr relied on heavily in his work, and it can be seen again most evidently in his designs for [[:File:Newark Town Hall.jpg|Newark Town Hall]].\n\nThe mansion consists of the three quite separate blocks, but indistinctly so. The three floored [[corps de logis]] contains the principal rooms, and two flanking pavilions of two floors each; the north designed to contain the Kitchen, Scullery and Housekeeper's Room and the south to contain the Laundry and Dairy. The upper floor of each pavilion contained accommodation for servants. This arrangement, of a central block flanked by pavilions, is original to Palladio's concept; however, in England Palladianism (a form of architecture based only loosely on Palladio's concepts) had evolved to a point that where Palladio had filled the distance between corps de logis and the flanking blocks with a void space or colonnade. The evolved 18th-century Palladianism usually filled the space with long wings containing [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilades]] of rooms. At Basildon, the architect used windowed walls to create service courts in the void. This had the double advantage of not only unifying the facade, but also (in a comparatively small mansion) of creating a discrete space for utilitarian stores, [[Toilet|lavatories]] and the drying of clothes.<ref name=\"Pugh, p6\"/>\n\n===Exterior===\n[[File:BasildonParkedited3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Basildon Park, the East front.]]\n\nThe principal facade is the long West facade of the corps de logis and its flanking pavilions. Built of [[Bath stone]], the three-storied rectangular corps de logis has a [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] ground floor, with a piano nobile above and a bedroom floor above this. This block is of seven bays; the central three bays are behind a recessed [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[portico]]. Entrance to the mansion is by three segmented arches under the portico, or more formally, by climbing a [[double staircase|double curved staircase]] behind the three arches. The stairs rise to an open loggia beneath the portico which gives access to the mansion's principal entrance. The [[wikt:fenestration|fenestration]] is designed to indicate the status of their floor. Thus, small windows indicate the domestic ground floor and secondary upper floor, while the windows of the first floor piano nobile are tall and large. These larger windows are unified along the full length of the facade extending on to the pavilions by a [[balustrading]] beneath them which continues the line of the balustrading protecting the central loggia. The roofline is concealed by a high [[parapet]] concealing the roofs themselves and broken only by the portico's pediment. This pediment is echoed as a smaller pediment over both of the two-storied pavilions.\n\nIn contrast to the Palladianism of the West front, the East front is austere in its neoclassicism. It projects from the flanking pavilions, which on this side of the house are partially screened by planting. The fenestration which is concentrated on the broad bay at the centre of the facade provides the essential rhythm and relief.<ref>Musson, p76, explains the concept of such neoclassical facades.</ref> Above the second floor, a balustrade not only hides the roof, but unites the projecting bay with its flanking bays.\n\n===Interior===\n\nThe corps de logis (central block) is built on the three floors. In the 18th century, such floors (known, because of their outer brickwork, as \"the Rustic\") would have been used by both the owners and their servants. The Rustic contained the wine cellars, Servants' Hall, estate offices, and secondary reception rooms.<ref name=\"Girouard, p206\">Girouard, p206.</ref> This is very much the case at Basildon where the former Servants' Hall is now the ground floor visitors' tea room and the former Summer Breakfast Room (beneath the Octagon Drawing Room) which later saw service as a billiard room, is now a lecture room for the mansion's paying visitors. The lower hall, beneath the first floor hall, was the everyday entrance to the mansion for the family.<ref>Pugh, p28.</ref>\n\n[[File:Baspianonobile.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'''The first floor'''. 1: The four service courts; 2: Portico and West front; 3: North Pavilion; 4: South Pavilion; 5: Entrance Hall; 6: Staircase Hall; 7: Octagon Drawing Room; 8: Dining Room; 9: Study; 10: Library; 11: Sutherland Room (formerly lady Iliffe's sitting room); 12: Kitchen (since 1952); 13: larder (?); 14: Green Drawing Room (formerly Breakfast or Small Dining Room).\n]]\n\n===The first floor===\n\nThe first floor was designed to be a [[piano nobile]] (meaning literally a \"noble floor\"); as its name suggests, it contains the principal rooms of the house. During the 1770s, when Basildon was built, a domestic and architectural movement from formality towards informality was in progress. Thus, while the exterior of Basildon is pure symmetry, this symmetry is not reflected in the interior layout of the rooms as would have been the case just a few years earlier.<ref>Girouard, p212, explains this movement.</ref> In any case, the builder of Basildon was not eminent enough to require a suite of state apartments on the piano nobile in permanent expectation of a royal visit. Thus, in keeping with this newly found spirit of informality Basildon has no formal and symmetrical [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms of increasing splendour, but two separate first floor suites, one feminine and one masculine, were placed on either side of the hall. '''The library''' (''10 on plan''), considered a masculine room, was placed next to the owner Sir Francis Sykes' dressing room (''9'') while on the opposite side of the hall (''11 and 12'') were the bedroom and dressing room of Lady Sykes.<ref>Pugh, p10.</ref> Sir Francis appears not to have had a bedroom on this floor, an arrangement not uncommon in the 18th century, when a dressing room served as a study and reception room combined\u2014the owner would descend from his bedroom above to the dressing room and receive business callers while the finishing touches were made to his dressing by a servant.<ref name=\"Girouard, p206\"/> Lady Sykes' dressing room or boudoir (''11 on first floor plan''), also used as private sitting room by the late Lady Iliffe, is now known as the '''Sutherland Room'''; it is currently used to display some of the studies by the 20th-century artist [[Graham Sutherland]] for his tapestry \"Christ in Glory\" at [[Coventry Cathedral]].<ref>Pugh, p12.</ref>\n\nThe principal receptions are a communicating circuit of rooms designed for entertaining. This was a late 18th-century feature, first introduced by the architect [[Matthew Brettingham]] in 1750.<ref>Girouard, pp194\u2013195.</ref>\n\n'''The Hall''' is the principal entrance to the house which would have been used by any eminent guests; entering the house by climbing the double staircase beneath the portico the guest immediately sees, through a gilded doorcase, a short enfilade through the staircase hall to the Octagon drawing room. While the hall in its use was not comparable with the [[Great Hall]] of earlier manor houses, it was still more than a mere entrance vestibule; in the 18th century, it was considered that any house of note required three principal reception rooms when entertaining: one for dancing, one for supper and one for cards.<ref>Girouard, p199.</ref> Thus, the hall, dining room and Octagon Drawing Room would fulfil those roles.\n\nThe hall retains more of its original neoclassical decorative features than many other rooms in the house; the walls' plasterwork panels and ceiling are all original, as are the Spanish mahogany doors (these had been removed during the 1920s, but were returned to the house in 1954). Only the white marble fireplace is not original to the house, but salvaged from the now demolished Panton Hall. The furniture in the room, against the walls in 18th-century fashion, is in the style of [[William Kent]].\n\n'''The Staircase Hall''' is at the centre of the house and is considered to be one of Carr's \"most monumental interiors.\"<ref name=\"Pugh, p14\"/> Typically of this period, the double height room is lit by a [[clerestory]] while the wide [[cantilever]]ed staircase, the Great Staircase, rises in flights around three of the four walls, to a gallery.<ref>Musson, p98, explains the 18th-century staircase.</ref> The balustrading of the staircase and landing is of gilded wrought iron adorned with medallions with classical motifs which were heavily restored in 1952.<ref name=\"Pugh, p14\"/> The groundfloor walls beneath the gallery are decorated with some of Carr's neoclassical plasterwork depicted in white against the eau de nil<ref>''Nilewater'', a pale tint of [[cyan]].</ref> colour of the walls. Recent analysis of the paint has shown that the walls were originally a pale stone colour and the staircase balustrade was painted blue with gilded figures on the (blue) plaques.<ref>[[Patrick Baty]] Basildon Park, Berkshire. A Report on the Decorative Schemes following an Examination of a Number of Elements in the Great Staircase. 11 April 2009.</ref>\n\nThe Great Staircase, which rises only between the first and second floors, is just one of three staircases all within metres of the other at the centre of the house. A narrow spiral stair, concealed in one of the cut off corners of the Octagon Drawing Room rises from the ground floor to the roof, while \"the backstairs\" is another large staircase lit by the same clerestory as the Great Staircase; this rises from the ground floor to the second floor.\n\nThe '''Octagon Drawing Room''' (''7 on first floor plan'') completes the short enfilade beginning at the front door. It is the principal room of the house. Unfinished by Carr, the room has an ornate gilded ceiling with recessed panels in the Italian Renaissance style, installed in 1840. Of the room's eight sides, three have windows forming a large bay, at the centre of which is a large [[Venetian window]] echoing the Palladian inspiration of the mansion. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries this room was used to display the finest art its owners possessed. Today, hung with red felt, it contains works by [[Pompeo Batoni]] and [[Giambattista Pittoni]]. The room contains fine neoclassical furniture, including items made to designs by Robert Adam, and curtains originally made for the state rooms of [[Blenheim Palace]].<ref>Pugh, p22, suggests the curtains were made for the Grand Cabinet at Blenheim Palace.</ref>\n\n[[File:Basildon Room by Matthew Bisanz 41.JPG|right|200px|thumb|The Basildon Room, The Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The room contains the original fireplace, mirrors and wall and ceiling paintings from the Dining Room of Basildon Park. The ceiling and plaster \"loop and bow\" panel design closely resembles that of the Basildon Dining Room.]]\n\nThe '''Dining Room''' (''marked 8 on first floor plan'') is one of the rooms most frequently changed since the completion of the mansion. Yet today it closely resembles its original form. Sited on the first floor of the corps de logis, some distance from the original kitchen (on the ground floor of the North Pavilion), the Dining Room is decorated in a neoclassical style inspired by the work of Robert Adam. The ceiling is divided into geometric panels by ornate plasterwork. Each panel originally contained a painted [[lunette]] or medallion by [[Theodore de Bruyn]], depicting a classical scene in [[grisaille]]. The walls too have plaster panels which contained medallions, matching those of the ceiling.\n\nIn 1845, the room was redecorated by the architect [[David Brandon (architect)|David Brandon]], who replaced Bruyn's paintings with polychrome depictions of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. The walls to which Brandon added mirrors, however, retained much of their 18th-century plasterwork. In 1929, the owner, George Ferdinando, stripped the dining room of its painted panels, mirrors, fireplace and doors and sold them to a firm of architectural antique dealers, Crowther's. The Dining Room's former decorations then crossed the Atlantic. Today, they form the Basildon Room of New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel.<ref name=\"Pugh, p43\"/>\n\nIn 1952, the new owners, Lord and Lady Iliffe, had the now bare room painted by the decorator [[John Beresford Fowler|John Fowler]] and transformed it to a drawing room. During the late 20th century, the artist Alec Cobbe was employed to redecorate the room in a style similar to the original scheme by de Bruyn. Much of Carr's \"loops and bows\" plasterwork had survived, and this, coupled with a fireplace and doors salvaged from [[Panton, Lincolnshire|Panton Hall]] and very similar to those which crossed the Atlantic, allowed the room to return to its original neoclassical form.<ref name=\"Pugh, p16\">Pugh, p16.</ref>\n\n'''The Kitchen''' was originally in the North pavilion. The concept of placing kitchens in a separate block to the house (and dining room) was a practice which had begun in the 1680s to prevent kitchen smells pervading the main house. Thus, Palladio's idea of a villa flanked by pavilions (intended to house farm animals) suited this practice admirably. However, the need for symmetry meant a balancing second pavilion was required. Therefore, it was common, as at Blenheim Palace, for the kitchen to be balanced by a chapel or an orangery, or for the less spiritual, a brewery or, as at a Basildon, a laundry.<ref>Girouard, p151.</ref> This meant that at Basildon, hot food \"''en route''\" to the dining room had to cross an open courtyard in all weathers, be taken through the ground floor of the mansion up the back stairs, cross the second floor and then be laid behind a colonnaded screen in the dining room before being finally served.<ref name=\"Pugh, p16\"/> During the modernisations at Basildon in the 1950s, Lady Iliffe had a new and state of the art kitchen installed on the piano nobile in the former bedroom allotted to former ladies of the house (''12 on first floor plan''). This solved the problem of hot food. The new kitchen is now open to the public as a nostalgic 1950s set museum piece, containing kitchen appliances and food stuffs and packaging contemporary to the mid 20th century. This is shown in the same fashion as the remainder of the house.\n\n[[File:Basupper.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'''The second floor'''. 1: Lady Iliffe's bedroom; 2: Shell Room; 3: Dressing Room; 4: Bamboo Bedroom; 5: Crimson Bedroom; 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 & 12: Bedrooms closed to the public; 10: Green Chintz Room; 13: [[Clerestory]] giving light to the Staircase Hall, concealed from sight by the roofline.]]\n\n'''The Green Drawing Room''' is between the Octagon Drawing room and the new kitchen. It had always previously been used as a breakfast room or small dining room, less formal than the Dining Room itself. When the National Trust took over management of the house, the room was refurnished and displayed as a drawing room. The room has a moulded plaster neoclassical ceiling and is hung with green silk which was formerly curtains at Englefield House, Berkshire. The white marble fireplace in this room is one of the few original to the house.\n\n===The second floor===\nThe second floor was designed to be of considerably less importance than the piano nobile below, which is indicated externally by the smaller windows. However, unlike in a [[Baroque]] house of just a few years earlier, it was not reserved for lesser guests, children and servants, as is evident by its approach from a monumentally grand staircase.\n\n== Basildon and its future ==\nAt the time of its building, the design of Basildon was already old-fashioned. From 1750s onwards large houses were being built without a rustic, and having the principal floor on the ground was becoming commonplace. Basildon, with its piano nobile, large portico denoting status, and main facade falsely elongated by fenestrated walls, was never innovative architecture, but, like many other houses, was built to bolster the status of its owner, the newly rich Sir Francis Sykes, keen for a political career.\n\nBasildon is not one of the great houses of Britain; houses of similar style and size exist the length of the country.

At a time when it was near ruin and its destruction seemed inevitable, it was saved. Since 1900, over 1,000 country houses,<ref name=V&A/> many of far greater architectural importance than Basildon, have been demolished. The destruction of many of these houses began as a trickle just prior to [[World War I]], but became a tidal wave in 1955, when one house was demolished every five days.<ref name=V&A>{{cite web | publisher = Victoria and Albert Museum | url = http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/architecture/past/save/index.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060825134010/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/architecture/past/save/index.html | archivedate = 25 August 2006 | title = PAST EXHIBITIONS: SAVE Britain\u2019s Heritage 1975-2005: 30 Years of Campaigning, 3 November 2005 \u2013 12 February 2006}}</ref> The destruction did not halt until 1975,<ref name=V&A/> by which time the Iliffe's restoration work at Basildon was almost completed.\n\nIn 1978, the Iliffes gave the house, together with its park and a large endowment for its upkeep, to the National Trust, enabling the house to provide a paying public with not only an insight to the interior of a grand house during both the 18th and 19th centuries, but also a rare view of how such houses were adapted to suit a more modern life-style during the last half of the 20th century.

It is owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and is a [[listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I]] [[listed building]]. The house was built between 1776 and 1783 for [[Sir Francis Sykes, 1st Baronet|Sir Francis Sykes]] and designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr]] in the [[Palladian style]] at a time when Palladianism was giving way to the newly fashionable [[neoclassicism]]. Thus, the interiors are in a neoclassical [[Robert Adam|\"Adamesque\"]] style.\n\nNever fully completed, the house passed through a succession of owners. In 1910 it was standing empty and in 1914, it was requisitioned by the British Government as an army convalescent hospital. It was again sold in 1928 and quickly sold again. In 1929, following a failed attempt to dismantle and rebuild the house in the USA, it was stripped of many of its fixtures and fittings and all but abandoned.\n\nDuring World War II, the house was again requisitioned and served as a barracks, a training ground for tanks, and finally a prisoner of war camp\u2014all activities unsuited to the preservation of an already semi-derelict building. In 1952, a time when hundreds of British country houses were being demolished, it was said of Basildon Park \"to say it was derelict, is hardly good enough, no window was left intact and most were repaired with cardboard or plywood.\"<ref name=\"Basildon Park p4\">Lady Iliffe writing in ''Basildon Park'', p4.</ref>\n\nToday, Basildon Park is as notable for its mid-twentieth-century renaissance and restoration, by [[Langton Iliffe, 2nd Baron Iliffe|Lord and Lady Iliffe]], as it is for its architecture.

His wife, who died in 1762, built the renowned<ref>Elizabeth Montagu, the Queen of the Bluestockings: Her Correspondence from 1720 to 1761, Volume 1</ref> grotto at the riverside ''New House'', which also served as the mansion's [[dower house]].]]\n\nBasildon is first documented in 1311 when it was granted by the crown to Elias de Colleshull.<ref name=\"Pugh, p34\">Pugh, p34.</ref> During the 16th and early 17th centuries, the manor of Basildon was held by the Yonge family. In 1654, the Basildon estate was purchased probably on behalf of Royalist Colonel [[George Fane]] by his brother-in-law [[Henry Bourchier, 5th Earl of Bath|the 5th Earl of Bath]] who died the same year (confusion as to for whom bought caused the political state of the country at the time and by George Fane's premature death). Lord Bath's widow, the former Lady Rachael Fane, bequeathed the estate to her nephew [[Henry Fane (died 1706)|Sir Henry Fane]], George Fane's son. Little is known of Basildon during the Fane ownership, but a mansion house was built with Gothic lodges. These lodges survive and serve the present house. The manor remained a Fane possession until it was offered for sale in 1766 by the heirs of the [[Charles, 2nd Viscount Fane|2nd Viscount Fane]], essentially, his two married sisters [[Dorothy Montagu, Countess of Sandwich|Dorothy Montagu]] and [[Jerome, 2nd Count de Salis|Mary de Salis]].<ref name=\"Pugh, p34\"/><ref>English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest.</ref>\n[[File:CoverofLettertoCharlesffane1714.jpg|thumb|60px|<sub>Cover of a letter: ''To Charles ffane, Esq., att Basseldon, neare Reading, Berks'', April 1714.<ref>Fane de Salis MSS</ref></sub>]]\n[[File:MaryStanhopeMaryffane.jpg|thumb|60px|<sub>Viscountess Fane (1686-1762).

Having made a fortune in India, Sykes returned to England to realise his social and political ambitions. For these to be fulfilled, Sykes required a grand estate conveniently close to London; he built Basildon Park to serve that purpose.\n\n=== 18th century ===\nBasildon Park was built for Sir [[Sir Francis Sykes, 1st Baronet|Francis Sykes]]. Born in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1732, the son of a yeoman farmer, he left his native country to make his fortune in India. He joined the [[British East India Company]] and amassed a fortune in [[Bengal]], at the court of the [[Nawab of Bengal|Nawab]]. He later became Governor of [[Kasimbazar]] and became what was then known as a [[Nawab|nabob]], a title derived from the Indian \"Nawab.\"\n\n[[File:Francis Sykes.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Sir Francis Sykes, for whom Basildon Park was built.]]\n\nReturning to England in 1769, possessed of vast wealth (estimated at between \u00a3250,000 and \u00a3500,000) he purchased [[Ackworth Park]] in his native [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\">Sykes, Oxford DNB.</ref> In 1770, he acquired the Gillingham Manor estate, Dorset, an estate of some {{convert|2200|acre|km2}}. This purchase enabled him to become Member of Parliament for the constituency of Shaftsbury. To further his political aspirations he required a house suitable for entertaining and indicative of his wealth conveniently nearer to London than the distant counties of Yorkshire and Dorset.\n\nBasildon fitted Sykes' requirement well, not only politically, but also socially. At this time this area of Berkshire was home to so many of the newly rich returned from India that it was referred to as \"the English Hindoostan.\"<ref name=\"Pugh, p34\"/> Sykes' close friend [[Warren Hastings]] was already resident in the area, and another friend, [[Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive|the 1st Lord Clive]], (better known as Clive of India) had himself attempted to buy Basildon in 1767.<ref>Pugh, p36</ref>\n\nFrom the moment Sykes purchased the Basildon site in 1771, his good fortune changed. The commencement of work on the house was delayed until 1776 as a result of the crash of the East India Company's shares, which caused Sykes to lose \u00a310,000 in a single day.<ref>Pugh, p36.</ref> Shortly afterwards, his and Clive's activities as part of the Bengal Administration were investigated by Parliament. Sykes as the Bengali Tax Collector had levied unjust taxes and was publicly censured. Two years later, in 1774, while Sykes was still a subject of public opprobrium, his finances suffered further when allegations of corruption pertaining to his constituency were made against him. As a result, he lost his parliamentary seat and was forced to pay \u00a311,000 in compensation.<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\"/>\n\nFinally, in 1776, work on Basildon began and lasted for the remainder of Sykes' life. Although his finances continued to dwindle and he was throughout his life to be vilified as an \"archetypal nabob\", he managed to regain his political and social lives.<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\"/> He was created a baronet in 1781, and became MP for Wallingford in 1784.<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\"/> As Sykes aged, work on Basildon slowed. This may have been for financial reasons or just because of a lack of momentum due to family disappointments. A younger son was drowned in 1786 and Sykes' heir proved to be dissipated and a further drain on Sykes' resources.<ref name=\"Pugh, p37\">Pugh, p37.</ref>\n\nSykes died at his London house on 11 January 1804. His body was returned to Basildon for burial in [[St Bartholomew's Church, Lower Basildon]].<ref name=\"Sykes, Oxford DNB\"/> and placed in a previously owned 14th century chest tomb.<ref>{{PastScape\n | mnumber = 241309\n | mname = St Bartholomews Church\n | accessdate = 2 July 2010\n }}</ref> At Basildon Park, the principal rooms remained unfinished.\n\n=== 19th century ===\n[[File:JameMorrison 1789-1857.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The entrepreneur [[James Morrison (businessman)|James Morrison]]. His ownership of the mansion saw it completed and filled with treasures.]]\nOn Sir Francis Sykes' death, Basildon was inherited by his son, Sir Francis Sykes (2nd Baronet) who died a few weeks later. The house then passed to his grandson, the five-year-old Sir Francis (3rd Baronet). By this time, the Sykes fortune was almost spent and Basildon was already mortgaged. The family finances suffered further as a result of the 3rd Baronet's association with the extravagant [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]]. Aged just 14, he entertained the Prince at Basildon. As a result of the Prince's occupation of the North side of the second floor, where the best bedrooms are located, for many years afterwards this range of rooms were known as \"The Regent's Side\" as opposed to the family's less formal rooms on the South side of the floor.<ref>Pugh, p24.</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1820s, Sykes was suffering serious financial problems, and in 1829, the estate was placed on the market.<ref name=\"Pugh, p37\"/> The house was not quickly sold, as Sykes refused to accept any price less than \u00a3100,000. During this period, the house was often let. However, Sykes and his family were in residence between 1834 and 1835 when the future Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] was a house-guest at Basildon. Disraeli, who was the lover of Sykes' wife Henrietta, immortalised her along with some descriptions of Basildon and its rooms in his novel, ''[[Henrietta Temple: A Love Story]]''.<ref>Pugh, p ?</ref> Another romantic attachment of Lady Sykes was to result in her husband being immortalised in a novel, this time in a less flattering light. Lady Sykes had been conducting an affair with the painter [[Daniel Maclise]]. Her husband publicly denounced Maclise, causing an unacceptable high society scandal. As a result, [[Charles Dickens]], a friend of Maclise, then writing ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', based his villainous and cruel character [[Bill Sikes]] on Sir Francis.<ref>Williams.</ref>\n\nIn 1838, as ''Oliver Twist'' was published, Sykes, out of funds and publicly humiliated, finally sold Basildon Park for just \u00a33,000 less than the \u00a3100,000 he had been seeking.\n\nBasildon's interiors were now finally completed and the estate had a seventy-year period of security. The new owner was [[James Morrison (businessman)|James Morrison]], a Hampshire born, self-made millionaire. From humble beginnings as an employee of a London haberdasher, he had married his employer's daughter, entered into partnership with his father-in-law and expanded the business. By 1820, Morrison was possessed of a fortune he was investing wisely to become one of Victorian England's wealthiest men. A politician, between 1830 and 1847, he was one time MP for [[St Ives (UK Parliament constituency)|St Ives]], [[Ipswich]] and the [[Inverness]] [[burgh]]s.\n\nIn addition to Basildon, Morrison owned several estates, including [[Fonthill Gifford|Fonthill]] and [[Islay]]. The mansions provided a setting for his huge art collection, which included works by [[John Constable|Constable]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] and many Italian and Dutch old masters. Basildon was to be the setting for some of his finest works.\n\nTo create that setting, Morrison employed the architect [[John Buonarotti Papworth]]. At Basildon, Papworth combined the roles of architect and interior decorator, helping to create what Morrison described as \"a casket for my pictorial gems.\"<ref>Pugh, p39.</ref> Many of Papworth's more ambitious plans were not realised; the demolition and replacement by colonnades of the yards, the conversion of a courtyard into a sculpture gallery, and the creation of a carriage ramp to the [[piano nobile]] on the East front were all declined by Morrison. However, the house was fitted up with a hot water system and fire precautions, and the decoration of the principal reception rooms was completed in suitably classical styles.\n\nMorrison died at Basildon on 30 October 1857.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:BasildonRoseGarden.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The South Pavilion and corps de logis. In 1978, the South Pavilion (the former laundry) was converted into a private house for Lord and Lady Iliffe following their donation of the main house to the National Trust.]]\nBasildon Park was occupied by James Morrison's unmarried daughter, Ellen, until her death in 1910. Her demise marked the beginning of a downward turn in Basildon's history. The house and estate were inherited by a nephew, James Morrison. Initially, he improved the estate and its buildings, commissioning the architect [[Edwin Lutyens]] to design workers' cottages in the neighbouring villages. However, he never occupied the house, using it only for occasional shooting parties.<ref name=\"Pugh, p42\">Pugh, p42.</ref> In 1914, the house was requisitioned by the British Government and used as a convalescent home for injured soldiers, suffering the attendant damage which accompanies institutional use.\n\nDuring the war Basildon's owner served with distinction, obtaining the [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] and, according to [[Harold Macmillan]], always \"insisted on walking rather than crawling under enemy fire.\"<ref>Pugh. p42.</ref> Surprisingly, considering the form in which his courage manifested itself, Morrison survived the war. However, his love of shooting, a lavish lifestyle and three marriages led to such a serious decline in his fortunes that in 1929, he was forced to sell the Basildon estate.<ref name=\"Pugh, p42\"/><ref name=\"The Times pg. 16\">The Times, Tuesday, 16 July 1929; pg. 16; Issue 45256</ref>\n\nThe new purchaser was the 1st Lord Iliffe. He wished to expand and consolidate his estate at nearby Yattendon, where he had built a new house. He immediately annexed the estate from house and park back, stripped the mansion of some doors and fireplaces for his London house, and placed the house back on the market.<ref name=\"Pugh, p42\"/>\n\nThus it was that in 1929 Basildon Park was purchased by a property developer, George Ferdinando.<ref name=\"Pugh, p2\">Pugh, p2.</ref> who bought the estate as park land. George Ferdinando was 65 when he bought the house and as his children were grown up his wife was unwilling to take on another large house and so he produced a sales notice, the idea being to sell the house as one lot in America. Encouraged by the then current fashion amongst wealthy American citizens for inhabiting ancient European houses and palazzi, Ferdinando produced a sales brochure advertising Basildon to any American citizen for $1,000,000. For this sum, he promised to \"carefully take it down\" and \"re-erect in America\", thus providing an opportunity to \"Any patriotic American wishing to benefit his native state by presenting this imposing building \u2026 ready for occupation as a private residence, museum, college building or public library.\"<ref name=\"Pugh, p2\"/> Fortunately he had a change of heart and decided instead to convert the old sawmill at the top of the park into a house for himself and his wife. George also persuaded one of his sons Eric to return from America where he was a cotton grower with his young family to live in the south pavilion then called the east wing. Eric then oversaw the return of fixtures and fittings such as the stair balustrade, the renovation and running of the house and estate. No evidence is available to say whether it was George Ferdinando, the first Lord Iliffe or the executors of the Morrison estate who sold off the dining room fixtures. However elements from the Dining Room have been reused in the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]] in New York and doorcases designed by John Carr are in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]],<ref>[[Yvonne Hackenbroch]], ''The Untermyer Collection: Furniture'' 1958, fig. 387.</ref>  the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]],<ref>The Dining-Room chimneypiece and decorative paintings and the doorcases are noted in John Harris, ''Moving Rooms: The Trade in Architectural Salvages'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2007:235.</ref> and the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.<ref>A doorcase from the \"Drawing Room\", noted in Quincy Lee, \"Catalogue of British Old Master Paintings in the Collection of the Louisiana State University Museum of Art\" ([http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04152009-092929/unrestricted/leethesis.pdf on-line text]).</ref><ref name=\"Pugh, p43\">Pugh, p43.</ref>\n\nWorld War II saw Basildon used as a billet for troops, while the park became a training ground for troops deployed in tank and ground warfare. George Ferdinando continued to live at Basildon during this time. Eric served in the navy during the war and on his return set about mending the walls that had been damaged by bridging units used on the river and the huge holes left in the demolition area. The house was then requisitioned for the Ministry of Works, whose caretaker stole the lead from the roofs.<ref name=\"Pugh, p14\">Pugh, p14.</ref> He was caught and imprisoned for two years. Unfortunately the ministry were only willing to pay back one tenth of the cost of the repair to the roof and other damage done including a fire. Having lived at Basildon now for twenty years George moved to Shoreham-by-sea in Sussex where he died in 1949,<ref>Probate, George Samuel Ferdinando. Ancestry.com.

Surname Range : ''Eaborn-Gysin, 1950.''</ref> but was buried in Basildon. Unable to foot the cost of repairing the house and the inheritance tax the house had to be sold and Eric and family moved to the converted barn house formerly part of the estate. The second Lord Iliffe, who lived in the area, visited the house at this point which was in rather a sad state. However, encouraged by the potential she saw in the mansion, Lady Iliffe persuaded her husband to buy it. This was the beginning of Basildon Park's salvation and renaissance.\n\nUnder the direction of the Iliffes (later the [[Langton Iliffe, 2nd Baron Iliffe|2nd Baron and Lady Iliffe]]), Basildon was completely restored and refurnished. This was achieved over a period of 25 years. Many fixtures and fittings were purchased from similar houses in a greater state of dereliction prior to their demolition. While often the Iliffes found great bargains, obtaining 18th-century mahogany doors and marble fireplaces, at other times their luck was less favourable; Lady Iliffe recalled attending the [[Mentmore Towers]] auction of 1975 with the intention of buying marble topped console tables for Basildon, but through economic necessity returned with only a coal-scuttle.<ref name=\"Lady Iliffe p4\">Lady Iliffe, ''Basildon Park'', p4.</ref>\n\n== Architectural appraisal ==\n\n[[File:BasildonParkedited.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The corps de logis at the centre of the West facade.]]\nBasildon Park was begun in 1772; the architect, [[John Carr of York]], was one of the leading architects in northern England. His work was initially influenced by the Palladian architects, the [[Earl of Burlington]] and [[William Kent]] and later by the neoclassicism of [[Robert Adam]].<ref>[http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&id=00000000007 The Royal Institution of Great Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622073857/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&id=00000000007 |date=22 June 2010 }}</ref> At Basildon, Carr's most southerly commission,<ref name=\"Pugh, p6\">Pugh, p6.</ref> both these architectural influences can be discerned. It has been speculated that the principal facade, the West Front, was inspired by [[Palladio]]'s [[Villa Emo]].<ref>Pugh, p6, mentions this speculation as \"probable.\"</ref> Whatever the inspiration, it was one Carr relied on heavily in his work, and it can be seen again most evidently in his designs for [[:File:Newark Town Hall.jpg|Newark Town Hall]].\n\nThe mansion consists of the three quite separate blocks, but indistinctly so. The three floored [[corps de logis]] contains the principal rooms, and two flanking pavilions of two floors each; the north designed to contain the Kitchen, Scullery and Housekeeper's Room and the south to contain the Laundry and Dairy. The upper floor of each pavilion contained accommodation for servants. This arrangement, of a central block flanked by pavilions, is original to Palladio's concept; however, in England Palladianism (a form of architecture based only loosely on Palladio's concepts) had evolved to a point that where Palladio had filled the distance between corps de logis and the flanking blocks with a void space or colonnade. The evolved 18th-century Palladianism usually filled the space with long wings containing [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilades]] of rooms. At Basildon, the architect used windowed walls to create service courts in the void. This had the double advantage of not only unifying the facade, but also (in a comparatively small mansion) of creating a discrete space for utilitarian stores, [[Toilet|lavatories]] and the drying of clothes.<ref name=\"Pugh, p6\"/>\n\n===Exterior===\n[[File:BasildonParkedited3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Basildon Park, the East front.]]\n\nThe principal facade is the long West facade of the corps de logis and its flanking pavilions. Built of [[Bath stone]], the three-storied rectangular corps de logis has a [[Rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] ground floor, with a piano nobile above and a bedroom floor above this. This block is of seven bays; the central three bays are behind a recessed [[Ionic order|Ionic]] [[portico]]. Entrance to the mansion is by three segmented arches under the portico, or more formally, by climbing a [[double staircase|double curved staircase]] behind the three arches. The stairs rise to an open loggia beneath the portico which gives access to the mansion's principal entrance. The [[wikt:fenestration|fenestration]] is designed to indicate the status of their floor. Thus, small windows indicate the domestic ground floor and secondary upper floor, while the windows of the first floor piano nobile are tall and large. These larger windows are unified along the full length of the facade extending on to the pavilions by a [[balustrading]] beneath them which continues the line of the balustrading protecting the central loggia. The roofline is concealed by a high [[parapet]] concealing the roofs themselves and broken only by the portico's pediment. This pediment is echoed as a smaller pediment over both of the two-storied pavilions.\n\nIn contrast to the Palladianism of the West front, the East front is austere in its neoclassicism. It projects from the flanking pavilions, which on this side of the house are partially screened by planting. The fenestration which is concentrated on the broad bay at the centre of the facade provides the essential rhythm and relief.<ref>Musson, p76, explains the concept of such neoclassical facades.</ref> Above the second floor, a balustrade not only hides the roof, but unites the projecting bay with its flanking bays.\n\n===Interior===\n\nThe corps de logis (central block) is built on the three floors. In the 18th century, such floors (known, because of their outer brickwork, as \"the Rustic\") would have been used by both the owners and their servants. The Rustic contained the wine cellars, Servants' Hall, estate offices, and secondary reception rooms.<ref name=\"Girouard, p206\">Girouard, p206.</ref> This is very much the case at Basildon where the former Servants' Hall is now the ground floor visitors' tea room and the former Summer Breakfast Room (beneath the Octagon Drawing Room) which later saw service as a billiard room, is now a lecture room for the mansion's paying visitors. The lower hall, beneath the first floor hall, was the everyday entrance to the mansion for the family.<ref>Pugh, p28.</ref>\n\n[[File:Baspianonobile.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'''The first floor'''. 1: The four service courts; 2: Portico and West front; 3: North Pavilion; 4: South Pavilion; 5: Entrance Hall; 6: Staircase Hall; 7: Octagon Drawing Room; 8: Dining Room; 9: Study; 10: Library; 11: Sutherland Room (formerly lady Iliffe's sitting room); 12: Kitchen (since 1952); 13: larder (?); 14: Green Drawing Room (formerly Breakfast or Small Dining Room).\n]]\n\n===The first floor===\n\nThe first floor was designed to be a [[piano nobile]] (meaning literally a \"noble floor\"); as its name suggests, it contains the principal rooms of the house. During the 1770s, when Basildon was built, a domestic and architectural movement from formality towards informality was in progress. Thus, while the exterior of Basildon is pure symmetry, this symmetry is not reflected in the interior layout of the rooms as would have been the case just a few years earlier.<ref>Girouard, p212, explains this movement.</ref> In any case, the builder of Basildon was not eminent enough to require a suite of state apartments on the piano nobile in permanent expectation of a royal visit. Thus, in keeping with this newly found spirit of informality Basildon has no formal and symmetrical [[enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]] of rooms of increasing splendour, but two separate first floor suites, one feminine and one masculine, were placed on either side of the hall. '''The library''' (''10 on plan''), considered a masculine room, was placed next to the owner Sir Francis Sykes' dressing room (''9'') while on the opposite side of the hall (''11 and 12'') were the bedroom and dressing room of Lady Sykes.<ref>Pugh, p10.</ref> Sir Francis appears not to have had a bedroom on this floor, an arrangement not uncommon in the 18th century, when a dressing room served as a study and reception room combined\u2014the owner would descend from his bedroom above to the dressing room and receive business callers while the finishing touches were made to his dressing by a servant.<ref name=\"Girouard, p206\"/> Lady Sykes' dressing room or boudoir (''11 on first floor plan''), also used as private sitting room by the late Lady Iliffe, is now known as the '''Sutherland Room'''; it is currently used to display some of the studies by the 20th-century artist [[Graham Sutherland]] for his tapestry \"Christ in Glory\" at [[Coventry Cathedral]].<ref>Pugh, p12.</ref>\n\nThe principal receptions are a communicating circuit of rooms designed for entertaining. This was a late 18th-century feature, first introduced by the architect [[Matthew Brettingham]] in 1750.<ref>Girouard, pp194\u2013195.</ref>\n\n'''The Hall''' is the principal entrance to the house which would have been used by any eminent guests; entering the house by climbing the double staircase beneath the portico the guest immediately sees, through a gilded doorcase, a short enfilade through the staircase hall to the Octagon drawing room. While the hall in its use was not comparable with the [[Great Hall]] of earlier manor houses, it was still more than a mere entrance vestibule; in the 18th century, it was considered that any house of note required three principal reception rooms when entertaining: one for dancing, one for supper and one for cards.<ref>Girouard, p199.</ref> Thus, the hall, dining room and Octagon Drawing Room would fulfil those roles.\n\nThe hall retains more of its original neoclassical decorative features than many other rooms in the house; the walls' plasterwork panels and ceiling are all original, as are the Spanish mahogany doors (these had been removed during the 1920s, but were returned to the house in 1954). Only the white marble fireplace is not original to the house, but salvaged from the now demolished Panton Hall. The furniture in the room, against the walls in 18th-century fashion, is in the style of [[William Kent]].\n\n'''The Staircase Hall''' is at the centre of the house and is considered to be one of Carr's \"most monumental interiors.\"<ref name=\"Pugh, p14\"/> Typically of this period, the double height room is lit by a [[clerestory]] while the wide [[cantilever]]ed staircase, the Great Staircase, rises in flights around three of the four walls, to a gallery.<ref>Musson, p98, explains the 18th-century staircase.</ref> The balustrading of the staircase and landing is of gilded wrought iron adorned with medallions with classical motifs which were heavily restored in 1952.<ref name=\"Pugh, p14\"/> The groundfloor walls beneath the gallery are decorated with some of Carr's neoclassical plasterwork depicted in white against the eau de nil<ref>''Nilewater'', a pale tint of [[cyan]].</ref> colour of the walls. Recent analysis of the paint has shown that the walls were originally a pale stone colour and the staircase balustrade was painted blue with gilded figures on the (blue) plaques.<ref>[[Patrick Baty]] Basildon Park, Berkshire. A Report on the Decorative Schemes following an Examination of a Number of Elements in the Great Staircase. 11 April 2009.</ref>\n\nThe Great Staircase, which rises only between the first and second floors, is just one of three staircases all within metres of the other at the centre of the house. A narrow spiral stair, concealed in one of the cut off corners of the Octagon Drawing Room rises from the ground floor to the roof, while \"the backstairs\" is another large staircase lit by the same clerestory as the Great Staircase; this rises from the ground floor to the second floor.\n\nThe '''Octagon Drawing Room''' (''7 on first floor plan'') completes the short enfilade beginning at the front door. It is the principal room of the house. Unfinished by Carr, the room has an ornate gilded ceiling with recessed panels in the Italian Renaissance style, installed in 1840. Of the room's eight sides, three have windows forming a large bay, at the centre of which is a large [[Venetian window]] echoing the Palladian inspiration of the mansion. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries this room was used to display the finest art its owners possessed. Today, hung with red felt, it contains works by [[Pompeo Batoni]] and [[Giambattista Pittoni]]. The room contains fine neoclassical furniture, including items made to designs by Robert Adam, and curtains originally made for the state rooms of [[Blenheim Palace]].<ref>Pugh, p22, suggests the curtains were made for the Grand Cabinet at Blenheim Palace.</ref>\n\n[[File:Basildon Room by Matthew Bisanz 41.JPG|right|200px|thumb|The Basildon Room, The Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York. The room contains the original fireplace, mirrors and wall and ceiling paintings from the Dining Room of Basildon Park. The ceiling and plaster \"loop and bow\" panel design closely resembles that of the Basildon Dining Room.]]\n\nThe '''Dining Room''' (''marked 8 on first floor plan'') is one of the rooms most frequently changed since the completion of the mansion. Yet today it closely resembles its original form. Sited on the first floor of the corps de logis, some distance from the original kitchen (on the ground floor of the North Pavilion), the Dining Room is decorated in a neoclassical style inspired by the work of Robert Adam. The ceiling is divided into geometric panels by ornate plasterwork. Each panel originally contained a painted [[lunette]] or medallion by [[Theodore de Bruyn]], depicting a classical scene in [[grisaille]]. The walls too have plaster panels which contained medallions, matching those of the ceiling.\n\nIn 1845, the room was redecorated by the architect [[David Brandon (architect)|David Brandon]], who replaced Bruyn's paintings with polychrome depictions of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. The walls to which Brandon added mirrors, however, retained much of their 18th-century plasterwork. In 1929, the owner, George Ferdinando, stripped the dining room of its painted panels, mirrors, fireplace and doors and sold them to a firm of architectural antique dealers, Crowther's. The Dining Room's former decorations then crossed the Atlantic. Today, they form the Basildon Room of New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel.<ref name=\"Pugh, p43\"/>\n\nIn 1952, the new owners, Lord and Lady Iliffe, had the now bare room painted by the decorator [[John Beresford Fowler|John Fowler]] and transformed it to a drawing room. During the late 20th century, the artist Alec Cobbe was employed to redecorate the room in a style similar to the original scheme by de Bruyn. Much of Carr's \"loops and bows\" plasterwork had survived, and this, coupled with a fireplace and doors salvaged from [[Panton, Lincolnshire|Panton Hall]] and very similar to those which crossed the Atlantic, allowed the room to return to its original neoclassical form.<ref name=\"Pugh, p16\">Pugh, p16.</ref>\n\n'''The Kitchen''' was originally in the North pavilion. The concept of placing kitchens in a separate block to the house (and dining room) was a practice which had begun in the 1680s to prevent kitchen smells pervading the main house. Thus, Palladio's idea of a villa flanked by pavilions (intended to house farm animals) suited this practice admirably. However, the need for symmetry meant a balancing second pavilion was required. Therefore, it was common, as at Blenheim Palace, for the kitchen to be balanced by a chapel or an orangery, or for the less spiritual, a brewery or, as at a Basildon, a laundry.<ref>Girouard, p151.</ref> This meant that at Basildon, hot food \"''en route''\" to the dining room had to cross an open courtyard in all weathers, be taken through the ground floor of the mansion up the back stairs, cross the second floor and then be laid behind a colonnaded screen in the dining room before being finally served.<ref name=\"Pugh, p16\"/> During the modernisations at Basildon in the 1950s, Lady Iliffe had a new and state of the art kitchen installed on the piano nobile in the former bedroom allotted to former ladies of the house (''12 on first floor plan''). This solved the problem of hot food. The new kitchen is now open to the public as a nostalgic 1950s set museum piece, containing kitchen appliances and food stuffs and packaging contemporary to the mid 20th century. This is shown in the same fashion as the remainder of the house.\n\n[[File:Basupper.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'''The second floor'''. 1: Lady Iliffe's bedroom; 2: Shell Room; 3: Dressing Room; 4: Bamboo Bedroom; 5: Crimson Bedroom; 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 & 12: Bedrooms closed to the public; 10: Green Chintz Room; 13: [[Clerestory]] giving light to the Staircase Hall, concealed from sight by the roofline.]]\n\n'''The Green Drawing Room''' is between the Octagon Drawing room and the new kitchen. It had always previously been used as a breakfast room or small dining room, less formal than the Dining Room itself. When the National Trust took over management of the house, the room was refurnished and displayed as a drawing room. The room has a moulded plaster neoclassical ceiling and is hung with green silk which was formerly curtains at Englefield House, Berkshire. The white marble fireplace in this room is one of the few original to the house.\n\n===The second floor===\nThe second floor was designed to be of considerably less importance than the piano nobile below, which is indicated externally by the smaller windows. However, unlike in a [[Baroque]] house of just a few years earlier, it was not reserved for lesser guests, children and servants, as is evident by its approach from a monumentally grand staircase.\n\n== Basildon and its future ==\nAt the time of its building, the design of Basildon was already old-fashioned. From 1750s onwards large houses were being built without a rustic, and having the principal floor on the ground was becoming commonplace. Basildon, with its piano nobile, large portico denoting status, and main facade falsely elongated by fenestrated walls, was never innovative architecture, but, like many other houses, was built to bolster the status of its owner, the newly rich Sir Francis Sykes, keen for a political career.\n\nBasildon is not one of the great houses of Britain; houses of similar style and size exist the length of the country. Neither is the mansion of great architectural importance. Its architect, described as \"one of the most prolific of the 18th century\"<ref>Hall, Oxford DNB.</ref> is far better known for his works elsewhere.<ref>Carr is best known for his work in the north of England, in particular [[Harewood House]].</ref> Neither is Basildon remarkable for its contents. While it has some fine plasterwork, its contents, though high quality antiques, are not of the finest museum quality and its art collection consists mostly of mediocre paintings of the 17th and 18th century Italian schools, bought for their size and suitability for the decoration of the interiors rather than for their quality.<ref name=\"Lady Iliffe p4\"/>\n\nInstead, Basildon is remarkable and notable for its survival against all odds in the 20th century. At a time when it was near ruin and its destruction seemed inevitable, it was saved. Since 1900, over 1,000 country houses,<ref name=V&A/> many of far greater architectural importance than Basildon, have been demolished. The destruction of many of these houses began as a trickle just prior to [[World War I]], but became a tidal wave in 1955, when one house was demolished every five days.<ref name=V&A>{{cite web | publisher = Victoria and Albert Museum | url = http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/architecture/past/save/index.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060825134010/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/architecture/past/save/index.html | archivedate = 25 August 2006 | title = PAST EXHIBITIONS: SAVE Britain\u2019s Heritage 1975-2005: 30 Years of Campaigning, 3 November 2005 \u2013 12 February 2006}}</ref> The destruction did not halt until 1975,<ref name=V&A/> by which time the Iliffe's restoration work at Basildon was almost completed.\n\nIn 1978, the Iliffes gave the house, together with its park and a large endowment for its upkeep, to the National Trust, enabling the house to provide a paying public with not only an insight to the interior of a grand house during both the 18th and 19th centuries, but also a rare view of how such houses were adapted to suit a more modern life-style during the last half of the 20th century. It was Lord and Lady Iliffe's wish that \"The National Trust will protect it and its park for future generations to enjoy.\"<ref>Lady Iliffe writing in ''Basildon Park,'' p 4.</ref>\n\n==Filming location==\n\nIn addition to being open to the public, the house has also served as a filming set. It was used as the location for Netherfield Park in the 2005 film ''[[Pride & Prejudice (2005 film)|Pride & Prejudice]],'' and more recently the 2016 film \"[[Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (film)|Pride and Prejudice and Zombies]],\" as a location for the 2006 movie ''[[Marie-Antoinette (film)|Marie-Antoinette]],'' and as Lord and Lady Radley's house in the 2009 film ''[[Dorian Gray (2009 film)|Dorian Gray]].'' The interiors of Basildon stood in for the Crawley family's London mansion, Grantham House, on the series ''[[Downton Abbey]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Downton Abbey at Basildon Park |url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/basildon-park/visitor-information/article-1355824843451/ |accessdate=12 October 2015 |publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025092035/http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/basildon-park/visitor-information/article-1355824843451/ |archivedate=25 October 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<Gallery>\n\nFile:Basildon Room by Matthew Bisanz 41.JPG|The Basildon Room, The Waldorf Astoria Hotel, New York\nFile:Basildon Room by Matthew Bisanz 19.JPG|detail from the Basildon Room.\nFile:Basildon Room by Matthew Bisanz 16.JPG|mantelpiece of the Basildon Room.\nFile:Basildon Room by Matthew Bisanz 30.JPG|ceiling of the Basildon Room.\n</Gallery>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{cite book\n | last = Girouard\n | first = Mark\n | authorlink = Mark Girouard\n | year = 1978\n | title = Life in the English Country House\n | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeinenglishcou0000giro\n | url-access = registration\n | publisher = Yale University Press\n | location =\n | isbn = 0-300-02273-5\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Musson\n | first = Jeremy\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2007\n | title = How to Read a Country House\n | publisher = Random House\n | location = London\n | isbn = 978-0-09-190076-2\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Charles Pugh\n | first = Tracey Avery\n | year = 2002\n | title = Basildon Park\n | publisher = The National Trust\n | location =\n | isbn = 978-1-84359-010-1\n}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100622073857/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&id=00000000007 The Royal Institution of Great Britain] John Carr (1723\u20131807).
