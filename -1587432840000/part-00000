Founded in 1859 by the [[Society of Jesus]], the Ateneo is the third-oldest university in the Philippines. \n\nThe Ateneo offers elementary and junior high school education exclusively to male students, while its senior high school and college are co-educational. In college, both undergraduate and graduate programs are organized into four schools, collectively known as the [[Loyola Schools]], which are located at its main campus at Loyola Heights along with the Grade School, Junior High School and Senior High School. Four professional schools occupy other campuses throughout [[Metro Manila]]. Students of the Ateneo are often referred to as Ateneans ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''mga Atenista'').\n\nUndergraduates of the Ateneo follow a [[Catholic]]-rooted [[liberal arts]] [[core curriculum]] throughout their program in the Loyola Schools.\n\nAs of 2020, the Ateneo alumni include one [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient, two [[Ramon Magsaysay Award|Ramon Magsaysay]] awardees, [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] (the [[national hero of the Philippines]]), five [[Presidents of the Philippines]], and five [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justices of the Philippine Supreme Court]]. In the 1890s, among its graduates were several leaders of the propaganda movement during the [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spain. The United Kingdom-based [[Quacquarelli Symonds]] (QS) ranks ADMU as the country's top private university, among the top 125 Asian universities, and among the top 600 universities worldwide in annual university rankings.<ref>{{cite web |title=QS World University Rankings 2020 |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020 |publisher=Quacquarelli Symbols |accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Ateneo de Manila}}\nWhile Jesuit teaching efforts in Manila date back to 1595, the Ateneo de Manila University traces its founding to 1859 when the Jesuits, at the behest of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Fern\u00e1ndo Norzagaray y Escudero]], took charge of the Municipal School of Manila, a small school for the children of Spanish residents. In 1865, its name was changed to ''Ateneo Municipal de Manila'' when it became accredited as a secondary school. It began offering the [[bachelor's degree]], as well as courses leading to certificates in agriculture, surveying, and business. When [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|Americans occupied the Philippines in 1902]], its subsidy from the city was withdrawn. The Jesuits removed the word \"Municipal\" from the school's name and it became simply the Ateneo de Manila. In 1908, the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|American colonial government]] licensed the Ateneo's bachelor degree and certificates in various disciplines. The Ateneo campus housed other Jesuit institutions of research and learning, such as the [[Manila Observatory]] and the San Jose Major Seminary.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.ateneo.edu/history |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University |accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAmerican Jesuits replaced their Spanish brethren in 1912. In 1932, the original campus at [[Intramuros]] in [[Manila]] was destroyed by fire and the Ateneo moved to the San Jose Major Seminary grounds in [[Padre Faura]], [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]]. The Ateneo campus was destroyed again in [[World War II]]. The Ateneo reopened temporarily in Plaza Guipit in [[Sampaloc, Manila]]. The Padre Faura campus reopened in 1946 with [[Quonset hut]]s serving as buildings among the campus ruins.<ref name=\"reyes\">Soledad S.

Founded in 1859 by the [[Society of Jesus]], the Ateneo is the third-oldest university in the Philippines. \n\nThe Ateneo offers elementary and junior high school education exclusively to male students, while its senior high school and college are co-educational. In college, both undergraduate and graduate programs are organized into four schools, collectively known as the [[Loyola Schools]], which are located at its main campus at Loyola Heights along with the Grade School, Junior High School and Senior High School. Four professional schools occupy other campuses throughout [[Metro Manila]]. Students of the Ateneo are often referred to as Ateneans ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''mga Atenista'').\n\nUndergraduates of the Ateneo follow a [[Catholic]]-rooted [[liberal arts]] [[core curriculum]] throughout their program in the Loyola Schools.\n\nAs of 2020, the Ateneo alumni include one [[Nobel Peace Prize]] recipient, two [[Ramon Magsaysay Award|Ramon Magsaysay]] awardees, [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] (the [[national hero of the Philippines]]), five [[Presidents of the Philippines]], and five [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justices of the Philippine Supreme Court]].

In 1865, its name was changed to ''Ateneo Municipal de Manila'' when it became accredited as a secondary school. It began offering the [[bachelor's degree]], as well as courses leading to certificates in agriculture, surveying, and business. When [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|Americans occupied the Philippines in 1902]], its subsidy from the city was withdrawn. The Jesuits removed the word \"Municipal\" from the school's name and it became simply the Ateneo de Manila. In 1908, the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|American colonial government]] licensed the Ateneo's bachelor degree and certificates in various disciplines. The Ateneo campus housed other Jesuit institutions of research and learning, such as the [[Manila Observatory]] and the San Jose Major Seminary.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.ateneo.edu/history |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University |accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAmerican Jesuits replaced their Spanish brethren in 1912.

The first army officially called the \"Indian Army\" was raised by the government of India in 1895, existing alongside the three long-established [[presidency armies]]. However, in 1903 the Indian Army absorbed these three armies.  The Indian Army should not be confused with the \"[[Army of India]]\" (1903\u20131947) which was the Indian Army itself plus the \"British Army in India\" (British units sent to India).\n\n==Organisation==\n[[File:Madras cavalry.jpg|thumb|220px|A painting showing a ''[[sowar]]'' of the [[6th Madras Light Cavalry]], circa 1845.]]\n[[File:The Queen's Own Madras Sappers and Miners, Review Order.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Queen's Own Madras Sappers and Miners]], 1896.]]\nThe Indian Army has its origins in the years after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], often called the Indian Mutiny in British histories, when in 1858 [[the Crown]] took over direct rule of British India from the [[East India Company]].  Before 1858, the precursor units of the Indian Army were units controlled by the Company and were paid for by their profits. These operated alongside units of the British Army, funded by the British government in [[London]].<ref>Harold E. Raugh, ''The Victorians at war, 1815\u20131914: an encyclopedia of British military history'' (2004) pp 173\u201379</ref>\n\nThe armies of the East India Company were recruited primarily from Muslims in the [[Bengal Presidency]], which consisted of [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], and high caste Hindus recruited primarily from the rural plains of [[Oudh]].  Many of these troops took part in the [[Indian Mutiny]], with the aim of reinstating the Mughal Emperor [[Bahadur Shah II]] at Delhi, partly as a result of insensitive treatment by their British officers.\n\nThe meaning of the term \"Indian Army\" has changed over time:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|width=80|1858\u20131894\n|The '''Indian Army''' was an informal collective term for the [[Presidency armies|armies of the three presidencies]]; the [[Bengal Army]], [[Madras Army]] and [[Bombay Army]].\n|-\n|1895\u20131902\n|The '''Indian Army''' had a formal existence and was the \"army of the government of India\", including British and Indian ([[sepoy]]) units.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|1903\u20131947\n|[[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]] was [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], between 1902 and 1909.

He formed higher level formations, eight army divisions, and brigaded Indian and British units. Following Kitchener's reforms:\n*The '''Indian Army''' was \"the force recruited locally and permanently based in India, together with its expatriate British officers.\"<ref>Oxford History of the British Army</ref>\n*The '''British Army in India''' consisted of British Army units posted to India for a tour of duty, and which would then be posted to other parts of the Empire or back to the UK.\n*The '''Army of India''' consisted of both the Indian Army and the British Army in India.\n|}\n\n===Command===\nThe officer commanding the Army of India was the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]] who reported to the civilian [[Governor-General of India]]. The title was used before the creation of a unified British Indian Army; the first holder was Major General [[Stringer Lawrence]] in 1748. By the early 1900s the Commander-in-Chief and his staff were based at [[GHQ India]]. Indian Army postings were less prestigious than British Army positions, but the pay was significantly greater so that officers could live on their salaries instead of having to have a private income. Accordingly, vacancies in the Indian Army were much sought after and generally reserved for the higher placed officer-cadets graduating from the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. British officers in the Indian Army were expected to learn to speak the Indian languages of their men, who tended to be recruited from primarily [[Hindi]] speaking areas. Prominent British Indian Army officers included [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Sir William Birdwood]], [[Sir Claude Auchinleck]] and [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Sir William Slim]].\n\n===Personnel===\n[[File:RML7pounderMountanGunHazaraBattery1895.jpg|thumb|right|200px|No. 4 ([[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]]) Mountain Battery with [[RML 7 pounder Mountain Gun|RML7 pounder \"Steel Gun\" Mountain Gun]] in Review Order.

[[King's Commissioned Indian Officer]]s (KCIOs), created from the 1920s, held equal powers to British officers. [[Viceroy's Commissioned Officer]]s were Indians holding officer ranks. They were treated in almost all respects as commissioned officers, but had authority over Indian troops only, and were subordinate to all British King's (and Queen's) Commissioned Officers and KCIOs. They included [[Subedar Major]] or [[Risaldar-Major]] (Cavalry), equivalents to a British [[Major]]; [[Subedar]] or [[Risaldar]] (Cavalry) equivalents to [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]]; and [[Jemadar]]s equivalent to [[Lieutenant]].\n\nRecruitment was entirely voluntary; about 1.75&nbsp;million men served in the First World War, many on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 2.5&nbsp;million in the Second.

The Indian Army, like the Presidency armies, continued to provide armed support to the civil authorities, both in combating banditry and in case of riots and rebellion. One of the first external operations the new unified army faced was the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China from 1899 to 1901.\n\n==Kitchener reforms==\nThe Kitchener reforms began in 1903 when [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] of [[Khartoum]], newly appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], completed the unification of the three former Presidency [[army|armies]], and also the [[Punjab Frontier Force]], the [[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)#Former Hyderabad Regiments|Hyderabad Contingent]] and other local forces, into one Indian Army; see [[Army of India]] (including also units of the [[British Army]] stationed in India).\n\nThe principles underlying the reforms were that:\n* defence of the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]] against foreign aggression was the army's primary role\n* all units were to have training and experience in that role on that frontier\n* the army's organisation should be the same in peace as in war\n* maintaining [[internal security]] was for the army a secondary role, in support of the [[police]].<ref>Barthorp pp. 142\u20133</ref>\n\nLord Kitchener found the army scattered across the country in [[Military base|stations]] at [[brigade]] or [[regiment]]al strength, and in effect, providing [[garrison]]s for most of the major cities.<ref name=Heathcotep30/>\nThe reformed Indian Army was to be stationed in operational [[formation (military)|formations]] and concentrated in the north of the [[Indian subcontinent|sub-continent]]. The Commander-in-Chief's plan called for nine fighting [[Division (military)|divisions]] grouped in two [[corps]] commands on the main axes through the North-West Frontier. Five divisions were to be grouped on the [[Lucknow]] \u2013 [[Peshawar]] \u2013 [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] axis, and four divisions on the [[Bombay]] \u2013 [[Mhow]] \u2013 [[Quetta]] axis.<ref name=Barthorpp143>Barthorp, p. 143</ref> However, the cost of abandoning some thirty-four stations and building new ones in the proposed corps areas was considered prohibitive, and that aspect of the plan had to be modified.<ref name=Heathcotep31>Heathcote, p. 31</ref>\n\nUnder the compromise adopted in 1905, the four existing commands were reduced to three, and together with Army [[Headquarters (military)|Headquarters]], arranged in ten standing divisions and four independent brigades:\n*[[Northern Command (India)|Northern Command]] comprised the [[1st (Peshawar) Division]], the [[2nd (Rawalpindi) Division]], the [[3rd (Lahore) Division]], the [[Kohat Brigade]], the [[Bannu Brigade]], and the [[Derajat Brigade]].\n*[[Western Command (India)|Western Command]] comprised the [[4th (Quetta) Division]], the [[5th (Mhow) Division]], the [[6th (Poona) Division]], and the [[Aden Brigade]], located in Aden in the Arabian Peninsula.\n*[[Eastern Command (India)|Eastern Command]] comprised the [[7th (Meerut) Division]] and the [[8th (Lucknow) Division]].\n\nArmy Headquarters retained the [[9th (Secunderabad) Division]] and the [[Burma Division]] under its direct control.<ref name=Heathcotep31/><ref>Sumner p. 9</ref> The numbered divisions were organised so that on mobilisation they could deploy a complete [[infantry division]], a [[cavalry]] brigade, and a number of troops for internal security or local frontier defence. Permanent divisional commands were formed with an establishment of staff officers under a [[Major-General]].<ref name=Heathcotep31/>\n\nAfter the reforms ended in 1909, the Indian Army was organised along British lines, although it was always behind in terms of equipment. An Indian Army division consisted of three brigades each of four battalions. Three of these battalions were of the Indian Army, and one British. The Indian battalions were often segregated, with companies of different tribes, castes or religions. One and a half million volunteers came forward from the estimated population of 315 million in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nRegimental battalions were not permanently allocated to particular divisions or brigades, but instead spent some years in one formation, and were then posted to another elsewhere. This rotating arrangement was intended both to provide all units with experience of [[active service]] on the Frontier, and to prevent them becoming 'localised' in static regimental stations.<ref name=Heathcotep31/> In contrast, the divisional locations remained constant\n\n===Renumbering and renaming the regiments===\n::''See [[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)]]''\nTo emphasise that there was now only one Indian Army, and that all units were to be trained and deployed without regard for their regional origins, the regiments were renumbered into single sequences of cavalry, [[artillery]], [[infantry of the line]], and [[Gurkha Rifles (disambiguation)|G\u00farkha Rifles]].<ref name=Heathcotep31/>\nRegimental designations were altered to remove all references to the former Presidential Armies.<ref name=Gaylorp5/> Where appropriate subsidiary titles recalling other identifying details were adopted. Thus the 2nd Bengal Lancers became the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]].\n\nThe new order began with the Bengal regiments, followed by the Punjab Frontier Force, then the regiments of Madras, the Hyderabad Contingent, and Bombay. Wherever possible a significant digit was retained in the new number.<ref name=Gaylorp5/> Thus the '''1st Sikh Infantry''' became the '''[[51st Sikhs]]''', the '''1st Madras Pioneers''' became the '''[[61st Pioneers]]''', and the '''1st Bombay Grenadiers''' became the [[101st Grenadiers]].\n\nThe '''G\u00farkha Regiments''' had developed into their own Line of [[rifle regiments]] since 1861. They were five of these until they were joined by the former 42nd, 43rd, & 44th Gurkha Regiments of the Bengal Army, who became the 6th, 7th, & 8th G\u00farkha Rifles. The numbers 42, 43, & 44 were allocated respectively to the [[42nd Deoli Regiment|Deoli]] and [[43rd Erinpura Regiment|Erinpura]] Irregular Forces and the [[44th Merwara Infantry|Mhairwara]] Battalion from [[Rajputana]].<ref>Gaylor, p. 10</ref>\n\nThe [[mountain gun|mountain]] [[Artillery battery|batteries]] had already lost their numbers two years earlier. Under the 1903 reforms they were renumbered with twenty added to their original numbers.<ref>Gaylor, p 107</ref> The army had very little artillery (only 12 batteries of [[mountain artillery]]), and [[Royal Indian Artillery]] batteries were attached to the divisions. The [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers]] was formed by the Group of [[Madras Engineer Group|Madras]], [[Bengal Engineer Group|Bengal]] and [[Bombay Engineer Group|Bombay Sappers]] in their respective presidencies.\n\nThe Queen's Own Corps of Guides, Punjab Frontier Force, composed of cavalry [[squadron (army)|squadron]]s and infantry [[Company (military unit)|companies]], was renamed the [[Queen's Own Corps of Guides (Lumsden's)]] but stayed numberless. The new regimental numbering and namings were notified in ''India Army Order 181'', dated 2 October 1903.<ref>Roger, p. 20</ref>\n\nIn 1903 the title of the [[Indian Staff Corps]] was abolished, and thereafter officers were simply appointed to 'the Indian Army.'<ref>Robson p. 57</ref> A [[General Staff]] was then created to deal with overall military policy, supervision of training in peacetime, conduct of [[military operation|operations]] in war, distribution of forces for internal security or external [[military deployment|deployment]], plans for future operations and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].<ref name=Heathcotep26>Heathcote p. 26</ref> Functions were divided along British lines into two branches; the [[Adjutant-General]], dealing with training, discipline, and personnel, and the [[Quartermaster-General]], dealing with supplies, accommodation, and communications.

Divisional commanders were responsible not only for their active formations, but also for internal security and [[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)#Volunteer Corps|volunteer troops]] within their respective areas. On mobilisation, divisional staffs took the field, leaving no-one to maintain the local administration. [[Military logistics|Supporting services]] were insufficient, and many troops intended for the field force were not moved from their old stations into the areas of their new divisional command. These defects became clear during the [[First World War]], and lead to further reorganisation.<ref>Heathcote, p. 32</ref>\n\nThe Indian Army Act 1911 legislated the replacement of the Indian Articles of War 1869. It was passed by the [[Governor General of India|Governor General]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=752287|title=British India|first=Courtenay|last=Ilbert|date=1 January 1913|publisher=|journal=Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation|volume=13|issue=2|pages=327\u2013333}}</ref> It was under aspects of this law that the Army charged defendants during the [[Indian National Army Trials]] in 1945.

They felt that any more would jeopardise national security. More than four divisions were eventually sent as [[Indian Expeditionary Force A]]<ref name=barua>{{Cite book|title=The Gentlemen of the Raj|last=Barua|first=Pradeep|publisher=Praeger Publishing|location=Westport, CT|year=2003}}</ref> formed the [[Indian Corps]] and the [[Indian Cavalry Corps]] that arrived on the Western Front in 1914. The high number of officer casualties the corps suffered early on had an effect on its later performance. British officers that understood the language, customs, and psychology of their men could not be quickly replaced, and the alien environment of the Western Front had some effect on the soldiers. However, the feared unrest in India never happened, and while the Indian Corps was transferred to the [[Middle East]] in 1915 India provided many more divisions for active service during the course of the war.<ref>Haythornthwaite P.J. (1992). ''The World War One Sourcebook'', Arms and Armour Press.</ref>\nIndians' first engagement was on the Western Front within a month of the start of the war, at the [[First Battle of Ypres]]. Here, [[The Garhwal Rifles|Garwhal Rifles]] were involved in the war's first trench raid on 9\u201310 November 1914 and [[Khudadad Khan]] became the first Indian to win a Victoria Cross.  After a year of front-line duty, sickness and casualties had reduced the Indian Corps to the point where it had to be withdrawn.\n\nNearly 700,000 then served in the Middle East, fighting against the Turks in the Mesopotamian campaign.<ref name=\"Memorial Gates Trust\">{{citation|url=http://www.mgtrust.org/ind1.htm|title=Participants from the Indian subcontinent in the First World War|publisher=Memorial Gates Trust|accessdate=2009-09-12}}</ref> There they were short of transportation for resupply and operated in extremely hot and dusty conditions. Led by Major General Sir Charles Townshend, they pushed on to capture Baghdad but they were repulsed by Ottoman Forces.\n\nIn the First World War the Indian Army saw extensive active service, including:\n* [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]]: [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]]\n* [[Battle of Gallipoli]]\n* [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]\n* [[Mesopotamian Campaign]], [[Siege of Kut]]\n* [[East Africa]], including the [[Battle of Tanga]]\n\nParticipants from the Indian subcontinent won 13,000 medals, including 12 Victoria Crosses. By the end of the war a total of 47,746 Indians had been reported dead or missing; 65,126 were wounded.<ref name=\"Memorial Gates Trust\"/>\n\nAlso serving in the First World War were so-called \"[[Imperial Service Troops]]\", provided by the semi-autonomous [[Princely States]]. About 21,000 were raised in the First World War, mainly consisting of [[Sikhs]] of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Rajputs]] from [[Rajputana]] (such as the [[Bikaner Camel Corps]] and the [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Mysore]] and [[Jodhpur]] Lancers of the [[Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade]]). These forces played a prominent role in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]].\n\n===Interbellum (1918\u20131939)===\n\nElements of the Army operated around [[Mary, Turkmenistan]] in 1918\u201319. See [[Malleson mission]] and [[Entente intervention in the Russian Civil War]]. The army then took part in the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1919. In the aftermath of the First World War, the [[Indian Territorial Force]] and [[Auxiliary Force (India)]] were created in the 1920s. The Indian Territorial Force was a part-time, paid, all-volunteer organisation within the army. Its units were primarily made up of European officers and Indian [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. The ITF was created by the Indian Territorial Force Act 1920<ref>\"Indian Auxiliary Forces: A Territorial Scheme\", ''[[The Times]]'', 1 October 1920</ref> to replace the Indian section of the [[Indian Defence Force]]. It was an all-volunteer force modelled after the British [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. The European parallel to the ITF was the [[Auxiliary Force (India)]].\n\nAfter the First World War the British started the process of [[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]], by which Indians were promoted into higher officer ranks. Indian cadets were sent to study in Great Britain at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and were given full commissions as [[King's Commissioned Indian Officer]]s. The KCIOs were equivalent in every way to British commissioned officers and had full authority over British troops (unlike VCOs). Some KCIOs were attached to British Army units for a part of their careers.\n\nIn 1922, after experience had shown that the large groups of single battalion regiments were unwieldy, a number of large regiments were created, and numerous cavalry regiments amalgamated. The [[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1922)]] shows the reduced number of larger regiments. Until 1932 most Indian Army officers, both British and Indian, were trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after that date the Indian officers increasingly received their training at the [[Indian Military Academy]] in [[Dehradun]] which was established that year.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Indian Army during World War II|India in World War II}}\n[[File:IWM-E-003660-4700-32.jpg|thumb|200px|Soldiers of the 4th Indian Division decorate the side of their lorry \"[[Khyber Pass]] to Hell-Fire Pass\" during [[Operation Battleaxe]] in June 1941.]]\n[[File:Newly-arrived Indian troops.jpg|thumb|200px|Indian troops on the quayside at Singapore, November 1941]]\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|200px|Indian Army Sikh personnel in action during the successful [[Operation Crusader]] in December 1941.]]\n[[File:British commander and Indian crew encounter elephant near Meiktila 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Sherman tank of the [[9th Royal Deccan Horse]], [[255th Indian Tank Brigade]], Burma 1945]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the Indian Army numbered 205,000 men. Later on during the Second World War the Indian Army would become the largest all-volunteer force in history, rising to over 2.5&nbsp;million men in size. In doing so the [[Indian III Corps]], [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|Indian IV Corps]], [[Indian XV Corps]], [[Indian XXXIII Corps]], [[Indian XXXIV Corps]], 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 17th, 19th, 20th, 21st, and 23rd Indian Divisions were formed, as well as other forces. Additionally two armoured divisions and an airborne division were created. In matters of administration, weapons, training, and equipment, the Indian Army had considerable independence; for example, prior to the war the Indian Army adopted the [[Vickers-Berthier]] (VB) light machine gun instead of the [[Bren gun]] of the British Army, while continuing to manufacture and issue the older [[Lee\u2013Enfield|SMLE No. 1 Mk III]] rifle during the Second World War, instead of the Lee\u2013Enfield No.4 Mk I issued to the British Army from the middle of the war.<ref>Weeks, John, ''World War II Small Arms'', New York: Galahad Books (1979), {{ISBN|0-88365-403-2}}, p. 89</ref>\n\nParticularly notable contributions of the Indian Army during that conflict were the:\n*[[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II]]\n**[[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]]\n**[[North African campaign]]\n***[[Operation Compass]]\n***[[Operation Battleaxe]]\n***[[Operation Crusader]]\n***[[First Battle of El Alamein]]\n***[[Second Battle of El Alamein]]\n**[[Anglo-Iraqi War]]\n**[[Syria-Lebanon campaign]]\n**[[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]\n**[[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]]\n***[[Battle of Monte Cassino]]\n*[[Battle of Hong Kong]]\n*[[Battle of Malaya]]\n*[[Battle of Singapore]]\n*[[Burma Campaign]]\n**[[Battle of Kohima]]\n**[[Battle of Imphal]]\n\nAbout 87,000 Indian soldiers lost their lives during this conflict. Indian soldiers were awarded 30 [[Victoria Cross]]es during the Second World War. (See: [[List of Indian Victoria Cross recipients|Indian Victoria Cross recipients]].)\n\nThe Germans and Japanese were relatively successful in recruiting combat forces from Indian [[prisoners of war]]. These forces were known as the [[Tiger Legion]] and the [[Indian National Army]] (INA). Indian nationalist leader [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] led the 40,000-strong INA. From a total of about 55,000 Indians taken prisoner in Malaya and Singapore in February 1942, about 30,000 joined the INA,<ref name=\"Great_in_adversity\">Peter Stanley ''[http://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j37/indians.htm \"Great in adversity\": Indian prisoners of war in New Guinea]'' website of the [[Australian War Memorial]]</ref> which fought Allied forces in the Burma Campaign. Others became guards at Japanese POW camps. The recruitment was the brainchild of Major [[Fujiwara Iwaichi]] who mentions in his memoirs that Captain [[Mohan Singh Deb]], who surrendered after [[Battle of Jitra|\nthe fall of Jitra]] became the founder of the INA.\n\nSome Indian Army personnel resisted recruitment and remained POWs.{{sfn|Barkawi|2006|p=341}} An unknown number captured in Malaya and Singapore were taken to Japanese-occupied areas of [[New Guinea]] as forced labour. Many of these men suffered severe hardships and brutality, similar to that experienced by other prisoners of Japan during the Second World War. About 6,000 of them survived until they were liberated by Australian or US forces, in 1943\u201345.<ref name=\"Great_in_adversity\"/>\n\nDuring the later stages of the Second World War, from the fall of [[Singapore]] and the ending of [[ABDACOM]] in early 1942 until the formation of the [[South East Asia Command]] (SEAC) in August 1943, some American and Chinese units were placed under British military command.\n\n===Post Second World War===\nAs a result of the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the formations, units, assets, and indigenous personnel of the Indian Army were divided, with two-thirds of the assets being retained by the [[Union of India]], and one third going to the new [[Dominion of Pakistan]].<ref>Brian Lapping, 'End of Empire,' Guild Publishing, London, 1985, p.75-6, p.82: 'By comparison with the two great provinces [Punjab & Sindh] partition of the army and the civil service was easy, though by any other standard, it was difficult, wasteful, and destructive. ... The men were transferred in their units. Regiments of Sikh and Hindu soldiers from the north-west frontier had to make their way through Muslim territory to get out of what was to be Pakistan.'</ref> Four [[Gurkha]] regiments (mostly recruited in [[Nepal]], which was outside India), were transferred from the former Indian Army to the British Army, forming its [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] and departing for a new station in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]. British Army units stationed in India returned to the [[United Kingdom]] or were posted to other stations outside India and Pakistan. During the transition period after partition, Headquarters British Troops in India, under then [[Major General]] [[Lashmer Whistler]], controlled the departing British units. The last British unit, 1st Battalion, [[Somerset Light Infantry]], left on 28 February 1948.<ref>{{cite book| first=Sir John| last=Smyth| authorlink=Sir John Smyth, 1st Baronet | title=Bolo Whistler: the life of General Sir Lashmer Whistler: a study in leadership| location=London| publisher=Muller| year=1967| oclc=59031387 |pages=170\u2013184}}</ref> Equipment from most British units was retained by the [[Indian Army]], as only a single infantry division, the [[7th Indian Infantry Division]], had been stationed in Pakistan before partition.\n\nMost of the remainder of the Indian Army's Muslim personnel proceeded to join the newly created [[Pakistan Army]]. Due to a shortage of experienced officers, several hundred British officers remained in Pakistan on contract until the early 1950s. From 1947 to 1948, soon after the Partition of India and of the Indian Army, the two new armies fought each other in the [[First Kashmir War]], beginning a bitter rivalry which has continued into the 21st century.\n\nThe present-day [[Indian Army]] and [[Pakistan Army]] thus were formed from units of the pre-partition Indian Army. Both of these forces, and the [[Bangladesh Army]] which was created from the Pakistan Army on the independence of [[Bangladesh]], retain many British Indian Army traditions.\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Commander-in-Chief, India]]\n*[[Chief of the General Staff (India)]]\n*[[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)]]\n*[[List of Indian Victoria Cross recipients]]\n*[[Indian Order of Merit]]\n*[[Indian Distinguished Service Medal]]\n*[[Order of British India]]\n*[[Observatory Ridge, Johannesburg]], site of a monument commemorating the British Indian Army\n*[[Royal Indian Navy]]\n*[[Indian Military Historical Society]]\n*[[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] \u2013 having a similar function in the Netherlands East Indies\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Barkawi |first=Tarak |date=April 2006 |title=Culture and Combat in the Colonies: The Indian Army In the Second World War |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume=41 |issue=2 |publisher=Sage |pages=325\u2013355 |doi=10.1177/0022009406062071 |url=https://cambridge.academia.edu/TarakBarkawi/Papers/267472/Culture_and_Combat_In_the_Colonies_The_Indian_Army_In_the_Second_World_War}}\n* Barthorp, Michael.

The first army officially called the \"Indian Army\" was raised by the government of India in 1895, existing alongside the three long-established [[presidency armies]]. However, in 1903 the Indian Army absorbed these three armies.  The Indian Army should not be confused with the \"[[Army of India]]\" (1903\u20131947) which was the Indian Army itself plus the \"British Army in India\" (British units sent to India).\n\n==Organisation==\n[[File:Madras cavalry.jpg|thumb|220px|A painting showing a ''[[sowar]]'' of the [[6th Madras Light Cavalry]], circa 1845.]]\n[[File:The Queen's Own Madras Sappers and Miners, Review Order.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The [[Queen's Own Madras Sappers and Miners]], 1896.]]\nThe Indian Army has its origins in the years after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], often called the Indian Mutiny in British histories, when in 1858 [[the Crown]] took over direct rule of British India from the [[East India Company]].  Before 1858, the precursor units of the Indian Army were units controlled by the Company and were paid for by their profits. These operated alongside units of the British Army, funded by the British government in [[London]].<ref>Harold E. Raugh, ''The Victorians at war, 1815\u20131914: an encyclopedia of British military history'' (2004) pp 173\u201379</ref>\n\nThe armies of the East India Company were recruited primarily from Muslims in the [[Bengal Presidency]], which consisted of [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], and high caste Hindus recruited primarily from the rural plains of [[Oudh]].  Many of these troops took part in the [[Indian Mutiny]], with the aim of reinstating the Mughal Emperor [[Bahadur Shah II]] at Delhi, partly as a result of insensitive treatment by their British officers.\n\nThe meaning of the term \"Indian Army\" has changed over time:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|width=80|1858\u20131894\n|The '''Indian Army''' was an informal collective term for the [[Presidency armies|armies of the three presidencies]]; the [[Bengal Army]], [[Madras Army]] and [[Bombay Army]].\n|-\n|1895\u20131902\n|The '''Indian Army''' had a formal existence and was the \"army of the government of India\", including British and Indian ([[sepoy]]) units.\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|1903\u20131947\n|[[Horatio Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]] was [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], between 1902 and 1909.

He formed higher level formations, eight army divisions, and brigaded Indian and British units. Following Kitchener's reforms:\n*The '''Indian Army''' was \"the force recruited locally and permanently based in India, together with its expatriate British officers.\"<ref>Oxford History of the British Army</ref>\n*The '''British Army in India''' consisted of British Army units posted to India for a tour of duty, and which would then be posted to other parts of the Empire or back to the UK.\n*The '''Army of India''' consisted of both the Indian Army and the British Army in India.\n|}\n\n===Command===\nThe officer commanding the Army of India was the [[Commander-in-Chief, India]] who reported to the civilian [[Governor-General of India]]. The title was used before the creation of a unified British Indian Army; the first holder was Major General [[Stringer Lawrence]] in 1748. By the early 1900s the Commander-in-Chief and his staff were based at [[GHQ India]]. Indian Army postings were less prestigious than British Army positions, but the pay was significantly greater so that officers could live on their salaries instead of having to have a private income. Accordingly, vacancies in the Indian Army were much sought after and generally reserved for the higher placed officer-cadets graduating from the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. British officers in the Indian Army were expected to learn to speak the Indian languages of their men, who tended to be recruited from primarily [[Hindi]] speaking areas. Prominent British Indian Army officers included [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], [[William Birdwood, 1st Baron Birdwood|Sir William Birdwood]], [[Sir Claude Auchinleck]] and [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|Sir William Slim]].\n\n===Personnel===\n[[File:RML7pounderMountanGunHazaraBattery1895.jpg|thumb|right|200px|No. 4 ([[Hazara, Pakistan|Hazara]]) Mountain Battery with [[RML 7 pounder Mountain Gun|RML7 pounder \"Steel Gun\" Mountain Gun]] in Review Order.

[[King's Commissioned Indian Officer]]s (KCIOs), created from the 1920s, held equal powers to British officers. [[Viceroy's Commissioned Officer]]s were Indians holding officer ranks. They were treated in almost all respects as commissioned officers, but had authority over Indian troops only, and were subordinate to all British King's (and Queen's) Commissioned Officers and KCIOs. They included [[Subedar Major]] or [[Risaldar-Major]] (Cavalry), equivalents to a British [[Major]]; [[Subedar]] or [[Risaldar]] (Cavalry) equivalents to [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]]; and [[Jemadar]]s equivalent to [[Lieutenant]].\n\nRecruitment was entirely voluntary; about 1.75&nbsp;million men served in the First World War, many on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and 2.5&nbsp;million in the Second.

The Indian Army, like the Presidency armies, continued to provide armed support to the civil authorities, both in combating banditry and in case of riots and rebellion. One of the first external operations the new unified army faced was the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China from 1899 to 1901.\n\n==Kitchener reforms==\nThe Kitchener reforms began in 1903 when [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] of [[Khartoum]], newly appointed [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], completed the unification of the three former Presidency [[army|armies]], and also the [[Punjab Frontier Force]], the [[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)#Former Hyderabad Regiments|Hyderabad Contingent]] and other local forces, into one Indian Army; see [[Army of India]] (including also units of the [[British Army]] stationed in India).\n\nThe principles underlying the reforms were that:\n* defence of the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]] against foreign aggression was the army's primary role\n* all units were to have training and experience in that role on that frontier\n* the army's organisation should be the same in peace as in war\n* maintaining [[internal security]] was for the army a secondary role, in support of the [[police]].<ref>Barthorp pp. 142\u20133</ref>\n\nLord Kitchener found the army scattered across the country in [[Military base|stations]] at [[brigade]] or [[regiment]]al strength, and in effect, providing [[garrison]]s for most of the major cities.<ref name=Heathcotep30/>\nThe reformed Indian Army was to be stationed in operational [[formation (military)|formations]] and concentrated in the north of the [[Indian subcontinent|sub-continent]]. The Commander-in-Chief's plan called for nine fighting [[Division (military)|divisions]] grouped in two [[corps]] commands on the main axes through the North-West Frontier. Five divisions were to be grouped on the [[Lucknow]] \u2013 [[Peshawar]] \u2013 [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] axis, and four divisions on the [[Bombay]] \u2013 [[Mhow]] \u2013 [[Quetta]] axis.<ref name=Barthorpp143>Barthorp, p. 143</ref> However, the cost of abandoning some thirty-four stations and building new ones in the proposed corps areas was considered prohibitive, and that aspect of the plan had to be modified.<ref name=Heathcotep31>Heathcote, p. 31</ref>\n\nUnder the compromise adopted in 1905, the four existing commands were reduced to three, and together with Army [[Headquarters (military)|Headquarters]], arranged in ten standing divisions and four independent brigades:\n*[[Northern Command (India)|Northern Command]] comprised the [[1st (Peshawar) Division]], the [[2nd (Rawalpindi) Division]], the [[3rd (Lahore) Division]], the [[Kohat Brigade]], the [[Bannu Brigade]], and the [[Derajat Brigade]].\n*[[Western Command (India)|Western Command]] comprised the [[4th (Quetta) Division]], the [[5th (Mhow) Division]], the [[6th (Poona) Division]], and the [[Aden Brigade]], located in Aden in the Arabian Peninsula.\n*[[Eastern Command (India)|Eastern Command]] comprised the [[7th (Meerut) Division]] and the [[8th (Lucknow) Division]].\n\nArmy Headquarters retained the [[9th (Secunderabad) Division]] and the [[Burma Division]] under its direct control.<ref name=Heathcotep31/><ref>Sumner p. 9</ref> The numbered divisions were organised so that on mobilisation they could deploy a complete [[infantry division]], a [[cavalry]] brigade, and a number of troops for internal security or local frontier defence. Permanent divisional commands were formed with an establishment of staff officers under a [[Major-General]].<ref name=Heathcotep31/>\n\nAfter the reforms ended in 1909, the Indian Army was organised along British lines, although it was always behind in terms of equipment. An Indian Army division consisted of three brigades each of four battalions. Three of these battalions were of the Indian Army, and one British. The Indian battalions were often segregated, with companies of different tribes, castes or religions. One and a half million volunteers came forward from the estimated population of 315 million in the Indian subcontinent.\n\nRegimental battalions were not permanently allocated to particular divisions or brigades, but instead spent some years in one formation, and were then posted to another elsewhere. This rotating arrangement was intended both to provide all units with experience of [[active service]] on the Frontier, and to prevent them becoming 'localised' in static regimental stations.<ref name=Heathcotep31/> In contrast, the divisional locations remained constant\n\n===Renumbering and renaming the regiments===\n::''See [[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)]]''\nTo emphasise that there was now only one Indian Army, and that all units were to be trained and deployed without regard for their regional origins, the regiments were renumbered into single sequences of cavalry, [[artillery]], [[infantry of the line]], and [[Gurkha Rifles (disambiguation)|G\u00farkha Rifles]].<ref name=Heathcotep31/>\nRegimental designations were altered to remove all references to the former Presidential Armies.<ref name=Gaylorp5/> Where appropriate subsidiary titles recalling other identifying details were adopted. Thus the 2nd Bengal Lancers became the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]].\n\nThe new order began with the Bengal regiments, followed by the Punjab Frontier Force, then the regiments of Madras, the Hyderabad Contingent, and Bombay. Wherever possible a significant digit was retained in the new number.<ref name=Gaylorp5/> Thus the '''1st Sikh Infantry''' became the '''[[51st Sikhs]]''', the '''1st Madras Pioneers''' became the '''[[61st Pioneers]]''', and the '''1st Bombay Grenadiers''' became the [[101st Grenadiers]].\n\nThe '''G\u00farkha Regiments''' had developed into their own Line of [[rifle regiments]] since 1861. They were five of these until they were joined by the former 42nd, 43rd, & 44th Gurkha Regiments of the Bengal Army, who became the 6th, 7th, & 8th G\u00farkha Rifles. The numbers 42, 43, & 44 were allocated respectively to the [[42nd Deoli Regiment|Deoli]] and [[43rd Erinpura Regiment|Erinpura]] Irregular Forces and the [[44th Merwara Infantry|Mhairwara]] Battalion from [[Rajputana]].<ref>Gaylor, p. 10</ref>\n\nThe [[mountain gun|mountain]] [[Artillery battery|batteries]] had already lost their numbers two years earlier. Under the 1903 reforms they were renumbered with twenty added to their original numbers.<ref>Gaylor, p 107</ref> The army had very little artillery (only 12 batteries of [[mountain artillery]]), and [[Royal Indian Artillery]] batteries were attached to the divisions. The [[Indian Army Corps of Engineers]] was formed by the Group of [[Madras Engineer Group|Madras]], [[Bengal Engineer Group|Bengal]] and [[Bombay Engineer Group|Bombay Sappers]] in their respective presidencies.\n\nThe Queen's Own Corps of Guides, Punjab Frontier Force, composed of cavalry [[squadron (army)|squadron]]s and infantry [[Company (military unit)|companies]], was renamed the [[Queen's Own Corps of Guides (Lumsden's)]] but stayed numberless. The new regimental numbering and namings were notified in ''India Army Order 181'', dated 2 October 1903.<ref>Roger, p. 20</ref>\n\nIn 1903 the title of the [[Indian Staff Corps]] was abolished, and thereafter officers were simply appointed to 'the Indian Army.'<ref>Robson p. 57</ref> A [[General Staff]] was then created to deal with overall military policy, supervision of training in peacetime, conduct of [[military operation|operations]] in war, distribution of forces for internal security or external [[military deployment|deployment]], plans for future operations and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].<ref name=Heathcotep26>Heathcote p. 26</ref> Functions were divided along British lines into two branches; the [[Adjutant-General]], dealing with training, discipline, and personnel, and the [[Quartermaster-General]], dealing with supplies, accommodation, and communications. In 1906 a General Branch was established to deal with\nmilitary policy, organisation and deployment, [[mobilisation]] and war plans, and intelligence and the conduct of operations.<ref name=Heathcotep139>Heathcote p. 139</ref> The Chiefs of the staff branches answered to the [[Chief of the General Staff (India)|Chief of the General Staff]], whose post was held by a [[Lieutenant-General]].<ref name=Heathcotep26/> To provide training for [[staff officers]], the [[Command and Staff College|Indian staff College]] was established in 1905, and permanently based at [[Quetta]] from 1907.<ref name=Heathcotep139/>\n\nWith no intermediate [[chain of command]], army headquarters was weighed down with minor administrative details. Divisional commanders were responsible not only for their active formations, but also for internal security and [[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)#Volunteer Corps|volunteer troops]] within their respective areas. On mobilisation, divisional staffs took the field, leaving no-one to maintain the local administration. [[Military logistics|Supporting services]] were insufficient, and many troops intended for the field force were not moved from their old stations into the areas of their new divisional command. These defects became clear during the [[First World War]], and lead to further reorganisation.<ref>Heathcote, p. 32</ref>\n\nThe Indian Army Act 1911 legislated the replacement of the Indian Articles of War 1869. It was passed by the [[Governor General of India|Governor General]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=752287|title=British India|first=Courtenay|last=Ilbert|date=1 January 1913|publisher=|journal=Journal of the Society of Comparative Legislation|volume=13|issue=2|pages=327\u2013333}}</ref> It was under aspects of this law that the Army charged defendants during the [[Indian National Army Trials]] in 1945.

Led by Major General Sir Charles Townshend, they pushed on to capture Baghdad but they were repulsed by Ottoman Forces.\n\nIn the First World War the Indian Army saw extensive active service, including:\n* [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]]: [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]]\n* [[Battle of Gallipoli]]\n* [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]\n* [[Mesopotamian Campaign]], [[Siege of Kut]]\n* [[East Africa]], including the [[Battle of Tanga]]\n\nParticipants from the Indian subcontinent won 13,000 medals, including 12 Victoria Crosses. By the end of the war a total of 47,746 Indians had been reported dead or missing; 65,126 were wounded.<ref name=\"Memorial Gates Trust\"/>\n\nAlso serving in the First World War were so-called \"[[Imperial Service Troops]]\", provided by the semi-autonomous [[Princely States]]. About 21,000 were raised in the First World War, mainly consisting of [[Sikhs]] of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Rajputs]] from [[Rajputana]] (such as the [[Bikaner Camel Corps]] and the [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Mysore]] and [[Jodhpur]] Lancers of the [[Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade]]). These forces played a prominent role in the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]].\n\n===Interbellum (1918\u20131939)===\n\nElements of the Army operated around [[Mary, Turkmenistan]] in 1918\u201319. See [[Malleson mission]] and [[Entente intervention in the Russian Civil War]]. The army then took part in the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1919. In the aftermath of the First World War, the [[Indian Territorial Force]] and [[Auxiliary Force (India)]] were created in the 1920s. The Indian Territorial Force was a part-time, paid, all-volunteer organisation within the army. Its units were primarily made up of European officers and Indian [[Other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. The ITF was created by the Indian Territorial Force Act 1920<ref>\"Indian Auxiliary Forces: A Territorial Scheme\", ''[[The Times]]'', 1 October 1920</ref> to replace the Indian section of the [[Indian Defence Force]]. It was an all-volunteer force modelled after the British [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. The European parallel to the ITF was the [[Auxiliary Force (India)]].\n\nAfter the First World War the British started the process of [[Indianisation (British India)|Indianisation]], by which Indians were promoted into higher officer ranks. Indian cadets were sent to study in Great Britain at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]], and were given full commissions as [[King's Commissioned Indian Officer]]s. The KCIOs were equivalent in every way to British commissioned officers and had full authority over British troops (unlike VCOs). Some KCIOs were attached to British Army units for a part of their careers.\n\nIn 1922, after experience had shown that the large groups of single battalion regiments were unwieldy, a number of large regiments were created, and numerous cavalry regiments amalgamated. The [[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1922)]] shows the reduced number of larger regiments. Until 1932 most Indian Army officers, both British and Indian, were trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, after that date the Indian officers increasingly received their training at the [[Indian Military Academy]] in [[Dehradun]] which was established that year.\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Indian Army during World War II|India in World War II}}\n[[File:IWM-E-003660-4700-32.jpg|thumb|200px|Soldiers of the 4th Indian Division decorate the side of their lorry \"[[Khyber Pass]] to Hell-Fire Pass\" during [[Operation Battleaxe]] in June 1941.]]\n[[File:Newly-arrived Indian troops.jpg|thumb|200px|Indian troops on the quayside at Singapore, November 1941]]\n[[File:Operation Crusader.jpg|thumb|200px|Indian Army Sikh personnel in action during the successful [[Operation Crusader]] in December 1941.]]\n[[File:British commander and Indian crew encounter elephant near Meiktila 2.jpg|thumb|200px|Sherman tank of the [[9th Royal Deccan Horse]], [[255th Indian Tank Brigade]], Burma 1945]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the Indian Army numbered 205,000 men. Later on during the Second World War the Indian Army would become the largest all-volunteer force in history, rising to over 2.5&nbsp;million men in size. In doing so the [[Indian III Corps]], [[IV Corps (United Kingdom)|Indian IV Corps]], [[Indian XV Corps]], [[Indian XXXIII Corps]], [[Indian XXXIV Corps]], 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 14th, 17th, 19th, 20th, 21st, and 23rd Indian Divisions were formed, as well as other forces. Additionally two armoured divisions and an airborne division were created. In matters of administration, weapons, training, and equipment, the Indian Army had considerable independence; for example, prior to the war the Indian Army adopted the [[Vickers-Berthier]] (VB) light machine gun instead of the [[Bren gun]] of the British Army, while continuing to manufacture and issue the older [[Lee\u2013Enfield|SMLE No. 1 Mk III]] rifle during the Second World War, instead of the Lee\u2013Enfield No.4 Mk I issued to the British Army from the middle of the war.<ref>Weeks, John, ''World War II Small Arms'', New York: Galahad Books (1979), {{ISBN|0-88365-403-2}}, p. 89</ref>\n\nParticularly notable contributions of the Indian Army during that conflict were the:\n*[[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II]]\n**[[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]]\n**[[North African campaign]]\n***[[Operation Compass]]\n***[[Operation Battleaxe]]\n***[[Operation Crusader]]\n***[[First Battle of El Alamein]]\n***[[Second Battle of El Alamein]]\n**[[Anglo-Iraqi War]]\n**[[Syria-Lebanon campaign]]\n**[[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran]]\n**[[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]]\n***[[Battle of Monte Cassino]]\n*[[Battle of Hong Kong]]\n*[[Battle of Malaya]]\n*[[Battle of Singapore]]\n*[[Burma Campaign]]\n**[[Battle of Kohima]]\n**[[Battle of Imphal]]\n\nAbout 87,000 Indian soldiers lost their lives during this conflict. Indian soldiers were awarded 30 [[Victoria Cross]]es during the Second World War. (See: [[List of Indian Victoria Cross recipients|Indian Victoria Cross recipients]].)\n\nThe Germans and Japanese were relatively successful in recruiting combat forces from Indian [[prisoners of war]]. These forces were known as the [[Tiger Legion]] and the [[Indian National Army]] (INA). Indian nationalist leader [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] led the 40,000-strong INA. From a total of about 55,000 Indians taken prisoner in Malaya and Singapore in February 1942, about 30,000 joined the INA,<ref name=\"Great_in_adversity\">Peter Stanley ''[http://www.awm.gov.au/journal/j37/indians.htm \"Great in adversity\": Indian prisoners of war in New Guinea]'' website of the [[Australian War Memorial]]</ref> which fought Allied forces in the Burma Campaign. Others became guards at Japanese POW camps. The recruitment was the brainchild of Major [[Fujiwara Iwaichi]] who mentions in his memoirs that Captain [[Mohan Singh Deb]], who surrendered after [[Battle of Jitra|\nthe fall of Jitra]] became the founder of the INA.\n\nSome Indian Army personnel resisted recruitment and remained POWs.{{sfn|Barkawi|2006|p=341}} An unknown number captured in Malaya and Singapore were taken to Japanese-occupied areas of [[New Guinea]] as forced labour. Many of these men suffered severe hardships and brutality, similar to that experienced by other prisoners of Japan during the Second World War. About 6,000 of them survived until they were liberated by Australian or US forces, in 1943\u201345.<ref name=\"Great_in_adversity\"/>\n\nDuring the later stages of the Second World War, from the fall of [[Singapore]] and the ending of [[ABDACOM]] in early 1942 until the formation of the [[South East Asia Command]] (SEAC) in August 1943, some American and Chinese units were placed under British military command.\n\n===Post Second World War===\nAs a result of the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, the formations, units, assets, and indigenous personnel of the Indian Army were divided, with two-thirds of the assets being retained by the [[Union of India]], and one third going to the new [[Dominion of Pakistan]].<ref>Brian Lapping, 'End of Empire,' Guild Publishing, London, 1985, p.75-6, p.82: 'By comparison with the two great provinces [Punjab & Sindh] partition of the army and the civil service was easy, though by any other standard, it was difficult, wasteful, and destructive. ... The men were transferred in their units. Regiments of Sikh and Hindu soldiers from the north-west frontier had to make their way through Muslim territory to get out of what was to be Pakistan.'</ref> Four [[Gurkha]] regiments (mostly recruited in [[Nepal]], which was outside India), were transferred from the former Indian Army to the British Army, forming its [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] and departing for a new station in [[Malayan Union|Malaya]]. British Army units stationed in India returned to the [[United Kingdom]] or were posted to other stations outside India and Pakistan. During the transition period after partition, Headquarters British Troops in India, under then [[Major General]] [[Lashmer Whistler]], controlled the departing British units. The last British unit, 1st Battalion, [[Somerset Light Infantry]], left on 28 February 1948.<ref>{{cite book| first=Sir John| last=Smyth| authorlink=Sir John Smyth, 1st Baronet | title=Bolo Whistler: the life of General Sir Lashmer Whistler: a study in leadership| location=London| publisher=Muller| year=1967| oclc=59031387 |pages=170\u2013184}}</ref> Equipment from most British units was retained by the [[Indian Army]], as only a single infantry division, the [[7th Indian Infantry Division]], had been stationed in Pakistan before partition.\n\nMost of the remainder of the Indian Army's Muslim personnel proceeded to join the newly created [[Pakistan Army]]. Due to a shortage of experienced officers, several hundred British officers remained in Pakistan on contract until the early 1950s. From 1947 to 1948, soon after the Partition of India and of the Indian Army, the two new armies fought each other in the [[First Kashmir War]], beginning a bitter rivalry which has continued into the 21st century.\n\nThe present-day [[Indian Army]] and [[Pakistan Army]] thus were formed from units of the pre-partition Indian Army. Both of these forces, and the [[Bangladesh Army]] which was created from the Pakistan Army on the independence of [[Bangladesh]], retain many British Indian Army traditions.\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Commander-in-Chief, India]]\n*[[Chief of the General Staff (India)]]\n*[[List of regiments of the Indian Army (1903)]]\n*[[List of Indian Victoria Cross recipients]]\n*[[Indian Order of Merit]]\n*[[Indian Distinguished Service Medal]]\n*[[Order of British India]]\n*[[Observatory Ridge, Johannesburg]], site of a monument commemorating the British Indian Army\n*[[Royal Indian Navy]]\n*[[Indian Military Historical Society]]\n*[[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] \u2013 having a similar function in the Netherlands East Indies\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |last=Barkawi |first=Tarak |date=April 2006 |title=Culture and Combat in the Colonies: The Indian Army In the Second World War |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |volume=41 |issue=2 |publisher=Sage |pages=325\u2013355 |doi=10.1177/0022009406062071 |url=https://cambridge.academia.edu/TarakBarkawi/Papers/267472/Culture_and_Combat_In_the_Colonies_The_Indian_Army_In_the_Second_World_War}}\n* Barthorp, Michael.
