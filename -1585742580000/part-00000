{"title_page": "Guided by Voices", "text_new": "\n\n'''Guided by Voices''' ('''GBV''') is an American [[indie rock]] band formed in 1983 in [[Dayton, Ohio]]. It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter [[Robert Pollard]], who founded the group with his brother Jim Pollard, guitarist [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]], [[Tobin Sprout]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]]. The \"classic\" lineup included these musicians along with  bassist [[Greg Demos]], who also has some song co-writing credits.\n\nNoted at first for their [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic and typically [[Portastudio]] four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music was influenced by early post\u2013[[British Invasion]] [[garage rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]]. The band has had a prolific output, releasing 28 full-length albums along with [[Guided By Voices discography|many other releases]]. Most songs are in the two-minute range, but many are even shorter; often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade [[sound effect]]s.\n\nGuided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004. In 2010 the \"classic\" lineup reunited to perform at [[Matador Records]] 21st anniversary party, subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in 2014, but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in 2016.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1983\u20131991)===\nFormed in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene.  As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation.  Guided by Voices' recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases beginning with the R.E.M.-inspired E.P. ''[[Forever Since Breakfast]]'' and followed by the albums ''[[Devil Between My Toes]]'', ''[[Sandbox (Guided by Voices album)|Sandbox]]'', ''[[Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia]]'', and ''[[Same Place The Fly Got Smashed]]''.  With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members' family and friends.\n\n===Lo-fi (1992\u20131996)===\nWith the release of the ultra-limited album ''[[Propeller (Guided by Voices album)|Propeller]]'' in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the [[college rock]] circuit and bands such as [[Sonic Youth]], [[R.E.M.]] and [[The Breeders]].  New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices' return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993.  At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced around the core of Pollard, guitarists [[Tobin Sprout]] and [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]] (not to be confused with [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s drummer), bassist [[Greg Demos]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]].  Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band, had re-joined circa ''Propeller'' and soon became Pollard's primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band's catalog. 1993 also saw the release of ''[[Vampire on Titus]]'', as well as the ''[[Fast Japanese Spin Cycle]]'' and ''[[Static Airplane Jive]]'' EPs.  Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV's history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark ''[[Bee Thousand]]'' via [[Scat Records]], with a distribution deal through indie label [[Matador Records]].  Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time.  The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard's homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, [[Roger Daltrey]]-inspired mic-twirling, later beer can throwing at rival bands<ref>{{Citation|last=Tim Krings|title=Bob Pollard throwing empty beer can at band|date=2010-07-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnb4GuuR2Lw&list=LLzjuRvUk5CF_p8rBConuR8g&index=15|accessdate=2017-11-07}}</ref>), [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]]'s [[Guitar showmanship|windmilling]] and [[chain smoking]], sometime bassist [[Greg Demos]]' striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around.\n\nTheir true Matador debut came in 1995 with ''[[Alien Lanes]]'', which, despite a five-figure recording allowance, was constructed out of home-recorded snippets on the cheap.  The band's underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as [[MTV]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  Guided by Voices is frequently referenced by novelist and poet, Dennis Cooper, in his George Miles cycle and the group's lyrics appear in ''Guide'', the fourth of the five novels which make up the cycle. The first chapter of ''Guide'' is titled \"Guided by Voices\". After sessions for a concept album entitled ''[[The Power of Suck]]'' were aborted, the band assembled ''[[Under the Bushes Under the Stars]]'' out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with [[Kim Deal]] and [[Steve Albini]] among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the \"classic lineup\", with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career.  Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout's ''[[Carnival Boy]]'' and Pollard's ''[[Not in My Airforce]]'', with each making a guest appearance on the other's album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band's existence.  These records were primarily self-released. Because GBV alumni were regularly featured, and songs from these albums were frequently included in GBV setlists, they are informally considered to be part of the GBV canon. Also in 1995, the band contributed the song \"Sensational Gravity Boy\" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n===Major label (1997\u20132001)===\nPollard created a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with [[Cleveland]] [[glam rock]]ers [[Cobra Verde (band)|Cobra Verde]] in 1997. The following album ''[[Mag Earwhig!]]'', combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, \"[[Jane of the Waking Universe]]\", that featured the classic lineup for one last time.  However, after another year of rigorous touring, the \"Guided by Verde\" lineup split in late 1997 following Pollard's announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next Guided by Voices project.\n\nCobra Verde's [[Doug Gillard]] was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included \"classic\"-era bassist [[Greg Demos]], former [[The Breeders|Breeders]] drummer [[Jim Macpherson]], and eventually, former [[The Amps|Amps]]/Breeders guitarist [[The Amps|Nate Farley]]. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer [[Ric Ocasek]] to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices' [[major label]] debut.  Initially produced for [[Capitol Records]], ''[[Do the Collapse]]'' was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label [[TVT Records|TVT]].  (In the UK it was released on [[Creation Records]]). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, ''Do the Collapse'' failed to garner radio airplay, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews.\n\nThrough touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices' live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of [[The Who]], [[David Bowie]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption.  In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band's first and only visits to Australia and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the massive ''[[Suitcase: Failed Experiments and Trashed Aircraft|Suitcase]]'', a four-disc, 100-song trawl through three decades worth of Pollard's enormous reserve of unreleased material. (Three more box sets of unreleased songs, ''[[Suitcase 2: American Superdream Wow|Suitcase 2]]'', ''[[Suitcase 3: Up We Go Now|Suitcase 3]]'' and  ''[[Suitcase 4: Captain Kangaroo Won The War|Suitcase 4]]'' released in October 2005, November 2009 and November 2015 respectively.)\n\n2001's ''[[Isolation Drills]]'' was recorded with [[Rob Schnapf]],<ref name=BOMB-IsolationDrills-2001>{{cite journal|last1=McGonigal|first1=Mike|title=Robert Pollard|journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB]]|date=Summer 2001|issue=76|page=32\u201337|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/robert-pollard/|publisher=New Art Publications}}</ref> who aimed to capture the band's live sound more closely than did Ocasek. Though the album debuted in ''Billboard'''s top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough.\n\n===Later years (2002\u20132004)===\n[[File:Robert pollard 0001.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Robert Pollard]] performing with Guided By Voices in 2014|255x255px]]\nAfter departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released ''[[Universal Truths and Cycles]]'', a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band's mid-90's, mid-fi aesthetic. ''Universal Truths'' producer [[Todd Tobias]] would also record the band's final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled ''[[Earthquake Glue]]'', followed by the anthology box set ''[[Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere]]'' and the [[greatest hits]] compilation ''[[Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates]]''.\n\nIn 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |title=Special Announcement From Guided By Voices |publisher=Gbv.com |accessdate=2012-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315062433/http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |archivedate=2012-03-15 }}</ref> following the release of the ''[[Half-Smiles of the Decomposed]]'' LP, and a final farewell tour. Pollard stated:\n\n:\"This feels like the last album for Guided by Voices. I've always said that when I make a record that I'm totally satisfied with as befitting a final album, then that will be it. And this is it.\"\n\nGuided by Voices would go on to release no less than 15 more studio albums (since ''[[Surrender Your Poppy Field]]''')'''''.\n\nOn November 9, 2004, Guided by Voices performed on the stage of [[Austin City Limits]], broadcast by [[PBS]] on January 22, 2005. Their last television appearance was on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on December 2, 2004. They played the single, \"Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)\".  After a select round of final US shows, Guided by Voices played their final show at The Metro in Chicago on December 31, 2004.  The four-hour, 63-song marathon finale is documented on the DVD ''The Electrifying Conclusion''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gbvdb.com/album.asp?albumid=2184 |title=The Electrifying Conclusion |publisher=Gbvdb.com |date=1994-01-15 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Post-GBV (2005\u20132009)===\nPollard released his first post-GBV album in 2006 on [[Merge Records]].  The album, titled ''[[From a Compound Eye]]'' was a double LP produced by [[Todd Tobias]]. Later Pollard albums have been released on Merge and Pollard's own label, Guided by Voices Inc.\n\nFollowing GBV's demise, Pollard was frequently asked about band reunions. In 2007 he told [[Magnet (magazine)|''MAGNET'']]: \"To me, it\u2019s just cashing in. If you\u2019re gonna get the band back together, it should be to support a new record, not just to play the hits. That\u2019s like doing the county-fair circuit. I don\u2019t see Guided By Voices reforming.

It has made frequent personnel changes but always maintained the presence of principal songwriter [[Robert Pollard]], who founded the group with his brother Jim Pollard, guitarist [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]], [[Tobin Sprout]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]]. The \"classic\" lineup included these musicians along with  bassist [[Greg Demos]], who also has some song co-writing credits.\n\nNoted at first for their [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] aesthetic and typically [[Portastudio]] four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices' music was influenced by early post\u2013[[British Invasion]] [[garage rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]] and [[post-punk]]. The band has had a prolific output, releasing 28 full-length albums along with [[Guided By Voices discography|many other releases]]. Most songs are in the two-minute range, but many are even shorter; often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade [[sound effect]]s.\n\nGuided by Voices initially disbanded in 2004. In 2010 the \"classic\" lineup reunited to perform at [[Matador Records]] 21st anniversary party, subsequently touring and releasing six new albums. GBV broke up a second time in 2014, but Pollard again rebooted the band with a new album and a new lineup in 2016.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years (1983\u20131991)===\nFormed in [[Dayton, Ohio]], in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene.  As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation.  Guided by Voices' recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases beginning with the R.E.M.-inspired E.P. ''[[Forever Since Breakfast]]'' and followed by the albums ''[[Devil Between My Toes]]'', ''[[Sandbox (Guided by Voices album)|Sandbox]]'', ''[[Self-Inflicted Aerial Nostalgia]]'', and ''[[Same Place The Fly Got Smashed]]''.  With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members' family and friends.\n\n===Lo-fi (1992\u20131996)===\nWith the release of the ultra-limited album ''[[Propeller (Guided by Voices album)|Propeller]]'' in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the [[college rock]] circuit and bands such as [[Sonic Youth]], [[R.E.M.]] and [[The Breeders]].  New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices' return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993.  At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced around the core of Pollard, guitarists [[Tobin Sprout]] and [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]] (not to be confused with [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s drummer), bassist [[Greg Demos]], and drummer [[Kevin Fennell]].  Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-'80s version of the band, had re-joined circa ''Propeller'' and soon became Pollard's primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band's catalog. 1993 also saw the release of ''[[Vampire on Titus]]'', as well as the ''[[Fast Japanese Spin Cycle]]'' and ''[[Static Airplane Jive]]'' EPs.  Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine.\n\nIn 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV's history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark ''[[Bee Thousand]]'' via [[Scat Records]], with a distribution deal through indie label [[Matador Records]].  Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time.  The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard's homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, [[Roger Daltrey]]-inspired mic-twirling, later beer can throwing at rival bands<ref>{{Citation|last=Tim Krings|title=Bob Pollard throwing empty beer can at band|date=2010-07-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnb4GuuR2Lw&list=LLzjuRvUk5CF_p8rBConuR8g&index=15|accessdate=2017-11-07}}</ref>), [[Mitch Mitchell (guitarist)|Mitch Mitchell]]'s [[Guitar showmanship|windmilling]] and [[chain smoking]], sometime bassist [[Greg Demos]]' striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around.\n\nTheir true Matador debut came in 1995 with ''[[Alien Lanes]]'', which, despite a five-figure recording allowance, was constructed out of home-recorded snippets on the cheap.  The band's underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as [[MTV]] and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  Guided by Voices is frequently referenced by novelist and poet, Dennis Cooper, in his George Miles cycle and the group's lyrics appear in ''Guide'', the fourth of the five novels which make up the cycle. The first chapter of ''Guide'' is titled \"Guided by Voices\". After sessions for a concept album entitled ''[[The Power of Suck]]'' were aborted, the band assembled ''[[Under the Bushes Under the Stars]]'' out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with [[Kim Deal]] and [[Steve Albini]] among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the \"classic lineup\", with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career.  Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout's ''[[Carnival Boy]]'' and Pollard's ''[[Not in My Airforce]]'', with each making a guest appearance on the other's album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band's existence.  These records were primarily self-released. Because GBV alumni were regularly featured, and songs from these albums were frequently included in GBV setlists, they are informally considered to be part of the GBV canon. Also in 1995, the band contributed the song \"Sensational Gravity Boy\" to the AIDS benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Bothered]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n===Major label (1997\u20132001)===\nPollard created a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with [[Cleveland]] [[glam rock]]ers [[Cobra Verde (band)|Cobra Verde]] in 1997. The following album ''[[Mag Earwhig!]]'', combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, \"[[Jane of the Waking Universe]]\", that featured the classic lineup for one last time.  However, after another year of rigorous touring, the \"Guided by Verde\" lineup split in late 1997 following Pollard's announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next Guided by Voices project.\n\nCobra Verde's [[Doug Gillard]] was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included \"classic\"-era bassist [[Greg Demos]], former [[The Breeders|Breeders]] drummer [[Jim Macpherson]], and eventually, former [[The Amps|Amps]]/Breeders guitarist [[The Amps|Nate Farley]]. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer [[Ric Ocasek]] to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices' [[major label]] debut.  Initially produced for [[Capitol Records]], ''[[Do the Collapse]]'' was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label [[TVT Records|TVT]].  (In the UK it was released on [[Creation Records]]). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, ''Do the Collapse'' failed to garner radio airplay, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews.\n\nThrough touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices' live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of [[The Who]], [[David Bowie]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption.  In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band's first and only visits to Australia and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the massive ''[[Suitcase: Failed Experiments and Trashed Aircraft|Suitcase]]'', a four-disc, 100-song trawl through three decades worth of Pollard's enormous reserve of unreleased material. (Three more box sets of unreleased songs, ''[[Suitcase 2: American Superdream Wow|Suitcase 2]]'', ''[[Suitcase 3: Up We Go Now|Suitcase 3]]'' and  ''[[Suitcase 4: Captain Kangaroo Won The War|Suitcase 4]]'' released in October 2005, November 2009 and November 2015 respectively.)\n\n2001's ''[[Isolation Drills]]'' was recorded with [[Rob Schnapf]],<ref name=BOMB-IsolationDrills-2001>{{cite journal|last1=McGonigal|first1=Mike|title=Robert Pollard|journal=[[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB]]|date=Summer 2001|issue=76|page=32\u201337|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/robert-pollard/|publisher=New Art Publications}}</ref> who aimed to capture the band's live sound more closely than did Ocasek. Though the album debuted in ''Billboard'''s top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough.\n\n===Later years (2002\u20132004)===\n[[File:Robert pollard 0001.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Robert Pollard]] performing with Guided By Voices in 2014|255x255px]]\nAfter departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released ''[[Universal Truths and Cycles]]'', a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band's mid-90's, mid-fi aesthetic. ''Universal Truths'' producer [[Todd Tobias]] would also record the band's final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled ''[[Earthquake Glue]]'', followed by the anthology box set ''[[Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere]]'' and the [[greatest hits]] compilation ''[[Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates]]''.\n\nIn 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |title=Special Announcement From Guided By Voices |publisher=Gbv.com |accessdate=2012-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315062433/http://gbv.com/2004gbvannouncement.htm |archivedate=2012-03-15 }}</ref> following the release of the ''[[Half-Smiles of the Decomposed]]'' LP, and a final farewell tour. Pollard stated:\n\n:\"This feels like the last album for Guided by Voices. I've always said that when I make a record that I'm totally satisfied with as befitting a final album, then that will be it. And this is it.\"\n\nGuided by Voices would go on to release no less than 15 more studio albums (since ''[[Surrender Your Poppy Field]]''')'''''.\n\nOn November 9, 2004, Guided by Voices performed on the stage of [[Austin City Limits]], broadcast by [[PBS]] on January 22, 2005. Their last television appearance was on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on December 2, 2004. They played the single, \"Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm Not Looking)\".  After a select round of final US shows, Guided by Voices played their final show at The Metro in Chicago on December 31, 2004.  The four-hour, 63-song marathon finale is documented on the DVD ''The Electrifying Conclusion''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gbvdb.com/album.asp?albumid=2184 |title=The Electrifying Conclusion |publisher=Gbvdb.com |date=1994-01-15 |accessdate=2012-11-17}}</ref>\n\n===Post-GBV (2005\u20132009)===\nPollard released his first post-GBV album in 2006 on [[Merge Records]].  The album, titled ''[[From a Compound Eye]]'' was a double LP produced by [[Todd Tobias]]. Later Pollard albums have been released on Merge and Pollard's own label, Guided by Voices Inc.\n\nFollowing GBV's demise, Pollard was frequently asked about band reunions. In 2007 he told [[Magnet (magazine)|''MAGNET'']]: \"To me, it\u2019s just cashing in. If you\u2019re gonna get the band back together, it should be to support a new record, not just to play the hits. That\u2019s like doing the county-fair circuit. I don\u2019t see Guided By Voices reforming.

It had annexed [[Ladakh]] into the state of [[Jammu]] in 1834. In 1841, they invaded [[Tibet under Qing rule|Tibet]] and overran parts of western Tibet. Chinese forces defeated the Sikh army in December 1841, forcing the Sikh army to withdraw, and in turn entered Ladakh and besieged [[Leh]], where they were in turn defeated by the Sikh Army. At this point, neither side wished to continue the conflict. The Sikhs claimed victory. as the Sikhs were embroiled in tensions with the British that would lead up to the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]], while the Chinese were in the midst of the [[First Opium War]]. The two parties signed a treaty in September 1842, which stipulated no transgressions or interference in the other country's frontiers.<ref name=\"Rubin\">The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P. Rubin, The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 9, No. 1. (January 1960), pp. 96-125.</ref>\n\n===British India===\nThe [[British East India Company]] used opium grown in India as export to China. The British used their Indian [[sepoy]]s and the [[British Indian Army]] in the [[Opium Wars]] and [[Boxer Rebellion]] against China. They also used Indian soldiers to guard the Foreign concessions in areas like Shanghai. The Chinese slur \"Yindu A San\" (Indian number three) was used to describe Indian soldiers in British service.\n\n==After independence==\nOn 1 October 1949 the People's Liberation Army defeated the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party). On 15 August 1947, India became federal, democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950.\n\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] based his vision of \"resurgent Asia\" on friendship between the two largest states of Asia; his vision of an internationalist foreign policy governed by the ethics of the Panchsheel ([[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]]), which he initially believed was shared by China. Nehru was disappointed when it became clear that the two countries had a conflict of interest in Tibet, which had traditionally served as a [[buffer zone]], and where India believed it had inherited special privileges from the [[British Raj]].\n\n===1950s===\n[[File:Prime Minister Nehru and Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong in Beijing.jpg|thumb|244px|Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] of China and Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] of India, during the former's state visit to China, October 1954.]]\nIndia [[Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China|established diplomatic relations with the PRC]] on 1 April 1950, the first non-communist nation in Asia to do so.\n\n[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] viewed [[Tibet]] as an integral part of the People's Republic of China. The preceding government of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] also [[Tibet Area (administrative division)|claimed Tibet as Chinese territory]], however was unable to re-assert control. Chairman Mao saw Indian concern over Tibet as a manifestation of interference in the internal affairs of the PRC. The PRC reasserted control over [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] and to end [[Lamaism]] (Tibetan Buddhism) and [[feudalism]], which it did by force of arms in 1950. To avoid antagonizing the PRC, Nehru informed Chinese leaders that India had no political ambitions or territorial ambitions and did not seek special privileges in Tibet but that traditional trading rights must continue. With Indian support, Tibetan delegates signed an agreement in May 1951 recognizing PRC sovereignty but guaranteeing that the existing political and social system of Tibet would continue.\n[[File:1952-06 1952\u5e745\u670816\u65e5\u4e2d\u5370\u53cb\u597d\u534f\u4f1a\u6210\u7acb.png|thumb|250px|right|Founding of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association on 16 May 1952 in Beijing.]]\n\nIn April 1954, India and the PRC signed an eight-year agreement on Tibet that became the [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]] (or ''Panchsheel''). Although critics called the Panchsheel naive, Nehru calculated that India's best guarantee of security was to establish a psychological buffer zone in place of the lost physical buffer of Tibet.{{Citation needed|reason=source needed to support this claim of Nehru's reason for action|date=November 2018}}\n\nIt is the popular perception that the catchphrase of India's diplomacy with China in the 1950s was ''Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai'', which means, in [[Hindi]], \"Indians and Chinese are brothers\". While [[VK Krishna Menon]] was the Defence Minister in 1958, Nehru had privately told G. Parthasarathi the Indian envoy to China to send all communications directly to him, bypassing Menon, because of his communist background and sympathy towards China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/dont-believe-in-hindichini-bhaibhai-nehr/570332/ |title=Don't believe in Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai, Nehru told envoy |newspaper=Indian Express |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305124336/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/dont-believe-in-hindichini-bhaibhai-nehr/570332/ |archivedate=5 March 2011  }}</ref>\n\nNehru sought to initiate a more direct dialogue between the peoples of China and India in culture and literature. Around then, the famous Indian artist (painter) [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], who had earlier decorated the pages of the original [[Constitution of India]], was sent to China in 1957 on a Government of India fellowship to establish a direct cross-cultural and inter-civilization bridge. Noted Indian scholar [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] and diplomat [[Natwar Singh]] were also there, and [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]] paid a visit to PRC. Between 1957 and 1959, [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]] not only disseminated Indian art in PRC but also became skilled in Chinese painting and lacquer-work. He also spent time with great masters [[Qi Baishi]], [[Li Keran]], [[Li Kuchan]] as well as some moments with Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Consequently, up until 1959, despite border skirmishes, Chinese leaders amicably had assured India that there was no territorial controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1101845|title='China, India and the fruits of Nehru's folly'|date=6 June 2007|work=dna|accessdate=16 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319030809/http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1101845|archivedate=19 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, India published new maps that included the [[Aksai Chin]] region within the boundaries of India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2120/stories/20041008000307600.htm|title=Nehru's legacy to India|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2017}}</ref> When India discovered that China built a road through the region, border clashes and Indian protests became more frequent. In January 1959, PRC premier [[Zhou Enlai]] wrote to Nehru, pointing out that no government in China had accepted as legal the [[McMahon Line]], which the 1914 [[Simla Convention]] defined the eastern section of the border between India and Tibet.\n\nIn March 1959, the [[Dalai Lama]], spiritual and temporal head of the [[History of Tibet (1950\u2013present)|Tibet]], sought sanctuary in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharmsala]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] where he established the [[Tibetan government-in-exile|Tibetan Government-in-Exile]]. Thousands of Tibetan refugees settled in northwestern India. The PRC accused India of [[expansionism]] and [[imperialism]] in Tibet and throughout the Himalayan region. China claimed 104,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of territory over which India's maps showed clear sovereignty, and demanded \"rectification\" of the entire border.\n\n===1960s===\n{{Main|Sino-Indian War}}\n[[File:India disputed areas map.svg|thumb|Map showing [[List of disputed territories of India|disputed territories of India]]]]\nBorder disputes resulted in a short border war between the People's Republic of China and India on 20 October 1962.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |last = Maxwell |first = Neville  |year = 2015 |title = India's China War (2nd Ed) |publisher = Natraj Publishers in Association with Wildlife Protection Society of India| location = New Delhi |isbn = 978-8181582508 |ref = none}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2017}} The border clash resulted in a defeat of India as the PRC pushed the Indian forces to within 48 km of the [[Assam]] plains in the northeast. It also occupied strategic points in the [[Aksai Chin]] and Demchok regions of [[Ladakh]], before declaring a unilateral [[ceasefire]] on 21 November. It claimed that it withdrew to 20 km behind its contended line of control. India disagreed with the claim.\n\nDuring the Sino-Indian border conflict, the India's [[Communist Party of India|Communist Party]] was accused by the Indian government of being pro-PRC, and many of its political leaders were jailed. Subsequently, the Communist Party of India (CPI) split with the leftist section{{Clarify|reason=It is not clear what is meant by the \"leftist section\"|date=April 2018}} forming the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] in 1964. CPI(M) held some contacts with the [[Communist Party of China]] for some time after the split but did not fully embrace the political line of Mao Zedong.\n\nRelations between the PRC and India deteriorated during the rest of the 1960s and the early 1970s while the [[China\u2013Pakistan relations]] improved and [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet relations worsened]]. The PRC backed Pakistan in its [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with India]]. Between 1967 and 1971, an all-weather road was built across territory claimed by India, linking PRC's [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] with Pakistan; India could do no more than protest.\n\nThe PRC continued an active propaganda campaign against India and supplied ideological, financial and other assistance to dissident groups, especially to [[Tribes of India|tribe]]s in northeastern India. The PRC accused India of assisting the [[Kham]]pa rebels in Tibet.\n\nSri Lanka played the role of chief negotiator for the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the Indian territory.

On 11 September, Chinese troops opened fire on a detachment of Indian soldiers tasked with protecting an engineering company that was fencing the North Shoulder of Nathu La.

However, Indian foreign minister N.D. Tiwari and Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] travelled to Beijing to negotiate a mutual de-escalation.<ref name=\"Sundarji\"/>\n\nIndia and the PRC held eight rounds of border negotiations between December 1981 and November 1987. In 1985 the PRC insisted on mutual concessions without defining the exact terms of its \"package proposal\" or where the actual line of control lay. In 1986 and 1987, the negotiations achieved nothing, given the charges exchanged between the two countries of military encroachment in the [[Sumdorung Chu Valley]]. China's construction of a military post and helicopter pad in the area in 1986 and India's grant of statehood to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (formerly the [[North-East Frontier Agency]]) in February 1987 caused both sides to deploy troops to the area. The PRC relayed warnings that it would \"teach India a lesson\" if it did not cease \"nibbling\" at Chinese territory. By the summer of 1987, however, both sides had backed away from conflict and denied military clashes had taken place.\n\nA warming trend in relations was facilitated by [[Rajiv Gandhi]]'s visit to China in December 1988. The two sides issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 that stressed the need to restore friendly relations on the basis of the Panchsheel. India and the People's Republic of China agreed to achieve a \"fair and reasonable settlement while seeking a mutually acceptable solution\" to the border dispute. The communiqu\u00e9 also expressed China's concern about agitation by [[Tibetan separatism|Tibetan separatists]] in India and reiterated that anti-China political activities by expatriate Tibetans would not be tolerated. Rajiv Gandhi signed bilateral agreements on science and technology co-operation, establish direct air links, and on cultural exchanges. The two sides also agreed to hold annual diplomatic consultations between foreign ministers, set up a joint committee on economic and scientific co-operation, and a joint working group on the boundary issue. The latter group was to be led by the Indian foreign secretary and the Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs.\n\n===1990s===\nTop-level dialogue continued with the December 1991 visit of [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|PRC premier]] [[Li Peng]] to India and the May 1992 visit to China of [[president of India|Indian president]] [[R. Venkataraman]]. Six rounds of talks of the Indian-Chinese Joint Working Group on the Border Issue were held between December 1988 and June 1993. Progress was also made in reducing tensions on the border via mutual troop reductions, regular meetings of local military commanders, and advance notification about military exercises. In July 1992, [[Sharad Pawar]] visited [[Beijing]], the first Indian Minister of Defence to do so. Consulates reopened in [[Bombay]] (Mumbai) and [[Shanghai]] in December 1992.\n\nIn 1993, The sixth-round of the joint working group talks was held in [[New Delhi]] but resulted in only minor developments. Prime Minister [[Narasimha Rao]] and Premier Li Peng signed a border agreement dealing with cross-border trade, cooperation on environmental issues (e.g. [[Pollution]], [[Endangered Species|Animal extinction]], [[Global Warming]], etc.) and radio and television broadcasting. A senior-level Chinese military delegation made a goodwill visit to India in December 1993 aimed at \"fostering confidence-building measures between the defence forces of the two countries.\" The visit, however, came at a time when China was providing greater military support to Burma. The presence of Chinese radar technicians in Burma's [[Coco Islands]], which border India's [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] caused concern in India.\n\nIn January 1994, Beijing announced that it not only favored a negotiated solution on Kashmir, but also opposed any form of independence for the region. Talks were held in New Delhi in February aimed at confirming established \"confidence-building measures\", discussing clarification of the \"line of actual control\", reduction of armed forces along the line, and prior information about forthcoming military exercises. China's hope for settlement of the boundary issue was reiterated.\n\nIn 1995, talks by the India-China Expert Group led to an agreement to set up two additional points of contact along the 4,000&nbsp;km border to facilitate meetings between military personnel. The two sides were reportedly \"seriously engaged\" in defining the McMahon Line and the line of actual control vis-\u00e0-vis military exercises and prevention of air intrusion. Talks were held in Beijing in July and in New Delhi in August to improve border security, combat cross-border crimes and on additional troop withdrawals from the border. These talks further reduced tensions.<ref>\nLin Liangguang Ye Zhengjia and Han Hua, Contemporary China\u2019s Relations with South Asia Countries, Beijing: Social Sciences Documentation Publishing House 2001.</ref>\n\nThere was little notice taken in Beijing of the April 1995 announcement of the opening of the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre]] in New Delhi. The Centre serves as the representative office of the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and is the counterpart of the [[India-Taipei Association]] located in Taiwan. Both institutions share the goal of improving India-ROC relations, which have been strained since New Delhi's recognition of Beijing in 1950.\n\nSino-Indian relations hit a low point in 1998 following India's [[nuclear test]]s. Indian Defence Minister [[George Fernandes]] declared that \"\u201cin my perception of national security, China is enemy No 1.\u2026and any person who is concerned about India\u2019s security must agree with that fact\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2104017/why-china-so-keen-alienate-half-billion-young-indians-no|title=Why is China alienating half a billion young Indians?|website=scmp.com|accessdate=27 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725145210/http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2104017/why-china-so-keen-alienate-half-billion-young-indians-no|archivedate=25 July 2017|date=25 July 2017}}</ref> hinting that India developed nuclear weapons in defence against China's nuclear arsenal. In 1998, China was one of the strongest international critics of India's nuclear tests and entry into the nuclear club.

Chinese officials were in a quandary on this issue as any protest to India on the issue would mean an explicit endorsement on India's governance of Sikkim, which the Chinese still hadn't recognised. In 2003, China officially recognised Indian sovereignty over Sikkim as the two countries moved towards resolving their border disputes.\n\nIn 2004, the two countries proposed opening up the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass]]es in Sikkim. 2004 was a milestone in Sino-Indian bilateral trade, surpassing the US$10 billion mark for the first time. In April 2005, Chinese Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] visited [[Bangalore]] to push for increased Sino-Indian cooperation in high-tech industries. Wen stated that the 21st century will be \"the Asian century of the IT industry.\"Regarding the issue of India gaining a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]], Wen Jiabao initially seemed to support the idea, but had returned to a neutral position.\n\nIn the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) Summit in 2005, China was granted an observer status. While other countries in the region are ready to consider China for permanent membership in the SAARC, India seemed reluctant.\n\nIssues surrounding energy has risen in significance. Both countries have growing energy demand to support economic growth. Both countries signed an agreement in 2006 to envisage [[ONGC]] Videsh Ltd (OVL) and the [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC) to placing joint bids for promising projects.\n\nIn 2006, China and India re-opened [[Nathula]] pass for trading. Nathula was closed 44 years prior to 2006.

It had annexed [[Ladakh]] into the state of [[Jammu]] in 1834. In 1841, they invaded [[Tibet under Qing rule|Tibet]] and overran parts of western Tibet. Chinese forces defeated the Sikh army in December 1841, forcing the Sikh army to withdraw, and in turn entered Ladakh and besieged [[Leh]], where they were in turn defeated by the Sikh Army. At this point, neither side wished to continue the conflict. The Sikhs claimed victory. as the Sikhs were embroiled in tensions with the British that would lead up to the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]], while the Chinese were in the midst of the [[First Opium War]]. The two parties signed a treaty in September 1842, which stipulated no transgressions or interference in the other country's frontiers.<ref name=\"Rubin\">The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P. Rubin, The International and Comparative Law Quarterly, Vol. 9, No. 1. (January 1960), pp. 96-125.</ref>\n\n===British India===\nThe [[British East India Company]] used opium grown in India as export to China. The British used their Indian [[sepoy]]s and the [[British Indian Army]] in the [[Opium Wars]] and [[Boxer Rebellion]] against China. They also used Indian soldiers to guard the Foreign concessions in areas like Shanghai. The Chinese slur \"Yindu A San\" (Indian number three) was used to describe Indian soldiers in British service.\n\n==After independence==\nOn 1 October 1949 the People's Liberation Army defeated the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party). On 15 August 1947, India became federal, democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950.\n\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] based his vision of \"resurgent Asia\" on friendship between the two largest states of Asia; his vision of an internationalist foreign policy governed by the ethics of the Panchsheel ([[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]]), which he initially believed was shared by China. Nehru was disappointed when it became clear that the two countries had a conflict of interest in Tibet, which had traditionally served as a [[buffer zone]], and where India believed it had inherited special privileges from the [[British Raj]].\n\n===1950s===\n[[File:Prime Minister Nehru and Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong in Beijing.jpg|thumb|244px|Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] of China and Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] of India, during the former's state visit to China, October 1954.]]\nIndia [[Dates of establishment of diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China|established diplomatic relations with the PRC]] on 1 April 1950, the first non-communist nation in Asia to do so.\n\n[[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] viewed [[Tibet]] as an integral part of the People's Republic of China. The preceding government of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] also [[Tibet Area (administrative division)|claimed Tibet as Chinese territory]], however was unable to re-assert control. Chairman Mao saw Indian concern over Tibet as a manifestation of interference in the internal affairs of the PRC. The PRC reasserted control over [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] and to end [[Lamaism]] (Tibetan Buddhism) and [[feudalism]], which it did by force of arms in 1950. To avoid antagonizing the PRC, Nehru informed Chinese leaders that India had no political ambitions or territorial ambitions and did not seek special privileges in Tibet but that traditional trading rights must continue. With Indian support, Tibetan delegates signed an agreement in May 1951 recognizing PRC sovereignty but guaranteeing that the existing political and social system of Tibet would continue.\n[[File:1952-06 1952\u5e745\u670816\u65e5\u4e2d\u5370\u53cb\u597d\u534f\u4f1a\u6210\u7acb.png|thumb|250px|right|Founding of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association on 16 May 1952 in Beijing.]]\n\nIn April 1954, India and the PRC signed an eight-year agreement on Tibet that became the [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]] (or ''Panchsheel''). Although critics called the Panchsheel naive, Nehru calculated that India's best guarantee of security was to establish a psychological buffer zone in place of the lost physical buffer of Tibet.{{Citation needed|reason=source needed to support this claim of Nehru's reason for action|date=November 2018}}\n\nIt is the popular perception that the catchphrase of India's diplomacy with China in the 1950s was ''Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai'', which means, in [[Hindi]], \"Indians and Chinese are brothers\". While [[VK Krishna Menon]] was the Defence Minister in 1958, Nehru had privately told G. Parthasarathi the Indian envoy to China to send all communications directly to him, bypassing Menon, because of his communist background and sympathy towards China.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/dont-believe-in-hindichini-bhaibhai-nehr/570332/ |title=Don't believe in Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai, Nehru told envoy |newspaper=Indian Express |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305124336/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/dont-believe-in-hindichini-bhaibhai-nehr/570332/ |archivedate=5 March 2011  }}</ref>\n\nNehru sought to initiate a more direct dialogue between the peoples of China and India in culture and literature. Around then, the famous Indian artist (painter) [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], who had earlier decorated the pages of the original [[Constitution of India]], was sent to China in 1957 on a Government of India fellowship to establish a direct cross-cultural and inter-civilization bridge. Noted Indian scholar [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] and diplomat [[Natwar Singh]] were also there, and [[Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan]] paid a visit to PRC. Between 1957 and 1959, [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]] not only disseminated Indian art in PRC but also became skilled in Chinese painting and lacquer-work. He also spent time with great masters [[Qi Baishi]], [[Li Keran]], [[Li Kuchan]] as well as some moments with Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. Consequently, up until 1959, despite border skirmishes, Chinese leaders amicably had assured India that there was no territorial controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1101845|title='China, India and the fruits of Nehru's folly'|date=6 June 2007|work=dna|accessdate=16 May 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319030809/http://www.dnaindia.com/report.asp?newsid=1101845|archivedate=19 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, India published new maps that included the [[Aksai Chin]] region within the boundaries of India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2120/stories/20041008000307600.htm|title=Nehru's legacy to India|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2017}}</ref> When India discovered that China built a road through the region, border clashes and Indian protests became more frequent. In January 1959, PRC premier [[Zhou Enlai]] wrote to Nehru, pointing out that no government in China had accepted as legal the [[McMahon Line]], which the 1914 [[Simla Convention]] defined the eastern section of the border between India and Tibet.\n\nIn March 1959, the [[Dalai Lama]], spiritual and temporal head of the [[History of Tibet (1950\u2013present)|Tibet]], sought sanctuary in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharmsala]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] where he established the [[Tibetan government-in-exile|Tibetan Government-in-Exile]]. Thousands of Tibetan refugees settled in northwestern India. The PRC accused India of [[expansionism]] and [[imperialism]] in Tibet and throughout the Himalayan region. China claimed 104,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of territory over which India's maps showed clear sovereignty, and demanded \"rectification\" of the entire border.\n\n===1960s===\n{{Main|Sino-Indian War}}\n[[File:India disputed areas map.svg|thumb|Map showing [[List of disputed territories of India|disputed territories of India]]]]\nBorder disputes resulted in a short border war between the People's Republic of China and India on 20 October 1962.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book |last = Maxwell |first = Neville  |year = 2015 |title = India's China War (2nd Ed) |publisher = Natraj Publishers in Association with Wildlife Protection Society of India| location = New Delhi |isbn = 978-8181582508 |ref = none}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2017}} The border clash resulted in a defeat of India as the PRC pushed the Indian forces to within 48 km of the [[Assam]] plains in the northeast. It also occupied strategic points in the [[Aksai Chin]] and Demchok regions of [[Ladakh]], before declaring a unilateral [[ceasefire]] on 21 November. It claimed that it withdrew to 20 km behind its contended line of control. India disagreed with the claim.\n\nDuring the Sino-Indian border conflict, the India's [[Communist Party of India|Communist Party]] was accused by the Indian government of being pro-PRC, and many of its political leaders were jailed. Subsequently, the Communist Party of India (CPI) split with the leftist section{{Clarify|reason=It is not clear what is meant by the \"leftist section\"|date=April 2018}} forming the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] in 1964. CPI(M) held some contacts with the [[Communist Party of China]] for some time after the split but did not fully embrace the political line of Mao Zedong.\n\nRelations between the PRC and India deteriorated during the rest of the 1960s and the early 1970s while the [[China\u2013Pakistan relations]] improved and [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet relations worsened]]. The PRC backed Pakistan in its [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965 war with India]]. Between 1967 and 1971, an all-weather road was built across territory claimed by India, linking PRC's [[Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] with Pakistan; India could do no more than protest.\n\nThe PRC continued an active propaganda campaign against India and supplied ideological, financial and other assistance to dissident groups, especially to [[Tribes of India|tribe]]s in northeastern India. The PRC accused India of assisting the [[Kham]]pa rebels in Tibet.\n\nSri Lanka played the role of chief negotiator for the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the Indian territory.

However, Indian foreign minister N.D. Tiwari and Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]] travelled to Beijing to negotiate a mutual de-escalation.<ref name=\"Sundarji\"/>\n\nIndia and the PRC held eight rounds of border negotiations between December 1981 and November 1987. In 1985 the PRC insisted on mutual concessions without defining the exact terms of its \"package proposal\" or where the actual line of control lay. In 1986 and 1987, the negotiations achieved nothing, given the charges exchanged between the two countries of military encroachment in the [[Sumdorung Chu Valley]]. China's construction of a military post and helicopter pad in the area in 1986 and India's grant of statehood to [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (formerly the [[North-East Frontier Agency]]) in February 1987 caused both sides to deploy troops to the area. The PRC relayed warnings that it would \"teach India a lesson\" if it did not cease \"nibbling\" at Chinese territory. By the summer of 1987, however, both sides had backed away from conflict and denied military clashes had taken place.\n\nA warming trend in relations was facilitated by [[Rajiv Gandhi]]'s visit to China in December 1988. The two sides issued a joint communiqu\u00e9 that stressed the need to restore friendly relations on the basis of the Panchsheel. India and the People's Republic of China agreed to achieve a \"fair and reasonable settlement while seeking a mutually acceptable solution\" to the border dispute. The communiqu\u00e9 also expressed China's concern about agitation by [[Tibetan separatism|Tibetan separatists]] in India and reiterated that anti-China political activities by expatriate Tibetans would not be tolerated. Rajiv Gandhi signed bilateral agreements on science and technology co-operation, establish direct air links, and on cultural exchanges. The two sides also agreed to hold annual diplomatic consultations between foreign ministers, set up a joint committee on economic and scientific co-operation, and a joint working group on the boundary issue. The latter group was to be led by the Indian foreign secretary and the Chinese vice minister of foreign affairs.\n\n===1990s===\nTop-level dialogue continued with the December 1991 visit of [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|PRC premier]] [[Li Peng]] to India and the May 1992 visit to China of [[president of India|Indian president]] [[R. Venkataraman]]. Six rounds of talks of the Indian-Chinese Joint Working Group on the Border Issue were held between December 1988 and June 1993. Progress was also made in reducing tensions on the border via mutual troop reductions, regular meetings of local military commanders, and advance notification about military exercises. In July 1992, [[Sharad Pawar]] visited [[Beijing]], the first Indian Minister of Defence to do so. Consulates reopened in [[Bombay]] (Mumbai) and [[Shanghai]] in December 1992.\n\nIn 1993, The sixth-round of the joint working group talks was held in [[New Delhi]] but resulted in only minor developments. Prime Minister [[Narasimha Rao]] and Premier Li Peng signed a border agreement dealing with cross-border trade, cooperation on environmental issues (e.g. [[Pollution]], [[Endangered Species|Animal extinction]], [[Global Warming]], etc.) and radio and television broadcasting. A senior-level Chinese military delegation made a goodwill visit to India in December 1993 aimed at \"fostering confidence-building measures between the defence forces of the two countries.\" The visit, however, came at a time when China was providing greater military support to Burma. The presence of Chinese radar technicians in Burma's [[Coco Islands]], which border India's [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] caused concern in India.\n\nIn January 1994, Beijing announced that it not only favored a negotiated solution on Kashmir, but also opposed any form of independence for the region. Talks were held in New Delhi in February aimed at confirming established \"confidence-building measures\", discussing clarification of the \"line of actual control\", reduction of armed forces along the line, and prior information about forthcoming military exercises. China's hope for settlement of the boundary issue was reiterated.\n\nIn 1995, talks by the India-China Expert Group led to an agreement to set up two additional points of contact along the 4,000&nbsp;km border to facilitate meetings between military personnel. The two sides were reportedly \"seriously engaged\" in defining the McMahon Line and the line of actual control vis-\u00e0-vis military exercises and prevention of air intrusion. Talks were held in Beijing in July and in New Delhi in August to improve border security, combat cross-border crimes and on additional troop withdrawals from the border. These talks further reduced tensions.<ref>\nLin Liangguang Ye Zhengjia and Han Hua, Contemporary China\u2019s Relations with South Asia Countries, Beijing: Social Sciences Documentation Publishing House 2001.</ref>\n\nThere was little notice taken in Beijing of the April 1995 announcement of the opening of the [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Centre]] in New Delhi. The Centre serves as the representative office of the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and is the counterpart of the [[India-Taipei Association]] located in Taiwan. Both institutions share the goal of improving India-ROC relations, which have been strained since New Delhi's recognition of Beijing in 1950.\n\nSino-Indian relations hit a low point in 1998 following India's [[nuclear test]]s. Indian Defence Minister [[George Fernandes]] declared that \"\u201cin my perception of national security, China is enemy No 1.\u2026and any person who is concerned about India\u2019s security must agree with that fact\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2104017/why-china-so-keen-alienate-half-billion-young-indians-no|title=Why is China alienating half a billion young Indians?|website=scmp.com|accessdate=27 July 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725145210/http://www.scmp.com/week-asia/geopolitics/article/2104017/why-china-so-keen-alienate-half-billion-young-indians-no|archivedate=25 July 2017|date=25 July 2017}}</ref> hinting that India developed nuclear weapons in defence against China's nuclear arsenal. In 1998, China was one of the strongest international critics of India's nuclear tests and entry into the nuclear club. During the 1999 [[Kargil War]] China voiced support for Pakistan, but also counseled Pakistan to withdraw its forces.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:Officers at Nathu La.JPG|thumb|Indian and Chinese officers at [[Nathu La]]. Nathu La was re-opened in 2006 following numerous bilateral trade agreements. The opening of the pass is expected to bolster the economy of the region and play a key role in the growing Sino-Indian trade.]]\nIn a major embarrassment for China, the 17th [[Karmapa]], [[Urgyen Trinley Dorje]], who was proclaimed by China, made a dramatic escape from Tibet to the [[Rumtek Monastery]] in Sikkim. Chinese officials were in a quandary on this issue as any protest to India on the issue would mean an explicit endorsement on India's governance of Sikkim, which the Chinese still hadn't recognised. In 2003, China officially recognised Indian sovereignty over Sikkim as the two countries moved towards resolving their border disputes.\n\nIn 2004, the two countries proposed opening up the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass]]es in Sikkim. 2004 was a milestone in Sino-Indian bilateral trade, surpassing the US$10 billion mark for the first time. In April 2005, Chinese Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] visited [[Bangalore]] to push for increased Sino-Indian cooperation in high-tech industries. Wen stated that the 21st century will be \"the Asian century of the IT industry.\"Regarding the issue of India gaining a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]], Wen Jiabao initially seemed to support the idea, but had returned to a neutral position.\n\nIn the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) Summit in 2005, China was granted an observer status. While other countries in the region are ready to consider China for permanent membership in the SAARC, India seemed reluctant.\n\nIssues surrounding energy has risen in significance. Both countries have growing energy demand to support economic growth. Both countries signed an agreement in 2006 to envisage [[ONGC]] Videsh Ltd (OVL) and the [[China National Petroleum Corporation]] (CNPC) to placing joint bids for promising projects.\n\nIn 2006, China and India re-opened [[Nathula]] pass for trading. Nathula was closed 44 years prior to 2006.
