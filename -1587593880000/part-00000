The Hospitals in Broward: Past/Present/Future. Profit Magazine. pp. 22\u201324.</ref> Soon, the land boom busted, followed by the [[1926 Miami Hurricane|September 1926]] hurricane, one of the worst in county history. Due to lack of patients able to pay for care, the hospital was forced to close in 1929. It was reopened by Juanita Clay in 1932 and remained successful until it was purchased in 1937 by Medical Services, Inc., an insurance company owned by Dr. F.A. Brunson and M.L. Menger.<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/> Medical Services issued hospital and family insurance policies that required the use of their own hospital and doctors. The Broward County medical community rebelled, refusing to use the Medical Services hospital.\n\nIn May 1937, the Broward County Medical Association (BCMA) met to discuss plans to build a public hospital, feeling that private hospitals could not be relied upon for continuity of service and only a community-owned hospital would offer security.<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/> The consensus of the meeting was to build a hospital supported by the city, county, or a hospital district. The result of the meeting was a unanimous motion to form the Broward Hospital Association (BHA). From that point on, the BHA began its mission to raise the funds needed to build a hospital. The Chairman, James D. Camp, as well as the other members, explored every possibility of finding funds; however, government-assisted funding simply wasn\u2019t available. During this time, the county was experiencing such rapid growth, the need for facilities became critical.<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/>\n\n=== Broward General opens ===\nAfter a long search, it was agreed that the Granada apartments<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/><ref name=\"Moss1968\">Moss, D. (1968, September). Broward General Hospital...Growing Medical Center. Fort Lauderdale Magazine. pp. 26-39.</ref> could be remodeled into a hospital that would accommodate 45 patients, with room for acceptable operating rooms, delivery rooms, laboratories, and x-ray space.\n\nMembers of the community also joined in. Many donated their work at cost, contributing their fees to the \"hospital fund.\" A \"drive\" was also implemented and equipment donated. The 45-bed hospital opened its doors as the new Broward General Hospital (now Broward General Medical Center) and admitted its first patient on January 2, 1938.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/>\n\nBetween 1935 and 1940, the population of Broward County grew from 20,000 to approximately 30,000.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/> To keep up with the growth, the addition of a new wing was crucial, but without funding the expansion was difficult. Camp approached the city commission in 1940 about the need for expansion and received a favorable response for a new wing. In 1942, a South Wing was added; in 1948, the East Wing was built, raising the bed total at Broward General to 142.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/>\n\nIn 1949, the Hospital Board returned to the City Commission to ask for funds for another wing. This time the City Commission denied the request. As a result, Camp and all members of the Board resigned.<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/>\n\n=== The birth of the district ===\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:BrowardGeneral_1945.jpg|frame|left|Broward General Hospital, 1945]] -->In August 1950, the Broward General Hospital Board succeeded in obtaining approval of an expansion program. A legislative act for a North Broward Hospital District was approved in 1952 by referendum and a District Board was appointed by the governor with William J. Kelly as chairman.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/>\n\nSoon thereafter plans for a building on the west side were underway. The West Wing plans included two floors for patients, a new surgical unit, new kitchen and dining space to be connected to the North Wing of the hospital by a hallway. In 1955, a new lab was opened and on September 3, 1957, the City of Fort Lauderdale gave a deed of conveyance to the North Broward Hospital District. Its area of responsibility stretched the width of the county, from the Dania Canal north to the Palm Beach County line.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/>\n\nIn 1961, an additional specialty wing brought the bed total to 468, plus 50 bassinets. The North Tower and ten-story elevator building opened in 1967; the South Tower in 1970.\n\n== The District Expands ==\n\n=== Broward Health North ===\nBy 1960, the population in Broward County grew to 350,000.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/> Responding to the growth of the county, the District built a three-story hospital on Sample Road in [[Pompano Beach, Florida]].<ref name=\"NBH1979\">(1979, August 8).

The Hospitals in Broward: Past/Present/Future. Profit Magazine. pp. 22\u201324.</ref> Soon, the land boom busted, followed by the [[1926 Miami Hurricane|September 1926]] hurricane, one of the worst in county history. Due to lack of patients able to pay for care, the hospital was forced to close in 1929. It was reopened by Juanita Clay in 1932 and remained successful until it was purchased in 1937 by Medical Services, Inc., an insurance company owned by Dr. F.A. Brunson and M.L. Menger.<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/> Medical Services issued hospital and family insurance policies that required the use of their own hospital and doctors. The Broward County medical community rebelled, refusing to use the Medical Services hospital.\n\nIn May 1937, the Broward County Medical Association (BCMA) met to discuss plans to build a public hospital, feeling that private hospitals could not be relied upon for continuity of service and only a community-owned hospital would offer security.<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/> The consensus of the meeting was to build a hospital supported by the city, county, or a hospital district. The result of the meeting was a unanimous motion to form the Broward Hospital Association (BHA). From that point on, the BHA began its mission to raise the funds needed to build a hospital. The Chairman, James D. Camp, as well as the other members, explored every possibility of finding funds; however, government-assisted funding simply wasn\u2019t available. During this time, the county was experiencing such rapid growth, the need for facilities became critical.<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/>\n\n=== Broward General opens ===\nAfter a long search, it was agreed that the Granada apartments<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/><ref name=\"Moss1968\">Moss, D. (1968, September). Broward General Hospital...Growing Medical Center. Fort Lauderdale Magazine. pp. 26-39.</ref> could be remodeled into a hospital that would accommodate 45 patients, with room for acceptable operating rooms, delivery rooms, laboratories, and x-ray space.\n\nMembers of the community also joined in. Many donated their work at cost, contributing their fees to the \"hospital fund.\" A \"drive\" was also implemented and equipment donated. The 45-bed hospital opened its doors as the new Broward General Hospital (now Broward General Medical Center) and admitted its first patient on January 2, 1938.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/>\n\nBetween 1935 and 1940, the population of Broward County grew from 20,000 to approximately 30,000.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/> To keep up with the growth, the addition of a new wing was crucial, but without funding the expansion was difficult. Camp approached the city commission in 1940 about the need for expansion and received a favorable response for a new wing. In 1942, a South Wing was added; in 1948, the East Wing was built, raising the bed total at Broward General to 142.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/>\n\nIn 1949, the Hospital Board returned to the City Commission to ask for funds for another wing. This time the City Commission denied the request. As a result, Camp and all members of the Board resigned.<ref name=\"idHospitalsinBroward1988\"/>\n\n=== The birth of the district ===\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:BrowardGeneral_1945.jpg|frame|left|Broward General Hospital, 1945]] -->In August 1950, the Broward General Hospital Board succeeded in obtaining approval of an expansion program. A legislative act for a North Broward Hospital District was approved in 1952 by referendum and a District Board was appointed by the governor with William J. Kelly as chairman.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/>\n\nSoon thereafter plans for a building on the west side were underway. The West Wing plans included two floors for patients, a new surgical unit, new kitchen and dining space to be connected to the North Wing of the hospital by a hallway. In 1955, a new lab was opened and on September 3, 1957, the City of Fort Lauderdale gave a deed of conveyance to the North Broward Hospital District. Its area of responsibility stretched the width of the county, from the Dania Canal north to the Palm Beach County line.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/>\n\nIn 1961, an additional specialty wing brought the bed total to 468, plus 50 bassinets. The North Tower and ten-story elevator building opened in 1967; the South Tower in 1970.\n\n== The District Expands ==\n\n=== Broward Health North ===\nBy 1960, the population in Broward County grew to 350,000.<ref name=\"Moss1968\"/> Responding to the growth of the county, the District built a three-story hospital on Sample Road in [[Pompano Beach, Florida]].<ref name=\"NBH1979\">(1979, August 8).

It is administered by [[North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services]] Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services.\n\n==History==\nIn 1850, influential mental health activist [[Dorothea Dix]] petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to support and build a psychiatric hospital to treat the insane.  Within 25 years the General Assembly determined that one hospital was insufficient to care for the population of people afflicted with mental illness. In 1875, the State provided $75,000 for the establishment of a second psychiatric hospital. Built in Morganton on {{convert|283|acre}} of land, Western Carolina Insane Asylum, opened on March 29, 1883. The asylum admitted physician Dr. Red Pepper as its first patient.  By 1884 its first director, [[Patrick Livingston Murphy|Dr. Patrick Livingston Murphy]], reported to the General Assembly that more space was needed. In 1885 and 1886 two new wings were opened, expanding the hospital's bed space to over 500 patients.\n\nIn 1890 the hospital's name was changed to State Hospital at Morganton, a name it kept until 1959.  Patients were used to construct roads on the property, and establish and maintain the gardens and grounds. By 1893 the hospital's holdings would encompass over {{convert|300|acre}}.  During the early 1900s the hospital expanded greatly.  Using the colony system, a farm area was established with a dairy, vineyard and greenhouses, all staffed by patients of varying degrees of functionality. The hospital was nearly self-sufficient.

It is administered by [[North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services]] Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities and Substance Abuse Services.\n\n==History==\nIn 1850, influential mental health activist [[Dorothea Dix]] petitioned the North Carolina General Assembly to support and build a psychiatric hospital to treat the insane.  Within 25 years the General Assembly determined that one hospital was insufficient to care for the population of people afflicted with mental illness. In 1875, the State provided $75,000 for the establishment of a second psychiatric hospital. Built in Morganton on {{convert|283|acre}} of land, Western Carolina Insane Asylum, opened on March 29, 1883. The asylum admitted physician Dr. Red Pepper as its first patient.  By 1884 its first director, [[Patrick Livingston Murphy|Dr. Patrick Livingston Murphy]], reported to the General Assembly that more space was needed. In 1885 and 1886 two new wings were opened, expanding the hospital's bed space to over 500 patients.\n\nIn 1890 the hospital's name was changed to State Hospital at Morganton, a name it kept until 1959.  Patients were used to construct roads on the property, and establish and maintain the gardens and grounds. By 1893 the hospital's holdings would encompass over {{convert|300|acre}}.  During the early 1900s the hospital expanded greatly.  Using the colony system, a farm area was established with a dairy, vineyard and greenhouses, all staffed by patients of varying degrees of functionality. The hospital was nearly self-sufficient. Additional expansions and land holdings would take place until just after [[World War I]] when public attitudes about mental health patients changed dramatically. The hospital, like many others of this time period, was neglected and suffered during the state and national financial problems of the [[Great Depression]].\n\nDuring the 1920s, the patient-to-physician ratio was 300-to-1; by the 1930s this was almost 500-to-1. Hours for attendants and nurses were intensive, and time off was sparse.  Attendants usually slept in the same wards with patients until further expansion during the 1940s. By that time, the hospital's census topped 3,500 patients. In 1959, State Hospital at Morganton became Broughton Hospital, named after World War II Governor [[J. Melville Broughton]].\n\nThe 1960s brought many changes to Broughton: educational programs were established, religious services were incorporated, and the hospital continued to expand (including through affiliated local community health centers).

{"title_page": "Paik system", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\nThe '''''Paik'' system''' was a type of [[corvee]] labour system on which the economy of the [[Ahom kingdom]] of medieval [[Assam]] depended. In this system, adult and able males were obligated to render service to the state and form its militia in return for a piece of land for cultivation owned by the kingdom\u2014believed to be a legacy the Ahoms brought with them from [[South-Eastern Asia]] in 1228.<ref>\"It follows, then, that paddy lands belonged to the community, i.e. to the king as representative of the community. This medieval Thai practice is a key to the understanding of the Ahom system of land rights in Assam.\" {{harvcol|Guha|1966|p=222}}</ref> The mature structure was designed by Momai Tamuli Borbarua in 1608, and extensively and exhaustively implemented by 1658 during the reign of [[Sutamla]] Jayadhwaj Singha.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The system continued to evolve over time to meet the needs of the Ahom state and in time began to accumulate contradictions.  By the end of the [[Moamoria rebellion]] (1769\u20131805) the Paik system had collapsed.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=51}}</ref>\n\n==''Paik'' system==\nEvery male in the Ahom kingdom between the ages of sixteen and fifty who was not a noble, a priest, a high caste or a slave was a ''paik''.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The paiks were organized into four-member groups called ''got''s.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> Each ''got'' had to send one member by rotation for public works. During the absence of a paik the other members of the ''got'' took care of his lands and family. In times of war, the paiks formed the militia. All lands under rice cultivation belonged to the state. Originally, the paiks were organized into ''phoid''s (clans), but by the 17th century the paiks were re-grouped into divisions called ''khel''s.  According to Guha (1991), about 90% of the population belonged to this class at the time of [[Rudra Singha]], around 1714.  The top [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]] was about 1% and the rest constituted the servile class.\n\n===Land holdings===\nThe duty of a ''paik'' was to render service to the Ahom state in exchange for which he was granted 2 ''puras'' (2.66 acres) of [[usufruct]] cultivable land (''gaa mati''), which was neither hereditary nor transferable.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=35}}</ref>  In addition he could maintain his tax-free ancestral homestead and garden (''basti'' and ''bari'' respectively).  The nobility maintained personal estates called ''khats''.\n\nCultivable land called ''roopeet'' was held communally that was distributed among the ''paiks'' (called ''gaa mati'').  Wastelands reclaimed by ''paiks'' or non-''paiks'' not covered by a royal grant are subject to inclusion in the ''roopeet'' category to be distributed as ''gaa mati'' in the next ''paik'' survey. Surplus cultivable land was distributed as ''ubar mati'' among the ''paiks''.\n\n===Royal service===\nThe royal services that the ''paiks'' tended to were defense (the Ahom kingdom did not have a standing army till the beginning of 19th century and its army consisted of the [[militia]] formed of ''paiks''), civil construction (embankments, roads, bridges, tanks, etc.), military production (boats, arrows, muskets), etc. There were two major classes of ''paiks'': ''kanri paik'' (archer) who rendered his service as a soldier or as a laborer and ''chamua paik'' who rendered non-manual service and had a higher social standing.  Some other minor classes were: ''bilatiyas'' (tenants at the estates of nobles), ''dewaliyas'' (attached to temples and [[sattra]]s) and ''bahatiyas'' (attached to hill masters).  ''Kanri paiks'' could move up to ''chamua''.  Most of the lower paik officers&mdash;Bora, Saikia, Hazarika, Tamuli, Pachani&mdash;belonged to the ''chamua'' class.<ref>{{harv|Baruah|1993|p=17}}</ref>   \n \nAfter the first major survey recorded in the [[Buranji]]s which was taken in 1510 under [[Suhungmung]], the ''paiks'' were organized according to families and lineage called ''phoids'' and resettled according to their skills. The number of ''paiks'' rendering royal service at any time followed the principle of ''ghar muri e-powa'' or one-fourth the number of ''paiks'' in a household.  The ''paik'' rendering service was rotated and the other ''paiks'' in his household tended to his ''gaa mati'' during his absence.\n\nIn the 1609 restructuring by Momai Tamuli Borbarua the ''phoid'' organization was replaced by the ''got''.  A ''got'' consisted of four ''paiks'' who lived close together.  The ''paiks'' in a ''got'' were numbered ''mul'' (first), ''duwal'' (second), ''tewal'' (third), etc.  In times of peace, generally one of the ''paiks'' in a ''got'' rendered royal service at any given time. In times of war, a second or even a third ''paik'' from a ''got'' could be asked to render service simultaneously. As before, the ''gaa mati'' was tended to by the remaining ''paiks'' of the ''got''. This ensured that economic production did not suffer when a large section of the population was not involved in it and contributed to the resilience of the Ahom kingdom in the 16th to 18th century.\n\nDuring the time of [[Rajeswar Singha]] (1752\u20131789), as the pressure on the ''paik'' system increased, the number of ''paiks'' in each ''got'' was decreased from four to three.\n\n===Organization of the ''paiks''===\nThe ''paiks'' in their ''phoids'' were organized under ''khels'' according to the locality in which they belonged.  Momai Tamuli Borbarua reorganized many such ''khels'' functionally according to the specific service the ''paiks'' in the khel rendered.  Some of the ''khels'' were thus similar to professional or trade guilds.  The organization of the ''khel'' was extended later by his son [[Lachit Borphukan]] into self contained ones by incorporating ''paiks'' of different professions into each ''khel''.\n\n''Khels'' were further organized under a ''mel'' or a ''dagi''.  A group of such divisions was attached to  each of the three great Gohains, which is then called the ''hatimur'' of the particular ''Gohain''.  A second group of divisions was placed under the ''khel'' officers (''Phukan'', ''Rajkhowa'' and ''Barua'') that rendered service to members of the royal family.  The third and the largest group of ''dagis'', organized under ''khel'' officers, rendered service to the king or the state.\n\n===''Paik'' officials===\nThe ''paiks'' in a ''khel'' were organized under a gradation of officials who commanded a set number of them.  They were ''Bora'' (20 ''paiks''), ''Saikia'' (100) and ''Hazarika'' (1000).  More important ''khels'' were commanded by a ''Phukan'' (6000), a ''Rajkhowa'' (a governor of a territory), or a ''Barua'' (a superintending officer) each of whom could command between 2000 and 3000 ''paiks''.\n\nThe ''Phukans'', ''Rajkhowas'', ''Baruas'' and ''Hazarikas'' were nominated by the king and appointed in concurrence with the three great ''Gohains'' ([[Burhagohain]], [[Borgohain]] and [[Borpatrogohain]]). The ''Boras'' and ''Saikias'' were appointed by their respective ''Phukans'' and ''Rajkhowas''. The ''paiks'' had the right to reject a ''Bora'' or a ''Saikia'' and request another officer of their choice.\n\n''Kanri paiks'' could rise to become ''chamua paiks'' and then to higher ''paik'' officials.  Appointments were made irrespective of the ''paik'''s religion or ethnicity.\n\n===Ahom justice===\nThe Ahom justice system was also based on the ''Paik'' system.  Each ''Paik'' official offered justice to the ''paiks'' and each appeal was heard by the next higher officer in the ''khel'' system.  The system of appeals could go right up to the ''Nyayxodha Phukan''.\n\n==Challenges to the ''Paik'' system==\nThe ''Paik'' system was a method by which the Ahom king obtained service from the people and also provided service back to the people.  By the 17th century it had evolved into a robust system that gave the [[Ahom kingdom]] a resilience in the face of a long protracted war against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].  But soon it met challenges.\n\nOver time, the nobles began to appropriate the services of ''kanri paik'', who as a ''likchou'' began to work for these high officials instead of the king.  After the end of [[Ahom-Mughal conflicts]], the [[Ahom kingdom]] extended the ''Paik'' system to the regions earlier held by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] but where the royal service  was now payable in cash, following the ''[[pargana]]'' system that was left behind.   The increased production of ''paiks'' and the growth of an internal market over time in the entire kingdom demanded a monetization of the economy, which the ''Paik'' system was unable to handle.  This gave rise to the ''apaikan chamua'' a class of ''paik''s who were released from their ''khels'' and who paid a cash tax in lieu of the service to the king.  The satras too attracted ''paiks'' who wanted to escape the compulsory service.  The satras, in addition, came into competition with the [[Ahom kingdom]] by expanding into new social groups that the [[Ahom kingdom]] would have expanded into otherwise and providing an alternative economic production process.  This conflict with the satras led to the [[Moamoria rebellion]] which further weakened the [[Ahom kingdom]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation| last=Baruah | given=S.

This medieval Thai practice is a key to the understanding of the Ahom system of land rights in Assam.\" {{harvcol|Guha|1966|p=222}}</ref> The mature structure was designed by Momai Tamuli Borbarua in 1608, and extensively and exhaustively implemented by 1658 during the reign of [[Sutamla]] Jayadhwaj Singha.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The system continued to evolve over time to meet the needs of the Ahom state and in time began to accumulate contradictions.  By the end of the [[Moamoria rebellion]] (1769\u20131805) the Paik system had collapsed.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=51}}</ref>\n\n==''Paik'' system==\nEvery male in the Ahom kingdom between the ages of sixteen and fifty who was not a noble, a priest, a high caste or a slave was a ''paik''.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> The paiks were organized into four-member groups called ''got''s.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=34}}</ref> Each ''got'' had to send one member by rotation for public works. During the absence of a paik the other members of the ''got'' took care of his lands and family. In times of war, the paiks formed the militia. All lands under rice cultivation belonged to the state. Originally, the paiks were organized into ''phoid''s (clans), but by the 17th century the paiks were re-grouped into divisions called ''khel''s.  According to Guha (1991), about 90% of the population belonged to this class at the time of [[Rudra Singha]], around 1714.  The top [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]] was about 1% and the rest constituted the servile class.\n\n===Land holdings===\nThe duty of a ''paik'' was to render service to the Ahom state in exchange for which he was granted 2 ''puras'' (2.66 acres) of [[usufruct]] cultivable land (''gaa mati''), which was neither hereditary nor transferable.<ref>{{harvcol|Sharma|1996|p=35}}</ref>  In addition he could maintain his tax-free ancestral homestead and garden (''basti'' and ''bari'' respectively).  The nobility maintained personal estates called ''khats''.\n\nCultivable land called ''roopeet'' was held communally that was distributed among the ''paiks'' (called ''gaa mati'').  Wastelands reclaimed by ''paiks'' or non-''paiks'' not covered by a royal grant are subject to inclusion in the ''roopeet'' category to be distributed as ''gaa mati'' in the next ''paik'' survey. Surplus cultivable land was distributed as ''ubar mati'' among the ''paiks''.\n\n===Royal service===\nThe royal services that the ''paiks'' tended to were defense (the Ahom kingdom did not have a standing army till the beginning of 19th century and its army consisted of the [[militia]] formed of ''paiks''), civil construction (embankments, roads, bridges, tanks, etc.), military production (boats, arrows, muskets), etc. There were two major classes of ''paiks'': ''kanri paik'' (archer) who rendered his service as a soldier or as a laborer and ''chamua paik'' who rendered non-manual service and had a higher social standing.  Some other minor classes were: ''bilatiyas'' (tenants at the estates of nobles), ''dewaliyas'' (attached to temples and [[sattra]]s) and ''bahatiyas'' (attached to hill masters).  ''Kanri paiks'' could move up to ''chamua''.  Most of the lower paik officers&mdash;Bora, Saikia, Hazarika, Tamuli, Pachani&mdash;belonged to the ''chamua'' class.<ref>{{harv|Baruah|1993|p=17}}</ref>   \n \nAfter the first major survey recorded in the [[Buranji]]s which was taken in 1510 under [[Suhungmung]], the ''paiks'' were organized according to families and lineage called ''phoids'' and resettled according to their skills. The number of ''paiks'' rendering royal service at any time followed the principle of ''ghar muri e-powa'' or one-fourth the number of ''paiks'' in a household.  The ''paik'' rendering service was rotated and the other ''paiks'' in his household tended to his ''gaa mati'' during his absence.\n\nIn the 1609 restructuring by Momai Tamuli Borbarua the ''phoid'' organization was replaced by the ''got''.  A ''got'' consisted of four ''paiks'' who lived close together.  The ''paiks'' in a ''got'' were numbered ''mul'' (first), ''duwal'' (second), ''tewal'' (third), etc.  In times of peace, generally one of the ''paiks'' in a ''got'' rendered royal service at any given time. In times of war, a second or even a third ''paik'' from a ''got'' could be asked to render service simultaneously. As before, the ''gaa mati'' was tended to by the remaining ''paiks'' of the ''got''. This ensured that economic production did not suffer when a large section of the population was not involved in it and contributed to the resilience of the Ahom kingdom in the 16th to 18th century.\n\nDuring the time of [[Rajeswar Singha]] (1752\u20131789), as the pressure on the ''paik'' system increased, the number of ''paiks'' in each ''got'' was decreased from four to three.\n\n===Organization of the ''paiks''===\nThe ''paiks'' in their ''phoids'' were organized under ''khels'' according to the locality in which they belonged.  Momai Tamuli Borbarua reorganized many such ''khels'' functionally according to the specific service the ''paiks'' in the khel rendered.  Some of the ''khels'' were thus similar to professional or trade guilds.  The organization of the ''khel'' was extended later by his son [[Lachit Borphukan]] into self contained ones by incorporating ''paiks'' of different professions into each ''khel''.\n\n''Khels'' were further organized under a ''mel'' or a ''dagi''.  A group of such divisions was attached to  each of the three great Gohains, which is then called the ''hatimur'' of the particular ''Gohain''.  A second group of divisions was placed under the ''khel'' officers (''Phukan'', ''Rajkhowa'' and ''Barua'') that rendered service to members of the royal family.  The third and the largest group of ''dagis'', organized under ''khel'' officers, rendered service to the king or the state.\n\n===''Paik'' officials===\nThe ''paiks'' in a ''khel'' were organized under a gradation of officials who commanded a set number of them.  They were ''Bora'' (20 ''paiks''), ''Saikia'' (100) and ''Hazarika'' (1000).  More important ''khels'' were commanded by a ''Phukan'' (6000), a ''Rajkhowa'' (a governor of a territory), or a ''Barua'' (a superintending officer) each of whom could command between 2000 and 3000 ''paiks''.\n\nThe ''Phukans'', ''Rajkhowas'', ''Baruas'' and ''Hazarikas'' were nominated by the king and appointed in concurrence with the three great ''Gohains'' ([[Burhagohain]], [[Borgohain]] and [[Borpatrogohain]]). The ''Boras'' and ''Saikias'' were appointed by their respective ''Phukans'' and ''Rajkhowas''. The ''paiks'' had the right to reject a ''Bora'' or a ''Saikia'' and request another officer of their choice.\n\n''Kanri paiks'' could rise to become ''chamua paiks'' and then to higher ''paik'' officials.  Appointments were made irrespective of the ''paik'''s religion or ethnicity.\n\n===Ahom justice===\nThe Ahom justice system was also based on the ''Paik'' system.  Each ''Paik'' official offered justice to the ''paiks'' and each appeal was heard by the next higher officer in the ''khel'' system.  The system of appeals could go right up to the ''Nyayxodha Phukan''.\n\n==Challenges to the ''Paik'' system==\nThe ''Paik'' system was a method by which the Ahom king obtained service from the people and also provided service back to the people.  By the 17th century it had evolved into a robust system that gave the [[Ahom kingdom]] a resilience in the face of a long protracted war against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].  But soon it met challenges.\n\nOver time, the nobles began to appropriate the services of ''kanri paik'', who as a ''likchou'' began to work for these high officials instead of the king.  After the end of [[Ahom-Mughal conflicts]], the [[Ahom kingdom]] extended the ''Paik'' system to the regions earlier held by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] but where the royal service  was now payable in cash, following the ''[[pargana]]'' system that was left behind.   The increased production of ''paiks'' and the growth of an internal market over time in the entire kingdom demanded a monetization of the economy, which the ''Paik'' system was unable to handle.  This gave rise to the ''apaikan chamua'' a class of ''paik''s who were released from their ''khels'' and who paid a cash tax in lieu of the service to the king.  The satras too attracted ''paiks'' who wanted to escape the compulsory service.  The satras, in addition, came into competition with the [[Ahom kingdom]] by expanding into new social groups that the [[Ahom kingdom]] would have expanded into otherwise and providing an alternative economic production process.  This conflict with the satras led to the [[Moamoria rebellion]] which further weakened the [[Ahom kingdom]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation| last=Baruah | given=S.
