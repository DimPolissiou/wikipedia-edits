Britain, which controlled the [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman provinces of Egypt and Sudan]], did not allow additional Ottoman troops to reach Libya through Egypt. Ottoman soldiers like Atat\u00fcrk went to Libya either dressed as Arabs (risking imprisonment if noticed by the British authorities in Egypt) or by the very few available ferries (the Italians, who had superior naval forces, effectively controlled the sea routes to Tripoli). However, despite all the hardships, Atat\u00fcrk's forces in Libya managed to repel the Italians on a number of occasions, such as the [[Battle of Tobruk (1911)|Battle of Tobruk]] on 22 December 1911. During the Battle of Derna on 16\u201317 January 1912, while Atat\u00fcrk was assaulting the Italian-controlled fortress of Kasr-\u0131 Harun, two Italian planes dropped bombs on the Ottoman forces; a [[limestone]] splinter from a damaged building's rubble struck Atat\u00fcrk's left eye, causing permanent tissue damage, but not total loss of sight. He received medical treatment for nearly a month; he attempted to leave the Red Crescent's health facilities after only two weeks, but when his eye's situation worsened, he had to return and resume treatment. On 6 March 1912 Atat\u00fcrk became the Commander of the Ottoman forces in Derna. He managed to defend and retain the city and its surrounding region until the end of the Italo-Turkish War on 18 October 1912.

This defining ideology of the Republic of Turkey is referred to as the \"Six Arrows\", or [[Kemalist ideology]]. Kemalist ideology is based on Atat\u00fcrk's conception of [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] and [[pragmatism]].<ref>Webster, ''The Turkey of Atat\u00fcrk: social process in the Turkish reformation'', 245</ref> The fundamentals of nationalism, populism, and [[Statism|etatism]] were all defined under the Six Arrows. These fundamentals were not new in world politics or, indeed, among the elite of Turkey. What made them unique was that these interrelated fundamentals were explicitly formulated for Turkey's needs. A good example is the definition and application of secularism; the Kemalist secular state significantly differed from predominantly Christian states.\n\n====Emergence of the state, 1923\u20131924====\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal and Mevlevi Order March 1923.png|thumb|left|Mustafa Kemal Pasha in 1923, with members of the [[Mevlevi Order]], before its institutional expression became illegal and their [[dervish]] lodge was changed into the [[Mevlana Museum]].

In forging the new republic, the Turkish revolutionaries turned their back on the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Constantinople and its Ottoman heritage.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 391\u2013392</ref> For instance, they made Angora,<!--Turkish names of cities began to be used in English after 1930--> [[Ankara]] in Turkish, the country's new capital and reformed the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Turkey|Turkish postal service]].

Atat\u00fcrk wanted a \"direct government by the Assembly\"<ref name=\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 362\">Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 362</ref> and visualized a [[representative democracy]], [[parliamentary sovereignty]], where the National Parliament would be the ultimate source of power.<ref name=\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 362\"/>\n\nIn the following years, he altered his stance somewhat; the country needed an immense amount of reconstruction, and that \"direct government by the Assembly\" could not survive in such an environment. The revolutionaries faced challenges from the supporters of the old Ottoman regime, and also from the supporters of newer ideologies such as communism and fascism. Atat\u00fcrk saw the consequences of fascist and communist doctrines in the 1920s and 1930s and rejected both.<ref>Landau, ''Atat\u00fcrk and the Modernization of Turkey'', 252</ref> He prevented the spread into Turkey of the [[totalitarian]] party rule which held sway in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 501</ref> Some perceived his opposition and silencing of these ideologies as a means of eliminating competition; others believed it was necessary to protect the young Turkish state from succumbing to the instability of new ideologies and competing factions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Under Atat\u00fcrk, the arrest process known as the Arrests of 1927 (''1927 Tevkifat\u0131'') was launched, and a widespread arrest policy was put in place against the [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Communist Party of Turkey]] members.

He wanted to institute compulsory primary education for both girls and boys; since then this effort has been an ongoing task for the republic. He pointed out that one of the main targets of [[education in Turkey]] had to be raising a generation nourished with what he called the \"public culture\". The state schools established a common curriculum which became known as the \"unification of education.\"\n\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Atat\u00fcrk with his [[bowler hat]]]]\n\nUnification of education was put into force on 3 March 1924 by the Law on Unification of Education (No. 430). With the new law, education became inclusive, organized on a model of the civil community. In this new design, all schools submitted their curriculum to the \"[[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]]\", a government agency modelled after other countries' ministries of education. Concurrently, the republic abolished the two ministries and made clergy subordinate to the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|department of religious affairs]], one of the foundations of [[secularism in Turkey]]. The unification of education under one curriculum ended \"clerics or clergy of the Ottoman Empire\", but was not the end of religious schools in Turkey; they were moved to higher education until later governments restored them to their former position in secondary after Atat\u00fcrk's death.\n\n[[File:Ataturk-hatreform.jpg|thumb|upright|Atat\u00fcrk with his [[Panama hat]] just after [[s:tr:Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Kastamonu Nutku|the Kastamonu speech]] in 1925]]\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1925, Atat\u00fcrk encouraged the Turks to wear modern European attire.<ref name=UNESCO>\u0130\u011fdemir, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 165\u2013170</ref> He was determined to force the abandonment of the sartorial traditions of the Middle East and finalize a series of dress reforms, which were originally started by [[Mahmud II]].<ref name=UNESCO/> The [[Fez (hat)|fez]] was established by Sultan Mahmud II in 1826 as part of the Ottoman Empire's modernization effort. The [[s:tr:\u015eapka \u0130ktisas\u0131 Hakk\u0131nda Kanun|Hat Law of 1925]] introduced the use of Western-style hats instead of the fez.

In 1925, Atat\u00fcrk wore a [[Panama hat]] during a public appearance in [[Kastamonu]], one of the most conservative towns in Anatolia, to explain that the hat was the headgear of civilized nations. The last part of reform on dress emphasized the need to wear modern Western suits with neckties as well as Fedora and Derby-style hats instead of antiquated religion-based clothing such as the veil and turban in the [[s:tr:Baz\u0131 Kisvelerin Giyilemiyece\u011fine Dair Kanun|Law Relating to Prohibited Garments of 1934]].\n\nEven though he personally promoted modern dress for women, Atat\u00fcrk never made specific reference to women's clothing in the law, as he believed that women would adapt to the new clothing styles of their own free will.

Sheikh Said was a wealthy Kurdish [[tribal chief]] of a local [[Naqshbandi]] order. He emphasized the issue of religion; he not only opposed the abolition of the Caliphate, but also the adoption of civil codes based on Western models, the closure of religious orders, the ban on polygamy, and the new obligatory civil marriage. Sheikh stirred up his followers against the policies of the government, which he considered anti-Islamic. In an effort to restore Islamic law, Sheik's forces moved through the countryside, seized government offices and marched on the important cities of [[Elaz\u0131\u011f]] and [[Diyarbak\u0131r]].<ref>Patrick Kinross, ''Atat\u00fcrk: The Rebirth of a Nation'', 397</ref> Members of the government saw the Sheikh Said Rebellion as an attempt at a counter-revolution. They urged immediate military action to prevent its spread. The \"Law for the Maintenance of Public Order\" was passed to deal with the rebellion on 4 March 1925. It gave the government exceptional powers and included the authority to shut down subversive groups, but was repealed on 4 March 1929.\n\nThere were also parliamentarians in the GNA who were not happy with these changes{{who|date=September 2015}}. So many members were denounced as opposition sympathizers at a private meeting of the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) that Atat\u00fcrk expressed his fear of being among the minority in his own party.<ref name=\"PRP\">Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 418</ref> He decided not to purge this group.<ref name=\"PRP\"/> After a [[Censure|censure motion]] gave the chance to have a breakaway group, [[Kaz\u0131m Karabekir]], along with his friends, established such a group on 17 October 1924.

Some of Atat\u00fcrk's closest associates who had supported him in the early days of the War of Independence such as [[Rauf Orbay|Rauf Bey]] (later Rauf Orbay), [[Refet Bele|Refet Pasha]] and [[Ali Fuat Cebesoy|Ali Fuat Pasha]] (later Ali Fuat Cebesoy) were among the members of the new party. The PRP's economic program suggested liberalism, in contrast to the [[state socialism]] of CHP, and its social program was based on conservatism in contrast to the [[modernism]] of CHP. Leaders of the party strongly supported the Kemalist revolution in principle, but had different opinions on the cultural revolution and the principle of [[secularism]].<ref>Weiker, ''Book Review of Z\u00fcrcher's \"Political Opposition in the Early Turkish Republic: The Progressive Republican Party, 1924\u20131925\"'', 297\u2013298</ref> The PRP was not against Atat\u00fcrk's main positions as declared in its program; they supported establishing secularism in the country and the civil law, or as stated, \"the needs of the age\" (article 3) and the uniform system of education (article 49).<ref name=\"Mango 419\">Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 419</ref> These principles were set by the leaders at the onset. The only legal opposition became a home for all kinds of differing views.\n\nDuring 1926, a plot to assassinate Atat\u00fcrk was uncovered in Smyrna<!--Use Izmir after 1930/1929 as the Nationalists began asking for use of Turkish names in 1929--> (\u0130zmir). It originated with a former deputy who had opposed the abolition of the Caliphate. Investigation shifted from an inquiry into the planners to an investigation ostensibly to uncover subversive activities but in truth used to undermine those disagreeing with Atat\u00fcrk's cultural revolution. The sweeping investigation brought a number of political activists before the tribunal, including Karabekir, the leader of PRP. A number of surviving leaders of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]], who were at best second-rank in the Turkish movement, including [[Mehmet Cavit Bey|Cavid]], Ahmed \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc, and Ismail Canbulat, were found guilty of treason and hanged.<ref>Touraj Atabaki, Erik Jan Z\u00fcrcher, 2004, Men of Order: authoritarian modernization under Atat\u00fcrk and Reza Shah, I.B.Tauris, {{ISBN|1-86064-426-0}}, page 207</ref> The investigations found a link between the members of the PRP and the Sheikh Said Rebellion. The PRP was dissolved following the outcomes of the trial. The pattern of organized opposition, however, was broken. This action was the only broad political purge during Atat\u00fcrk's presidency.

It was modelled after the Italian Penal Code. On 4 October 1926, [[Sharia|Islamic courts]] were closed. Establishing the civic law needed time, so Atat\u00fcrk delayed the inclusion of the principle of [[la\u00efcit\u00e9]] until 5 February 1937.\n\nOttoman practice discouraged social interaction between men and women in keeping with Islamic practice of [[sex segregation and Islam|sex segregation]]. Atat\u00fcrk began developing social reforms very early, as was evident in his personal journal. He and his staff discussed issues like abolishing the [[Hijab|veiling of women]] and the integration of women into the outside world. The clue on how he was planning to tackle the issue was stated in his journal in November 1915:\n\n{{bquote|The social change can come by (1) educating capable mothers who are knowledgeable about life; (2) giving freedom to women; (3) a man can change his morals, thoughts, and feelings by leading a common life with a woman; as there is an inborn tendency towards the attraction of mutual affection.<ref name=mango164>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 164</ref>}}\n\nAtat\u00fcrk needed a new civil code to establish his second major step of giving freedom to women. The first part was the education of girls and was established with the unification of education. On 4 October 1926, the new Turkish civil code passed. It was modelled after the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. Under the new code, women gained equality with men in such matters as inheritance and divorce. Atat\u00fcrk did not consider gender a factor in social organization. According to his view, society marched towards its goal with men and women united. He believed that it was scientifically impossible for him to achieve progress and to become civilized if the gender separation continued as in Ottoman times.<ref>T\u00fcfek\u00e7i, ''Universality of Atat\u00fcrk's philosophy''</ref> During a meeting he declaimed:\n\n{{bquote|''To the women'': Win for us the battle of education and you will do yet more for your country than we have been able to do.

We shall remain irremediably backward, incapable of treating on equal terms with the civilizations of the West.<ref>Kinross, ''Atat\u00fcrk: The Rebirth of a Nation'', p. 343</ref>}}\n\nIn 1927, the [[State Art and Sculpture Museum]] ({{lang-tr|Ankara Resim ve Heykel M\u00fczesi}}) opened its doors. The museum highlighted sculpture, which was little practised in Turkey owing to the Islamic tradition of avoiding idolatry. Atat\u00fcrk believed that \"culture is the foundation of the Turkish Republic,\"<ref name=atillasoy15>Atillasoy, ''Atat\u00fcrk : first president and founder of the Turkish Republic'', 15</ref> and described modern Turkey's ideological thrust as \"a creation of patriotism blended with a lofty humanist ideal.\" He included both his own nation's creative legacy and what he saw as the admirable values of global civilization. The pre-Islamic [[Turkic peoples|culture of the Turks]] became the subject of extensive research, and particular emphasis was laid upon Turkish culture widespread before the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] civilizations. He instigated study of [[History of Anatolia|Anatolian civilizations]]\u2014[[Phrygians]] and [[Lydians]], [[Sumer]]ians and [[Hittites]]. To attract current public attention to past cultures, he personally named the \"[[S\u00fcmerbank]]\" (1932) after the Sumerians and the \"[[Etibank]]\" (1935) after the Hittites. He also stressed the folk arts of the countryside as a wellspring of Turkish creativity.\n\n[[File:Ataturk-20 September 1928.jpg|thumb|left|upright|President Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk introducing [[Turkish alphabet|the new Turkish alphabet]] to the people of [[Kayseri]] on 20 September 1928]]\n\nIn the spring of 1928, Atat\u00fcrk met in Angora (Ankara)<!--The name became Ankara in English in the 1930s--> with several linguists and professors from all over Turkey where he unveiled to them a plan of his to implement a new alphabet for the written Turkish language based on a modified [[Latin alphabet]]. The new [[Turkish alphabet]] would serve as a replacement for the old [[Arabic script]] and as a solution to the literacy problem in Turkey, as the Arabic script does not feature any [[vowel]]s while [[Turkish phonology#Vowels|the Turkish language has eight]]. When he asked them at how long it would take, in their professional opinion, to implement the new alphabet into the Turkish language, most of the professors and linguists said between three and five years.

On 1 November 1928, he introduced the new Turkish alphabet and abolished the use of Arabic script. At the time, literate citizens of the country comprised as little as 10% of the population.

He insisted on the protection of secular reforms. The brand-new [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] succeeded all around the country. Without the establishment of a real political spectrum, once again, the party became the center to opposition of Atat\u00fcrk's reforms, particularly in regard to the role of religion in public life.\n\nOn 23 December 1930, a chain of violent incidents occurred, starting with the rebellion of Islamic fundamentalists in [[Menemen]], a small town in the Aegean region. This so-called [[Menemen Incident]] was considered a serious threat against secular reforms.\n\nIn November 1930, Ali Fethi Okyar dissolved his own party. A more lasting [[multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey]] began in 1945. In 1950, the CHP released the majority position to the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]]. There are arguments that Atat\u00fcrk's single-party rule did not promote [[direct democracy]]. The reason experiments with [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] failed during this period was that not all groups in the country had agreed to a minimal consensus regarding shared values (mainly secularism) and shared rules for conflict resolution. In response to such criticisms, Atat\u00fcrk's biographer [[Andrew Mango]] said: \"between the two wars, democracy could not be sustained in many relatively richer and better-educated societies.

The [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] was put down by the [[RAF Iraq Command]] during the summer of 1920. From the British perspective, if Atat\u00fcrk stabilized Turkey, he would then turn his attention to Mosul and penetrate Mesopotamia, where the native population would probably join him thus bringing an insurgent and hostile Muslim nation to the very gates of India.\n\nIn 1923, Atat\u00fcrk tried to persuade the GNA that accepting the arbitration of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] over Mosul did not mean relinquishing Mosul, but rather waiting for a time when Turkey might be stronger. The artificially drawn border had an unsettling effect on the population on both sides.

The relationship between the rebels and Britain was questioned.

Partly because of the continuing uncertainties along the northern frontier (present-day northern Iraq), the committee recommended that the region should be connected to Iraq with the condition that the UK would hold the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. By the end of March 1925, the necessary troop movements were completed, and the whole area of the Sheikh Said rebellion was encircled.<ref>Kinross, 401</ref> As a result of these manoeuvres, the revolt was put down. Britain, Iraq and Kemal made a treaty on 5 June 1926, which mostly followed the decisions of the League Council. In 1926, Kemal faced growing opposition to his reform policies, a continuing precarious economic situation, and a defeat in the Mosul issue. A large section of the Kurdish population and the [[Iraqi Turkmen]] were left on the other side of the border. The Sheikh Said Rebellion hastened both the imposition of the Republican Party and the speed of Atat\u00fcrk's reforms. In 1925, the population was largely illiterate and disparate.

This meeting was followed by a Turkey-Afghanistan Friendship and Cooperation pact on 22 May 1928. Atat\u00fcrk supported Afghanistan's integration into international organizations.

The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the [[Dardanelles]] should remain open to all commercial vessels: seizure of foreign military vessels was subject to certain limitations during peacetime, and, even as a neutral state, Turkey could not limit any military passage during wartime. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the waterway was to be demilitarized, and its management left to the Straits Commission. The demilitarized zone heavily restricted Turkey's domination and sovereignty over the Straits. The defence of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] was impossible without having the sovereignty over the water that passed through it.\n\nIn March 1936, Hitler's [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|reoccupation of the Rhineland]] gave Atat\u00fcrk the opportunity to resume full control over the Straits. \"The situation in Europe\", he declared \"is highly appropriate for such a move. We shall certainly achieve it\".<ref>Sosyal, Ismail, 1983, \"Turkey's Diplomatic treaties\", TTK, Ankara page 493</ref> [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras]], who was the foreign minister, initiated a move to revise the Straits' regime. Aras claimed that he was directed by the President, rather than his Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc. \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc was worried about harming relations with Britain, France, and Balkan neighbors over the Straits. However, the signatories agreed to join the conference, since unlimited military passage had become unfavourable to Turkey with the changes in world politics. Atat\u00fcrk demanded that the members of the Turkish Foreign Office devise a solution that would transfer full control over the waterway to Turkey.\n\nOn 20 July 1936, the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits|Montreux Convention]] was signed, with the participation of Bulgaria, Great Britain, Australia, France, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Yugoslavia and Greece. It became the primary instrument governing the passage of commercial and war vessels through the Dardanelles Strait. It was ratified by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|GNAT]] on 31 July 1936. It went into effect on 9 November 1936 and is still valid today.\n\n====Balkan Pact====\n[[File:Alexander I of Yugoslavia and Mustafa Kemal in 1933.jpg|thumb|During the visit of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in 1931]]\n\nUntil the early 1930s, Turkey followed a modern neutral foreign policy with the West by developing joint friendship and neutrality agreements. These bilateral agreements were aligned with Atat\u00fcrk's worldview. By the end of 1925, Turkey had signed fifteen joint agreements with Western states.\n\nIn the early 1930s, changes and developments in world politics required Turkey to make multilateral agreements to improve its security. Atat\u00fcrk strongly believed that close cooperation between the Balkan states based on the principle of equality would have an important effect on European politics. These states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries and had formed a powerful force. While the origins of the Balkan agreement may date back as far as 1925, the Balkan Pact came to being in the mid-1930s. Several important developments in the Balkan Peninsula and in Europe helped the original idea to materialize, such as improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important factor in driving Turkish foreign policy from the mid-1930s onwards was the fear of Italy. [[Benito Mussolini]] had frequently proclaimed his intention to make the entire Mediterranean ''[[Mare Nostrum]]''. Both the Turks and the various Balkan states felt threatened by Italian ambitions.\n\nThe [[Balkan Pact]] was negotiated by Atat\u00fcrk with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This mutual-defence agreement intended to guarantee the signatories' territorial integrity and political independence against attack by another Balkan state such as Bulgaria or Albania. It countered the increasingly aggressive foreign policy of fascist Italy and the effect of a potential Bulgarian alignment with Nazi Germany. Atat\u00fcrk thought of the Balkan Pact as a medium of balance in the relations with the European countries.<ref>Yilmaz Altu\u00f0, \"Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Dis Politikas\u00fd,\" B.\u00dc.

It was regarded as a significant step forward in consolidating the free world's position in southeast Europe, although it contained no specific military commitments. The importance of the agreement was best displayed in the message which Atat\u00fcrk sent to the Greek Premier, [[Ioannis Metaxas]]:\n\n{{bquote|The borders of the allies in the Balkan Pact are a single border. Those who covet this border will encounter the burning beams of the sun. I recommend avoiding this.

The unanimously ratified Balkan pact became a reality on 18 May 1935 and lasted until 1940.\n\nThe Balkan Pact turned out to be ineffective for reasons that were beyond Atat\u00fcrk's control. What he wanted to prevent with the Balkan Pact was realized by Bulgaria's attempt to put the [[Dobruja]] issue into the agenda after a series of international events ending with the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] on 7 April 1939. These [[Causes of World War II|conflicts]] spread rapidly, triggering World War II. The goal of Atat\u00fcrk, to protect southeast Europe, failed with the dissolution of the pact. The only state which arose intact after the war was Atat\u00fcrk's Republic of Turkey.\n\n====Issue of Hatay====\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Kemal Ataturk congratulation of the Hatay's decision.png|thumb|Telegram sent by Atat\u00fcrk after the local legislative assembly accepted his proposal for the [[Hatay State]]'s flag]]\n\nTurkish Prime-Minister [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] was very conscious of foreign policy issues. During the second half of the 1930s, Atat\u00fcrk tried to form a closer relationship with Britain. The risks of this policy change put the two men at odds. The Hatay issue and the Lyon agreement were two important developments in foreign policy that played a significant role in the severing of relations between Atat\u00fcrk and \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc.\n\nIn 1936, Atat\u00fcrk raised the \"Issue of Hatay\" at the League of Nations. [[Hatay State|Hatay]] was based on the old administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire called the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]]. On behalf of the League of Nations, the representatives of France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey prepared a constitution for Hatay, which established it as an autonomous [[sanjak]] within Syria. Despite some inter-ethnic violence, in the midst of 1938 an election was conducted by the local legislative assembly. The cities of [[Antakya]] (Antioch) and [[\u0130skenderun]] (Alexandretta) joined Turkey in 1939.\n\n===Economic policies===\n:''For conceptual analysis, see [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms#Economic reforms|Economic reforms]]''\nAtat\u00fcrk instigated economic policies to develop small and large scale businesses, but also to create social strata (industrial bourgeoisie along with the [[peasantry]] of Anatolia) that were virtually non-existent during the Ottoman Empire. The primary problem faced by the politics of his period was the lag in the development of political institutions and social classes which would steer such social and economic changes.<ref>Huntington, ''Political Order in Changing Societies'', 347\u2013357</ref> His vision regarding early Turkish economic policy was apparent during the [[\u0130zmir Economic Congress]] of 1923 which was established before the signing of the [[Lausanne Treaty]]. The initial choices of his economic policies reflected the realities of his period. After World War I, due to the lack of any real potential investors to open private sector factories and develop industrial production, Atat\u00fcrk established many state-owned factories for agriculture, machinery, and textile industries.\n\n====State intervention, 1923\u20131929====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--last 3 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk Nazilli Basma Fabrikas\u0131'n\u0131n a\u00e7\u0131l\u0131\u015f\u0131nda (1937).jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk and [[Cel\u00e2l Bayar]] visiting the S\u00fcmerbank Nazilli Cotton Factory, which was established as a part of the cotton-related industry]]\n\nAtat\u00fcrk's and [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]]'s pursuit of state-controlled economic policies was guided by a national vision; their goal was to knit the country together, eliminate the foreign control of the economy, and improve communications within Turkey.

[[Turkish tobacco]] was an important industrial crop, while its cultivation and manufacture had been French monopolies under [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. The tobacco and cigarette trade was controlled by two French companies: the \"[[Regie Company]]\" and \"Narquileh Tobacco\".<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 232\u2013233.</ref> The Ottoman Empire had given the tobacco monopoly to the [[Ottoman Bank]] as a limited company under the \"[[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Council of the Public Debt]]\". Regie, as part of the Council of the Public Debt, had control over production, storing, and distribution (including export) with unchallenged price control. Consequently, Turkish farmers were dependent on the company for their livelihood.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |title = T\u00fct\u00fcn, \u0130\u00e7ki ve Tekel |language = Turkish |date = 29 January 2003 |accessdate = 10 October 2007 |last = Aysu |first = Abdullah |publisher = B\u0130A Haber Merkezi |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015212242/http://bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |archivedate = 15 October 2007 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> In 1925, this company was taken over by the state and named \"[[Tekel]]\". The control of tobacco was the biggest achievement of the Kemalist political machinery's \"[[nationalization]]\" of the economy for a country that did not produce oil. They accompanied this achievement with the development of the cotton industry, which peaked during the early 1930s. Cotton was the second biggest industrial crop in Turkey at the time.\n\nIn 1924, with the initiative of Atat\u00fcrk, the first Turkish bank [[\u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131]] was established. He was the first member of \u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131. The bank's creation was a response to the growing need for a truly national establishment and the birth of a banking system which was capable of backing up economic activities, managing funds accumulated as a result of policies providing savings incentives, and, where necessary, extending resources which could trigger industrial impetus.\n\nIn 1927, [[Turkish State Railways]] was established. Because Atat\u00fcrk considered the development of a national [[Rail transport|rail network]] as another important step in industrialization, it was given high priority. This institution developed an extensive railway network in a very short time. In 1927, Kemal also ordered the integration of road construction goals into development plans. Prior to this, the road network had consisted of 13,885&nbsp; km of ruined surface roads, 4,450&nbsp; km of stabilized roads, and 94 bridges. In 1935, a new entity was established under the government called \"\u015eose ve K\u00f6pr\u00fcler Reisli\u011fi\" which would drive the development of new roads after World War II. However, in 1937, the 22,000&nbsp; km of roads in Turkey augmented the railways.\n\nThe national group{{Clarify|date=December 2008}}, which had Atat\u00fcrk as the leader, developed many projects within the first decade of the republic. However, the Turkish economy was still largely agrarian, with primitive tools and methods; roads and transportation facilities were far from sufficient and management of the economy was inefficient. The [[Great Depression]] brought many changes to this picture.\n\n====Great Depression, 1929\u20131931====\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal surveying the model of the quarter of Ministries.jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk supported large-scale government subsidized industrial complexes, such as [[S\u00fcmerbank]], increasingly after the [[Great Depression]].]]\nThe young republic, like the rest of the world, found itself in a deep economic crisis during the [[Great Depression]]. Atat\u00fcrk reacted to conditions of this period by moving toward integrated economic policies and establishing a central bank to control exchange rates. However, Turkey could not finance essential imports; its currency was shunned and zealous revenue officials seized the meagre possessions of peasants who could not pay their taxes.<ref name=mango470/>\n\nIn 1929, Atat\u00fcrk signed a treaty that resulted in the [[debt restructuring|restructuring of the nation's debt]] with the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]]. He did not fault the Ottoman debt. He had to deal with the turbulent economic issues of the Great Depression along with the payment of the high debt known as the [[Ottoman public debt]]. Until the early 1930s, Turkish private business could not acquire exchange credits. It was impossible to integrate the Turkish economy without a solution to this problem. This increased the credibility of the new Republic.\n\nIn 1931, Atat\u00fcrk's goal of establishing the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] was realized. The bank's primary purpose was to have control over the exchange rate and [[Ottoman Bank]]'s role during its initial years as a central bank was phased out. Later specialized banks such as the [[S\u00fcmerbank]] (1932) and the [[Etibank]] (1935) were founded.\n\nFrom the [[political economy]] perspective, Atat\u00fcrk had to face the same problems which all countries faced: political upheaval. The establishment of a new party with a different economic perspective was needed; he asked Ali Fethi Okyar to fulfil. The [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] (August 1930) came out with a liberal program and proposed that state monopolies should be ended, foreign capital should be attracted, and that state investment should be curtailed. Atat\u00fcrk supported \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc's point of view: \"it is impossible to attract foreign capital for essential development.\" In 1931, he proclaimed: \"In the economic area ...the programme of the party is statism.\"<ref>Ibrahim Kaya, Social Theory and Later Modernities, page 90</ref> However, the effect of free republicans was felt strongly and state intervention became more moderate, more akin to a form of [[state capitalism]]. One of his radical left-wing supporters, [[Yakup Kadri Karaosmano\u011flu]] from the [[Kadro]] (The Cadre) movement, claimed that Atat\u00fcrk found a third way between capitalism and socialism.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 478</ref>\n\n====Liberalization and planned growth, 1931\u20131939====\n[[File:1932 Mustafa Kemal Etimesgut airport.png|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Atat\u00fcrk at the Etimesgut Airport in [[Ankara]], built by the [[Turkish Aeronautical Association|Turkish Aircraft Association]].

Cemil Bozok, son of Salih Bozok, who was a distant cousin of Atat\u00fcrk and, later, his ADC, claims to have been related to both Ali R\u0131za's and Z\u00fcbeyde's families. This would mean that the families of Atat\u00fcrk's parents were interrelated. Cemil Bozok also notes that his paternal grandfather, Safer Efendi, was of Albanian origin. This may have a bearing on the vexed question of Atat\u00fcrk's ethnic origin. Atat\u00fcrk's parents and relatives all used Turkish as their mother tongue.

Britain, which controlled the [[Khedivate of Egypt|Ottoman provinces of Egypt and Sudan]], did not allow additional Ottoman troops to reach Libya through Egypt. Ottoman soldiers like Atat\u00fcrk went to Libya either dressed as Arabs (risking imprisonment if noticed by the British authorities in Egypt) or by the very few available ferries (the Italians, who had superior naval forces, effectively controlled the sea routes to Tripoli). However, despite all the hardships, Atat\u00fcrk's forces in Libya managed to repel the Italians on a number of occasions, such as the [[Battle of Tobruk (1911)|Battle of Tobruk]] on 22 December 1911. During the Battle of Derna on 16\u201317 January 1912, while Atat\u00fcrk was assaulting the Italian-controlled fortress of Kasr-\u0131 Harun, two Italian planes dropped bombs on the Ottoman forces; a [[limestone]] splinter from a damaged building's rubble struck Atat\u00fcrk's left eye, causing permanent tissue damage, but not total loss of sight. He received medical treatment for nearly a month; he attempted to leave the Red Crescent's health facilities after only two weeks, but when his eye's situation worsened, he had to return and resume treatment. On 6 March 1912 Atat\u00fcrk became the Commander of the Ottoman forces in Derna. He managed to defend and retain the city and its surrounding region until the end of the Italo-Turkish War on 18 October 1912. Atat\u00fcrk, [[\u0130smail Enver|Enver Bey]], [[Ali Fethi Okyar|Fethi Bey]], and the other Ottoman military commanders in Libya had to return to [[Ottoman territories in Europe|Ottoman Europe]] following the outbreak of the [[Balkan Wars]] on 8 October 1912.

In forging the new republic, the Turkish revolutionaries turned their back on the perceived corruption and decadence of cosmopolitan Constantinople and its Ottoman heritage.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 391\u2013392</ref> For instance, they made Angora,<!--Turkish names of cities began to be used in English after 1930--> [[Ankara]] in Turkish, the country's new capital and reformed the [[Postage stamps and postal history of Turkey|Turkish postal service]]. Once a provincial town deep in Anatolia, Angora was thus turned into the center of the independence movement. Atat\u00fcrk wanted a \"direct government by the Assembly\"<ref name=\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 362\">Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 362</ref> and visualized a [[representative democracy]], [[parliamentary sovereignty]], where the National Parliament would be the ultimate source of power.<ref name=\"Mango, Atat\u00fcrk, 362\"/>\n\nIn the following years, he altered his stance somewhat; the country needed an immense amount of reconstruction, and that \"direct government by the Assembly\" could not survive in such an environment. The revolutionaries faced challenges from the supporters of the old Ottoman regime, and also from the supporters of newer ideologies such as communism and fascism. Atat\u00fcrk saw the consequences of fascist and communist doctrines in the 1920s and 1930s and rejected both.<ref>Landau, ''Atat\u00fcrk and the Modernization of Turkey'', 252</ref> He prevented the spread into Turkey of the [[totalitarian]] party rule which held sway in the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 501</ref> Some perceived his opposition and silencing of these ideologies as a means of eliminating competition; others believed it was necessary to protect the young Turkish state from succumbing to the instability of new ideologies and competing factions.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Under Atat\u00fcrk, the arrest process known as the Arrests of 1927 (''1927 Tevkifat\u0131'') was launched, and a widespread arrest policy was put in place against the [[Communist Party of Turkey (historical)|Communist Party of Turkey]] members.

Education was the cornerstone in this effort. In 1923, there were three main educational groups of institutions. The most common institutions were [[medrese]]s based on Arabic, the Qur'an and memorization. The second type of institution was idad\u00ee and sultan\u00ee, the reformist schools of the [[Tanzimat]] era.

He wanted to institute compulsory primary education for both girls and boys; since then this effort has been an ongoing task for the republic. He pointed out that one of the main targets of [[education in Turkey]] had to be raising a generation nourished with what he called the \"public culture\". The state schools established a common curriculum which became known as the \"unification of education.\"\n\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Atat\u00fcrk with his [[bowler hat]]]]\n\nUnification of education was put into force on 3 March 1924 by the Law on Unification of Education (No. 430). With the new law, education became inclusive, organized on a model of the civil community. In this new design, all schools submitted their curriculum to the \"[[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Ministry of National Education]]\", a government agency modelled after other countries' ministries of education. Concurrently, the republic abolished the two ministries and made clergy subordinate to the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|department of religious affairs]], one of the foundations of [[secularism in Turkey]]. The unification of education under one curriculum ended \"clerics or clergy of the Ottoman Empire\", but was not the end of religious schools in Turkey; they were moved to higher education until later governments restored them to their former position in secondary after Atat\u00fcrk's death.\n\n[[File:Ataturk-hatreform.jpg|thumb|upright|Atat\u00fcrk with his [[Panama hat]] just after [[s:tr:Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Kastamonu Nutku|the Kastamonu speech]] in 1925]]\n\nBeginning in the fall of 1925, Atat\u00fcrk encouraged the Turks to wear modern European attire.<ref name=UNESCO>\u0130\u011fdemir, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 165\u2013170</ref> He was determined to force the abandonment of the sartorial traditions of the Middle East and finalize a series of dress reforms, which were originally started by [[Mahmud II]].<ref name=UNESCO/> The [[Fez (hat)|fez]] was established by Sultan Mahmud II in 1826 as part of the Ottoman Empire's modernization effort. The [[s:tr:\u015eapka \u0130ktisas\u0131 Hakk\u0131nda Kanun|Hat Law of 1925]] introduced the use of Western-style hats instead of the fez. Atat\u00fcrk first made the hat compulsory for civil servants.<ref name=UNESCO/> The guidelines for the proper dressing of students and state employees were passed during his lifetime; many civil servants adopted the hat willingly. In 1925, Atat\u00fcrk wore a [[Panama hat]] during a public appearance in [[Kastamonu]], one of the most conservative towns in Anatolia, to explain that the hat was the headgear of civilized nations. The last part of reform on dress emphasized the need to wear modern Western suits with neckties as well as Fedora and Derby-style hats instead of antiquated religion-based clothing such as the veil and turban in the [[s:tr:Baz\u0131 Kisvelerin Giyilemiyece\u011fine Dair Kanun|Law Relating to Prohibited Garments of 1934]].\n\nEven though he personally promoted modern dress for women, Atat\u00fcrk never made specific reference to women's clothing in the law, as he believed that women would adapt to the new clothing styles of their own free will. He was frequently photographed on public business with his wife [[L\u00e2tife U\u015fakl\u0131gil]], who covered her head in accordance with Islamic tradition. He was also frequently photographed on public business with women wearing modern Western clothes. But it was Atat\u00fcrk's adopted daughters, [[Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en]] and [[Afet \u0130nan]], who provided the real role model for the Turkish women of the future.

He emphasized the issue of religion; he not only opposed the abolition of the Caliphate, but also the adoption of civil codes based on Western models, the closure of religious orders, the ban on polygamy, and the new obligatory civil marriage. Sheikh stirred up his followers against the policies of the government, which he considered anti-Islamic.

It was modelled after the Italian Penal Code. On 4 October 1926, [[Sharia|Islamic courts]] were closed. Establishing the civic law needed time, so Atat\u00fcrk delayed the inclusion of the principle of [[la\u00efcit\u00e9]] until 5 February 1937.\n\nOttoman practice discouraged social interaction between men and women in keeping with Islamic practice of [[sex segregation and Islam|sex segregation]]. Atat\u00fcrk began developing social reforms very early, as was evident in his personal journal. He and his staff discussed issues like abolishing the [[Hijab|veiling of women]] and the integration of women into the outside world. The clue on how he was planning to tackle the issue was stated in his journal in November 1915:\n\n{{bquote|The social change can come by (1) educating capable mothers who are knowledgeable about life; (2) giving freedom to women; (3) a man can change his morals, thoughts, and feelings by leading a common life with a woman; as there is an inborn tendency towards the attraction of mutual affection.<ref name=mango164>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 164</ref>}}\n\nAtat\u00fcrk needed a new civil code to establish his second major step of giving freedom to women. The first part was the education of girls and was established with the unification of education. On 4 October 1926, the new Turkish civil code passed. It was modelled after the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. Under the new code, women gained equality with men in such matters as inheritance and divorce. Atat\u00fcrk did not consider gender a factor in social organization. According to his view, society marched towards its goal with men and women united. He believed that it was scientifically impossible for him to achieve progress and to become civilized if the gender separation continued as in Ottoman times.<ref>T\u00fcfek\u00e7i, ''Universality of Atat\u00fcrk's philosophy''</ref> During a meeting he declaimed:\n\n{{bquote|''To the women'': Win for us the battle of education and you will do yet more for your country than we have been able to do.

The museum highlighted sculpture, which was little practised in Turkey owing to the Islamic tradition of avoiding idolatry. Atat\u00fcrk believed that \"culture is the foundation of the Turkish Republic,\"<ref name=atillasoy15>Atillasoy, ''Atat\u00fcrk : first president and founder of the Turkish Republic'', 15</ref> and described modern Turkey's ideological thrust as \"a creation of patriotism blended with a lofty humanist ideal.\" He included both his own nation's creative legacy and what he saw as the admirable values of global civilization. The pre-Islamic [[Turkic peoples|culture of the Turks]] became the subject of extensive research, and particular emphasis was laid upon Turkish culture widespread before the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] civilizations. He instigated study of [[History of Anatolia|Anatolian civilizations]]\u2014[[Phrygians]] and [[Lydians]], [[Sumer]]ians and [[Hittites]]. To attract current public attention to past cultures, he personally named the \"[[S\u00fcmerbank]]\" (1932) after the Sumerians and the \"[[Etibank]]\" (1935) after the Hittites. He also stressed the folk arts of the countryside as a wellspring of Turkish creativity.\n\n[[File:Ataturk-20 September 1928.jpg|thumb|left|upright|President Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk introducing [[Turkish alphabet|the new Turkish alphabet]] to the people of [[Kayseri]] on 20 September 1928]]\n\nIn the spring of 1928, Atat\u00fcrk met in Angora (Ankara)<!--The name became Ankara in English in the 1930s--> with several linguists and professors from all over Turkey where he unveiled to them a plan of his to implement a new alphabet for the written Turkish language based on a modified [[Latin alphabet]]. The new [[Turkish alphabet]] would serve as a replacement for the old [[Arabic script]] and as a solution to the literacy problem in Turkey, as the Arabic script does not feature any [[vowel]]s while [[Turkish phonology#Vowels|the Turkish language has eight]]. When he asked them at how long it would take, in their professional opinion, to implement the new alphabet into the Turkish language, most of the professors and linguists said between three and five years. Atat\u00fcrk was said to have scoffed and openly stated, \"We shall do it in three to five months\".<ref>Falih R\u0131fk\u0131 Atay (1969). ''\u00c7ankaya''.

On 1 November 1928, he introduced the new Turkish alphabet and abolished the use of Arabic script. At the time, literate citizens of the country comprised as little as 10% of the population.

He instigated official education meetings called \"Science Boards\" and \"Education Summits.\" to discuss the quality of education, training issues and certain basic educational principles. He said, \"our schools [curriculum] should aim to provide opportunities for all pupils to learn and to achieve.\" He was personally engaged with the development of two textbooks. The first one was ''{{lang-tr|Vatanda\u015f \u0130\u00e7in Medeni Bilgiler}}'' (1930). The second, ''Geometry'' (1937), was a text for high schools. The ''Vatanda\u015f \u0130\u00e7in Medeni Bilgiler'' (''Civic knowledge for the citizens'') introduced the science of comparative government and explained the means of administering public trust by explaining the rules of governance as applied to the new state institutions.\n\n====Opposition to Mustafa Kemal in 1930\u20131931====\n[[File:Ataturk and Fethi Okyar.jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk with the [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] leader [[Ali Fethi Okyar]] and his daughter in [[Yalova]], on 13 August 1930]]\nOn 11 August 1930, Atat\u00fcrk decided to try a multiparty movement once again and asked Ali Fethi Okyar to establish a new party. He insisted on the protection of secular reforms. The brand-new [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] succeeded all around the country. Without the establishment of a real political spectrum, once again, the party became the center to opposition of Atat\u00fcrk's reforms, particularly in regard to the role of religion in public life.\n\nOn 23 December 1930, a chain of violent incidents occurred, starting with the rebellion of Islamic fundamentalists in [[Menemen]], a small town in the Aegean region. This so-called [[Menemen Incident]] was considered a serious threat against secular reforms.\n\nIn November 1930, Ali Fethi Okyar dissolved his own party. A more lasting [[multi-party period of the Republic of Turkey]] began in 1945. In 1950, the CHP released the majority position to the [[Democratic Party (Turkey, historical)|Democratic Party]]. There are arguments that Atat\u00fcrk's single-party rule did not promote [[direct democracy]]. The reason experiments with [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] failed during this period was that not all groups in the country had agreed to a minimal consensus regarding shared values (mainly secularism) and shared rules for conflict resolution. In response to such criticisms, Atat\u00fcrk's biographer [[Andrew Mango]] said: \"between the two wars, democracy could not be sustained in many relatively richer and better-educated societies. Atat\u00fcrk's enlightened authoritarianism left a reasonable space for free private lives. More could not have been expected in his lifetime.\"<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 536</ref> Even though, at times, he did not appear to be a democrat in his actions, he always supported the idea of building a [[civil society]]: a system of voluntary civic and social organizations and institutions as opposed to the force-backed structures of the state.

During the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], [[Lieutenant General]] [[William Marshall (British Army officer)|William Marshall]] followed the British War Office's instruction that \"every effort was to be made to score as heavily as possible on the Tigris before the whistle blew\", capturing Mosul three days after the signature of the [[Armistice of Mudros]] (30 October 1918).<ref name=\"britainsoil\">Peter Sluglett, \"The Primacy of Oil in Britain's Iraq Policy\", in the book \"Britain in Iraq: 1914\u20131932\" London: Ithaca Press, 1976, pp. 103\u2013116</ref> In 1920, the ''[[Misak-\u0131 Milli]]'', which consolidated the \"Turkish lands\", declared that Mosul Province was a part of the historic Turkish heartland. The British were in a precarious situation with the Issue of Mosul and were adopting almost equally desperate measures to protect their interests. The [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] was put down by the [[RAF Iraq Command]] during the summer of 1920. From the British perspective, if Atat\u00fcrk stabilized Turkey, he would then turn his attention to Mosul and penetrate Mesopotamia, where the native population would probably join him thus bringing an insurgent and hostile Muslim nation to the very gates of India.\n\nIn 1923, Atat\u00fcrk tried to persuade the GNA that accepting the arbitration of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] over Mosul did not mean relinquishing Mosul, but rather waiting for a time when Turkey might be stronger. The artificially drawn border had an unsettling effect on the population on both sides. Later, it was claimed that Turkey began where the oil ends, as the border was drawn by the British geophysicists based on the oil reserves.

The relationship between the rebels and Britain was questioned. British assistance was sought after the rebels realised that the rebellion, or its expected outcome, could not stand by itself.<ref>Olson, Robert W. (1989) The Emergence of Kurdish Nationalism and the Sheikh Said Rebellion, 1880\u20131925, p.45</ref>\n\nIn 1925, the League of Nations formed a three-member committee to study the case while the Sheikh Said Rebellion was on the rise. Partly because of the continuing uncertainties along the northern frontier (present-day northern Iraq), the committee recommended that the region should be connected to Iraq with the condition that the UK would hold the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. By the end of March 1925, the necessary troop movements were completed, and the whole area of the Sheikh Said rebellion was encircled.<ref>Kinross, 401</ref> As a result of these manoeuvres, the revolt was put down. Britain, Iraq and Kemal made a treaty on 5 June 1926, which mostly followed the decisions of the League Council. In 1926, Kemal faced growing opposition to his reform policies, a continuing precarious economic situation, and a defeat in the Mosul issue. A large section of the Kurdish population and the [[Iraqi Turkmen]] were left on the other side of the border. The Sheikh Said Rebellion hastened both the imposition of the Republican Party and the speed of Atat\u00fcrk's reforms. In 1925, the population was largely illiterate and disparate. Turkey was in ruins, reconstruction was difficult, poverty was everywhere and people were in pain, which fed separatist violence.<ref>ASD: Speeches and statements by Atat\u00fcrk, volume I pages 361\u2013363 published by Atat\u00fcrk Culture, language and history Higher Institute, Ankara 1989</ref> Rather than to a section of the population, Atat\u00fcrk attributed the rebellion to a group of notables, who  on 7 March 1925 were found guilty by the courts (kanunen mucrim olan bazi muteneffizan) and who used the mask of religion to conceal the interests of landlords, feudal tribal leaders and other \"reactionaries\".<ref name=mangokurds20>Andrew Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk and the Kurds'', Middle Eastern Studies, Vol.35, No.4, 1999, 20</ref>\n\n====Relations with the Russian SFSR/Soviet Union====\n{{See also|Russia\u2013Turkey relations#Turkey and the Soviet Union }}\n[[File:Diplomatic reception held in the Soviet Embassy in Ankara 1927 cropped.jpg|thumb|During a reception at the [[USSR]] Embassy in Ankara, on 7 November 1927]]\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal and Voroshilov on 29 October 1933.jpg|thumb|Exchanges on the concept of a Balkan Federation during the visit of [[Kliment Voroshilov|Voroshilov]], a vision of Kemal's which was never achieved]]\n\nIn his message to [[Vladimir Lenin]], the Bolshevik leader and head of the [[Russian SFSR]]'s government, dated 26 April 1920, Kemal promised to coordinate his military operations with the Bolsheviks' \"fight against [[imperialist]] governments\" and requested 5 million [[Turkish lira|lira]] in gold as well as armaments \"as first aid\" to his forces.<ref name=\"LetterLenin\">''\u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c'' (the Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Foreign Minisrty]]'s magazine).

He encouraged [[Amanullah Khan]] in social and political reform but urged that reforms should build upon the basis of a strong government. During the late 1920s, Anglo-Afghan relations soured over British fears of an Afghan-Soviet friendship. On 20 May 1928, Anglo-Afghan politics gained a positive perspective, when Amanullah Khan and the Queen were received by Atat\u00fcrk in Constantinople. This meeting was followed by a Turkey-Afghanistan Friendship and Cooperation pact on 22 May 1928. Atat\u00fcrk supported Afghanistan's integration into international organizations.

In 1935, the draft of what would become the [[Treaty of Saadabad]] was paragraphed in Geneva, but the signing of it was delayed because of the [[Iran-Iraq border|border dispute between Iran and Iraq]]. Iran challenged the validity of both the Treaty of Erzerum and the Constantinople Protocol in 1934.\n\n[[File:Faisal I of Iraq and Mustafa Kemal Ankara Depot on 1931.jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk with King [[Faisal I of Iraq]] in Ankara, 1931]]\n\nOn 8 July 1937, Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan signed the [[Treaty of Saadabad|Saadabad Pact]] at [[Tehran]].

The treaty united the Afghan king's call for greater Oriental-Middle Eastern cooperation, Reza Shah's goal in securing relations with Turkey that would help Iran free itself from Soviet and British influence, and Atat\u00fcrk's foreign policy of securing stability in the region. The immediate outcome was to deter Mussolini from adventures in the region.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 510</ref>\n\n====Turkish Straits====\n[[File:King Edward VIII and President Kemal Atat\u00fcrk.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Atat\u00fcrk with King [[Edward VIII]] of the [[United Kingdom]] in [[Istanbul]], 4 September 1936]]\n\nOn 24 July 1923, the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]] included the Lausanne Straits Agreement. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the [[Dardanelles]] should remain open to all commercial vessels: seizure of foreign military vessels was subject to certain limitations during peacetime, and, even as a neutral state, Turkey could not limit any military passage during wartime. The Lausanne Straits Agreement stated that the waterway was to be demilitarized, and its management left to the Straits Commission. The demilitarized zone heavily restricted Turkey's domination and sovereignty over the Straits. The defence of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] was impossible without having the sovereignty over the water that passed through it.\n\nIn March 1936, Hitler's [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|reoccupation of the Rhineland]] gave Atat\u00fcrk the opportunity to resume full control over the Straits. \"The situation in Europe\", he declared \"is highly appropriate for such a move. We shall certainly achieve it\".<ref>Sosyal, Ismail, 1983, \"Turkey's Diplomatic treaties\", TTK, Ankara page 493</ref> [[Tevfik R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Aras]], who was the foreign minister, initiated a move to revise the Straits' regime. Aras claimed that he was directed by the President, rather than his Prime Minister, \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc. \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc was worried about harming relations with Britain, France, and Balkan neighbors over the Straits. However, the signatories agreed to join the conference, since unlimited military passage had become unfavourable to Turkey with the changes in world politics. Atat\u00fcrk demanded that the members of the Turkish Foreign Office devise a solution that would transfer full control over the waterway to Turkey.\n\nOn 20 July 1936, the [[Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits|Montreux Convention]] was signed, with the participation of Bulgaria, Great Britain, Australia, France, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Yugoslavia and Greece. It became the primary instrument governing the passage of commercial and war vessels through the Dardanelles Strait. It was ratified by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|GNAT]] on 31 July 1936. It went into effect on 9 November 1936 and is still valid today.\n\n====Balkan Pact====\n[[File:Alexander I of Yugoslavia and Mustafa Kemal in 1933.jpg|thumb|During the visit of King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] in 1931]]\n\nUntil the early 1930s, Turkey followed a modern neutral foreign policy with the West by developing joint friendship and neutrality agreements. These bilateral agreements were aligned with Atat\u00fcrk's worldview. By the end of 1925, Turkey had signed fifteen joint agreements with Western states.\n\nIn the early 1930s, changes and developments in world politics required Turkey to make multilateral agreements to improve its security. Atat\u00fcrk strongly believed that close cooperation between the Balkan states based on the principle of equality would have an important effect on European politics. These states had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire for centuries and had formed a powerful force. While the origins of the Balkan agreement may date back as far as 1925, the Balkan Pact came to being in the mid-1930s. Several important developments in the Balkan Peninsula and in Europe helped the original idea to materialize, such as improvements in the Turkish-Greek alliance and the rapprochement between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. The most important factor in driving Turkish foreign policy from the mid-1930s onwards was the fear of Italy. [[Benito Mussolini]] had frequently proclaimed his intention to make the entire Mediterranean ''[[Mare Nostrum]]''. Both the Turks and the various Balkan states felt threatened by Italian ambitions.\n\nThe [[Balkan Pact]] was negotiated by Atat\u00fcrk with Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This mutual-defence agreement intended to guarantee the signatories' territorial integrity and political independence against attack by another Balkan state such as Bulgaria or Albania. It countered the increasingly aggressive foreign policy of fascist Italy and the effect of a potential Bulgarian alignment with Nazi Germany. Atat\u00fcrk thought of the Balkan Pact as a medium of balance in the relations with the European countries.<ref>Yilmaz Altu\u00f0, \"Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Dis Politikas\u00fd,\" B.\u00dc.

It was regarded as a significant step forward in consolidating the free world's position in southeast Europe, although it contained no specific military commitments. The importance of the agreement was best displayed in the message which Atat\u00fcrk sent to the Greek Premier, [[Ioannis Metaxas]]:\n\n{{bquote|The borders of the allies in the Balkan Pact are a single border. Those who covet this border will encounter the burning beams of the sun. I recommend avoiding this. The forces that defend our borders are a single and inseparable force.<ref>Atat\u00fcrk'\u00fcn Milli D\u00fd\u00fe Politikas\u00fd, Vol. 2, p. 355</ref>}}\n\nIt was signed by GNA on 28 February The Greek and Yugoslav Parliaments ratified the agreement a few days after. The unanimously ratified Balkan pact became a reality on 18 May 1935 and lasted until 1940.\n\nThe Balkan Pact turned out to be ineffective for reasons that were beyond Atat\u00fcrk's control. What he wanted to prevent with the Balkan Pact was realized by Bulgaria's attempt to put the [[Dobruja]] issue into the agenda after a series of international events ending with the [[Italian invasion of Albania]] on 7 April 1939. These [[Causes of World War II|conflicts]] spread rapidly, triggering World War II. The goal of Atat\u00fcrk, to protect southeast Europe, failed with the dissolution of the pact. The only state which arose intact after the war was Atat\u00fcrk's Republic of Turkey.\n\n====Issue of Hatay====\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Kemal Ataturk congratulation of the Hatay's decision.png|thumb|Telegram sent by Atat\u00fcrk after the local legislative assembly accepted his proposal for the [[Hatay State]]'s flag]]\n\nTurkish Prime-Minister [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] was very conscious of foreign policy issues. During the second half of the 1930s, Atat\u00fcrk tried to form a closer relationship with Britain. The risks of this policy change put the two men at odds. The Hatay issue and the Lyon agreement were two important developments in foreign policy that played a significant role in the severing of relations between Atat\u00fcrk and \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc.\n\nIn 1936, Atat\u00fcrk raised the \"Issue of Hatay\" at the League of Nations. [[Hatay State|Hatay]] was based on the old administrative unit of the Ottoman Empire called the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]]. On behalf of the League of Nations, the representatives of France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and Turkey prepared a constitution for Hatay, which established it as an autonomous [[sanjak]] within Syria. Despite some inter-ethnic violence, in the midst of 1938 an election was conducted by the local legislative assembly. The cities of [[Antakya]] (Antioch) and [[\u0130skenderun]] (Alexandretta) joined Turkey in 1939.\n\n===Economic policies===\n:''For conceptual analysis, see [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms#Economic reforms|Economic reforms]]''\nAtat\u00fcrk instigated economic policies to develop small and large scale businesses, but also to create social strata (industrial bourgeoisie along with the [[peasantry]] of Anatolia) that were virtually non-existent during the Ottoman Empire. The primary problem faced by the politics of his period was the lag in the development of political institutions and social classes which would steer such social and economic changes.<ref>Huntington, ''Political Order in Changing Societies'', 347\u2013357</ref> His vision regarding early Turkish economic policy was apparent during the [[\u0130zmir Economic Congress]] of 1923 which was established before the signing of the [[Lausanne Treaty]]. The initial choices of his economic policies reflected the realities of his period. After World War I, due to the lack of any real potential investors to open private sector factories and develop industrial production, Atat\u00fcrk established many state-owned factories for agriculture, machinery, and textile industries.\n\n====State intervention, 1923\u20131929====\n{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--last 3 paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[File:Atat\u00fcrk Nazilli Basma Fabrikas\u0131'n\u0131n a\u00e7\u0131l\u0131\u015f\u0131nda (1937).jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk and [[Cel\u00e2l Bayar]] visiting the S\u00fcmerbank Nazilli Cotton Factory, which was established as a part of the cotton-related industry]]\n\nAtat\u00fcrk's and [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]]'s pursuit of state-controlled economic policies was guided by a national vision; their goal was to knit the country together, eliminate the foreign control of the economy, and improve communications within Turkey.

[[Turkish tobacco]] was an important industrial crop, while its cultivation and manufacture had been French monopolies under [[capitulations of the Ottoman Empire]]. The tobacco and cigarette trade was controlled by two French companies: the \"[[Regie Company]]\" and \"Narquileh Tobacco\".<ref>Shaw, ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey'', 232\u2013233.</ref> The Ottoman Empire had given the tobacco monopoly to the [[Ottoman Bank]] as a limited company under the \"[[Ottoman Public Debt Administration|Council of the Public Debt]]\". Regie, as part of the Council of the Public Debt, had control over production, storing, and distribution (including export) with unchallenged price control. Consequently, Turkish farmers were dependent on the company for their livelihood.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |title = T\u00fct\u00fcn, \u0130\u00e7ki ve Tekel |language = Turkish |date = 29 January 2003 |accessdate = 10 October 2007 |last = Aysu |first = Abdullah |publisher = B\u0130A Haber Merkezi |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071015212242/http://bianet.org/2003/01/30/16340.htm |archivedate = 15 October 2007 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> In 1925, this company was taken over by the state and named \"[[Tekel]]\". The control of tobacco was the biggest achievement of the Kemalist political machinery's \"[[nationalization]]\" of the economy for a country that did not produce oil. They accompanied this achievement with the development of the cotton industry, which peaked during the early 1930s. Cotton was the second biggest industrial crop in Turkey at the time.\n\nIn 1924, with the initiative of Atat\u00fcrk, the first Turkish bank [[\u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131]] was established. He was the first member of \u0130\u015f Bankas\u0131. The bank's creation was a response to the growing need for a truly national establishment and the birth of a banking system which was capable of backing up economic activities, managing funds accumulated as a result of policies providing savings incentives, and, where necessary, extending resources which could trigger industrial impetus.\n\nIn 1927, [[Turkish State Railways]] was established. Because Atat\u00fcrk considered the development of a national [[Rail transport|rail network]] as another important step in industrialization, it was given high priority. This institution developed an extensive railway network in a very short time. In 1927, Kemal also ordered the integration of road construction goals into development plans. Prior to this, the road network had consisted of 13,885&nbsp; km of ruined surface roads, 4,450&nbsp; km of stabilized roads, and 94 bridges. In 1935, a new entity was established under the government called \"\u015eose ve K\u00f6pr\u00fcler Reisli\u011fi\" which would drive the development of new roads after World War II. However, in 1937, the 22,000&nbsp; km of roads in Turkey augmented the railways.\n\nThe national group{{Clarify|date=December 2008}}, which had Atat\u00fcrk as the leader, developed many projects within the first decade of the republic. However, the Turkish economy was still largely agrarian, with primitive tools and methods; roads and transportation facilities were far from sufficient and management of the economy was inefficient. The [[Great Depression]] brought many changes to this picture.\n\n====Great Depression, 1929\u20131931====\n[[File:Mustafa Kemal surveying the model of the quarter of Ministries.jpg|thumb|Atat\u00fcrk supported large-scale government subsidized industrial complexes, such as [[S\u00fcmerbank]], increasingly after the [[Great Depression]].]]\nThe young republic, like the rest of the world, found itself in a deep economic crisis during the [[Great Depression]]. Atat\u00fcrk reacted to conditions of this period by moving toward integrated economic policies and establishing a central bank to control exchange rates. However, Turkey could not finance essential imports; its currency was shunned and zealous revenue officials seized the meagre possessions of peasants who could not pay their taxes.<ref name=mango470/>\n\nIn 1929, Atat\u00fcrk signed a treaty that resulted in the [[debt restructuring|restructuring of the nation's debt]] with the [[Ottoman Public Debt Administration]]. He did not fault the Ottoman debt. He had to deal with the turbulent economic issues of the Great Depression along with the payment of the high debt known as the [[Ottoman public debt]]. Until the early 1930s, Turkish private business could not acquire exchange credits. It was impossible to integrate the Turkish economy without a solution to this problem. This increased the credibility of the new Republic.\n\nIn 1931, Atat\u00fcrk's goal of establishing the [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey]] was realized. The bank's primary purpose was to have control over the exchange rate and [[Ottoman Bank]]'s role during its initial years as a central bank was phased out. Later specialized banks such as the [[S\u00fcmerbank]] (1932) and the [[Etibank]] (1935) were founded.\n\nFrom the [[political economy]] perspective, Atat\u00fcrk had to face the same problems which all countries faced: political upheaval. The establishment of a new party with a different economic perspective was needed; he asked Ali Fethi Okyar to fulfil. The [[Liberal Republican Party (Turkey)|Liberal Republican Party]] (August 1930) came out with a liberal program and proposed that state monopolies should be ended, foreign capital should be attracted, and that state investment should be curtailed. Atat\u00fcrk supported \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc's point of view: \"it is impossible to attract foreign capital for essential development.\" In 1931, he proclaimed: \"In the economic area ...the programme of the party is statism.\"<ref>Ibrahim Kaya, Social Theory and Later Modernities, page 90</ref> However, the effect of free republicans was felt strongly and state intervention became more moderate, more akin to a form of [[state capitalism]]. One of his radical left-wing supporters, [[Yakup Kadri Karaosmano\u011flu]] from the [[Kadro]] (The Cadre) movement, claimed that Atat\u00fcrk found a third way between capitalism and socialism.<ref>Mango, ''Atat\u00fcrk'', 478</ref>\n\n====Liberalization and planned growth, 1931\u20131939====\n[[File:1932 Mustafa Kemal Etimesgut airport.png|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Atat\u00fcrk at the Etimesgut Airport in [[Ankara]], built by the [[Turkish Aeronautical Association|Turkish Aircraft Association]].

The technique has been used in many fields to remove a [[wikt:background|background]] from the subject of a photo or video \u2013 particularly the [[news]]casting, [[motion picture]], and [[video game]] industries. A colour range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in [[video production]] and post-production. This technique is also referred to as '''colour keying''', '''colour-separation overlay''' ('''CSO'''; primarily by the [[BBC]]<ref name=\"What is Chroma Key?\">{{cite web |url=http://lumeo.com.au/chroma-key/ |title=What is Chroma Key?|publisher=Lumeo |access-date=3 July 2014}}</ref>), or by various terms for specific colour-related variants such as '''green screen''', '''blue screen''' and '''magic pink'''; chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any colour that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from [[human skin colour]]s. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the colour used as the backing, otherwise, the part may be erroneously identified as part of the backing.<ref name=\"BorisFX\" />\n\nIt is commonly used for [[weather forecasting|weather forecast]] [[broadcast]]s, wherein a [[news presenter]] is usually seen standing in front of a large [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] map during live television [[newscast]]s, though in actuality it is a large blue or green background. When using a blue screen, different weather maps are added on the parts of the image where the colour is blue. If the news presenter wears blue clothes, his or her clothes will also be replaced with the background video. Chroma keying is also common in the entertainment industry for visual effects in [[movies]] and video games. [[Rotoscopy]] may instead be carried out on subjects that aren't in front of a green (or blue) screen. [[Motion tracking]] can also be used in conjunction with chroma keying, for example to move the background as the subject moves.\n\n==History==\n\n===Predecessors===\n\nPrior to the introduction of [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling mattes]] and [[optical printer|optical printing]], [[double exposure]] was used to introduce elements into a scene which were not present in the initial exposure. This was done using black draping where a green screen would be used today. [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] first used this approach in 1898. In 1903, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]] used double exposure to add background scenes to windows which were black when filmed on set, using a [[garbage matte]] to expose only the window areas.<ref>{{cite book | title=Experimental Filmmaking: Break the Machine | author=Kathryn Ramey | page=70 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYRICgAAQBAJ&pg=PA70| isbn=9781136071508 | date=2015-07-30 }}</ref>\n\nIn order to have figures in one exposure actually move in front of a substituted background in the other, a travelling matte was needed, to occlude the correct portion of the background in each frame. In 1918 [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank Williams]] patented a travelling matte technique, again based on using a black background. This was used in many films, such as ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|4}}\n\nIn the 1920s, [[Walt Disney]] used a white backdrop to include human actors with cartoon characters and backgrounds in his ''[[Alice Comedies]]''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|5}}\n\n===Bluescreen===\nThe blue screen method was developed in the 1930s at [[RKO Radio Pictures]].  At RKO, [[Linwood Dunn]] used an early version of the [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling matte]] to create \"wipes\" \u2013 where there were transitions like a windshield wiper in films such as ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933). Credited to [[Lawrence W. Butler|Larry Butler]], a scene featuring a genie escaping from a bottle was the first use of a proper bluescreen process to create a traveling matte for ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Award for Best Special Effects]] that year. In 1950, [[Warner Brothers]] employee and ex-[[Kodak]] researcher [[Arthur Widmer]] began working on an [[ultraviolet]] travelling matte process. He also began developing bluescreen techniques: one of the first films to use them was the [[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|1958 adaptation]] of the [[Ernest Hemingway]] novella, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', starring [[Spencer Tracy]].<ref name=\"cri\">{{cite web|url=http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90@206385.htm|title=Illusions Take Home First Oscars|date=14 February 2005|publisher=[[China Radio International|CRI English]]|accessdate=21 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315004609/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90%40206385.htm|archivedate=15 March 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Petro Vlahos]] was awarded an Academy Award for his refinement of these techniques in 1964. His technique exploits the fact that most objects in real-world scenes have a colour whose blue-colour component is similar in intensity to their green-colour component. [[Zbigniew Rybczy\u0144ski]] also contributed to bluescreen technology. An [[optical printer]] with two projectors, a film camera and a 'beam splitter', was used to combine the actor in front of a blue screen together with the background footage, one frame at a time. In the early 1970s, American and British television networks began using green backdrops instead of blue for their newscasts. During the 1980s, [[minicomputer]]s were used to control the optical printer. For the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Richard Edlund]] created a 'quad optical printer' that accelerated the process considerably and saved money. He received a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his innovation.\n\nFor decades, travelling matte shots had to be done \"locked-down\", so that neither the matted subject nor the background could shift their camera perspective at all.  Later, computer-timed, [[Motion control photography|motion-control]] cameras alleviated this problem, as both the foreground and background could be filmed with the same camera moves.\n\nMeteorologists on television often use a field monitor, to the side of the screen, to see where they are putting their hands against the background images. A newer technique is to project a faint image onto the screen.\n\nSome films make heavy use of chroma key to add backgrounds that are constructed entirely using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). Performances from different takes can be composited together, which allows actors to be filmed separately and then placed together in the same scene. Chroma key allows performers to appear to be in any location without leaving the studio. \nComputer development also made it easier to [[camera tracking|incorporate motion]] into composited shots, even when using handheld cameras. Reference-points can be placed onto the coloured background (usually as a painted grid, X's marked with tape, or equally spaced tennis balls attached to the wall).  In post-production, a computer can use the references to compute the camera's position and thus render an image that matches the perspective and movement of the foreground perfectly.  Modern advances in software and computational power have eliminated the need to accurately place the markers \u2013 the software figures out their position in space (a disadvantage of this is that it requires a large camera movement, possibly encouraging modern film techniques where the camera is always in motion).\n\n==Process==\n[[File:SpiderwickChroniclesSet.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Film set for ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)|The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', where a visual effects scene using bluescreen chroma key is in preparation]]\n\nThe principal subject is filmed or photographed against a background consisting of a single colour or a relatively narrow range of colours, usually blue or green because these colours are considered to be the furthest away from skin tone.<ref name=\"BorisFX\">{{cite web|url=http://www.borisfx.com/tutorials/chroma_key.php|title=The Chroma Effect|work=Chroma Key Tutorial|publisher=BorisFX|quote=If the foreground is a person then blue or green backing colour is recommended as these colours are not present in human flesh pigments.

This process is commonly known as \"[[keying (graphics)|keying]]\", \"keying out\" or simply a \"key\".\n\n===Processing a green backdrop===\n[[File:VirtuellesStudio Greenbox.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Virtual television studio with green-screen technique. The high amount of contrast between different parts of the screen is not ideal (see [[Chroma key#Even lighting|even lighting]]). Green reflections from the desk would create undesirable artifacts.]]\n\nGreen is used as a backdrop for TV and electronic cinematography more than any other colour because television weathermen tended to wear blue suits. When chroma keying first came into use in television production, the blue screen that was then the norm in the movie industry was used out of habit, until other practical considerations caused the television industry to move from blue to green screens. Broadcast quality colour television cameras use separate red, green and blue image sensors, and early analog TV chroma keyers required RGB component video to work reliably. From a technological perspective it was equally possible to use the blue or green channel, but because blue clothing was an ongoing challenge, the green screen came into common use. Newscasters sometimes forget the chroma key dress code, and when the key is applied to clothing of the same colour as the background, the person would seem to disappear into the key. Because green clothing is less common than blue, it soon became apparent that it was easier to use a green matte screen than it was to constantly police the clothing choices of on-air talent.   Also, because the human eye is more sensitive to green wavelengths, which lie in the middle of the visible light spectrum, the green analog video channel typically carried more signal strength, giving a better signal to noise ratio compared to the other component video channels, so green screen keys could produce the cleanest key. In the digital television and cinema age, much of the tweaking that was required to make a good quality key has been automated. However, the one constant that remains is some level of colour coordination to keep foreground subjects from being keyed out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.videomaker.com/article/f5/13055-the-keys-to-chromakey-how-to-use-a-green-screen |title=The Keys To Chromakey: How To Use A Green Screen|publisher=Videomaker |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Processing a blue backdrop===\nBefore electronic chroma keying, compositing was done on (chemical) film. The camera colour negative was printed onto high-contrast black and white negative, using either a filter or the high contrast film's colour sensitivity to expose only blue (and higher) frequencies. Blue light only shines through the colour negative where there is ''not'' blue in the scene, so this left the film clear where the blue screen was, and opaque elsewhere, except it also produced clear for any white objects (since they also contained blue). Removing these spots could be done by a suitable double-exposure with the colour positive (thus turning any area containing red or green opaque), and many other techniques. The end result was film that was clear where the blue screen was, and opaque everywhere else. This is called a ''female matte'', similar to an ''[[alpha matte]]'' in digital keying. Copying this film onto another high-contrast negative produced the opposite ''male matte''. The background negative was then packed with the female matte and exposed onto a final strip of film, then the camera negative was packed with the male matte was double-printed onto this same film. These two images combined together creates the final effect.\n\n===Major factors===\nThe most important factor for a key is the colour separation of the foreground (the subject) and background (the screen)&nbsp;\u2013 a blue screen will be used if the subject is predominantly green (for example plants), despite the camera being more sensitive to green light.\n\nIn [[Analog television|analog color TV]], colour is represented by the phase of the chroma [[Subcarrier#Television|subcarrier]] relative to a reference oscillator. Chroma key is achieved by comparing the phase of the video to the phase corresponding to the pre-selected colour. In-phase portions of the video are replaced by the alternate background video.\n\nIn [[Digital television|digital color TV]], colour is represented by three numbers (red, green, blue intensity levels). Chroma key is achieved by a simple numerical comparison between the video and the pre-selected colour. If the colour at a particular point on the screen matches (either exactly, or in a range), then the video at that point is replaced by the alternate background.\n\n====Lighting====\nIn order to create an illusion that characters and objects filmed are present in the intended background scene, the lighting in the two scenes must be a reasonable match. For outdoor scenes, overcast days create a diffuse, evenly coloured light which can be easier to match in the studio, whereas direct sunlight needs to be matched in both direction and overall colour based on time of day.\n\nA studio shot taken in front of a green screen will naturally have ambient light the same colour as the screen, due to its light scattering. This effect is known as ''spill''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|p20}} This can look unnatural or cause portions of the characters to disappear, so must be compensated for, or avoided by using a larger screen placed far from the actors.<ref>{{Cite book |last1= Aronson |first1= David |authorlink1= David Aronson |title= DV Filmmaking: From Start to Finish, Volume 1 |year= 2006 |publisher= O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn= 978-0596008482 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/dvfilmmakingfrom0000aron/page/52 52\u201353] |url= https://archive.org/details/dvfilmmakingfrom0000aron/page/52 }}</ref>\n\n====Camera====\nThe depth of field used to record the scene in front of the coloured screen should match that of the background.

An example of intentional use of this is when an actor wears a blue covering over a part of his body to make it invisible in the final shot. This technique can be used to achieve an effect similar to that used in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films to create the effect of an [[Cloak of invisibility|invisibility cloak]]. The actor can also be filmed against a chroma-key background and inserted into the background shot with a distortion effect, in order to create a cloak that is marginally detectable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.creativecow.net/articles/stern_eran/Invisible_Cape.php |title=Creating an invisible cape in After Effects |publisher=Library.creativecow.net |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDifficulties emerge with blue screen when a costume in an effects shot must be blue, such as [[Superman]]'s traditional blue outfit.  In the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', in scenes where both [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Green Goblin]] are in the air, Spider-Man had to be shot in front of the green screen and the Green Goblin had to be shot in front of a blue screen. The colour difference is because Spider-Man wears a costume which is red and blue in colour and the Green Goblin wears a costume which is entirely green in colour. If both were shot in front of the same screen, parts of one character would be erased from the shot.\n\nFor a clean division of foreground from background, it is also important that clothing and hair in the foreground shot have a fairly simple silhouette, as fine details such as frizzy hair may not resolve properly. Similarly, partially transparent elements of the costume cause problems.<ref name=\"bermingham\" />\n\n==Background colour==\n[[File:MuseumOfScienceBoston BlueScreenAtSpecialEffectsShow.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Demonstration of the creation of visual effects techniques utilizing chroma key]]\n\n[[Blue]] was originally used for TV chroma keying [[special effects]] because the film industry used blue backgrounds for similar purposes. The colour blue was tied to the blue emulsion layer of film having comparable grain and detail in comparison to the red and [[green]] layers of the emulsion. In television and digital filmmaking, however, green has become the favoured colour because of some practical considerations, and because [[lossy compression]] algorithms used in both analog and digital TV distribution retain more detail in the green channel. The choice of colour is up to the effects artists and the needs of the specific shot. Whereas the blue screen was introduced to the television industry by the film industry, the use of green screen visual effects has been introduced to the film industry as electronic imaging has augmented and replaced the use of chemical film stock in cinema. Also, the green background is favoured over blue for outdoor filming where the blue sky might appear in the frame and could accidentally be replaced in the process. Although green and blue are the most common in part because red, green and blue components are used to encode the visible light spectrum, any key colour can be used. Red is avoided for human subjects due to its prevalence in white skin tones, but can be often used for objects and scenes which do not involve people.\n\nA so-called \"[[Sodium vapor process|yellow screen]]\" is accomplished with a white backdrop. Ordinary stage lighting is used in combination with a bright yellow sodium lamp. The sodium light falls almost entirely in a narrow frequency band, which can then be separated from the other light using a prism, and projected onto a separate but synchronized film carrier within the camera. This second film is high-contrast black and white, and is processed to produce the matte.<ref name=Foster>{{cite book | title=The Green Screen Handbook: Real-World Production Techniques | first=Jeff | last=Foster | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-470-52107-6}}</ref>{{rp|16}}\n\nOccasionally, a [[magenta]] background is used, as in some software applications where the magenta or [[fuchsia (color)|fuchsia]] is sometimes referred to as \"magic pink\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.skinyourscreen.com/site/Articles/so-you-wanna-make-a-theme | title = So you wanna make a theme? | work = skinyourscreen.com articles | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071029042547/http://www.skinyourscreen.com/site/Articles/so-you-wanna-make-a-theme | archivedate = 29 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA newer technique is to use a [[retroreflective]] curtain in the background, along with a ring of bright [[LED]]s around the [[camera lens]].  This requires no light to shine on the background other than the LEDs, which use an extremely small amount of power and space unlike big [[stage light]]s, and require no [[rigging (theatre)|rigging]].  This advance was made possible by the invention in the 1990s of practical blue LEDs, which also allow for [[Emerald (color)|emerald green]] LEDs.\n\nThere is also a form of colour keying that uses light spectrum invisible to human eye.

First the background is captured without actors or other foreground elements; then the scene is recorded. The image of the background is used to cancel the background in the actual footage; for example in a digital image, each pixel will have a different chroma key. This is sometimes referred to as a ''difference matte''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&pg=SA2-PA23&lpg=SA2-PA23&vq=%22difference+matte%22&dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&q=%22difference%20matte%22&f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=27}}</ref> However, this makes it easy for objects to be accidentally removed if they happen to be similar to the background, or for the background to remain due to camera noise or if it happens to change slightly from the reference footage.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&pg=SA2-PA25&lpg=SA2-PA25&vq=%22difference+matte%22&dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&q=%22difference%20matte%22&f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=29}}</ref> A background with a repeating pattern alleviates many of these issues, and can be less sensitive to wardrobe colour than solid-colour backdrops.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Every colour chromakey | first1= Atsushi | last1=Yamashita | first2=Hiroki | last2=Agata | first3=Toru | last3=Kaneko | doi = 10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761643 | journal=Icpr 2008 | pages= 1\u20134 | year=2008| isbn= 978-1-4244-2174-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Tolerances==\n\n===Even lighting===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Myx tv.jpg|thumb|right|267px|A live broadcast of [[Myx TV]] using green-screen chroma key. Note the lack of shadows on the screen. The whiter area near the center of the image is due to the angle this photo was taken from, and would not appear from the video camera's angle.]]\n\nThe biggest challenge when setting up a bluescreen or greenscreen is even lighting and the avoidance of [[shadow]], because it is best to have as narrow a colour range as possible being replaced. A shadow would present itself as a darker colour to the camera and might not register for replacement. This can sometimes be seen in low-budget or live broadcasts where the errors cannot be manually repaired. The material being used affects the quality and ease of having it evenly lit. Materials which are shiny will be far less successful than those that are not. A shiny surface will have areas that reflect the lights making them appear pale, while other areas may be darkened. A matte surface will diffuse the reflected light and have a more even colour range. In order to get the cleanest key from shooting greenscreen it is necessary to create a value difference between the subject and the greenscreen. In order to differentiate the subject from the screen, a two-stop difference can be used, either by making the greenscreen two stops higher than the subject, or vice versa.\n\nSometimes a shadow can be used to create a visual effect.  Areas of the bluescreen or greenscreen with a shadow on them can be replaced with a darker version of the desired background video image, making it look like the person is casting a shadow on them. Any spill of the chroma key colour will make the result look unnatural. A difference in the [[focal length]] of the lenses used can affect the success of chroma key.\n\n===Exposure===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}Another challenge for bluescreen or greenscreen is proper [[camera exposure]]. Underexposing or overexposing a coloured backdrop can lead to poor [[Colorfulness|saturation]] levels. In the case of video cameras, underexposed images can contain high amounts of [[image noise|noise]], as well. The background must be bright enough to allow the camera to create a bright and saturated image.\n\n==Programming==\nThere are several different quality- and speed-optimised techniques for implementing colour keying in software.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/~michael/chroma/ | title = High Quality Chroma Key | last=Ashihkmin |first=Michael|publisher = University of Utah}}</ref><ref name=\"gcfilms\">{{cite web | url = http://gc-films.com/chromakey.html | title=Greenscreen code and hints | first=Edward | last=Cannon}}</ref>\n\nIn most versions, a function ''f''(''r'', ''g'', ''b'') \u2192 ''\u03b1'' is applied to every pixel in the image. \u03b1&nbsp;(alpha) has a meaning similar to that in [[alpha compositing]] techniques. ''\u03b1''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;0 means the pixel is fully in the green screen, ''\u03b1''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1 means the pixel is fully in the foreground object, and intermediate values indicate the pixel is partially covered by the foreground object (or it is transparent). A further function ''g''(''r'',&nbsp;''g'',&nbsp;''b'')&nbsp;\u2192 (''r'',&nbsp;''g'',&nbsp;''b'') is needed to remove green spill on the foreground objects.\n\nA very simple ''f''() function for green screen is ''A''(''r''+''b'') \u2212 ''Bg'' where ''A'' and ''B'' are user adjustable constants with a default value of 1.0. A very simple ''g''() is (''r'', min(''g'',''b''), ''b''). This is fairly close to the capabilities of analog and film-based screen pulling.\n\nModern examples<ref name=\"gcfilms\" /> of these functions are best described by two closed nested surfaces in  3-D rgb space, often quite complex. Colours inside the inner surface are considered green screen. Colours outside the outer surface are opaque foreground. Colours between the surfaces are partially covered, they are more opaque the closer they are to the outer surface. Sometimes more closed surfaces are used to determine how to remove green spill. It is also very common for ''f''() to depend on more than just the current pixel's colour, it may also use the (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') position, the values of nearby pixels, the value from reference images or a statistical colour model of the scene,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Interactive High-Quality Green-Screen Keying via Colour Unmixing | first1=Yagiz | last1=Aksoy | first2=Tunc| last2=Aydin | first3=Marc| last3=Pollefeys | first4=Aljoscha | last4=Smolic | journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics  | volume=36 | issue=4 | pages=1 | year=2016| doi=10.1145/3072959.2907940 }}</ref> and values from user-drawn masks.

The technique has been used in many fields to remove a [[wikt:background|background]] from the subject of a photo or video \u2013 particularly the [[news]]casting, [[motion picture]], and [[video game]] industries. A colour range in the foreground footage is made transparent, allowing separately filmed background footage or a static image to be inserted into the scene. The chroma keying technique is commonly used in [[video production]] and post-production. This technique is also referred to as '''colour keying''', '''colour-separation overlay''' ('''CSO'''; primarily by the [[BBC]]<ref name=\"What is Chroma Key?\">{{cite web |url=http://lumeo.com.au/chroma-key/ |title=What is Chroma Key?|publisher=Lumeo |access-date=3 July 2014}}</ref>), or by various terms for specific colour-related variants such as '''green screen''', '''blue screen''' and '''magic pink'''; chroma keying can be done with backgrounds of any colour that are uniform and distinct, but green and blue backgrounds are more commonly used because they differ most distinctly in hue from [[human skin colour]]s. No part of the subject being filmed or photographed may duplicate the colour used as the backing, otherwise, the part may be erroneusly identified as part of the backing.<ref name=\"BorisFX\" />\n\nIt is commonly used for [[weather forecasting|weather forecast]] [[broadcast]]s, wherein a [[news presenter]] is usually seen standing in front of a large [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] map during live television [[newscast]]s, though in actuality it is a large blue or green background. When using a blue screen, different weather maps are added on the parts of the image where the colour is blue. If the news presenter wears blue clothes, his or her clothes will also be replaced with the background video. Chroma keying is also common in the entertainment industry for visual effects in [[movies]] and video games. [[Rotoscopy]] may instead be carried out on subjects that aren't in front of a green (or blue) screen. [[Motion tracking]] can also be used in conjuntion with chroma keying, for example to move the background as the subject moves.\n\n==History==\n\n===Predecessors===\n\nPrior to the introduction of [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling mattes]] and [[optical printer|optical printing]], [[double exposure]] was used to introduce elements into a scene which were not present in the initial exposure. This was done using black draping where a green screen would be used today. [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] first used this approach in 1898. In 1903, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]] used double exposure to add background scenes to windows which were black when filmed on set, using a [[garbage matte]] to expose only the window areas.<ref>{{cite book | title=Experimental Filmmaking: Break the Machine | author=Kathryn Ramey | page=70 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYRICgAAQBAJ&pg=PA70| isbn=9781136071508 | date=2015-07-30 }}</ref>\n\nIn order to have figures in one exposure actually move in front of a substituted background in the other, a travelling matte was needed, to occlude the correct portion of the background in each frame. In 1918 [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank Williams]] patented a travelling matte technique, again based on using a black background. This was used in many films, such as ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|4}}\n\nIn the 1920s, [[Walt Disney]] used a white backdrop to include human actors with cartoon characters and backgrounds in his ''[[Alice Comedies]]''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|5}}\n\n===Bluescreen===\nThe blue screen method was developed in the 1930s at [[RKO Radio Pictures]].  At RKO, [[Linwood Dunn]] used an early version of the [[Matte (filmmaking)|travelling matte]] to create \"wipes\" \u2013 where there were transitions like a windshield wiper in films such as ''[[Flying Down to Rio]]'' (1933). Credited to [[Lawrence W. Butler|Larry Butler]], a scene featuring a genie escaping from a bottle was the first use of a proper bluescreen process to create a traveling matte for ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1940 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1940), which won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Academy Award for Best Special Effects]] that year. In 1950, [[Warner Brothers]] employee and ex-[[Kodak]] researcher [[Arthur Widmer]] began working on an [[ultraviolet]] travelling matte process. He also began developing bluescreen techniques: one of the first films to use them was the [[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|1958 adaptation]] of the [[Ernest Hemingway]] novella, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', starring [[Spencer Tracy]].<ref name=\"cri\">{{cite web|url=http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90@206385.htm|title=Illusions Take Home First Oscars|date=14 February 2005|publisher=[[China Radio International|CRI English]]|accessdate=21 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315004609/http://en.chinabroadcast.cn/2246/2005-2-14/90%40206385.htm|archivedate=15 March 2005|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Petro Vlahos]] was awarded an Academy Award for his refinement of these techniques in 1964. His technique exploits the fact that most objects in real-world scenes have a colour whose blue-colour component is similar in intensity to their green-colour component. [[Zbigniew Rybczy\u0144ski]] also contributed to bluescreen technology. An [[optical printer]] with two projectors, a film camera and a 'beam splitter', was used to combine the actor in front of a blue screen together with the background footage, one frame at a time. In the early 1970s, American and British television networks began using green backdrops instead of blue for their newscasts. During the 1980s, [[minicomputer]]s were used to control the optical printer. For the film ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Richard Edlund]] created a 'quad optical printer' that accelerated the process considerably and saved money. He received a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his innovation.\n\nFor decades, travelling matte shots had to be done \"locked-down\", so that neither the matted subject nor the background could shift their camera perspective at all.  Later, computer-timed, [[Motion control photography|motion-control]] cameras alleviated this problem, as both the foreground and background could be filmed with the same camera moves.\n\nMeteorologists on television often use a field monitor, to the side of the screen, to see where they are putting their hands against the background images. A newer technique is to project a faint image onto the screen.\n\nSome films make heavy use of chroma key to add backgrounds that are constructed entirely using [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). Performances from different takes can be composited together, which allows actors to be filmed separately and then placed together in the same scene. Chroma key allows performers to appear to be in any location without leaving the studio. \nComputer development also made it easier to [[camera tracking|incorporate motion]] into composited shots, even when using handheld cameras. Reference-points can be placed onto the coloured background (usually as a painted grid, X's marked with tape, or equally spaced tennis balls attached to the wall).  In post-production, a computer can use the references to compute the camera's position and thus render an image that matches the perspective and movement of the foreground perfectly.  Modern advances in software and computational power have eliminated the need to accurately place the markers \u2013 the software figures out their position in space (a disadvantage of this is that it requires a large camera movement, possibly encouraging modern film techniques where the camera is always in motion).\n\n==Process==\n[[File:SpiderwickChroniclesSet.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Film set for ''[[The Spiderwick Chronicles (film)|The Spiderwick Chronicles]]'', where a visual effects scene using bluescreen chroma key is in preparation]]\n\nThe principal subject is filmed or photographed against a background consisting of a single colour or a relatively narrow range of colours, usually blue or green because these colours are considered to be the furthest away from skin tone.<ref name=\"BorisFX\">{{cite web|url=http://www.borisfx.com/tutorials/chroma_key.php|title=The Chroma Effect|work=Chroma Key Tutorial|publisher=BorisFX|quote=If the foreground is a person then blue or green backing colour is recommended as these colours are not present in human flesh pigments.

This process is commonly known as \"[[keying (graphics)|keying]]\", \"keying out\" or simply a \"key\".\n\n===Processing a green backdrop===\n[[File:VirtuellesStudio Greenbox.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Virtual television studio with green-screen technique. The high amount of contrast between different parts of the screen is not ideal (see [[Chroma key#Even lighting|even lighting]]). Green reflections from the desk would create undesirable artifacts.]]\n\nGreen is used as a backdrop for TV and electronic cinematography more than any other colour because television weathermen tended to wear blue suits. When chroma keying first came into use in television production, the blue screen that was then the norm in the movie industry was used out of habit, until other practical considerations caused the television industry to move from blue to green screens. Broadcast quality colour television cameras use separate red, green and blue image sensors, and early analog TV chroma keyers required RGB component video to work reliably. From a technological perspective it was equally possible to use the blue or green channel, but because blue clothing was an ongoing challenge, the green screen came into common use. Newscasters sometimes forget the chroma key dress code, and when the key is applied to clothing of the same colour as the background, the person would seem to disappear into the key. Because green clothing is less common than blue, it soon became apparent that it was easier to use a green matte screen than it was to constantly police the clothing choices of on-air talent.   Also, because the human eye is more sensitive to green wavelengths, which lie in the middle of the visible light spectrum, the green analog video channel typically carried more signal strength, giving a better signal to noise ratio compared to the other component video channels, so green screen keys could produce the cleanest key. In the digital television and cinema age, much of the tweaking that was required to make a good quality key has been automated. However, the one constant that remains is some level of colour coordination to keep foreground subjects from being keyed out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.videomaker.com/article/f5/13055-the-keys-to-chromakey-how-to-use-a-green-screen |title=The Keys To Chromakey: How To Use A Green Screen|publisher=Videomaker |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Processing a blue backdrop===\nBefore electronic chroma keying, compositing was done on (chemical) film. The camera colour negative was printed onto high-contrast black and white negative, using either a filter or the high contrast film's colour sensitivity to expose only blue (and higher) frequencies. Blue light only shines through the colour negative where there is ''not'' blue in the scene, so this left the film clear where the blue screen was, and opaque elsewhere, except it also produced clear for any white objects (since they also contained blue). Removing these spots could be done by a suitable double-exposure with the colour positive (thus turning any area containing red or green opaque), and many other techniques. The end result was film that was clear where the blue screen was, and opaque everywhere else. This is called a ''female matte'', similar to an ''[[alpha matte]]'' in digital keying. Copying this film onto another high-contrast negative produced the opposite ''male matte''. The background negative was then packed with the female matte and exposed onto a final strip of film, then the camera negative was packed with the male matte was double-printed onto this same film. These two images combined together creates the final effect.\n\n===Major factors===\nThe most important factor for a key is the colour separation of the foreground (the subject) and background (the screen)&nbsp;\u2013 a blue screen will be used if the subject is predominantly green (for example plants), despite the camera being more sensitive to green light.\n\nIn [[Analog television|analog color TV]], colour is represented by the phase of the chroma [[Subcarrier#Television|subcarrier]] relative to a reference oscillator. Chroma key is achieved by comparing the phase of the video to the phase corresponding to the pre-selected colour. In-phase portions of the video are replaced by the alternate background video.\n\nIn [[Digital television|digital color TV]], colour is represented by three numbers (red, green, blue intensity levels). Chroma key is achieved by a simple numerical comparison between the video and the pre-selected colour. If the colour at a particular point on the screen matches (either exactly, or in a range), then the video at that point is replaced by the alternate background.\n\n====Lighting====\nIn order to create an illusion that characters and objects filmed are present in the intended background scene, the lighting in the two scenes must be a reasonable match. For outdoor scenes, overcast days create a diffuse, evenly coloured light which can be easier to match in the studio, whereas direct sunlight needs to be matched in both direction and overall colour based on time of day.\n\nA studio shot taken in front of a green screen will naturally have ambient light the same colour as the screen, due to its light scattering. This effect is known as ''spill''.<ref name=Foster />{{rp|p20}} This can look unnatural or cause portions of the characters to disappear, so must be compensated for, or avoided by using a larger screen placed far from the actors.<ref>{{Cite book |last1= Aronson |first1= David |authorlink1= David Aronson |title= DV Filmmaking: From Start to Finish, Volume 1 |year= 2006 |publisher= O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn= 978-0596008482 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/dvfilmmakingfrom0000aron/page/52 52\u201353] |url= https://archive.org/details/dvfilmmakingfrom0000aron/page/52 }}</ref>\n\n====Camera====\nThe depth of field used to record the scene in front of the coloured screen should match that of the background. This can mean recording the actors with a larger depth of field than normal.<ref name=\"bermingham\">{{Cite book | first= Alan | last=Bermingham | title= Location Lighting for Television | year= 2013 | publisher=Focal Press | isbn=978-0-240-51937-1 | page= 42 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7bAcAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA42}}</ref>\n\n==Clothing==\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Girl wearing blue clothing in front of green screen.

An example of intentional use of this is when an actor wears a blue covering over a part of his body to make it invisible in the final shot. This technique can be used to achieve an effect similar to that used in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' films to create the effect of an [[Cloak of invisibility|invisibility cloak]]. The actor can also be filmed against a chroma-key background and inserted into the background shot with a distortion effect, in order to create a cloak that is marginally detectable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.creativecow.net/articles/stern_eran/Invisible_Cape.php |title=Creating an invisible cape in After Effects |publisher=Library.creativecow.net |accessdate=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDifficulties emerge with blue screen when a costume in an effects shot must be blue, such as [[Superman]]'s traditional blue outfit.  In the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', in scenes where both [[Spider-Man]] and the [[Green Goblin]] are in the air, Spider-Man had to be shot in front of the green screen and the Green Goblin had to be shot in front of a blue screen. The colour difference is because Spider-Man wears a costume which is red and blue in colour and the Green Goblin wears a costume which is entirely green in colour. If both were shot in front of the same screen, parts of one character would be erased from the shot.\n\nFor a clean division of foreground from background, it is also important that clothing and hair in the foreground shot have a fairly simple silhouette, as fine details such as frizzy hair may not resolve properly. Similarly, partially transparent elements of the costume cause problems.<ref name=\"bermingham\" />\n\n==Background colour==\n[[File:MuseumOfScienceBoston BlueScreenAtSpecialEffectsShow.jpg|thumb|right|267px|Demonstration of the creation of visual effects techniques utilizing chroma key]]\n\n[[Blue]] was originally used for TV chroma keying [[special effects]] because the film industry used blue backgrounds for similar purposes. The colour blue was tied to the blue emulsion layer of film having comparable grain and detail in comparison to the red and [[green]] layers of the emulsion. In television and digital filmmaking, however, green has become the favoured colour because of some practical considerations, and because [[lossy compression]] algorithms used in both analog and digital TV distribution retain more detail in the green channel. The choice of colour is up to the effects artists and the needs of the specific shot. Whereas the blue screen was introduced to the television industry by the film industry, the use of green screen visual effects has been introduced to the film industry as electronic imaging has augmented and replaced the use of chemical film stock in cinema. Also, the green background is favoured over blue for outdoor filming where the blue sky might appear in the frame and could accidentally be replaced in the process. Although green and blue are the most common in part because red, green and blue components are used to encode the visible light spectrum, any key colour can be used. Red is avoided for human subjects due to its prevalence in white skin tones, but can be often used for objects and scenes which do not involve people.\n\nA so-called \"[[Sodium vapor process|yellow screen]]\" is accomplished with a white backdrop. Ordinary stage lighting is used in combination with a bright yellow sodium lamp. The sodium light falls almost entirely in a narrow frequency band, which can then be separated from the other light using a prism, and projected onto a separate but synchronized film carrier within the camera. This second film is high-contrast black and white, and is processed to produce the matte.<ref name=Foster>{{cite book | title=The Green Screen Handbook: Real-World Production Techniques | first=Jeff | last=Foster | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-470-52107-6}}</ref>{{rp|16}}\n\nOccasionally, a [[magenta]] background is used, as in some software applications where the magenta or [[fuchsia (color)|fuchsia]] is sometimes referred to as \"magic pink\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.skinyourscreen.com/site/Articles/so-you-wanna-make-a-theme | title = So you wanna make a theme? | work = skinyourscreen.com articles | accessdate = 23 August 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071029042547/http://www.skinyourscreen.com/site/Articles/so-you-wanna-make-a-theme | archivedate = 29 October 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA newer technique is to use a [[retroreflective]] curtain in the background, along with a ring of bright [[LED]]s around the [[camera lens]].  This requires no light to shine on the background other than the LEDs, which use an extremely small amount of power and space unlike big [[stage light]]s, and require no [[rigging (theatre)|rigging]].  This advance was made possible by the invention in the 1990s of practical blue LEDs, which also allow for [[Emerald (color)|emerald green]] LEDs.\n\nThere is also a form of colour keying that uses light spectrum invisible to human eye.

First the background is captured without actors or other foreground elements; then the scene is recorded. The image of the background is used to cancel the background in the actual footage; for example in a digital image, each pixel will have a different chroma key. This is sometimes referred to as a ''difference matte''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&pg=SA2-PA23&lpg=SA2-PA23&vq=%22difference+matte%22&dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&q=%22difference%20matte%22&f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=27}}</ref> However, this makes it easy for objects to be accidentally removed if they happen to be similar to the background, or for the background to remain due to camera noise or if it happens to change slightly from the reference footage.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Wright|title=Digital Compositing for Film and Video: Production Workflows and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/?id=n-xHDwAAQBAJ&pg=SA2-PA25&lpg=SA2-PA25&vq=%22difference+matte%22&dq=Steve+Wright.+Digital+Compositing+for+Film+and+Video#v=onepage&q=%22difference%20matte%22&f=false|date=22 November 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-315-28399-9|page=29}}</ref> A background with a repeating pattern alleviates many of these issues, and can be less sensitive to wardrobe colour than solid-colour backdrops.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Every colour chromakey | first1= Atsushi | last1=Yamashita | first2=Hiroki | last2=Agata | first3=Toru | last3=Kaneko | doi = 10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761643 | journal=Icpr 2008 | pages= 1\u20134 | year=2008| isbn= 978-1-4244-2174-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Tolerances==\n\n===Even lighting===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Myx tv.jpg|thumb|right|267px|A live broadcast of [[Myx TV]] using green-screen chroma key. Note the lack of shadows on the screen. The whiter area near the center of the image is due to the angle this photo was taken from, and would not appear from the video camera's angle.]]\n\nThe biggest challenge when setting up a bluescreen or greenscreen is even lighting and the avoidance of [[shadow]], because it is best to have as narrow a colour range as possible being replaced. A shadow would present itself as a darker colour to the camera and might not register for replacement. This can sometimes be seen in low-budget or live broadcasts where the errors cannot be manually repaired. The material being used affects the quality and ease of having it evenly lit. Materials which are shiny will be far less successful than those that are not. A shiny surface will have areas that reflect the lights making them appear pale, while other areas may be darkened. A matte surface will diffuse the reflected light and have a more even colour range. In order to get the cleanest key from shooting greenscreen it is necessary to create a value difference between the subject and the greenscreen. In order to differentiate the subject from the screen, a two-stop difference can be used, either by making the greenscreen two stops higher than the subject, or vice versa.\n\nSometimes a shadow can be used to create a visual effect.  Areas of the bluescreen or greenscreen with a shadow on them can be replaced with a darker version of the desired background video image, making it look like the person is casting a shadow on them. Any spill of the chroma key colour will make the result look unnatural. A difference in the [[focal length]] of the lenses used can affect the success of chroma key.\n\n===Exposure===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}Another challenge for bluescreen or greenscreen is proper [[camera exposure]]. Underexposing or overexposing a coloured backdrop can lead to poor [[Colorfulness|saturation]] levels. In the case of video cameras, underexposed images can contain high amounts of [[image noise|noise]], as well. The background must be bright enough to allow the camera to create a bright and saturated image.\n\n==Programming==\nThere are several different quality- and speed-optimised techniques for implementing colour keying in software.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cs.utah.edu/~michael/chroma/ | title = High Quality Chroma Key | last=Ashihkmin |first=Michael|publisher = University of Utah}}</ref><ref name=\"gcfilms\">{{cite web | url = http://gc-films.com/chromakey.html | title=Greenscreen code and hints | first=Edward | last=Cannon}}</ref>\n\nIn most versions, a function ''f''(''r'', ''g'', ''b'') \u2192 ''\u03b1'' is applied to every pixel in the image. \u03b1&nbsp;(alpha) has a meaning similar to that in [[alpha compositing]] techniques. ''\u03b1''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;0 means the pixel is fully in the green screen, ''\u03b1''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1 means the pixel is fully in the foreground object, and intermediate values indicate the pixel is partially covered by the foreground object (or it is transparent). A further function ''g''(''r'',&nbsp;''g'',&nbsp;''b'')&nbsp;\u2192 (''r'',&nbsp;''g'',&nbsp;''b'') is needed to remove green spill on the foreground objects.\n\nA very simple ''f''() function for green screen is ''A''(''r''+''b'') \u2212 ''Bg'' where ''A'' and ''B'' are user adjustable constants with a default value of 1.0. A very simple ''g''() is (''r'', min(''g'',''b''), ''b''). This is fairly close to the capabilities of analog and film-based screen pulling.\n\nModern examples<ref name=\"gcfilms\" /> of these functions are best described by two closed nested surfaces in  3-D rgb space, often quite complex. Colours inside the inner surface are considered green screen. Colours outside the outer surface are opaque foreground. Colours between the surfaces are partially covered, they are more opaque the closer they are to the outer surface. Sometimes more closed surfaces are used to determine how to remove green spill. It is also very common for ''f''() to depend on more than just the current pixel's colour, it may also use the (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') position, the values of nearby pixels, the value from reference images or a statistical colour model of the scene,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Interactive High-Quality Green-Screen Keying via Colour Unmixing | first1=Yagiz | last1=Aksoy | first2=Tunc| last2=Aydin | first3=Marc| last3=Pollefeys | first4=Aljoscha | last4=Smolic | journal=ACM Transactions on Graphics  | volume=36 | issue=4 | pages=1 | year=2016| doi=10.1145/3072959.2907940 }}</ref> and values from user-drawn masks. These produce closed surfaces in space with more than three dimensions.\n\nA different class of algorithm tries to figure out a 2D path that separates the foreground from the background.

Each episode follows a year in the life of morbidly [[obese]] individuals, who begin the episode weighing at least {{convert|600|lb}}, and documents their attempts to reduce their weight to a healthy level. Update episodes, called \"Where Are They Now?\", feature one or more previous patients, picking up a year or more after their original episodes aired.\n\nPatients are placed under the care of Iranian-American [[Houston]] surgeon [[Younan Nowzaradan]] (often referred to as simply \"Dr. Now\"), who first has them attempt losing weight on their own by following a strict [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and then depending on the patient's progress may offer [[gastric bypass surgery]] or [[sleeve gastrectomy]] to further assist in [[weight loss]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://people.com/bodies/my-600-lb-life-dr-nowzaradan-why-difficult-patients-keep-weight-off/ | title=My 600-Lb.

Because of its popularity, new episodes were filmed, including a \"Where Are They Now?\" retrospective in Season 4 that follows up on previous patients to track their weight-loss journey months or years after [[bariatric surgery]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/27/my-600-lb-life-where-are-they-now-video_n_1381855.html|title=\u2018My 600-lb Life: Where are They Now?\u2019: Have They Kept The Weight Off?|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Season 1, patients were filmed over a period of seven years (2004\u20132011). Beginning with Season 2, patients were filmed for only one year. In Season 8, certain patients' stories were filmed for only six months. \n\nBeginning with Season 5, new episodes began filming as 2-hour episodes instead of 1-hour. This was previously done with Melissa's Story (split into two parts) and Lupe's Story. Recap episodes titled under \"Supersized\" and \"Extended\", which include additional facts and footage respectively, also aired during this season.\n\n==Subject outcomes==\nSeven patients have died since appearing on the show.\n\n* Henry Foots, who was featured in season one, died of an illness unrelated to his weight loss surgery on May 16, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|via=Legacy.com|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/henry-foots-obituary?pid=1000000164888383|title=Henry Foots Obituary|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n* Sean Milliken, who was chronicled on the fourth season of the show, died on February 17, 2019, from an infection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/health/my-600-lb-life-sean-milliken-dead/|title=My 600-Lb.

Each episode follows a year in the life of morbidly [[obese]] individuals, who begin the episode weighing at least {{convert|600|lb}}, and documents their attempts to reduce their weight to a healthy level. Update episodes, called \"Where Are They Now?\", feature one or more previous patients, picking up a year or more after their original episodes aired.\n\nPatients are placed under the care of Iranian-American [[Houston]] surgeon [[Younan Nowzaradan]] (often referred to as simply \"Dr. Now\"), who first has them attempt losing weight on their own by following a strict [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and then depending on the patient's progress may offer [[gastric bypass surgery]] or [[sleeve gastrectomy]] to further assist in [[weight loss]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://people.com/bodies/my-600-lb-life-dr-nowzaradan-why-difficult-patients-keep-weight-off/ | title=My 600-Lb.

Because of its popularity, new episodes were filmed, including a \"Where Are They Now?\" retrospective in Season 4 that follows up on previous patients to track their weight-loss journey months or years after [[bariatric surgery]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/27/my-600-lb-life-where-are-they-now-video_n_1381855.html|title=\u2018My 600-lb Life: Where are They Now?\u2019: Have They Kept The Weight Off?|date=March 27, 2012|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Season 1, patients were filmed over a period of seven years (2004\u20132011). Beginning with Season 2, patients were filmed for only one year. In Season 8, certain patients' stories were filmed for only six months. \n\nBeginning with Season 5, new episodes began filming as 2-hour episodes instead of 1-hour. This was previously done with Melissa's Story (split into two parts) and Lupe's Story. Recap episodes titled under \"Supersized\" and \"Extended\", which include additional facts and footage respectively, also aired during this season.\n\n==Subject outcomes==\nSeven patients have died since appearing on the show.\n\n* Henry Foots, who was featured in season one, died of an illness unrelated to his weight loss surgery on May 16, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|via=Legacy.com|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/henry-foots-obituary?pid=1000000164888383|title=Henry Foots Obituary|accessdate=November 17, 2017}}</ref>\n* Sean Milliken, who was chronicled on the fourth season of the show, died on February 17, 2019, from an infection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/health/my-600-lb-life-sean-milliken-dead/|title=My 600-Lb.
