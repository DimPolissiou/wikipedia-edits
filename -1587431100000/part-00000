The Czech government maintains a registry of those nationals who hold a concurrent nationality in addition to their Czech nationality.\n\nSome countries, however, do not permit multiple citizenship e.g. adults who acquired Czech and [[Japanese citizenship]] by birth must declare, to the latter's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, which citizenship they want to keep.\n\n==Citizenship of the European Union==\nBecause Czech Republic forms part of the [[European Union]], Czech citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Czech Republic (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/czechrepublic/index_en.htm | title=Czech Republic | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511151117/http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/czechrepublic/index_en.htm | archive-date=11 May 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> When in a non-EU country where there is no Czech embassy, Czech citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.<ref>Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].</ref><ref>[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state).

The battle ended Muslim expansion into Nubia, establishing trade and a historic peace between the Muslim world and a Christian nation. As a result, Makuria was able to grow into a regional power that would dominate Nubia for over the next 500 years.\n\n==Background==\nRelations between the kingdom of Makuria and Rashidun Egypt had gotten off to a rocky start in 642 with the [[First Battle of Dongola]]. After their defeat, the Arabs withdrew from Nubia and something of a peace had been established by 645.<ref name=Clark-565/> According to the 14th-century Arab-Egyptian historian [[al-Maqrizi]], Makuria did something to violate the truce.<ref name=Clark-565/> It was then that [[Abdallah ibn Sa'd]], the successor of the first governor of Arab Egypt, invaded Makuria in an attempt to bring the Makurians to heel.<ref name=Clark-565/> At this time, northern and central Nubia were united under the Makurian king Qalidurut.<ref name=Hrbek-103/>\n\nArchaeological discoveries show that Dongola was a well fortified city in the seventh century. It had walls at least {{convert|6|m|ft}} high and {{convert|4|m|ft}} wide at the base with towers. These were constructed of [[mudbrick]]s in mortar and faced with stone. The round corner towers were 6 metres wide and projected {{convert|8|m|ft}} out from the wall. There were another two towers on the north wall. The towers, however, may have been added after, and possibly in response to, the siege of 652.<ref name=Purton-45>Purton, pp. 45\u201346.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Alte kirche.jpg|thumb|Ground plan of the so-called \"Old Church\", which was presumably destroyed during the siege]]\nAbdallah marched a force of 5,000 men to the Makurian capital of Dongola in 651.<ref name=Clark-565/> He was equipped with [[heavy cavalry]] and a catapult (''manjaniq''), probably a [[mangonel]],<ref name=Spaulding-582>Spaulding, p. 582.</ref> which according to al-Maqrizi the Makurians had never seen before.<ref name=Purton-45/> He then laid siege to the city,<ref>Kissling, p. 166.</ref> putting his cavalry in the precarious situation of storming a walled city defended by the infamous Nubian archers.<ref name=Burns-75>Burns, p. 75.</ref> During the siege the town's cathedral was damaged by catapult fire.<ref name=Clark-565/> (A damaged church has been discovered outside the remains of the city walls dating to the mid-seventh century.<ref name=Purton-45/>)\n\nThe siege ended in a pitched battle.<ref name=Spaulding-582/> The casualties incurred by Abdallah's forces were heavy,<ref name=Burns-75/> and Qalidurut did not sue for peace.<ref name=Clark-565/> In the end, Abdallah called off the siege and negotiated a pact (''baqt'').<ref name=Hrbek-103/> According to the 9th-century Egyptian historian [[Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam]] this was because \"he was unable to defeat them\". The 10th-century Shiite historian [[Ahmad al-Kufi]], who had no sympathy for the forces of the caliph, had en even stronger opinion: \"The Muslims had never [before] suffered a loss like the one they had in Nubia.\"<ref name=Spaulding-582/> An Arab poet describing the battle wrote:<ref name=Shinnie-4>Shinnie, p. 4.</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"My eyes ne'er saw another fight like Damqula [Dongola],<br>\nWith rushing horses loaded down with coats of mail.\"\n</blockquote>\nIn the centuries that followed, however, the siege and second battle of Dongola were transformed by Muslim historians into a victory. Qalidurut was said to have come out of the city submissively seeking terms, according to al-Maqrizi.<ref name=Spaulding-582/> It may be that this version of events stems from the conflation of the events of 652 with late 13th-century conflict between Nubia and the [[Mamluk Egypt|Mamluks]].<ref name=Purton-45/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Baqt}}\nThe details of the second Battle of Dongola are scarce, but we do know that the forces of the caliphate suffered enough casualties that taking their objective\u2014the city of Dongola\u2014was no longer possible.<ref name=Burns-75/> A negotiated truce known as the ''[[Baqt]]'' was agreed upon by both sides and lasted for six centuries.<ref name=Jennings-26>Jennings, p. 26.</ref> It set up trade relations between Muslim Egypt and Christian Nubia. It involved the exchange of wheat, barley, wine, horses and linen from Egypt for 360 slaves per year from Nubia. \n\nThe ''baqt'' was without precedent in the early history of Islam. Also new to the paradigm of Muslim-Non Muslim Relations was Nubia's status as a land free from conquest. Traditionally, Nubia was made the exception.<ref name=Clark-565/> It was a Christian region where its rulers did business with Muslim rulers on equal terms well until the 12th century when the power of Nubia began to wane. As a result of the battle and the ''baqt'',  Christian Nubia had the space to flourish for the next 600 years.<ref name=Clark-565/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |author=Adams, William |title=Nubia: corridor to Africa |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1977 |pages=824 Pages |isbn=0-691-09370-9}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |author=Burns, James McDonald |title=A History of Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2007 |pages=418 |isbn=0-521-86746-0}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |author1=[[J.

The battle ended Muslim expansion into Nubia, establishing trade and a historic peace between the Muslim world and a Christian nation. As a result, Makuria was able to grow into a regional power that would dominate Nubia for over the next 500 years.\n\n==Background==\nRelations between the kingdom of Makuria and Rashidun Egypt had gotten off to a rocky start in 642 with the [[First Battle of Dongola]]. After their defeat, the Arabs withdrew from Nubia and something of a peace had been established by 645.<ref name=Clark-565/> According to the 14th-century Arab-Egyptian historian [[al-Maqrizi]], Makuria did something to violate the truce.<ref name=Clark-565/> It was then that [[Abdallah ibn Sa'd]], the successor of the first governor of Arab Egypt, invaded Makuria in an attempt to bring the Makurians to heel.<ref name=Clark-565/> At this time, northern and central Nubia were united under the Makurian king Qalidurut.<ref name=Hrbek-103/>\n\nArchaeological discoveries show that Dongola was a well fortified city in the seventh century. It had walls at least {{convert|6|m|ft}} high and {{convert|4|m|ft}} wide at the base with towers. These were constructed of [[mudbrick]]s in mortar and faced with stone. The round corner towers were 6 metres wide and projected {{convert|8|m|ft}} out from the wall. There were another two towers on the north wall. The towers, however, may have been added after, and possibly in response to, the siege of 652.<ref name=Purton-45>Purton, pp. 45\u201346.</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Alte kirche.jpg|thumb|Ground plan of the so-called \"Old Church\", which was presumably destroyed during the siege]]\nAbdallah marched a force of 5,000 men to the Makurian capital of Dongola in 651.<ref name=Clark-565/> He was equipped with [[heavy cavalry]] and a catapult (''manjaniq''), probably a [[mangonel]],<ref name=Spaulding-582>Spaulding, p. 582.</ref> which according to al-Maqrizi the Makurians had never seen before.<ref name=Purton-45/> He then laid siege to the city,<ref>Kissling, p. 166.</ref> putting his cavalry in the precarious situation of storming a walled city defended by the infamous Nubian archers.<ref name=Burns-75>Burns, p. 75.</ref> During the siege the town's cathedral was damaged by catapult fire.<ref name=Clark-565/> (A damaged church has been discovered outside the remains of the city walls dating to the mid-seventh century.<ref name=Purton-45/>)\n\nThe siege ended in a pitched battle.<ref name=Spaulding-582/> The casualties incurred by Abdallah's forces were heavy,<ref name=Burns-75/> and Qalidurut did not sue for peace.<ref name=Clark-565/> In the end, Abdallah called off the siege and negotiated a pact (''baqt'').<ref name=Hrbek-103/> According to the 9th-century Egyptian historian [[Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam]] this was because \"he was unable to defeat them\". The 10th-century Shiite historian [[Ahmad al-Kufi]], who had no sympathy for the forces of the caliph, had en even stronger opinion: \"The Muslims had never [before] suffered a loss like the one they had in Nubia.\"<ref name=Spaulding-582/> An Arab poet describing the battle wrote:<ref name=Shinnie-4>Shinnie, p. 4.</ref>\n<blockquote>\n\"My eyes ne'er saw another fight like Damqula [Dongola],<br>\nWith rushing horses loaded down with coats of mail.\"\n</blockquote>\nIn the centuries that followed, however, the siege and second battle of Dongola were transformed by Muslim historians into a victory. Qalidurut was said to have come out of the city submissively seeking terms, according to al-Maqrizi.<ref name=Spaulding-582/> It may be that this version of events stems from the conflation of the events of 652 with late 13th-century conflict between Nubia and the [[Mamluk Egypt|Mamluks]].<ref name=Purton-45/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Baqt}}\nThe details of the second Battle of Dongola are scarce, but we do know that the forces of the caliphate suffered enough casualties that taking their objective\u2014the city of Dongola\u2014was no longer possible.<ref name=Burns-75/> A negotiated truce known as the ''[[Baqt]]'' was agreed upon by both sides and lasted for six centuries.<ref name=Jennings-26>Jennings, p. 26.</ref> It set up trade relations between Muslim Egypt and Christian Nubia. It involved the exchange of wheat, barley, wine, horses and linen from Egypt for 360 slaves per year from Nubia. \n\nThe ''baqt'' was without precedent in the early history of Islam. Also new to the paradigm of Muslim-Non Muslim Relations was Nubia's status as a land free from conquest. Traditionally, Nubia was made the exception.<ref name=Clark-565/> It was a Christian region where its rulers did business with Muslim rulers on equal terms well until the 12th century when the power of Nubia began to wane. As a result of the battle and the ''baqt'',  Christian Nubia had the space to flourish for the next 600 years.<ref name=Clark-565/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |author=Adams, William |title=Nubia: corridor to Africa |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1977 |pages=824 Pages |isbn=0-691-09370-9}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |author=Burns, James McDonald |title=A History of Sub-Saharan Africa |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2007 |pages=418 |isbn=0-521-86746-0}}\n*{{cite book |ref=harv |author1=[[J.

The division participated in the Invasions of Poland, Belgium, France and the Soviet Union. From 1941 to 1945 it continuously fought on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].\n\n==History==\n===Before World War II===\nThe 3rd Panzer Division was formed on 15 October 1935<ref name=\"Battistelli p19\">Battistelli 2007, p. 19.</ref> from elements of the [[1st Cavalry Division (Reichswehr)|1st]] and [[3rd Cavalry Division (Reichswehr)|3rd Cavalry Division]] as well as a variety of other Military and police units, and was headquartered in the German capital [[Berlin]]. It was one of three tank divisions created at the time, the other two being the [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st]] and [[2nd Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|2nd Panzer Division]].<ref name=\"Battistelli p19\">Battistelli 2007, p. 19.</ref> Germany had renounced the [[Treaty of Versailles]] earlier in the year which had forbidden the country, among other things, from having tank forces, a treaty Germany had violated almost from the start by secretly developing tanks and operating a covert [[Kama tank school|tank school]] in the Soviet Union.<ref>Mitcham, p. 3\u20139</ref><ref name=\"Three\" >Mitcham, p. 53</ref>\n\nMembers of the divisions tank regiment participated in the [[Spanish Civil War]] on the Nationalist side as part of the German [[Legion Condor]]. The division also took part in the annexation of Austria, the so-called ''[[Anschluss]]''.<ref name=\"Three\" />\n\n===Action During World War II===\nThe 3rd Panzer Division participated in the 1939 [[invasion of Poland]], where it was the most numerically powerful Panzer [[Division (military)|Division]], with 391 tanks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historicalsocietyofgermanmilitaryhistory.com/wehrmacht-armed-forces-of-world-war-two/german-heer-army-photos/orders-battle-wehrmacht-divisions/ |title=Orders of Battle \u2013 Heer Divisions including Heavy Panzer Battalions |publisher=Historical Society of German Military History |accessdate=2016-03-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112163103/http://historicalsocietyofgermanmilitaryhistory.com/wehrmacht-armed-forces-of-world-war-two/german-heer-army-photos/orders-battle-wehrmacht-divisions/ |archive-date=12 January 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It was engaged in the northern sector, operating from [[Pommerania]], and advancing via [[Toru\u0144]] to [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]].<ref name=\"Three\" /> In May 1940 it was part of the German forces [[Battle of Belgium|invading Belgium]], advancing via the [[Albert Canal]] to [[Brussels]] and into France. Like the other German tank divisions the 3rd lost one of its two tank regiments in late 1940 to allow for the creation of further tank divisions, and gained an Infantry regiment instead.<ref name=\"Four\" >Mitcham, p. 54</ref>\n\nThe Division was ordered to prepare for service in Libya, North Africa that same year to help support the Italian efforts there. The deployment was cancelled by Hitler however after Mussolini launched an [[Greco-Italian War|invasion of Greece]] 28 October 1940 without prior warning to his German Ally. The Division was instead diverted to [[Operation Felix]] though the operation was never initiated.<ref>Ellis 2001, p. 8.</ref>\n\nThe 3rd Panzer Division was part of [[Operation Barbarossa]], the invasion of the Soviet Union, which began on 22 June 1941. Initially it was engaged in the central sector of the advance but was then redirected south to participate in the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|Battle of Kiev]]. From there it participated in the [[Battle of Moscow]], advancing towards [[Tula, Russia|Tula]]. With the Soviet counterattacks in the winter of 1941\u201342 the division acted as a stand-by emergency force and, in March 1942, participated in the defense of [[Kharkov]]. The division participated in the [[Case Blue]], the German attack in the southern sector of the Eastern Front in June 1942, in which the 3rd Panzer Division advanced towards the Caucasus. Initially successful the operation was ultimately a failure, with the division suffering heavy casualties in the process, especially in the fighting around [[Mozdok]]. It narrowly escaped encirclement on its retreat by crossing the frozen [[Sea of Azov]] near Rostov.<ref name=\"Four\" />\n\nThe 3rd Panzer Division took part in the [[Battle of Kursk]], attacking west of [[Belgorod]]. Following the German failure the division was engaged in the defense and retreat that followed. It remained on the Eastern Front for the remainder of the Second World War, fighting in the Ukraine, Romania, Poland and Hungary. At the end of the war saw the division engaged in [[Styria]] where it evaded Soviet forces and managed to surrender to the US Army instead.<ref name=\"Four\" /> The majority of the divisions soldiers were released from captivity by July 1945.<ref>Stoves, p. 31</ref>\n\n==Commanders==\nThe commanders of the division:<ref>Mitcham, p. 55\u201358</ref>\n*Generalmajor [[Ernst Fessmann]] (15.
