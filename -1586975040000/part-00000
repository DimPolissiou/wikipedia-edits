It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020. Commencing work on the album in early 2018, Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]], [[Stuart Price]], [[The Monsters & Strangerz]] and others, in order to create a \"nostalgic\" [[Pop music|pop]] and [[disco]] album with influences from [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic music]], inspired by artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Moloko]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Outkast]].\n\nThe album was preceded by three singles and the [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]], which was released as a promotional single. \"[[Don't Start Now]]\" was released on 31 October 2019, as the album's [[lead single]], attaining both critical and commercial success. The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively, and both reached the top 10 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. To promote the album, Lipa is scheduled to embark on the [[List of Dua Lipa concert tours#Future Nostalgia Tour (2021)|Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production. Commercially, the album topped the charts in nine different countries. In Lipa's native country the United Kingdom, it peaked atop of the [[UK Albums Chart]], becoming her first album to achieve this. It also reached the top 5 in countries such as Australia, Belgium, Spain and the United States.\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter the release of ''[[Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition]]'' in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of her debut album, Lipa announced a new single titled \"[[Swan Song (song)|Swan Song]]\". On 24 January 2019, the song was released for the film ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' (2019), and was met with moderate commercial success. In the same month, Lipa stated that she had been spending the past year in the writing process for an upcoming second studio album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dua-lipa-grammys-music-2019-779203/|title=Dua Lipa's New Rules for 2019|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=16 January 2019|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> Whilst discussing the sound of the album, Lipa commented that it would be a \"nostalgic\" pop record that \"feels like a dancercise class\".<ref name=\"bbc1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48880735|title=Dua Lipa reveals nerves about new album|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=5 July 2019|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> On the development of ''Future Nostalgia'', Lipa stated:\n<blockquote>\nWhat I wanted to do with this album was to break out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to make music that felt like it could sit alongside some of my favourite classic pop songs, whilst still feeling fresh and uniquely mine.

It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020. Commencing work on the album in early 2018, Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]], [[Stuart Price]], [[The Monsters & Strangerz]] and others, in order to create a \"nostalgic\" [[Pop music|pop]] and [[disco]] album with influences from [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic music]], inspired by artists such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Moloko]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Outkast]].\n\nThe album was preceded by three singles and the [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]], which was released as a promotional single. \"[[Don't Start Now]]\" was released on 31 October 2019, as the album's [[lead single]], attaining both critical and commercial success. The song became her first top-three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively, and both reached the top-ten on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. To promote the album, Lipa announced the [[List of Dua Lipa concert tours#Future Nostalgia Tour (2021)|Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021. In April 2020, Lipa became the first British female artist to have three entries in the Top 10 in 65 years, when all three of the latter singles reached the region on the UK singles chart.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production. It topped the music charts in nine different countries, including the [[UK Albums Chart]], becoming her first album to achieve this feat. [[Spotify]] announced that the album broke three records on the platform, becoming the most-streamed album in a day for a British female artist globally, the most-streamed album in a day for a British female artist in the UK and the most-streamed album in a day for a British female artist in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/dua-lipas-future-nostalgia-album-breaks-three-streaming-records-on-spotify__29325/|title=Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia album breaks three Spotify records|website=www.officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter the release of ''[[Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition]]'' in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of her debut album, Lipa announced a new single titled \"[[Swan Song (song)|Swan Song]]\".

He played as a [[wing half|half back]] for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]]. On the books of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] as a youth, Barnes began his football career at amateur level. Upon completion of his [[national service]] in 1947 he joined semi-pro [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]].\n\nA transfer to Manchester City in 1950 meant Barnes turned professional, but his pro career had a slow start, making only one first team appearance in four years. He broke into the first team in 1954, flourishing as part of the tactical system known as the ''[[Revie Plan]]''. During this period he played in two consecutive [[FA Cup]] finals, as a loser in 1955 and a winner in 1956. After making 283 appearances for Manchester City he joined Wrexham as player-manager in 1961, guiding them to [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] in his first season. Barnes returned to Manchester City in 1970, and over more than two decades filled a variety of coaching roles, including overseeing the development of the youth team which won the 1986 [[FA Youth Cup]].\n\nHe died on 13 July 2010.<ref name=MENdies>{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Brennan |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-legend-ken-barnes-dies-894067 |title=City legend Ken Barnes dies |date=14 July 2010 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\nBarnes was born in the [[Small Heath]] area of [[Birmingham]], in the shadow of [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's]], the home stadium of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].<ref name=\"hof168\">{{cite book |last= James|first= Gary| title= The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame | page=168|publisher= Hamlyn |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-600-61282-1}}</ref> Support for Birmingham City ran in the family; his uncle played for the club in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wagg |first=Jimmy |last2= Barnes|first2= Ken |title=This Simple Game: The Footballing Life of Ken Barnes |publisher=Empire Publications |location=Manchester |year=2005 |isbn=1-901746-49-6|page= 15}}</ref> In 1943, aged 14, he began work at the [[Royal Mail|Post Office]]. He played football for the works team, and quickly received an invitation to play for [[Moor Green F.C.|Moor Green]], one of the strongest amateur teams in the area.<ref>''This Simple Game: The Footballing Life of Ken Barnes'', p.&nbsp;20</ref> His performances for Moor Green resulted in interest from Birmingham City, and Barnes became part of their junior team, Birmingham City Colts. Barnes worked at the Post Office during the day, trained with Moor Green in the evening, and played for Birmingham City Colts at the weekend. However, the Colts stopped selecting Barnes after a clash of matches, in which Barnes chose to play for a local team instead of the Colts.<ref>''This Simple Game: The Footballing Life of Ken Barnes'', p.&nbsp;23</ref> Barnes then resumed playing for Moor Green.\n\nAfter a few months Barnes gained a second opportunity with a professional club, joining the youth ranks at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. As with when he played for Birmingham, he trained with Moor Green and played for Bolton's youth team at the weekend. Upon turning 18, Barnes was called up for national service, and was based with the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] at [[Stafford]]. He continued to play for Bolton when circumstances permitted it, but when the club made a formal request for his services the RAF refused.<ref>''This Simple Game: The Footballing Life of Ken Barnes'', p.&nbsp;27</ref> Upon completion of his national service Barnes joined semi-pro [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]]. He made his debut against [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] on 14 June 1947, and continued to play for the club for the next three years.\n\n== Manchester City ==\nBarnes joined [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] after a \u00a3750 move from non-League Stafford Rangers on 6 May 1950.<ref name=\"hof168\"/> He did not feature in the first team on a regular basis for several years \u2013 his debut, against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 5 January 1952 was the only appearance he made in his first four years at the club.<ref name=\"mre\">{{cite book |last=Penney |first=Ian |title=The Maine Road Encyclopedia |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |year=1995 |isbn=1-85158-710-1 |pages= 20\u201321}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[1953-54 in English football|1953\u201354 season]] Barnes was playing for the [[Manchester City F.C. Reserves and Academy|Manchester City reserve team]]. Inspired by the [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] team which had [[England v Hungary (1953)|beaten England 6\u20133]] the previous year, the reserves began using a tactical system in which [[Johnny Williamson]] was used as a deep-lying centre-forward. Barnes played as an attacking half-back in a similar vein to [[J\u00f3zsef Bozsik]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rowlands |first=Alan |title=Trautmann: The Biography |publisher=Breedon |location=Derby |year=2005 |isbn=1-85983-491-4}} p131</ref> Using the system the reserves achieved a lengthy unbeaten run. At the start of the following season Manchester City manager [[Les McDowall]] decided to try the system at first team level, using [[Don Revie]] in the centre-forward role.

He played as a [[wing half|half back]] for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]]. On the books of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] as a youth, Barnes began his football career at amateur level. Upon completion of his [[national service]] in 1947 he joined semi-pro [[Stafford Rangers F.C.|Stafford Rangers]].\n\nA transfer to Manchester City in 1950 meant Barnes turned professional, but his pro career had a slow start, making only one first team appearance in four years. He broke into the first team in 1954, flourishing as part of the tactical system known as the ''[[Revie Plan]]''. During this period he played in two consecutive [[FA Cup]] finals, as a loser in 1955 and a winner in 1956. After making 283 appearances for Manchester City he joined Wrexham as player-manager in 1961, guiding them to [[promotion and relegation|promotion]] in his first season. Barnes returned to Manchester City in 1970, and over more than two decades filled a variety of coaching roles, including overseeing the development of the youth team which won the 1986 [[FA Youth Cup]].\n\nHe died on 13 July 2010.<ref name=MENdies>{{cite news |first=Stuart |last=Brennan |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/city-legend-ken-barnes-dies-894067 |title=City legend Ken Barnes dies |date=14 July 2010 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |accessdate=2 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\nBarnes was born in the [[Small Heath]] area of [[Birmingham]], in the shadow of [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's]], the home stadium of [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].<ref name=\"hof168\">{{cite book |last= James|first= Gary| title= The Official Manchester City Hall of Fame | page=168|publisher= Hamlyn |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-600-61282-1}}</ref> Support for Birmingham City ran in the family; his uncle played for the club in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wagg |first=Jimmy |last2= Barnes|first2= Ken |title=This Simple Game: The Footballing Life of Ken Barnes |publisher=Empire Publications |location=Manchester |year=2005 |isbn=1-901746-49-6|page= 15}}</ref> In 1943, aged 14, he began work at the [[Royal Mail|Post Office]].

The city proper has a population of 33,039, making it the state's 3rd largest settlement behind [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] (66,882) and [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]] (36,221).\n\nModern Bangor was established in the mid-19th century with the lumber and shipbuilding industries. Lying on the [[Penobscot River]], logs could be floated downstream from the [[Maine North Woods]] and processed at the city's water-powered sawmills, then shipped from Bangor's port to the Atlantic Ocean {{convert|30|mi}} downstream, and from there to any port in the world. Evidence of this is still visible in the [[lumber baron]]s' elaborate [[Greek Revival]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions and the 31-foot-high (9.4 m) statue of [[Paul Bunyan]]. Today, Bangor's economy is based on services and retail, healthcare, and education.\n\nBangor has a [[port of entry]] at [[Bangor International Airport]], also home to the [[Bangor Air National Guard Base]]. Historically Bangor was an important stopover on the [[great circle route]] air route between the U.S. East Coast and Europe.\n\nBangor has a [[humid continental climate]], with cold, snowy winters, and warm summers.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Name and pronunciation==\n\nFounded as Condeskeag Plantation, Bangor was incorporated as a [[New England town]] in 1791.

Then known as Norumbega, by 1772, there were 12 families, along with a [[sawmill]], store, and school. By 1787 the population was 567.

The ships remained there until the late 1950s, when construction of the Joshua Chamberlain Bridge disturbed the site. Six cannons were removed from the riverbed; five of which are on display throughout the region (one was thrown back into the river by area residents angered the archeological site was destroyed for the bridge construction).<ref name=cvb-heritage/>\n\nDuring the [[War of 1812]] Bangor and [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]] were [[Battle of Hampden#Sacking of Bangor and Hampden|looted by the British]].\n\nMaine was part of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] until 1820 when it voted to secede from Massachusetts and was admitted to the Union as the 23rd state under the [[Missouri Compromise]].\n\nIn 1861, a mob ransacked the offices of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] newspaper the ''Bangor Daily Union'', threw the presses and other materials thrown into the street and burned them.

The [[20th Maine Infantry Regiment]] held [[Little Round Top]] in the [[Battle of Gettysburg]].

Boutelle]] accepted the surrender of the Confederate fleet after the [[Battle of Mobile Bay]]. A Bangor residential street is named for him. The [[Confederate States Navy]] captured several Bangor ships during the Civil War.\n\nBangor was near the lands disputed during the [[Aroostook War]], a boundary dispute with Britain in 1838\u201339. The passion of the Aroostook War signaled the increasing role lumbering and logging played in the Maine economy, particularly in the state's central and eastern sections. Bangor arose as a lumbering boom-town in the 1830s, and a potential demographic and political rival to Portland. Bangor became for a time the largest lumber port in the world, and the site of furious land speculation that extended up the Penobscot River valley and beyond.<ref>David C. Smith, ''A History of Lumbering in Maine, 1861\u20131960'' (University of Maine Press, 1972)</ref>\n\n===Industrialization: lumbering, shipping, and manufacturing===\n[[File:Sterns Sawmill, below Bangor, ME.jpg|thumb|Sterns Sawmill, below Bangor]]\nThe [[Penobscot River]] [[drainage basin]] above Bangor was unattractive to settlement for farming, but well suited to [[lumbering]]. Winter snow allowed logs to be dragged from the woods by horse-teams. Carried to the Penobscot or its tributaries, [[log driving]] in the [[snowmelt]] brought them to waterfall-powered [[sawmill]]s upriver from Bangor. The sawn lumber was then shipped from the city's docks, Bangor being at the head-of-tide (between the rapids and the ocean) to points anywhere in the world. [[Shipbuilding]] was also developed.<ref name='Wood'/> Bangor capitalists also owned most of the forests. The main markets for Bangor lumber were the East Coast cities. Much was also shipped to the [[Caribbean]] and to [[California]] during the [[Gold Rush]], via [[Cape Horn]], before sawmills could be established in the west. Bangorians later helped transplant the Maine culture of lumbering to the [[Pacific Northwest]], and participated directly in the Gold Rush. [[Bangor, Washington]]; [[Bangor, California]]; and Little Bangor, Nevada, are legacies of this contact.<ref name='Wood'>Richard George Wood, ''A History of Lumbering in Maine'', 1820\u201361 (Orono: University of Maine Press, 1971)</ref>\n\nBy 1860, Bangor was the world's largest lumber port, with 150 sawmills operating along the river. The city shipped over 150 million boardfeet of lumber a year, much of it in Bangor-built and Bangor-owned ships. In the year 1860, 3,300 lumbering ships passed by the docks.<ref name=cvb-heritage/>\n\nMany of the [[lumber baron]]s built elaborate [[Greek Revival]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] houses that still stand in the [[Broadway Historic District (Bangor, Maine)|Broadway Historic District]]. Bangor has many substantial old churches, and shade trees. The city was so beautiful it was called \"The Queen City of the East.\" The shorter ''Queen City'' appellation is still used by some local clubs, organizations, events and businesses.<ref name=\"City of Bangor Maine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bangormaine.gov|title=Maine's Queen City Since 1834|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to shipping lumber, 19th-century Bangor was the leading producer of [[moccasins]], shipping over 100,000 pairs a year by the 1880s.<ref>''Barnstable Patriot'', Oct. 21, 1884, p. 1</ref> Exports also included bricks, leather, and even ice (which was cut and stored in winter, then shipped to Boston, and even China, the West Indies and South America).<ref name=cvb-heritage/>\n\nBangor had certain disadvantages compared to other East Coast ports, including its rival [[Portland, Maine]]. Being on a northern river, its port froze during the winter, and it could not take the largest ocean-going ships. The comparative lack of settlement in the forested hinterland also gave it a comparatively small home market.<ref>David Demeritt, \"Boards, Barrels, and Boxshooks: The Economics of Downeast Lumber in 19th Century Cuba\" ''Forest and Conservation History'', v. 35, no. 3 (July 1991), p. 112</ref>\n\nIn 1844 the first ocean-going iron-hulled [[steamship]] in the U.S. was named ''The Bangor''. She was built by the [[Harlan and Hollingsworth]] firm of [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1844, and was intended to take passengers between Bangor and Boston. On her second voyage, however, in 1845, she burned to the waterline off [[Castine, Maine|Castine]]. She was rebuilt at [[Bath, Maine|Bath]], returned briefly to her earlier route, but was soon purchased by the U.S. government for use in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].<ref>Edward Mitchell Blanding, \"Bangor, Maine\", ''New England Magazine'', v.

A new type of [[steam engine]] built there, named the \"Endeavor\", won a Gold Medal at the [[New York Crystal Palace]] Exhibition of the American Institute in 1856. The firm won a diploma for a shingle-making machine the following year.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qeRIAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA73&dq=Annual+Report+of+the+American+Institute+of+the+City+of+New+York+1856#PPA178,M1 ''Annual Report of the American Institute of the City of New York''] (1856), p. 178</ref> In the 1920s, Union Iron Works engineer Don A.

As early as the 1870s, the city promoted a Halifax-to-New York railroad, via Bangor, as the quickest connection between North America and Europe (when combined with steamship service between Britain and Halifax). A [[European and North American Railway]] opened through Bangor, with President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] officiating at the inauguration, but commerce never lived up to the potential. More recent attempts to capture traffic between Halifax and [[Montreal]] by constructing an [[East\u2013West Highway (New England)|East\u2013West Highway]] through Maine have also come to naught.

It ushered in a decline of the city center that was accelerated by the construction of the [[Bangor Mall]] in 1978 and subsequent big-box stores on the city's outskirts.<ref name=\"urbanrenewal\">{{cite web |title=Urban Renewal |url=http://bangorinfo.com/Focus/focus_urban_renewal.html |website=Bangor Info |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref> Downtown Bangor began to recover in the 1990s, with bookstores, cafe/restaurants, galleries, and museums filling once-vacant storefronts.<!-- link doesn't appear to address recovery: [http://www.downtownbangor.com/]--> The recent re-development of the city's waterfront has also helped re-focus cultural life in the historic center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bangormaine.gov/bd_mdi_waterfront.php|title=Major Development Initiatives: Waterfront Redevelopment|publisher=City of Bangor|accessdate=2008-02-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222121706/http://www.bangormaine.gov/bd_mdi_waterfront.php|archivedate=February 22, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Hydrology===\n[[File:1992USCGCSwivel.jpg|thumb|Ice breaking on the Penobscot River]]\nBangor is on the banks of the Penobscot River, close enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be influenced by tides.

[[Ice jam]]s can exacerbate high flow conditions and cause acute localized flooding.

Both resulted from mid-December [[freshet]]s that cleared the upper river of ice, followed by cold that produced large volumes of [[frazil ice]] or slush which was carried by high flows forming a major ice jam in the lower river. In March of both years, a dynamic breakup of ice ran into the jam and flooded downtown Bangor. Though no lives were lost and the city recovered quickly, the 1846 and 1902 ice jam floods were economically devastating, according to the Army Corps analysis. Both floods occurred with multiple dams in place and little to no ice-breaking in the lower river. The [[United States Coast Guard]] began [[icebreaker]] operations on the Penobscot in the 1940s, preventing the formation of frozen ice jams during the winter and providing an unobstructed path for ice-out in the spring.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schmitt|first1=Catherine|title=Ice-out on the Penobscot|url=http://www.seagrant.umaine.edu/blog/ice-out|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref> Long-term temperature records show a gradual warming since 1894, which may have reduced the ice jam flood potential at Bangor.\n\nIn the [[Groundhog Day gale of 1976]] a [[storm surge]] went up the Penobscot, flooding Bangor for three hours.<ref>{{cite journal |publisher= Maine State Climate Office |journal= The Maine Climate |date= March 2002}}</ref>  At 11:15 am, waters began rising on the river and within 15 minutes had risen a total of {{convert|3.7|m|ft}} flooding downtown.

The city proper has a population of 33,039, making it the state's 3rd largest settlement behind [[Portland, Maine|Portland]] (66,882) and [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]] (36,221).\n\nModern Bangor was established in the mid-19th century with the lumber and shipbuilding industries. Lying on the [[Penobscot River]], logs could be floated downstream from the [[Maine North Woods]] and processed at the city's water-powered sawmills, then shipped from Bangor's port to the Atlantic Ocean {{convert|30|mi}} downstream, and from there to any port in the world. Evidence of this is still visible in the [[lumber baron]]s' elaborate [[Greek Revival]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions and the 31-foot-high (9.4 m) statue of [[Paul Bunyan]]. Today, Bangor's economy is based on services and retail, healthcare, and education.\n\nBangor has a [[port of entry]] at [[Bangor International Airport]], also home to the [[Bangor Air National Guard Base]]. Historically Bangor was an important stopover on the [[great circle route]] air route between the U.S. East Coast and Europe.\n\nBangor has a [[humid continental climate]], with cold, snowy winters, and warm summers.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Name and pronunciation==\n\nFounded as Condeskeag Plantation, Bangor was incorporated as a [[New England town]] in 1791.

Then known as Norumbega, by 1772, there were 12 families, along with a [[sawmill]], store, and school. By 1787 the population was 567.

The [[Confederate States Navy]] captured several Bangor ships during the Civil War.\n\nBangor was near the lands disputed during the [[Aroostook War]], a boundary dispute with Britain in 1838\u201339. The passion of the Aroostook War signaled the increasing role lumbering and logging played in the Maine economy, particularly in the state's central and eastern sections. Bangor arose as a lumbering boom-town in the 1830s, and a potential demographic and political rival to Portland. Bangor became for a time the largest lumber port in the world, and the site of furious land speculation that extended up the Penobscot River valley and beyond.<ref>David C. Smith, ''A History of Lumbering in Maine, 1861\u20131960'' (University of Maine Press, 1972)</ref>\n\n===Industrialization: lumbering, shipping, and manufacturing===\n[[File:Sterns Sawmill, below Bangor, ME.jpg|thumb|Sterns Sawmill, below Bangor]]\nThe [[Penobscot River]] [[drainage basin]] above Bangor was unattractive to settlement for farming, but well suited to [[lumbering]]. Winter snow allowed logs to be dragged from the woods by horse-teams. Carried to the Penobscot or its tributaries, [[log driving]] in the [[snowmelt]] brought them to waterfall-powered [[sawmill]]s upriver from Bangor. The sawn lumber was then shipped from the city's docks, Bangor being at the head-of-tide (between the rapids and the ocean) to points anywhere in the world. [[Shipbuilding]] was also developed.<ref name='Wood'/> Bangor capitalists also owned most of the forests. The main markets for Bangor lumber were the East Coast cities. Much was also shipped to the [[Caribbean]] and to [[California]] during the [[Gold Rush]], via [[Cape Horn]], before sawmills could be established in the west. Bangorians later helped transplant the Maine culture of lumbering to the [[Pacific Northwest]], and participated directly in the Gold Rush. [[Bangor, Washington]]; [[Bangor, California]]; and Little Bangor, Nevada, are legacies of this contact.<ref name='Wood'>Richard George Wood, ''A History of Lumbering in Maine'', 1820\u201361 (Orono: University of Maine Press, 1971)</ref>\n\nBy 1860, Bangor was the world's largest lumber port, with 150 sawmills operating along the river. The city shipped over 150 million boardfeet of lumber a year, much of it in Bangor-built and Bangor-owned ships. In the year 1860, 3,300 lumbering ships passed by the docks.<ref name=cvb-heritage/>\n\nMany of the [[lumber baron]]s built elaborate [[Greek Revival]] and [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] houses that still stand in the [[Broadway Historic District (Bangor, Maine)|Broadway Historic District]]. Bangor has many substantial old churches, and shade trees.

Being on a northern river, its port froze during the winter, and it could not take the largest ocean-going ships. The comparative lack of settlement in the forested hinterland also gave it a comparatively small home market.<ref>David Demeritt, \"Boards, Barrels, and Boxshooks: The Economics of Downeast Lumber in 19th Century Cuba\" ''Forest and Conservation History'', v. 35, no. 3 (July 1991), p. 112</ref>\n\nIn 1844 the first ocean-going iron-hulled [[steamship]] in the U.S. was named ''The Bangor''. She was built by the [[Harlan and Hollingsworth]] firm of [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1844, and was intended to take passengers between Bangor and Boston. On her second voyage, however, in 1845, she burned to the waterline off [[Castine, Maine|Castine]]. She was rebuilt at [[Bath, Maine|Bath]], returned briefly to her earlier route, but was soon purchased by the U.S. government for use in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].<ref>Edward Mitchell Blanding, \"Bangor, Maine\", ''New England Magazine'', v.

As early as the 1870s, the city promoted a Halifax-to-New York railroad, via Bangor, as the quickest connection between North America and Europe (when combined with steamship service between Britain and Halifax). A [[European and North American Railway]] opened through Bangor, with President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] officiating at the inauguration, but commerce never lived up to the potential. More recent attempts to capture traffic between Halifax and [[Montreal]] by constructing an [[East\u2013West Highway (New England)|East\u2013West Highway]] through Maine have also come to naught.

Both resulted from mid-December [[freshet]]s that cleared the upper river of ice, followed by cold that produced large volumes of [[frazil ice]] or slush which was carried by high flows forming a major ice jam in the lower river. In March of both years, a dynamic breakup of ice ran into the jam and flooded downtown Bangor.

She said, \"The system devised in 1945 precisely to deal with threats of this nature did not work as it was supposed to.\" She added, \"Even in the wake of the flagrant shattering of the international norm against chemical weapons use, Russia continues to hold the council hostage and shirk its international responsibilities. \"What we have learned, what the Syrian people have learned, is that the Security Council the world needs to deal with this crisis is not the Security Council we have.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Gladstone|first=Rick|title=New U.S. Envoy to U.N.

Referring to a law signed in February by Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] that imposes a life sentence upon anyone found guilty of repeated same-sex sexual acts, she said: \"Unfortunately, [[Uganda]]'s anti-gay legislation is not an outlier. Nor is the climate of intolerance and abuse that it has fostered.\" This speech occurred on the first anniversary of [[United States v.

An expeditionary force invaded the Soviet Union in [[Bessarabia]] and southern [[Ukraine]], alongside the German [[Wehrmacht]]. The expeditionary force, 'Army Group Antonescu,' was composed on 22 June 1941 of the [[Third Army (Romania)|3rd Army]], the [[4th Army (Romania)|4th Army]], the [[2nd Army Corps (Romania)|2nd Army Corps]], and the [[11th Mechanised Division (Romania)|11th Infantry Division]].<ref>Leo Niehorster, [http://niehorster.org/031_rumania/41-06/_ag_antonescu.html Army Group Antonescu, 22 June 1941] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305133056/http://www.niehorster.org/031_rumania/41-06/_ag_antonescu.html |date=5 March 2016 }}, accessed June 2011</ref> The 3rd Army comprised the [[4th Army Corps (Romania)|4th Army Corps]] (6th and 7th Infantry Divisions), the Cavalry Corps, the Mountain Corps, two separate artillery battalion, a TA unit, and the Air Force's 3rd Army Cooperation Command. The 4th Army consisted of the [[3rd Army Corps (Romania)|3rd Army Corps]], the [[5th Army Corps (Romania)|5th Army Corps]], the 11th Army Corps (two fortress brigades), and the 4th Army Cooperation Command. The army group-level 2nd Army Corps, under Major General N. Macici, controlled the 9th and 10th Infantry Divisions and the 7th Cavalry Brigade. Additionally the [[1st Armoured Division (Romania)|1st Armoured Division]] was formed for service on the Eastern Front. The Army Group's first offensive, in conjunction with the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|Eleventh Army]], [[Operation Munchen]], enabled Romania to retake the territory immediately east of the [[Transnistria|Dnister]], former part of Moldavia. The Romanian Armies saw their first major battles at [[Siege of Odessa|Odessa]] and [[Battle of Sevastopol|Sevastopol]], and in 1942 advanced with other Axis forces deeper into Soviet territory during [[Operation Blue]].\n\nThe greatest disaster for the Romanian expeditionary force on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] came at [[Romanian Armies in the Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], where, during the Soviet counter-offensive of November 1942, the thinly spread forces of the [[Romanian Third Army|Third Army]] (deployed north of Stalingrad<!--see ''[[Battle of Don's Bend]]''-->) and of the [[Fourth Army (Romania)|Fourth Army]] (deployed south of Stalingrad<!--see ''[[Battle of Kalmuk Steppe]]''-->) were attacked by vastly superior [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces and suffered combined losses of some 158,000 personnel.\n\nDuring April\u2013May 1944 the Romanian forces led by General [[Ioan Mihail Racovi\u0163\u0103|Mihai Racovi\u0163\u01ce]], together with elements of the [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Sixth Army]] were responsible for defending Northern Romania during the Soviet [[First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive]], and took part in the [[Battles of T\u00e2rgu Frumos]]. In late August 1944, the [[Red Army]] entered [[Battle of Romania (1944)|eastern Romania]]. The Battle of Jassy took place on August 20\u201325, 1944. 150 000 German soldiers died (80 000 in Stalingrad), 106 000 Germans was taken as prisoners by the Red Army (108 000 in Stalingrad); the fate of the rest 80 000 remain unknown.  On August 23, 1944, a [[King Michael Coup|coup]] led by King [[Michael I of Romania]] deposed Marshal Antonescu and set up a pro-Soviet government. It has been estimated that the royal coup shortened the war by six months.<ref>\nConstantiniu, Florin, ''O istorie sincer\u0103 a poporului rom\u00e2n'' (\"An Honest History of the Romanian People\"), Ed.

After the expelling of the last Wehrmacht remnants from Romania, the Romanian Armies took part in the [[Battle of Budapest|Siege of Budapest]] and the [[Prague Offensive]] of May 1945.\n\n===Cold War===\n[[File:Defilare 1989.jpg|thumb|Troops of the Romanian People's Army during a parade in [[Bucharest]] in 1989]]\n\nAfter the [[Romanian Communist Party]] seized power, the Armed Forces of Romania was reformed to mirror the soviet model. It was reestablished as the '''[[Romanian People's Army]]''' ({{lang-ro|Armata Popular\u0103 Rom\u00e2n\u0103}}) under the original supervision of Minister of Defence, [[Emil Bodn\u0103ra\u015f]]. Between 1955 and 1991, the Romanian People's Army took part in events of the [[Warsaw Pact]], of which Romania was a member. During this period, the army was supplied with weapons and equipment from the [[Soviet Union]]. From 1947 to 1960, the country divided into 3 military regions: Western ([[Cluj]]), Eastern ([[Bac\u0103u]]), and South ([[Bucharest]]).\n\nIn 1980 the Romanian Land Forces was reorganized in 4 Army Commands: 1st ([[Bucharest]]), 2nd ([[Buzau]]), 3rd ([[Craiova]]) and 4th ([[Cluj-Napoca]]). In the four Army Commands were 8 Mechanized Divisions, 2 Tank Divisions and 1 Tank Brigade, as well as 4 Mountain Brigades (specialized motorized infantry bands).\n\nIn 1989 the RLF had, as armored equipment, a total of 2715 combat vehicles: 945 outdated (soviet WW-2 type) T-34-85 tanks, 790 soviet and Czechoslovak T-55/-55A/-55AM tanks, 415 Romanian built TR-77-580, 535 Romanian built TR-85-800 and 30 soviet T-72 \"Ural-1\" tanks.\n\n===Post-1990===\nThe People's Army was dissolved after the [[Romanian Revolution]] in the beginning of 1990 and was rebranded as the Romanian Armed Forces. Since 1994, Romania has been actively participating in the [[Partnership for Peace]] program and on 29 March 2004, it officially joined the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]]. During the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] in 1999, Romania placed its territory and airspace at disposal for NATO troop and even sent troops to the [[Kosovo Force]] contingent in the summer of 1999 to stabilize the situation in [[Kosovo]] and [[Metohija]]. On 15 November 2002, [[Hungary]], Romania, [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]] created a multinational engineering battalion called \"''Tisa''\" , which includes an engineering company from the armed forces.<ref>[http://www.regnum.ru/news/1198076.html \u0420\u0443\u043c\u044b\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u0432\u044b\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0438\u0437 \u0418\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430] // REGNUM.RU \u043e\u0442 21 \u0430\u0432\u0433\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0430 2009</ref> Romania has taken part in the [[War in Afghanistan]] since July 2002, with Romanian contingent being increased from 962 to more than 1,500 troops in 2009.<ref name=autogenerated1>\u0420\u0443\u043c\u044b\u043d\u0438\u044f // \u00ab\u0417\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u00bb, \u2116\u00a09 (798), \u0441\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044c 2013. \u0441\u0442\u0440.\u202f91</ref><ref>Tony Perry.

The Central Powers drove deep into Romania and conquered the south of the country ([[Wallachia]], including Bucharest) by the end of 1916.  The Romanian forces, led by [[Marshal]] [[Constantin Prezan]], retreated into the north-east part of Romania ([[Moldavia]]). In the summer of 1917 however, Prezan, aided by the future Marshal, [[General]] [[Ion Antonescu]], successfully defended the remaining unoccupied territories against German and Austro-Hungarian forces led by [[Field Marshal]] [[August von Mackensen]].<ref>Vincent Esposito, ''Atlas of American Wars, Vol 2'', text for map 40</ref> General [[Alexandru Averescu]] led the Second Army in the victories of the [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u015fti]] (July 22 to August 1, 1917) and the [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u015fe\u015fti]] (August 6 to September 8, 1917).

The army group-level 2nd Army Corps, under Major General N. Macici, controlled the 9th and 10th Infantry Divisions and the 7th Cavalry Brigade. Additionally the [[1st Armoured Division (Romania)|1st Armoured Division]] was formed for service on the Eastern Front. The Army Group's first offensive, in conjunction with the [[11th Army (Wehrmacht)|Eleventh Army]], [[Operation Munchen]], enabled Romania to retake the territory immediately east of the [[Transnistria|Dnister]], former part of Moldavia. The Romanian Armies saw their first major battles at [[Siege of Odessa|Odessa]] and [[Battle of Sevastopol|Sevastopol]], and in 1942 advanced with other Axis forces deeper into Soviet territory during [[Operation Blue]].\n\nThe greatest disaster for the Romanian expeditionary force on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] came at [[Romanian Armies in the Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], where, during the Soviet counter-offensive of November 1942, the thinly spread forces of the [[Romanian Third Army|Third Army]] (deployed north of Stalingrad<!--see ''[[Battle of Don's Bend]]''-->) and of the [[Fourth Army (Romania)|Fourth Army]] (deployed south of Stalingrad<!--see ''[[Battle of Kalmuk Steppe]]''-->) were attacked by vastly superior [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] forces and suffered combined losses of some 158,000 personnel.\n\nDuring April\u2013May 1944 the Romanian forces led by General [[Ioan Mihail Racovi\u0163\u0103|Mihai Racovi\u0163\u01ce]], together with elements of the [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Sixth Army]] were responsible for defending Northern Romania during the Soviet [[First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive]], and took part in the [[Battles of T\u00e2rgu Frumos]].

During this period, the army was supplied with weapons and equipment from the [[Soviet Union]]. From 1947 to 1960, the country divided into 3 military regions: Western ([[Cluj]]), Eastern ([[Bac\u0103u]]), and South ([[Bucharest]]).\n\nIn 1980 the Romanian Land Forces was reorganized in 4 Army Commands: 1st ([[Bucharest]]), 2nd ([[Buzau]]), 3rd ([[Craiova]]) and 4th ([[Cluj-Napoca]]). In the four Army Commands were 8 Mechanized Divisions, 2 Tank Divisions and 1 Tank Brigade, as well as 4 Mountain Brigades (specialized motorized infantry bands).\n\nIn 1989 the RLF had, as armored equipment, a total of 2715 combat vehicles: 945 outdated (soviet WW-2 type) T-34-85 tanks, 790 soviet and Czechoslovak T-55/-55A/-55AM tanks, 415 Romanian built TR-77-580, 535 Romanian built TR-85-800 and 30 soviet T-72 \"Ural-1\" tanks.\n\n===Post-1990===\nThe People's Army was dissolved after the [[Romanian Revolution]] in the beginning of 1990 and was rebranded as the Romanian Armed Forces.
