His accomplishments include three NBA championships, four [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards]], three [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|Finals MVP Awards]], and two [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic gold medals]]. James holds the all-time record for [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders|playoffs points]], is third in [[List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders|all-time points]], and eighth in [[List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders|all-time assists]]. James was selected to the [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA First Team]] twelve times (all-time record), made the [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive First Team]] five times, and has played in sixteen [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star Games]], in which he was selected [[NBA All-Star Game MVP Award|All-Star MVP]] three times.\n\nJames played basketball for [[St. Vincent\u2013St. Mary High School]] in his hometown of [[Akron, Ohio]], where he was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar. A [[prep-to-pro]], he joined Cleveland in [[2003 NBA draft|2003]] as the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall draft pick]]. Named the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]] [[NBA Rookie of the Year Award|NBA Rookie of the Year]], he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, winning the NBA MVP Award in 2009 and 2010. After failing to win a championship with Cleveland, James left in 2010 to sign as a [[Free agent (NBA)|free agent]] with Miami. This move was announced in an [[ESPN]] special titled ''[[The Decision (TV special)|The Decision]]'', and is one of the most controversial free agent decisions in American sports history.\n\nJames won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in [[2012 NBA Finals|2012]] and [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]]; in both of these years, he also earned league MVP and Finals MVP. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract to re-sign with the Cavaliers. In [[2016 NBA Finals|2016]], he led the Cavaliers to victory over the [[2015\u201316 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] in the [[2016 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]] by [[Comeback (sports)|coming back]] from a 3\u20131 deficit, delivering the franchise's first championship and ending [[Cleveland sports curse|Cleveland's 52-year professional sports title drought]]. In 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers to sign with the Lakers.\n\nOff the court, James has accumulated additional wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. His public life has been the subject of much scrutiny, and he has been ranked as one of America's most influential and popular athletes. He has been featured in books, documentaries, and television commercials. He has also hosted the [[ESPY Awards]] and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and appeared in the 2015 film ''[[Trainwreck (film)|Trainwreck]]''. The LeBron James Family Foundation charity builds upon his vision to improve education for students in Akron, Ohio.\n\n==Early life==\nJames was born on December 30, 1984 in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]],

Among them Oscar Messano, Anthony Harris and Edmundo Valente from [[:es:CABASE|CABASE]], Fabio Marinho, member of the [[Brazilian Internet Steering Committee]] (CGI.br) and President of ASSESPRO \u2013 Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Empresas de Software Servi\u00e7os de Inform\u00e1tica e Internet,  Raimundo Beca - AHCIET \u2013 Asociaci\u00f3n Hispanoamericana de Centros de Investigaci\u00f3n y Empresas de Telecomunicaciones, Brasil, [[NIC M\u00e9xico]] - Oscar Robles and German Valdez, y Julian Dunayevich, Raul Echeverria, ENRED.\n\nThose organizations joined by eCOMLAC \u2013 Federaci\u00f3n Latino Americana y Caribe\u00f1a para Internet y el Comercio Electr\u00f4nico, argumented that Latin American IPs addresses could be handled by a local entity and reached an agreement for its creation.\nOthers persons participated in these early discussion, among the Eliezer Cadenas (ENRED), Fidel Vienegas (AHCIET), Raphael Mandarino (CGI.br).\n\nFinally, the agreement for creation of LACNIC (Latin American and Caribbean IP Address Regional Registry), was signed in Santiago de Chile on August 22, 1999 during the second ICANN meeting.\n\nAn Interim Board was defined with six members:\n* AHCIET \u2013 Raimundo Beca;\n* CABASE \u2013 Jorge Plano, later substituted by Oscar Messano;\n* CGI.br \u2013 Jos\u00e9 Luis Ribeiro;\n* ENRED \u2013 Julian Dunayerich; later substituted by Raul Echeverria;\n* NIC.mx \u2013 German Valdez;\n* ECOMLAC \u2013 Fabio Marinho;\n\nNext step, this LACNIC Interim Board submitted on August 26, 1999, this agreement to Esther Dyson, then Chair of ICANN Interim Board for ICANN approval.\n\nA Business Plan of this new organization was developed and presented to [[ARIN]], the organization responsible for this region at that moment.

It serves as the official [[app store]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the [[Android software development|Android software development kit]] (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a [[digital media]] store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, [[Google Store]], on March 11, 2015, and it also offered news publications and magazines before the revamp of [[Google News]] on May 15, 2018.\n\nApplications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] Play Store [[mobile app]] or by [[Software deployment|deploying]] the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 3.5 million apps published in 2017.<ref name=\"3.5 million apps\"/> It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which [[Malware|malicious software]] has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.\n\nGoogle Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are [[Google Play Books]], [[Google Play Games]], [[Google Play Movies & TV]] and [[Google Play Music]]. Following their re-branding, Google has gradually expanded the geographical support for each of the services.\n\n== Catalog content ==\n\n=== Android applications ===\n{{Further|Android (operating

The application used a [[JavaScript]] exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that \"We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of\". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that \"As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer\".

It serves as the official [[app store]] for the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]], allowing users to browse and download applications developed with the [[Android software development|Android software development kit]] (SDK) and published through Google. Google Play also serves as a [[digital media]] store, offering music, books, movies, and television programs. It previously offered Google hardware devices for purchase until the introduction of a separate online hardware retailer, [[Google Store]], on March 11, 2015, and it also offered news publications and magazines before the revamp of [[Google News]] on May 15, 2018.\n\nApplications are available through Google Play either free of charge or at a cost. They can be downloaded directly on an Android device through the [[proprietary software|proprietary]] Play Store [[mobile app]] or by [[Software deployment|deploying]] the application to a device from the Google Play website. Applications exploiting hardware capabilities of a device can be targeted to users of devices with specific hardware components, such as a motion sensor (for motion-dependent games) or a front-facing camera (for online video calling). The Google Play store had over 82 billion app downloads in 2016 and has reached over 3.5 million apps published in 2017.<ref name=\"3.5 million apps\"/> It has been the subject of multiple issues concerning security, in which [[Malware|malicious software]] has been approved and uploaded to the store and downloaded by users, with varying degrees of severity.\n\nGoogle Play was launched on March 6, 2012, bringing together Android Market, Google Music, and the Google eBookstore under one brand, marking a shift in Google's digital distribution strategy. The services included in Google Play are [[Google Play Books]], [[Google Play Games]], [[Google Play Movies & TV]] and [[Google Play Music]]. Following their re-branding, Google has gradually expanded the geographical support for each of the services.\n\n== Catalog content ==\n\n=== Android applications ===\n{{Further|Android (operating

The application used a [[JavaScript]] exploit to steal contacts, SMS messages, and photos, and was also capable of making the phone open arbitrary web pages or launch [[denial-of-service attack]]s. Nicholas Percoco, senior vice president of Trustwave's SpiderLabs advanced security team, stated that \"We wanted to test the bounds of what it's capable of\". The app stayed on Google Play for more than two weeks, being repeatedly scanned by the Bouncer system without detection, with Percoco further saying that \"As an attack, all a malware attacker has to do to get into Google Play is to bypass Bouncer\".
