In it the Oxford academics detail with considerable rigour how on a visit to [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in 1901 they believed they had found themselves walking in the Trianon of 1789 and seen [[Marie Antoinette|Marie-Antoinette]].  Their account was initially published in 1911 under the pseudonyms Miss Morison and Miss Lamont, in a vain attempt to protect their reputations. Jourdain died in 1924 whilst principal, her demise possibly brought on by the criticism she and Moberly received for daring to involve Oxford University in something so unscientific.  For the 1931 edition, and to support Moberly, Edith invited the scientist [[J. W. Dunne|J.W. Dunne]] to introduce the account with a note concerning his interest in [[Serialism (philosophy)|Serialism]] (and its fourth dimension) and how this might explain what Moberly and Jourdain had seen.

Moberly's father had been Bishop of Salisbury and she had seen two such birds an hour after his death in 1885. She told Edith this when she first arrived at St Hugh's College, having won a scholarship organized by the current Bishop of Salisbury. Edith's friends would have been familiar with these stories of the unexplained and suitably infected by her enthusiasm.  [[David Herbert]], second son of Reginald, Earl of Pembroke, recalling her funeral, wrote: \u2018As they lowered her coffin into the grave, with swish of wings a pigeon flew up into the sky.

However, when the excavator Mr Keiller began searching for this avenue she did not have the courage to tell him where to start digging.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Without Knowing Mr. Walkley|last=Olivier|first=Edith|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=229\u201330}}</ref>\n\n=== Misses Moberly and Jourdain ===\nEdith was a published author when she was asked to write the preface to the 1931 fourth edition of the popular ''An Adventure'' by Charlotte Anne Moberly (principal of St Hugh's College, Oxford from its foundation in 1886-1915) and her successor Eleanor Jourdain. In it the Oxford academics detail with considerable rigour how on a visit to Versailles in 1901 they believed they had found themselves walking in the Trianon of 1789 and seen Marie-Antoinette.  Their account was initially published in 1911 under the pseudonyms Miss Morison and Miss Lamont, in a vain attempt to protect their reputations. Jourdain died in 1924 whilst principal, her demise possibly brought on by the criticism she and Moberly received for daring to involve Oxford University in something so unscientific.  For the 1931 edition, and to support Moberly, Edith invited the scientist J.W. Dunne to introduce the account with a note concerning his interest in Serialism (and its fourth-dimension) and how this might explain what Moberly and Jourdain had seen. And perhaps what occasionally happened to her.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Adventure|last=Moberly and Jourdain|first=|publisher=Faber and Faber|year=1931|isbn=|location=London|pages=9\u201332}}</ref>\n\n=== The Bishop's Birds ===\nEdith was familiar with the legend that two white birds would be seen flying over Salisbury cathedral upon the death of a Bishop of Salisbury. Moberly's father had been Bishop of Salisbury and she had seen two such birds an hour after his death in 1885. She told Edith this when she first arrived at St Hugh's College having won a scholarship organized by the current Bishop of Salisbury. Edith's friends would have been familiar with these stories of the unexplained and suitably infected by her enthusiasm.  David Herbert, second son of Reginald, Earl of Pembroke, recalling her funeral, wrote: \u2018As they lowered her coffin into the grave, with swish of wings a pigeon flew up into the sky.

In the left hand Mr. LINCOLN holds the Emancipation Proclamation, and in his right the pen with which he has just signed it.

To give eclat to the occasion various functionaries connected with the national and State Governments, the corporate authorities of the city, literary and scientific bodies, and a number of citizens distinguished by services and merit were invited to attend.

The expedition leader, [[John White (surveyor)|John White]], returned to England for supplies that same year but was unable to return to the colony due to war between England and Spain. When he finally did return in 1590, he found the colony abandoned. The houses were intact, but the colonists had completely disappeared. Although there are a number of theories about the fate of the colony, it remains a mystery and has come to be known as the [[Roanoke Colony|\"Lost Colony\"]]. Two English children were born in this colony; the first was named [[Virginia Dare]] \u2013 [[Dare County, North Carolina]], was named in honor of the baby, who was among those whose fate is unknown.

They erected a cross and named the point of land [[Cape Henry]], in honor of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the eldest son of King James.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nTheir instructions were to select a location inland along a waterway where they would be less vulnerable to the Spanish or other Europeans also seeking to establish colonies. They sailed westward into the Bay and reached the mouth of [[Hampton Roads]], stopping at a location now known as [[Old Point Comfort]]. Keeping the shoreline to their right, they then ventured up the largest river, which they named the [[James River (Virginia)|James]], for their king. After exploring at least as far upriver as the confluence of the [[Appomattox River]] at present-day [[Hopewell, Virginia|Hopewell]], they returned downstream to [[Jamestown Island]], which offered a favorable defensive position against enemy ships and deep water anchorage adjacent to the land. Within two weeks they had constructed their first fort and named their settlement [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn addition to securing gold and other precious minerals to send back to the waiting investors in England, the survival plan for the Jamestown colonists depended upon regular supplies from England and trade with the [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. The location they selected was largely cut off from the mainland and offered little game for hunting, no fresh drinking water, and very limited ground for farming. Captain Newport returned to England twice, delivering the First Supply and the Second Supply missions during 1608, and leaving the ''Discovery'' for the use of the colonists. However, death from disease and conflicts with the Natives Americans took a fearsome toll of the colonists. Despite attempts at mining minerals, growing silk, and exporting the native Virginia tobacco, no profitable exports had been identified, and it was unclear whether the settlement would survive financially.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== Powhatan Confederacy ====\n{{See also|Powhatan Confederacy}}\nThe [[Powhatan Confederacy]] was a [[confederation]] of numerous linguistically related tribes in the eastern part of Virginia. The Powhatan Confederacy controlled a territory known as [[Tsenacommacah]], which roughly corresponded with the [[Tidewater region]] of Virginia. It was in this territory that the English established Jamestown. At the time of the English arrival, the Powhatan were led by the [[paramount chief]] [[Wahunsenacawh]].\n\n==== Popham colony and Plymouth company ====\n\nOn May 31, 1607, about 100 men and boys left England for what is now [[Maine]]. Approximately three months later, the group landed on a wooded peninsula where the Kennebec River meets the Atlantic Ocean and began building Fort St. George. By the end of the year, due to limited resources, half of the colonists returned to England. Late the next year, the remaining 45 sailed home, and the Plymouth company fell dormant.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maine's Lost Colony |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/maines-lost-colony-106323660/ |website=Smithsonian |accessdate=June 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Charter of 1609 \u2013 the London company expands ====\n{{Main|Second Virginia Charter}}\n[[File:Wpdms virginia company plymouth council.png|thumb|The 1609 charter for the Virginia colony \"from sea to sea\"]]\n\nIn 1609, with the abandonment of the Plymouth Company settlement, the London Company's Virginia charter was adjusted to include the territory north of the [[34th parallel north|34th parallel]] and south of the [[39th parallel north|39th parallel]], with its original coastal grant extended \"from sea to sea\". Thus, at least according to James I's writ, the Virginia Colony in its original sense extended to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, in what is now California, with all the states in between ([[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], etc.) belonging to Virginia. For practical purposes, though, the colonists rarely ventured far inland to what was known as \"The Virginia Wilderness\", although the concept itself helped renew the interest of investors, and additional funds enabled an expanded effort, known as the [[Third Supply]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== 1609 Third Supply and Bermuda ====\n{{Main|History of Bermuda|Somers Isles Company}}\n[[File:Virginia and Florida by W.

The ''[[Sea Venture]]'' was specifically designed for emigration of additional colonists and transporting supplies. It became the [[flagship]] of the Admiral of the convoy, Sir [[George Somers]]. The Third Supply was the largest to date, with eight other ships joining the ''Sea Venture''. The new Captain of the ''Sea Venture'' was the mission's Vice-Admiral, Christopher Newport. Hundreds of new colonists were aboard the ships. However, weather was to drastically affect the mission.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nA few days out of London, the nine ships of the third supply mission encountered a massive hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. They became separated during the three days the storm lasted. Admiral Somers had the new ''Sea Venture'', carrying most of the supplies of the mission, deliberately driven aground onto the reefs of [[Bermuda]] to avoid sinking. However, while there was no loss of life, the ship was wrecked beyond repair, stranding its survivors on the uninhabited [[archipelago]], to which they laid claim for England.<ref>Hobson Woodward.

Seven of the other ships had arrived carrying more colonists, but little in the way of food and supplies. Combined with a drought, and hostile relations with the [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]], the loss of the supplies that had been aboard the ''Sea Venture'' resulted in the [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|Starving Time]] in late 1609 to May 1610, during which over 80% of the colonists perished.

Depositing his passengers and limited supplies, he returned to England with word of the plight of the colonists at Jamestown. The King authorized another leader, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], later better known as \"Lord Delaware\", to have greater powers, and the London Company organized another supply mission. They set sail from London on April 1, 1610.\n\nJust after the survivors of the Starving Time and those who had joined them from Bermuda had abandoned Jamestown, the ships of the new supply mission sailed up the James River with food, supplies, a doctor, and more colonists. Lord Delaware was determined that the colony was to survive, and he intercepted the departing ships about {{convert|10|mi|km}} downstream of Jamestown. The colonists thanked [[Divine providence|Providence]] for the Colony's salvation.\n\nWest proved far harsher and more belligerent toward the Indians than any of his predecessors, engaging in wars of conquest against them. He first sent Gates to drive off the Kecoughtan from their village on July 9, 1610, then gave Chief Powhatan an ultimatum to either return all English subjects and property, or face war. Powhatan responded by insisting that the English either stay in their fort or leave Virginia. Enraged, De la Warr had the hand of a [[Paspahegh]] captive cut off and sent him to the paramount chief with another ultimatum: Return all English subjects and property, or the neighboring villages would be burned. This time, Powhatan did not even respond.\n\n==== First Anglo-Powhatan War (1610\u20131614), John Rolfe and Pocahontas ====\n\nOn August 9, 1610, tired of waiting for a response from Powhatan, West sent George Percy with 70 men to attack the Paspahegh capital, burning the houses and cutting down their cornfields. They killed 65 to 75, and captured one of Wowinchopunk's wives and her children. Returning downstream, the English threw the children overboard and shot out \"their Braynes in the water\". The queen was put to the sword in Jamestown. The Paspahegh never recovered from this attack and abandoned their town. Another small force sent with Samuel Argall against the Warraskoyaks found that they had already fled, but he destroyed their abandoned village and cornfields as well. This event triggered the first Anglo-Powhatan War.\n\nAmong the individuals who had briefly abandoned Jamestown was [[John Rolfe]], a ''Sea Venture'' survivor who had lost his wife and son in Bermuda. He was a businessman from London who had some untried seeds for new, sweeter strains of [[tobacco]] with him, as well as some untried marketing ideas. It would turn out that John Rolfe held the key to the Colony's economic success. By 1612, Rolfe's new strains of tobacco had been successfully cultivated and exported, establishing a first [[cash crop]] for [[export]]. [[Plantations in the American South|Plantations]] and new outposts sprung up starting with [[Henricus]], initially both upriver and downriver along the navigable portion of the James, and thereafter along the other rivers and waterways of the area. The settlement at Jamestown could finally be considered permanently established.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Story of Jamestown |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hh/2/hh2b3.htm |work=NPS Historical Handbook |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA period of peace followed the marriage in 1614 of colonist John Rolfe to [[Pocahontas]], the daughter of Algonquian chief [[Chief Powhatan|Powhatan]].\n\n==== Second Anglo-Powhatan War (1622\u20131632) ====\n\n===== Indian Massacre of 1622 =====\n{{Main|Indian Massacre of 1622}}\n[[File:1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Indian massacre of 1622, depicted in a 1628 woodcut by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]] out of [[Theodore de Bry]]'s workshop]]\n\nThe relations with the Natives took a turn for the worse after the death of Pocahontas in England and the return of John Rolfe and other colonial leaders in May 1617. Disease, poor harvests and the growing demand for tobacco lands caused hostilities to escalate.\n\nAfter Wahunsenacawh's death in 1618, he was soon succeeded by his own younger brother, Opechancanough. He maintained friendly relations with the Colony on the surface, negotiating with them through his warrior [[Nemattanew]], but by 1622, after Nemattanew had been slain, Opechancanough was ready to order a limited surprise attack on them, hoping to persuade them to move on and settle elsewhere.\n\nChief Opechancanough organized and led a well-coordinated series of surprise attacks on multiple English settlements along both sides of a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} long stretch of the James River, which took place early on the morning of March 22, 1622. This event came to be known as the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]] and resulted in the deaths of 347 colonists (including men, women, and children) and the abduction of many others. The Massacre caught most of the Virginia Colony by surprise and virtually wiped out several entire communities, including [[Henricus]] and [[Wolstenholme Town]] at [[Martin's Hundred]].\n\nJamestown was spared from destruction, however, due to a Virginia Indian boy named [[Chanco]] who, after learning of the planned attacks from his brother, gave warning to colonist [[Richard Pace (Jamestown)|Richard Pace]] with whom he lived. Pace, after securing himself and his neighbors on the south side of the James River, took a canoe across river to warn Jamestown, which narrowly escaped destruction, although there was no time to warn the other settlements.\n\nA year later, Captain [[William Tucker (Jamestown)|William Tucker]] and Dr. [[John Pott]]s worked out a truce with the Powhatan and proposed a toast using liquor laced with poison. 200 Virginia Indians were killed or made ill by the poison and 50 more were slaughtered by the colonists. For over a decade, the English settlers killed Powhatan men and women, captured children and systematically razed villages, seizing or destroying crops.\n\nBy 1634, a six-mile-long [[palisade]] was completed across the [[Virginia Peninsula]]. The new palisade provided some security from attacks by the Virginia Indians for colonists farming and fishing lower on the Peninsula from that point.\n\nOn April 18, 1644, Opechancanough again tried to force the colonists to abandon the region with another series of coordinated attacks, killing almost 500 colonists. However, this was a much less devastating portion of the growing population than had been the case in the 1622 attacks.\n\nThe forces of Royal Governor of Virginia [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] captured the old warrior in 1646,<ref>Rountree, Helen C. ''Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough: Three Indian Lives Changed by Jamestown''. University of Virginia Press: Charlottesville, 2005</ref> variously thought to be between 90 and 100 years old. In October, while a prisoner, Opechancanough was killed by a soldier (shot in the back) assigned to guard him.\n\n=== Crown colony (1624\u20131652) ===\n[[File:Virginia Colonial Records - Briefe Declaration.jpg|thumb|Briefe Declaration of 1624]]\nIn 1620, a successor to the Plymouth Company sent colonists to the New World aboard the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Known as [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], they successfully established a settlement in what became [[Massachusetts]]. The portion of what had been Virginia north of the 40th parallel became known as [[New England]], according to books written by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]], who had made a voyage there.\n\nIn 1624, the charter of the Virginia Company was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority in the form of a [[crown colony]]. Subsequent charters for the [[Maryland Colony]] in 1632 and to the eight [[Lords Proprietor]] of the [[Province of Carolina]] in 1663 and 1665 further reduced the Virginia Colony to roughly the coastal borders it held until the [[American Revolution]]. (The exact border with North Carolina was disputed until surveyed by [[William Byrd II]] in 1728.)\n<!--dispute over [[Kent Island, Maryland]]-->\n\n==== Third Anglo-Powhatan War (1644\u20131646) ====\n\nAfter twelve years of peace following the Indian Wars of 1622\u20131632, another Anglo\u2013Powhatan War began on March 18, 1644, as a last effort by the remnants of the Powhatan Confederacy, still under [[Opechancanough]], to dislodge the English settlers of the Virginia Colony. Around 500 colonists were killed, but that number represented a relatively low percent of the overall population, as opposed to the earlier massacre (the 1622 attack had wiped out a third; that of 1644 barely a tenth). However, Opechancanough, still preferring to use Powhatan tactics, did not make any major follow-up to this attack.\n\nThis was followed by a last effort by the settlers to decimate the Powhatan. In July, they marched against the Pamunkey, Chickahominy, and Powhatan proper; and south of the James, against the Appomattoc, Weyanoke, Warraskoyak, and Nansemond, as well as two Carolina tribes, the [[Chowanoke]] and [[Secotan]].\n\nIn February 1645, the colony ordered the construction of three frontier forts: Fort Charles at the falls of the James, Fort James on the Chickahominy, and Fort Royal at the falls of the York. In August, Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] stormed Opechancanough's stronghold and captured him. All captured males in the village over age 11 were deported to [[Tangier Island]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/jame1/moretti-langholtz/chap4.htm A Study of Virginia Indians]</ref> Opechancanough, around 92 years old, was taken to Jamestown where he was shot in the back by a guard. Opechancanough's death resulted in the disintegration of the Powhatan Confederacy into its component tribes, whom the colonists continued to attack. In March 1646, the colony decided to build a fourth frontier fort, [[Fort Henry (Virginia)|Fort Henry]], at the falls of the Appomattox, where the modern city of Petersburg is located.\n\n==== Treaty of 1646 ====\n[[File:1646linemap.jpg|thumb|Red line showing the boundary between the Virginia Colony and Tributary Indian tribes, as established by the Treaty of 1646. The Red dot shows Jamestown, the capital of the Virginia Colony.]]\n\nIn the peace treaty of October 1646, the new ''weroance'', [[Necotowance]], and the subtribes formerly in the Confederacy, each became tributaries to the King of England. At the same time, a racial frontier was delineated between Indian and English settlements, with members of each group forbidden to cross to the other side except by special pass obtained at one of the newly erected border forts. The extent of the Virginia colony open to patent by English colonists was defined as: All the land between the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York]] rivers, and up to the navigable point of each of the major rivers \u2013 which were connected by a straight line running directly from modern Franklin on the Blackwater, northwesterly to the Appomattoc village beside Fort Henry, and continuing in the same direction to the [[Monacan (tribe)|Monocan]] village above the falls of the James, where Fort Charles was built, then turning sharp right, to Fort Royal on the York (Pamunkey) river. Necotowance thus ceded the English vast tracts of still-uncolonized land, much of it between the James and Blackwater. English settlements on the peninsula north of the York and below the Poropotank were also allowed, as they had already been there since 1640.\n\n=== English Civil War and Commonwealth (1642\u20131660) ===\n{{See also|Virginia Cavaliers (historical)}}\n\nWhile the newer, Puritan colonies, most notably [[Massachusetts]], were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies sided with the Crown. The [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company's]] two settlements, Virginia and [[Bermuda]] (Bermuda's Independent Puritans were expelled as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]], settling the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]]), [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]] were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown, and were singled out by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October 1650. This dictated that\n<blockquote>due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.</blockquote>\n\nThe Act also authorised Parliamentary [[privateer]]s to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies: \"All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.\"\n\nVirginia's population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the [[English Civil War]].

While a military failure, its handling did result in Governor Berkeley being recalled to England.\n\nIn 1679, the Treaty of Middle Plantation was signed.\n\n==== Williamsburg era ====\n{{Further|James Blair (Virginia)|Alexander Spotswood|Sir William Gooch, 1st Baronet|Robert Dinwiddie|Francis Fauquier}}\n\nThe largest and richest and most influential of the American colonies was Virginia, where conservatives were in full control of the colonial and local governments. At the local level, Church of England parishes handled many local affairs, and they in turn were controlled not by the minister, but rather by a closed circle of rich landowners who comprised the parish vestry. Ronald L. Heinemann emphasizes the ideological conservatism of Virginia, while noting there were also religious dissenters who were gaining strength by the 1760s:\n:The tobacco planters and farmers of Virginia adhered to the concept of a hierarchical society that they or their ancestors had brought with them from England. Most held to the general idea of a Great Chain of Being: at the top were God and his heavenly host; next came kings...who were divinely sanctioned to rule, then an hereditary aristocracy who were followed in descending order by wealthy landed gentry, small, independent farmers, tenant farmers, servants....Aspirations to rise above one's station in life were considered a sin.<ref>Ronald L. Heinemann et al. ''Old Dominion, New Commonwealth: A History of Virginia, 1607\u20132007'' (2007) p 67</ref>\n\nIn actual practice, colonial Virginia never had a bishop to represent God nor a hereditary aristocracy with titles like 'duke' or 'baron'. However it did have a royal governor appointed by the king, as well as a powerful landed gentry. The status quo was strongly reinforced by what Jefferson called \"feudal and unnatural distinctions\" that were vital to the maintenance of aristocracy in Virginia. He targeted laws such as [[entail]] and [[primogeniture]] by which the oldest son inherited all the land. As a result increasingly large plantations, worked by white tenant farmers and by black slaves, gained in size and wealth and political power in the eastern (\"Tidewater\") tobacco areas.  Maryland and South Carolina had similar hierarchical systems, as did New York and Pennsylvania.<ref>Holly Brewer, \"Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia: 'Ancient Feudal Restraints' and Revolutionary Reform,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1997) 54#2 307\u2013346 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2953276 in JSTOR]</ref> During the Revolutionary era, all such laws were repealed by the new states.<ref>Richard B.

For much of the 17th century, English contact and conflict was mostly with the [[Algonquian peoples]] that populated the coastal regions, primarily the Powhatan Confederacy. Following a series of wars and the decline of the Powhatan as a political entity, the colonists expanded westward in the late 17th and 18th centuries, encountering the [[Shawnee]], [[Iroquoian]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Nottoway people|Nottoway]], [[Meherrin]], [[Iroquois]] and [[Cherokee]], as well as [[Siouan]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Tutelo people|Tutelo]], [[Saponi people|Saponi]], and [[Occaneechi]].\n\n=== Iroquois Confederacy ===\n{{See also|Iroquois Confederacy}}\n[[File:5NationsExpansion.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of the [[Iroquois]] expansion during the Beaver Wars, 1638\u20131711]]\n\nAs the English settlements expanded beyond the Tidewater territory traditionally occupied by the Powhatan, they encountered new groups with which there had been minimal relations with the Colony.\n\nIn the late 17th century, the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] expanded into the Western region of Virginia as part of the [[Beaver Wars]]. They arrived shortly before the English settlers, and displaced the resident [[Siouan languages|Siouan tribes]].<!--In the late 17th century, [[Chain covenant]]; Treaty of Albany (1684)-->\n\nLt. Gov. [[Alexander Spotswood]] made further advances in policy with the Virginia Indians along the frontier. In 1714, he established [[Fort Christanna]] to help educate and trade with several tribes with which the colony had friendly relations, as well as to help protect them from hostile tribes. In 1722, he negotiated the [[Treaty of Albany (1722)|Treaty of Albany]].\n\n=== Lord Dunmore's War ===\n{{Main|Lord Dunmore's War}}\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|Environment of Virginia}}\nThe cultural geography of colonial Virginia gradually evolved, with a variety of settlement and jurisdiction models experimented with. By the late 17th century and into the 18th century, the primary settlement pattern was based on plantations (to grow tobacco), farms, and some towns (mostly ports or courthouse villages).\n\n=== Early settlements ===\nThe fort at Jamestown, founded in 1607, remained the primary settlement of the colonists for several years. A few strategic outposts were constructed, including [[Fort Algernon]] (1609) at the entrance to the James River.\n\nEarly attempts to occupy strategic locations already inhabited by natives at what is now [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]] failed owing to native resistance.\n\nA short distance farther up the James, in 1611, [[Thomas Dale]] began the construction of a progressive development at [[Henricus]] on and about what was later known as [[Farrars Island]]. Henricus was envisioned as possible replacement capital for Jamestown, and was to have the first college in Virginia. (The ill-fated Henricus was destroyed during the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]]). In addition to creating the new settlement at Henricus, Dale also established the port town of [[Bermuda Hundred (Town)|Bermuda Hundred]], as well as [[City Point, Virginia|\"Bermuda Cittie\"]] (sic) in 1613, now part of [[Hopewell, Virginia]]. He began the excavation work at [[Dutch Gap]], using methods he had learned while serving in [[Holland]].\n\n=== \"Hundreds\" ===\n[[File:Virginia Under the Stuarts - Dale's Settlements.png|thumb|Bermuda Hundred and other early English settlements upriver of Jamestown]]\nOnce tobacco had been established as an export cash crop, investors became more interested and groups of them united to create largely self-sufficient \"hundreds.\" The term [[Hundred (country subdivision)|\"hundred\"]] is a traditional English name for an administrative division of a shire (or county) to define an area which would support one hundred heads of household.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hundred |title=Hundred &#124; Define Hundred at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> In the colonial era in Virginia, the \"hundreds\" were large developments of many acres, necessary to support land hungry tobacco crops. The \"hundreds\" were required to be at least several miles from any existing community. Soon, these patented tracts of land sprang up along the rivers. The investors sent shiploads of settlers and supplies to Virginia to establish the new developments. The administrative centers of Virginia's hundreds were essentially small towns or villages, and were often palisaded for defense.\n\nAn example was [[Martin's Hundred]], located downstream from Jamestown on the north bank of the James River. It was sponsored by the [[Martin's Hundred Society]], a group of investors in London. It was settled in 1618, and [[Wolstenholme Towne]] was its administrative center, named for Sir John Wolstenholme, one of the investors.\n\n[[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia|Bermuda Hundred]] (now in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]]) and [[Flowerdew Hundred]] (now in [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George County]]) are other names which have survived over centuries. Others included [[Berkeley Hundred]], Bermuda Nether Hundred, Bermuda Upper Hundred, [[Smith's Hundred]], Digges Hundred, West Hundred and Shirley Hundred (and, in Bermuda, ''Harrington Hundreds'').\n\nIncluding the creation of the \"hundreds\", the various incentives to investors in the Virginia Colony finally paid off by 1617. By this time, the colonists were exporting 50,000 pounds of tobacco to England a year and were beginning to generate enough profit to ensure the economic survival of the colony.\n\n=== Cities, Shires, and Counties ===\n{{Main|Shires of Virginia|Counties of Virginia}}\nIn 1619, the plantations and developments were divided into four \"incorporations\" or \"citties\" (sic), as they were called. These were [[Charles City (Virginia Company)|Charles Cittie]], [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]], [[Henrico City (Virginia Company)|Henrico Cittie]], and [[James City (Virginia Company)|James Cittie]], which included the relatively small seat of government for the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Island]]. Each of the four \"citties\" (sic) extended across the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], the main conduit of transportation of the era. Elizabeth Cittie, know initially as [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] (a Native word with many variations in spelling by the English), also included the areas now known as [[South Hampton Roads]] and the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]].\n\nIn 1634, a new system of local government was created in the Virginia Colony by order of the King of England. Eight [[shire]]s were designated, each with its own local officers. Within a few years, the shires were renamed [[counties]], a system which has remained to the present day.\n\n=== Later settlements ===\nIn 1630, under the governorship of [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]], the first settlement on the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] was founded. In 1632, the Virginia legislature voted to build a fort to link Jamestown and the York River settlement of [[Chiskiack]] and protect the colony from Indian attacks. In 1634, a palisade was built near Middle Plantation. This wall stretched across the peninsula between the York and James rivers and protected the settlements on the eastern side of the lower Peninsula from Indians. The wall also served to contain cattle.\n\nIn 1699, a new capital was established and built at [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]], soon renamed [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]].\n<!--Richmond, Alexandria, Port Royal, Yorktown, Hampton, Norfolk, etc. etc.; [[Port Royal, Virginia|Port Royal]], [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]-->\n\n=== Northern Neck Proprietary ===\n{{Main|Northern Neck Proprietary}}\nIn the period following the [[English Civil War]], the exiled King [[Charles II of England]] hoped to shore up the loyalty of several of his supporters by granting them a significant area of mostly uncharted land to control as a [[Proprietary colony|Proprietary]] in Virginia (a claim that would only be valid were the king to return to power). While under the jurisdiction of the Virginia Colony, the proprietary maintained complete control of the granting of land within that territory (and revenues obtained from it) until after the American Revolution. The grant was for the land between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers, which included the titular [[Northern Neck]], but as time went on also would include all of what is today [[Northern Virginia]] and into West Virginia. Due to ambiguities of the text of the various grants causing disputes between the proprietary and the colonial government, the tract was finally demarcated via the [[Fairfax Line]] in 1746.\n\n== Government and law ==\n{{Main|Virginia Governor's Council|House of Burgesses}}\n{{See also|List of colonial governors of Virginia}}\n[[File:Hanover County Courthouse - front view.JPG|thumb|[[Hanover County Courthouse]] (c. 1735\u20131742), with its arcaded front, is typical of a numerous colonial courthouse built in Virginia.]]<!--placeholder until a decent color picture of the King William Courthouse can be take-->\nIn the initial years under the Virginia Company, the colony was governed by a council, headed by a council President. From 1611 to 1618, under the orders of Sir [[Thomas Dale]], the settlers of the colony were under a regime of civil law that became known as [[Dale's Code]].<ref name=\"COLO NPS Assembly\" />\n\nUnder a charter from the company in 1618, a new model of governance was put in place in 1619, which created a new [[House of Burgesses]].<ref name=\"COLO NPS Assembly\" /> On July 30, 1619, burgesses met at [[Jamestown Church]] as the first elected representative legislative assembly in the New World.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Assembly\">{{cite web |title=The First Legislative Assembly |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/the-first-legislative-assembly.htm |publisher=Colonial National Historical Park (NPS) |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> The legal system in the colony was thereafter based around the English [[common law]].\n\nFor much of the history of the Royal Colony, the formal appointed governor was absentee, often remaining in England. In his stead, a series of acting or Lieutenant Governors who were physically present held actual authority. In the later years of its history, as it became increasingly civilized, more governors made the journey.\n\nThe first settlement in the colony, Jamestown, served as the capital and main port of entry from its founding until 1699. During this time, a series of statehouses (capitols) were used and subsequently consumed by fires (both accidental, and in the case of Bacon's Rebellion, intentional). Following such a fire, in 1699 the capital was relocated inland, away from the swampy clime of Jamestown to Middle Plantation, soon to be renamed Williamsburg.\n\nThe capital of Virginia remained in Williamsburg, until it was moved further inland to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1779 during the American Revolution.\n\n== Economy ==\n{{See also|Plantation economy|Tobacco in the American Colonies}}\nThe entrepreneurs of the Virginia Company experimented with a number of means of making the colony profitable. The orders sent with the first colonists instructed that they search for precious metals (specifically [[gold]]). While no gold was found, various products were sent back, including pitch and [[clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]]. In 1608, early attempts were made at breaking the [[Continental Europe|Continental]] hold on glassmaking through the [[Jamestown Glasshouse|creation of a glassworks]]. In 1619, the colonist built the [[Falling Creek Ironworks|first ironworks in North America]].\n\nIn 1612, settler John Rolfe planted [[tobacco]] obtained from Bermuda (during his stay there as part of the [[Third Supply]]). Within a few years, the crop proved extremely lucrative in the European market. As the English increasingly used tobacco products, [[Tobacco in the American Colonies]] became significant economic force, especially in the tidewater region surrounding the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nVast plantations were built along the rivers of Virginia, and social/economic systems developed to grow and distribute this [[cash crop]]. Some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops. Planters would then fill large [[hogshead]]s with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses. In 1730, the [[Virginia]] [[House of Burgesses]] standardized and improved quality of tobacco exported by establishing the [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730]], which required inspectors to grade tobacco at 40 specified locations.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Ethnic origins ===\nEngland supplied the great majority of colonists. In 1608, the first [[Poles]] and [[Slovaks]] arrived as part of a group of skilled [[Artisan|craftsmen]].<ref name=\"JamestownColony\">{{cite web |last=Holshouser |first=Joshua D. |last2=Brylinsk-Padnbey |first2=Lucyna |last3=Kielbasa |first3=Katarzyna |title=Jamestown: The Birth of American Polonia 1608\u20132008 (The Role and Accomplishments of Polish Pioneers in the Jamestown Colony) |url=http://www.pac1944.org/jamestown/roles-and-accomp.htm |date=July 2007 |work=[[Polish American Congress]] |accessdate=October 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724124454/http://pac1944.org/jamestown/roles-and-accomp.htm |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Shipwright\">{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=George |last2=Olasij |first2=Thompson Dele |title=Migrants, Immigrants, and Slaves: Racial and Ethnic Groups in America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bl5V_QCJ4GYC&pg=PA116&dq=%22Jan+Bogdan%22+%22John+Smith%22#v=onepage&q=%22Jan%20Bogdan%22%20%22John%20Smith%22&f=false |date=January 10, 1995 |page=116 |publisher=[[University Press of America]] |isbn=978-0-8191-9738-2 |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"FirstColonists\">{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Patrick |title=Robertson's Book of Firsts: Who Did What for the First Time |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2TEEaCrPiWsC&pg=PT611&lpg=PT611&dq=%22Jan+Bogdan%22+in+Jamestown#v=onepage&q=%22Jan%20Bogdan%22%20in%20Jamestown&f=false |date=November 8, 2011 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA |page= |isbn=978-1-59691-579-4 |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"SavesJohnSmith2\">{{cite book |last=Uminski |first=Sigmund H. |title=The Polish pioneers in Virginia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k0o8AAAAIAAJ&q=%22Jan+Bogdan%22+%22Captain+John+Smith%22&dq=%22Jan+Bogdan%22+%22Captain+John+Smith%22 |date=1974 |page=8 |publisher=Polish Publication Society of America |location= |isbn= |asin=B0006CA8QI |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref> In 1619, the first Africans arrived, though the concept of racially based slavery did not evolve for several decades.

One method to solve the shortage was through the usage of [[indentured servant]]s.\n\nBy the 1640s, legal documents started to define the changing nature of indentured servants and their status as servants. In 1640, [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]] was sentenced to lifetime servitude as punishment for trying to escape from his master Hugh Gwyn. This is the earliest legal sanctioning of slavery in Virginia.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Out of the Land of Bondage\": The English Revolution and the Atlantic Origins of Abolition |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=943\u2013974 |first=John |last=Donoghue |year=2010 |url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/115/4/943.full.pdf|doi=10.1086/ahr.115.4.943 }}</ref> After this trial, the relationship between indentured servants and their masters changed, as planters saw permanent servitude a more appealing and profitable prospect than seven-year indentures.<!--Where does this conclusion come from? -->\n\nAs many indentured workers were illiterate, especially Africans, there were opportunities for abuse by planters and other indenture holders. Some ignored the expiration of servants' indentured contracts and tried to keep them as lifelong workers. One example is with [[Anthony Johnson (colonist)|Anthony Johnson]], who argued with Robert Parker, another planter, over the status of [[John Casor]], formerly an indentured servant of his. Johnson argued that his indenture was for life and Parker had interfered with his rights. The court ruled in favor of Johnson and ordered that Casor be returned to him, where he served the rest of his life as a slave.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=History of Black Americans: From Africa to the Emergence of the Cotton Kingdom |first=Philip S. |last=Foner |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1980 |page=3 |url=http://testaae.greenwood.com/doc_print.aspx?fileID=GR7529&chapterID=GR7529-747&path=books/greenwood |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014135617/http://testaae.greenwood.com/doc_print.aspx?fileID=GR7529&chapterID=GR7529-747&path=books%2Fgreenwood |archivedate=October 14, 2013 }}</ref> Such documented cases marked the transformation of Negroes from indentured servants into slaves.\n\nIn the late 17th century, the [[Royal African Company]], which was established by the King of England to supply the great demand for labor to the colonies, had a monopoly on the provision of African slaves to the colony.<ref name=\"Royal African Company\">{{cite web |title=The Royal African Company \u2013 Supplying Slaves to Jamestown |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/the-royal-african-company-supplying-slaves-to-jamestown.htm |publisher=Colonial National Historical Park (National Park Service) |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> As plantation agriculture was established earlier in Barbados, in the early years, slaves were shipped from Barbados (where they were seasoned) to the colonies of Virginia and Carolina.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Main|Religion in early Virginia}}\nIn 1619, the [[Anglican Church]] was formally [[established church|established]] as the official religion in the colony, and would remain so until shortly after the American Revolution.

The upper class planters controlled the vestry, which ran the parish and chose the minister. The church in Virginia was controlled by the Bishop of London, who sent priests and missionaries, but there were never enough, and they reported very low standards of personal morality.<ref>Edward L.

They erected a cross and named the point of land [[Cape Henry]], in honor of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the eldest son of King James.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nTheir instructions were to select a location inland along a waterway where they would be less vulnerable to the Spanish or other Europeans also seeking to establish colonies. They sailed westward into the Bay and reached the mouth of [[Hampton Roads]], stopping at a location now known as [[Old Point Comfort]]. Keeping the shoreline to their right, they then ventured up the largest river, which they named the [[James River (Virginia)|James]], for their king. After exploring at least as far upriver as the confluence of the [[Appomattox River]] at present-day [[Hopewell, Virginia|Hopewell]], they returned downstream to [[Jamestown Island]], which offered a favorable defensive position against enemy ships and deep water anchorage adjacent to the land. Within two weeks they had constructed their first fort and named their settlement [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn addition to securing gold and other precious minerals to send back to the waiting investors in England, the survival plan for the Jamestown colonists depended upon regular supplies from England and trade with the [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. The location they selected was largely cut off from the mainland and offered little game for hunting, no fresh drinking water, and very limited ground for farming. Captain Newport returned to England twice, delivering the First Supply and the Second Supply missions during 1608, and leaving the ''Discovery'' for the use of the colonists. However, death from disease and conflicts with the Natives Americans took a fearsome toll of the colonists. Despite attempts at mining minerals, growing silk, and exporting the native Virginia tobacco, no profitable exports had been identified, and it was unclear whether the settlement would survive financially.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== Powhatan Confederacy ====\n{{See also|Powhatan Confederacy}}\nThe [[Powhatan Confederacy]] was a [[confederation]] of numerous linguistically related tribes in the eastern part of Virginia. The Powhatan Confederacy controlled a territory known as [[Tsenacommacah]], which roughly corresponded with the [[Tidewater region]] of Virginia. It was in this territory that the English established Jamestown. At the time of the English arrival, the Powhatan were led by the [[paramount chief]] [[Wahunsenacawh]].\n\n==== Popham colony and Plymouth company ====\n\nOn May 31, 1607, about 100 men and boys left England for what is now [[Maine]]. Approximately three months later, the group landed on a wooded peninsula where the Kennebec River meets the Atlantic Ocean and began building Fort St. George.

Thus, at least according to James I's writ, the Virginia Colony in its original sense extended to the coast of the Pacific Ocean, in what is now California, with all the states in between ([[Kentucky]], [[Missouri]], [[Colorado]], [[Utah]], etc.) belonging to Virginia. For practical purposes, though, the colonists rarely ventured far inland to what was known as \"The Virginia Wilderness\", although the concept itself helped renew the interest of investors, and additional funds enabled an expanded effort, known as the [[Third Supply]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n==== 1609 Third Supply and Bermuda ====\n{{Main|History of Bermuda|Somers Isles Company}}\n[[File:Virginia and Florida by W. Blaeu (MAM, Madrid, 413) 01.jpg|thumb|Map depicting the Colony of Virginia (according to the [[Second Virginia Charter|Second Charter]]), made by [[Willem Blaeu]] between 1609 and 1638]]\n\nFor the Third Supply, the London Company had a new ship built. The ''[[Sea Venture]]'' was specifically designed for emigration of additional colonists and transporting supplies. It became the [[flagship]] of the Admiral of the convoy, Sir [[George Somers]]. The Third Supply was the largest to date, with eight other ships joining the ''Sea Venture''. The new Captain of the ''Sea Venture'' was the mission's Vice-Admiral, Christopher Newport. Hundreds of new colonists were aboard the ships. However, weather was to drastically affect the mission.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nA few days out of London, the nine ships of the third supply mission encountered a massive hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. They became separated during the three days the storm lasted. Admiral Somers had the new ''Sea Venture'', carrying most of the supplies of the mission, deliberately driven aground onto the reefs of [[Bermuda]] to avoid sinking. However, while there was no loss of life, the ship was wrecked beyond repair, stranding its survivors on the uninhabited [[archipelago]], to which they laid claim for England.<ref>Hobson Woodward.

Viking (2009) {{ISBN|978-0-670-02096-6}}</ref>\n\nThe survivors at Bermuda eventually built two smaller ships and most of them continued on to Jamestown, leaving a few on Bermuda to secure the claim. The Company's possession of Bermuda was made official in 1612, when the third and final charter extended the boundaries of 'Virginia' far enough out to sea to encompass Bermuda.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Third Virginia Charter 1612 |url=http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/documents/1600-1650/the-third-virginia-charter-1612.php |accessdate=June 23, 2017}}</ref> Bermuda has since been known officially also as ''The Somers Isles'' (in commemoration of Admiral Somers).

Seven of the other ships had arrived carrying more colonists, but little in the way of food and supplies. Combined with a drought, and hostile relations with the [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]], the loss of the supplies that had been aboard the ''Sea Venture'' resulted in the [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|Starving Time]] in late 1609 to May 1610, during which over 80% of the colonists perished.

Depositing his passengers and limited supplies, he returned to England with word of the plight of the colonists at Jamestown. The King authorized another leader, [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], later better known as \"Lord Delaware\", to have greater powers, and the London Company organized another supply mission. They set sail from London on April 1, 1610.\n\nJust after the survivors of the Starving Time and those who had joined them from Bermuda had abandoned Jamestown, the ships of the new supply mission sailed up the James River with food, supplies, a doctor, and more colonists. Lord Delaware was determined that the colony was to survive, and he intercepted the departing ships about {{convert|10|mi|km}} downstream of Jamestown. The colonists thanked [[Divine providence|Providence]] for the Colony's salvation.\n\nWest proved far harsher and more belligerent toward the Indians than any of his predecessors, engaging in wars of conquest against them. He first sent Gates to drive off the Kecoughtan from their village on July 9, 1610, then gave Chief Powhatan an ultimatum to either return all English subjects and property, or face war. Powhatan responded by insisting that the English either stay in their fort or leave Virginia. Enraged, De la Warr had the hand of a [[Paspahegh]] captive cut off and sent him to the paramount chief with another ultimatum: Return all English subjects and property, or the neighboring villages would be burned. This time, Powhatan did not even respond.\n\n==== First Anglo-Powhatan War (1610\u20131614), John Rolfe and Pocahontas ====\n\nOn August 9, 1610, tired of waiting for a response from Powhatan, West sent George Percy with 70 men to attack the Paspahegh capital, burning the houses and cutting down their cornfields. They killed 65 to 75, and captured one of Wowinchopunk's wives and her children. Returning downstream, the English threw the children overboard and shot out \"their Braynes in the water\". The queen was put to the sword in Jamestown. The Paspahegh never recovered from this attack and abandoned their town. Another small force sent with Samuel Argall against the Warraskoyaks found that they had already fled, but he destroyed their abandoned village and cornfields as well. This event triggered the first Anglo-Powhatan War.\n\nAmong the individuals who had briefly abandoned Jamestown was [[John Rolfe]], a ''Sea Venture'' survivor who had lost his wife and son in Bermuda. He was a businessman from London who had some untried seeds for new, sweeter strains of [[tobacco]] with him, as well as some untried marketing ideas. It would turn out that John Rolfe held the key to the Colony's economic success. By 1612, Rolfe's new strains of tobacco had been successfully cultivated and exported, establishing a first [[cash crop]] for [[export]]. [[Plantations in the American South|Plantations]] and new outposts sprung up starting with [[Henricus]], initially both upriver and downriver along the navigable portion of the James, and thereafter along the other rivers and waterways of the area. The settlement at Jamestown could finally be considered permanently established.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Story of Jamestown |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hh/2/hh2b3.htm |work=NPS Historical Handbook |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA period of peace followed the marriage in 1614 of colonist John Rolfe to [[Pocahontas]], the daughter of Algonquian chief [[Chief Powhatan|Powhatan]].\n\n==== Second Anglo-Powhatan War (1622\u20131632) ====\n\n===== Indian Massacre of 1622 =====\n{{Main|Indian Massacre of 1622}}\n[[File:1622 massacre jamestown de Bry.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Indian massacre of 1622, depicted in a 1628 woodcut by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]] out of [[Theodore de Bry]]'s workshop]]\n\nThe relations with the Natives took a turn for the worse after the death of Pocahontas in England and the return of John Rolfe and other colonial leaders in May 1617. Disease, poor harvests and the growing demand for tobacco lands caused hostilities to escalate.\n\nAfter Wahunsenacawh's death in 1618, he was soon succeeded by his own younger brother, Opechancanough. He maintained friendly relations with the Colony on the surface, negotiating with them through his warrior [[Nemattanew]], but by 1622, after Nemattanew had been slain, Opechancanough was ready to order a limited surprise attack on them, hoping to persuade them to move on and settle elsewhere.\n\nChief Opechancanough organized and led a well-coordinated series of surprise attacks on multiple English settlements along both sides of a {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} long stretch of the James River, which took place early on the morning of March 22, 1622. This event came to be known as the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]] and resulted in the deaths of 347 colonists (including men, women, and children) and the abduction of many others. The Massacre caught most of the Virginia Colony by surprise and virtually wiped out several entire communities, including [[Henricus]] and [[Wolstenholme Town]] at [[Martin's Hundred]].\n\nJamestown was spared from destruction, however, due to a Virginia Indian boy named [[Chanco]] who, after learning of the planned attacks from his brother, gave warning to colonist [[Richard Pace (Jamestown)|Richard Pace]] with whom he lived. Pace, after securing himself and his neighbors on the south side of the James River, took a canoe across river to warn Jamestown, which narrowly escaped destruction, although there was no time to warn the other settlements.\n\nA year later, Captain [[William Tucker (Jamestown)|William Tucker]] and Dr. [[John Pott]]s worked out a truce with the Powhatan and proposed a toast using liquor laced with poison. 200 Virginia Indians were killed or made ill by the poison and 50 more were slaughtered by the colonists. For over a decade, the English settlers killed Powhatan men and women, captured children and systematically razed villages, seizing or destroying crops.\n\nBy 1634, a six-mile-long [[palisade]] was completed across the [[Virginia Peninsula]]. The new palisade provided some security from attacks by the Virginia Indians for colonists farming and fishing lower on the Peninsula from that point.\n\nOn April 18, 1644, Opechancanough again tried to force the colonists to abandon the region with another series of coordinated attacks, killing almost 500 colonists. However, this was a much less devastating portion of the growing population than had been the case in the 1622 attacks.\n\nThe forces of Royal Governor of Virginia [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] captured the old warrior in 1646,<ref>Rountree, Helen C. ''Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough: Three Indian Lives Changed by Jamestown''. University of Virginia Press: Charlottesville, 2005</ref> variously thought to be between 90 and 100 years old. In October, while a prisoner, Opechancanough was killed by a soldier (shot in the back) assigned to guard him.\n\n=== Crown colony (1624\u20131652) ===\n[[File:Virginia Colonial Records - Briefe Declaration.jpg|thumb|Briefe Declaration of 1624]]\nIn 1620, a successor to the Plymouth Company sent colonists to the New World aboard the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Known as [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]], they successfully established a settlement in what became [[Massachusetts]]. The portion of what had been Virginia north of the 40th parallel became known as [[New England]], according to books written by [[John Smith of Jamestown|Captain John Smith]], who had made a voyage there.\n\nIn 1624, the charter of the Virginia Company was revoked by King James I and the Virginia Colony was transferred to royal authority in the form of a [[crown colony]]. Subsequent charters for the [[Maryland Colony]] in 1632 and to the eight [[Lords Proprietor]] of the [[Province of Carolina]] in 1663 and 1665 further reduced the Virginia Colony to roughly the coastal borders it held until the [[American Revolution]]. (The exact border with North Carolina was disputed until surveyed by [[William Byrd II]] in 1728.)\n<!--dispute over [[Kent Island, Maryland]]-->\n\n==== Third Anglo-Powhatan War (1644\u20131646) ====\n\nAfter twelve years of peace following the Indian Wars of 1622\u20131632, another Anglo\u2013Powhatan War began on March 18, 1644, as a last effort by the remnants of the Powhatan Confederacy, still under [[Opechancanough]], to dislodge the English settlers of the Virginia Colony. Around 500 colonists were killed, but that number represented a relatively low percent of the overall population, as opposed to the earlier massacre (the 1622 attack had wiped out a third; that of 1644 barely a tenth). However, Opechancanough, still preferring to use Powhatan tactics, did not make any major follow-up to this attack.\n\nThis was followed by a last effort by the settlers to decimate the Powhatan. In July, they marched against the Pamunkey, Chickahominy, and Powhatan proper; and south of the James, against the Appomattoc, Weyanoke, Warraskoyak, and Nansemond, as well as two Carolina tribes, the [[Chowanoke]] and [[Secotan]].\n\nIn February 1645, the colony ordered the construction of three frontier forts: Fort Charles at the falls of the James, Fort James on the Chickahominy, and Fort Royal at the falls of the York. In August, Governor [[William Berkeley (governor)|William Berkeley]] stormed Opechancanough's stronghold and captured him. All captured males in the village over age 11 were deported to [[Tangier Island]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/jame1/moretti-langholtz/chap4.htm A Study of Virginia Indians]</ref> Opechancanough, around 92 years old, was taken to Jamestown where he was shot in the back by a guard. Opechancanough's death resulted in the disintegration of the Powhatan Confederacy into its component tribes, whom the colonists continued to attack. In March 1646, the colony decided to build a fourth frontier fort, [[Fort Henry (Virginia)|Fort Henry]], at the falls of the Appomattox, where the modern city of Petersburg is located.\n\n==== Treaty of 1646 ====\n[[File:1646linemap.jpg|thumb|Red line showing the boundary between the Virginia Colony and Tributary Indian tribes, as established by the Treaty of 1646. The Red dot shows Jamestown, the capital of the Virginia Colony.]]\n\nIn the peace treaty of October 1646, the new ''weroance'', [[Necotowance]], and the subtribes formerly in the Confederacy, each became tributaries to the King of England. At the same time, a racial frontier was delineated between Indian and English settlements, with members of each group forbidden to cross to the other side except by special pass obtained at one of the newly erected border forts. The extent of the Virginia colony open to patent by English colonists was defined as: All the land between the [[Blackwater River (Virginia)|Blackwater]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York]] rivers, and up to the navigable point of each of the major rivers \u2013 which were connected by a straight line running directly from modern Franklin on the Blackwater, northwesterly to the Appomattoc village beside Fort Henry, and continuing in the same direction to the [[Monacan (tribe)|Monocan]] village above the falls of the James, where Fort Charles was built, then turning sharp right, to Fort Royal on the York (Pamunkey) river. Necotowance thus ceded the English vast tracts of still-uncolonized land, much of it between the James and Blackwater.

The [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company's]] two settlements, Virginia and [[Bermuda]] (Bermuda's Independent Puritans were expelled as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]], settling the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]]), [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]] were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown, and were singled out by the [[Rump Parliament]] in [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October 1650. This dictated that\n<blockquote>due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.</blockquote>\n\nThe Act also authorised Parliamentary [[privateer]]s to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies: \"All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized.

At the local level, Church of England parishes handled many local affairs, and they in turn were controlled not by the minister, but rather by a closed circle of rich landowners who comprised the parish vestry. Ronald L. Heinemann emphasizes the ideological conservatism of Virginia, while noting there were also religious dissenters who were gaining strength by the 1760s:\n:The tobacco planters and farmers of Virginia adhered to the concept of a hierarchical society that they or their ancestors had brought with them from England. Most held to the general idea of a Great Chain of Being: at the top were God and his heavenly host; next came kings...who were divinely sanctioned to rule, then an hereditary aristocracy who were followed in descending order by wealthy landed gentry, small, independent farmers, tenant farmers, servants....Aspirations to rise above one's station in life were considered a sin.<ref>Ronald L. Heinemann et al. ''Old Dominion, New Commonwealth: A History of Virginia, 1607\u20132007'' (2007) p 67</ref>\n\nIn actual practice, colonial Virginia never had a bishop to represent God nor a hereditary aristocracy with titles like 'duke' or 'baron'. However it did have a royal governor appointed by the king, as well as a powerful landed gentry. The status quo was strongly reinforced by what Jefferson called \"feudal and unnatural distinctions\" that were vital to the maintenance of aristocracy in Virginia. He targeted laws such as [[entail]] and [[primogeniture]] by which the oldest son inherited all the land. As a result increasingly large plantations, worked by white tenant farmers and by black slaves, gained in size and wealth and political power in the eastern (\"Tidewater\") tobacco areas.  Maryland and South Carolina had similar hierarchical systems, as did New York and Pennsylvania.<ref>Holly Brewer, \"Entailing Aristocracy in Colonial Virginia: 'Ancient Feudal Restraints' and Revolutionary Reform,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1997) 54#2 307\u2013346 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2953276 in JSTOR]</ref> During the Revolutionary era, all such laws were repealed by the new states.<ref>Richard B.

For much of the 17th century, English contact and conflict was mostly with the [[Algonquian peoples]] that populated the coastal regions, primarily the Powhatan Confederacy. Following a series of wars and the decline of the Powhatan as a political entity, the colonists expanded westward in the late 17th and 18th centuries, encountering the [[Shawnee]], [[Iroquoian]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Nottoway people|Nottoway]], [[Meherrin]], [[Iroquois]] and [[Cherokee]], as well as [[Siouan]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Tutelo people|Tutelo]], [[Saponi people|Saponi]], and [[Occaneechi]].\n\n=== Iroquois Confederacy ===\n{{See also|Iroquois Confederacy}}\n[[File:5NationsExpansion.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of the [[Iroquois]] expansion during the Beaver Wars, 1638\u20131711]]\n\nAs the English settlements expanded beyond the Tidewater territory traditionally occupied by the Powhatan, they encountered new groups with which there had been minimal relations with the Colony.\n\nIn the late 17th century, the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] expanded into the Western region of Virginia as part of the [[Beaver Wars]]. They arrived shortly before the English settlers, and displaced the resident [[Siouan languages|Siouan tribes]].<!--In the late 17th century, [[Chain covenant]]; Treaty of Albany (1684)-->\n\nLt. Gov. [[Alexander Spotswood]] made further advances in policy with the Virginia Indians along the frontier. In 1714, he established [[Fort Christanna]] to help educate and trade with several tribes with which the colony had friendly relations, as well as to help protect them from hostile tribes. In 1722, he negotiated the [[Treaty of Albany (1722)|Treaty of Albany]].\n\n=== Lord Dunmore's War ===\n{{Main|Lord Dunmore's War}}\n\n== Geography ==\n{{See also|Environment of Virginia}}\nThe cultural geography of colonial Virginia gradually evolved, with a variety of settlement and jurisdiction models experimented with. By the late 17th century and into the 18th century, the primary settlement pattern was based on plantations (to grow tobacco), farms, and some towns (mostly ports or courthouse villages).\n\n=== Early settlements ===\nThe fort at Jamestown, founded in 1607, remained the primary settlement of the colonists for several years. A few strategic outposts were constructed, including [[Fort Algernon]] (1609) at the entrance to the James River.\n\nEarly attempts to occupy strategic locations already inhabited by natives at what is now [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]] failed owing to native resistance.\n\nA short distance farther up the James, in 1611, [[Thomas Dale]] began the construction of a progressive development at [[Henricus]] on and about what was later known as [[Farrars Island]]. Henricus was envisioned as possible replacement capital for Jamestown, and was to have the first college in Virginia. (The ill-fated Henricus was destroyed during the [[Indian Massacre of 1622]]). In addition to creating the new settlement at Henricus, Dale also established the port town of [[Bermuda Hundred (Town)|Bermuda Hundred]], as well as [[City Point, Virginia|\"Bermuda Cittie\"]] (sic) in 1613, now part of [[Hopewell, Virginia]]. He began the excavation work at [[Dutch Gap]], using methods he had learned while serving in [[Holland]].\n\n=== \"Hundreds\" ===\n[[File:Virginia Under the Stuarts - Dale's Settlements.png|thumb|Bermuda Hundred and other early English settlements upriver of Jamestown]]\nOnce tobacco had been established as an export cash crop, investors became more interested and groups of them united to create largely self-sufficient \"hundreds.\" The term [[Hundred (country subdivision)|\"hundred\"]] is a traditional English name for an administrative division of a shire (or county) to define an area which would support one hundred heads of household.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=hundred |title=Hundred &#124; Define Hundred at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=October 26, 2013}}</ref> In the colonial era in Virginia, the \"hundreds\" were large developments of many acres, necessary to support land hungry tobacco crops. The \"hundreds\" were required to be at least several miles from any existing community. Soon, these patented tracts of land sprang up along the rivers. The investors sent shiploads of settlers and supplies to Virginia to establish the new developments. The administrative centers of Virginia's hundreds were essentially small towns or villages, and were often palisaded for defense.\n\nAn example was [[Martin's Hundred]], located downstream from Jamestown on the north bank of the James River. It was sponsored by the [[Martin's Hundred Society]], a group of investors in London. It was settled in 1618, and [[Wolstenholme Towne]] was its administrative center, named for Sir John Wolstenholme, one of the investors.\n\n[[Bermuda Hundred, Virginia|Bermuda Hundred]] (now in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]]) and [[Flowerdew Hundred]] (now in [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George County]]) are other names which have survived over centuries. Others included [[Berkeley Hundred]], Bermuda Nether Hundred, Bermuda Upper Hundred, [[Smith's Hundred]], Digges Hundred, West Hundred and Shirley Hundred (and, in Bermuda, ''Harrington Hundreds'').\n\nIncluding the creation of the \"hundreds\", the various incentives to investors in the Virginia Colony finally paid off by 1617. By this time, the colonists were exporting 50,000 pounds of tobacco to England a year and were beginning to generate enough profit to ensure the economic survival of the colony.\n\n=== Cities, Shires, and Counties ===\n{{Main|Shires of Virginia|Counties of Virginia}}\nIn 1619, the plantations and developments were divided into four \"incorporations\" or \"citties\" (sic), as they were called. These were [[Charles City (Virginia Company)|Charles Cittie]], [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]], [[Henrico City (Virginia Company)|Henrico Cittie]], and [[James City (Virginia Company)|James Cittie]], which included the relatively small seat of government for the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown Island]]. Each of the four \"citties\" (sic) extended across the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], the main conduit of transportation of the era. Elizabeth Cittie, know initially as [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] (a Native word with many variations in spelling by the English), also included the areas now known as [[South Hampton Roads]] and the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]].\n\nIn 1634, a new system of local government was created in the Virginia Colony by order of the King of England. Eight [[shire]]s were designated, each with its own local officers. Within a few years, the shires were renamed [[counties]], a system which has remained to the present day.\n\n=== Later settlements ===\nIn 1630, under the governorship of [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]], the first settlement on the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] was founded. In 1632, the Virginia legislature voted to build a fort to link Jamestown and the York River settlement of [[Chiskiack]] and protect the colony from Indian attacks. In 1634, a palisade was built near Middle Plantation. This wall stretched across the peninsula between the York and James rivers and protected the settlements on the eastern side of the lower Peninsula from Indians. The wall also served to contain cattle.\n\nIn 1699, a new capital was established and built at [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]], soon renamed [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]].\n<!--Richmond, Alexandria, Port Royal, Yorktown, Hampton, Norfolk, etc. etc.; [[Port Royal, Virginia|Port Royal]], [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]-->\n\n=== Northern Neck Proprietary ===\n{{Main|Northern Neck Proprietary}}\nIn the period following the [[English Civil War]], the exiled King [[Charles II of England]] hoped to shore up the loyalty of several of his supporters by granting them a significant area of mostly uncharted land to control as a [[Proprietary colony|Proprietary]] in Virginia (a claim that would only be valid were the king to return to power). While under the jurisdiction of the Virginia Colony, the proprietary maintained complete control of the granting of land within that territory (and revenues obtained from it) until after the American Revolution. The grant was for the land between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers, which included the titular [[Northern Neck]], but as time went on also would include all of what is today [[Northern Virginia]] and into West Virginia. Due to ambiguities of the text of the various grants causing disputes between the proprietary and the colonial government, the tract was finally demarcated via the [[Fairfax Line]] in 1746.\n\n== Government and law ==\n{{Main|Virginia Governor's Council|House of Burgesses}}\n{{See also|List of colonial governors of Virginia}}\n[[File:Hanover County Courthouse - front view.JPG|thumb|[[Hanover County Courthouse]] (c. 1735\u20131742), with its arcaded front, is typical of a numerous colonial courthouse built in Virginia.]]<!--placeholder until a decent color picture of the King William Courthouse can be take-->\nIn the initial years under the Virginia Company, the colony was governed by a council, headed by a council President. From 1611 to 1618, under the orders of Sir [[Thomas Dale]], the settlers of the colony were under a regime of civil law that became known as [[Dale's Code]].<ref name=\"COLO NPS Assembly\" />\n\nUnder a charter from the company in 1618, a new model of governance was put in place in 1619, which created a new [[House of Burgesses]].<ref name=\"COLO NPS Assembly\" /> On July 30, 1619, burgesses met at [[Jamestown Church]] as the first elected representative legislative assembly in the New World.<ref name=\"COLO NPS Assembly\">{{cite web |title=The First Legislative Assembly |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/historyculture/the-first-legislative-assembly.htm |publisher=Colonial National Historical Park (NPS) |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}</ref> The legal system in the colony was thereafter based around the English [[common law]].\n\nFor much of the history of the Royal Colony, the formal appointed governor was absentee, often remaining in England. In his stead, a series of acting or Lieutenant Governors who were physically present held actual authority. In the later years of its history, as it became increasingly civilized, more governors made the journey.\n\nThe first settlement in the colony, Jamestown, served as the capital and main port of entry from its founding until 1699. During this time, a series of statehouses (capitols) were used and subsequently consumed by fires (both accidental, and in the case of Bacon's Rebellion, intentional). Following such a fire, in 1699 the capital was relocated inland, away from the swampy clime of Jamestown to Middle Plantation, soon to be renamed Williamsburg.\n\nThe capital of Virginia remained in Williamsburg, until it was moved further inland to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1779 during the American Revolution.\n\n== Economy ==\n{{See also|Plantation economy|Tobacco in the American Colonies}}\nThe entrepreneurs of the Virginia Company experimented with a number of means of making the colony profitable. The orders sent with the first colonists instructed that they search for precious metals (specifically [[gold]]). While no gold was found, various products were sent back, including pitch and [[clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]]. In 1608, early attempts were made at breaking the [[Continental Europe|Continental]] hold on glassmaking through the [[Jamestown Glasshouse|creation of a glassworks]]. In 1619, the colonist built the [[Falling Creek Ironworks|first ironworks in North America]].\n\nIn 1612, settler John Rolfe planted [[tobacco]] obtained from Bermuda (during his stay there as part of the [[Third Supply]]). Within a few years, the crop proved extremely lucrative in the European market. As the English increasingly used tobacco products, [[Tobacco in the American Colonies]] became significant economic force, especially in the tidewater region surrounding the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nVast plantations were built along the rivers of Virginia, and social/economic systems developed to grow and distribute this [[cash crop]]. Some elements of this system included the importation and employment of slaves to grow crops. Planters would then fill large [[hogshead]]s with tobacco and convey them to inspection warehouses. In 1730, the [[Virginia]] [[House of Burgesses]] standardized and improved quality of tobacco exported by establishing the [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730]], which required inspectors to grade tobacco at 40 specified locations.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Ethnic origins ===\nEngland supplied the great majority of colonists. In 1608, the first [[Poles]] and [[Slovaks]] arrived as part of a group of skilled [[Artisan|craftsmen]].<ref name=\"JamestownColony\">{{cite web |last=Holshouser |first=Joshua D. |last2=Brylinsk-Padnbey |first2=Lucyna |last3=Kielbasa |first3=Katarzyna |title=Jamestown: The Birth of American Polonia 1608\u20132008 (The Role and Accomplishments of Polish Pioneers in the Jamestown Colony) |url=http://www.pac1944.org/jamestown/roles-and-accomp.htm |date=July 2007 |work=[[Polish American Congress]] |accessdate=October 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724124454/http://pac1944.org/jamestown/roles-and-accomp.htm |archive-date=July 24, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Shipwright\">{{cite book |last=Henderson |first=George |last2=Olasij |first2=Thompson Dele |title=Migrants, Immigrants, and Slaves: Racial and Ethnic Groups in America |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Bl5V_QCJ4GYC&pg=PA116&dq=%22Jan+Bogdan%22+%22John+Smith%22#v=onepage&q=%22Jan%20Bogdan%22%20%22John%20Smith%22&f=false |date=January 10, 1995 |page=116 |publisher=[[University Press of America]] |isbn=978-0-8191-9738-2 |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"FirstColonists\">{{cite book |last=Robertson |first=Patrick |title=Robertson's Book of Firsts: Who Did What for the First Time |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2TEEaCrPiWsC&pg=PT611&lpg=PT611&dq=%22Jan+Bogdan%22+in+Jamestown#v=onepage&q=%22Jan%20Bogdan%22%20in%20Jamestown&f=false |date=November 8, 2011 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] USA |page= |isbn=978-1-59691-579-4 |accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"SavesJohnSmith2\">{{cite book |last=Uminski |first=Sigmund H. |title=The Polish pioneers in Virginia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k0o8AAAAIAAJ&q=%22Jan+Bogdan%22+%22Captain+John+Smith%22&dq=%22Jan+Bogdan%22+%22Captain+John+Smith%22 |date=1974 |page=8 |publisher=Polish Publication Society of America |location= |isbn= |asin=B0006CA8QI |accessdate=October 1, 2014}}</ref> In 1619, the first Africans arrived, though the concept of racially based slavery did not evolve for several decades.

One method to solve the shortage was through the usage of [[indentured servant]]s.\n\nBy the 1640s, legal documents started to define the changing nature of indentured servants and their status as servants. In 1640, [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]] was sentenced to lifetime servitude as punishment for trying to escape from his master Hugh Gwyn. This is the earliest legal sanctioning of slavery in Virginia.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Out of the Land of Bondage\": The English Revolution and the Atlantic Origins of Abolition |journal=The American Historical Review |volume=115 |issue=4 |pages=943\u2013974 |first=John |last=Donoghue |year=2010 |url=http://ahr.oxfordjournals.org/content/115/4/943.full.pdf|doi=10.1086/ahr.115.4.943 }}</ref> After this trial, the relationship between indentured servants and their masters changed, as planters saw permanent servitude a more appealing and profitable prospect than seven-year indentures.<!--Where does this conclusion come from? -->\n\nAs many indentured workers were illiterate, especially Africans, there were opportunities for abuse by planters and other indenture holders. Some ignored the expiration of servants' indentured contracts and tried to keep them as lifelong workers.

In that year, 97% of complaints came from individual members of the public.  34% were from prisoners or prisoner advocates (not all against the Department of Corrections), and 63% were from other members of the public.

The increases enabled Dame Beverley to hire more investigators and she said her office should catch up on its backlog of complaints by 2015.<ref name=\"nzherald.co.nz\"/>\n\n==== Attempts to circumvent OIA ====\nIn 2012 Dame Beverley expressed concern at attempts by Government agencies to keep information secret by drafting laws to avoid the Official Information Act, referring in particular to new legislation on partial state asset sales, charter schools and changes to mining permits. The Ombudsman's Office argued at a select committee hearing that state assets associated with the Mixed Ownership Model Act would still be 51 per cent owned by the public and should remain subject to the Official Information Act (OIA).  Dame Beverley said there was an increasing number of officials in government who fail to understand the constitutional importance of the legislation and that this trend was 'reprehensible' and 'extremely dangerous'.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10836994 Top-level alarm over secrecy trend], NZ Herald 28 September 2012</ref>\n\nIn December 2012, the Ombudsman criticised the Ministry of Education over its response to requests for information about school closures in Christchurch. David McGee found the Ministry misled the Christchurch City Council by advising two school principals to withdraw their official requests \"in order to receive a better response.\" McGee said: \"Schools and parents should not have to ferret out information by making official information requests.\" The Ombudsman also expressed concerns that there may be a perception within the public sector that \"some requests for information can only be processed efficiently by somehow removing them from the OIA context\".<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10854911 Ombudsman criticises Education Ministry over school closure requests], NZ Herald 18 December 2012</ref>\n\nIn March 2013 the Office of the Ombudsman announced it would conduct an own-motion investigation into the way the public service responds to requests made under the Official Information Act. It said it was receiving an increasing number of complaints by members of the public who felt \"shut out\". Constitutional lawyer [[Mai Chen]] said reluctance by Government departments to answer OIA requests raised concerns \"about how well public servants understood a law intended to give balance to the 'David and Goliath' inequality between citizen and government\".<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10872519 Ombudsman to investigate OIA response], NZ Herald 21 May 2013</ref> Labour's Claire Curren agreed on the need for an investigation saying: \"There is an emerging crisis with our watchdog agencies\", and this is contributing to a \"paralysis of democracy\".<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10872519 Ombudsman to investigate OIA response]</ref>\n\nThe investigation began in December 2014 with over 63 state agencies required to participate.<ref>[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11375105 Government offices selected for OIA review], New Zealand Herald, 17 December 2014</ref>\n\n=== Protecting whistleblowers ===\nThe Ombudsman is one of a number of agencies responsible for protecting '[[whistleblowers]]' \u2013 employees who report serious wrongdoing in their workplace under the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2000/0007/latest/DLM53466.html?search=ts_act%40bill%40regulation%40deemedreg_protected+disclosures+act_resel_25_h&p=1 Protected Disclosures Act], which came into force in 2001.
