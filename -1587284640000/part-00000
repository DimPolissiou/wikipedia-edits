Chow plays the assassin Ah Jong, who accidentally damages the eyes of the singer Jennie (Sally Yeh) during a shootout. He later discovers that if Jennie does not undergo an expensive operation she will go blind. To get the money for Jennie, Ah Jong decides to perform one last hit.\n\nAfter the financial backing from [[Tsui Hark]] became problematic following the release of Woo's film ''[[A Better Tomorrow 2]]'', Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun Fat's and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming ''The Killer'' with a rough draft whose plot was influenced by the films ''[[Le Samoura\u00ef]]'', ''[[Mean Streets]]'', and ''Narazumono''. Woo desired to make a film about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to ''The Killer'' as a tribute to directors [[Jean-Pierre Melville]] and [[Martin Scorsese]].\n\n''The Killer'' was not an immediate success in Hong Kong, but received critical acclaim in the Western world with reviewers praising the [[Action film|action]] scenes and its over-the-top style. The film became Woo's stepping stone to make Hollywood films and has been a strong influence on many directors, including [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Robert Rodriguez]] and [[Johnnie To]].\n\n== Plot ==\nHitman Ah Jong is on his last job for the [[Hong Kong]] [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]], but accidentally damages the eyes of a young [[nightclub singer]] named Jennie with a [[muzzle flash]] in a shootout. After the attack, Ah Jong begins to watch Jennie perform at the nightclub and escorts her home when she is attacked by thugs. Jennie and Ah Jong begin to fall in love during his frequent visits to her apartment.\n\nDriven to help her secure the money for a sight-saving [[cornea]]l transplant, he accepts one final hit. Li Ying, a police detective, spots Ah Jong completing the job but the assassin escapes. [[Boss (crime)|Triad boss]] Hay Wong Hoi double crosses Ah Jong, and instead of paying him, sends a group of hitmen to kill him. During Ah Jong's escape from the Triad, a young child is injured by a stray bullet. After dispatching the attackers, Ah Jong rushes the child to the hospital while being followed by Li and his partner Sgt. Tsang Yeh. Once the child regains consciousness at the casualty ward, Ah Jong escapes Li and Tsang.\n\nLi becomes obsessed with Ah Jong's act of good will. He and Tsang find that Ah Jong visits Jennie at her apartment; they plan to arrest him the next time he visits her. Ah Jong visits Jennie and is caught in an ambush from which he manages to escape. Li and Tsang explain to Jennie that Ah Jong was the assassin that blinded her at the nightclub. Ah Jong meets with his Triad manager, Fung Sei, and demands his payment for the job. Fung Sei brings a suitcase for Ah Jong, who discovers it to be filled with sheets of blank paper before finding himself in the middle of a Triad ambush. He kills all of the hitmen, but leaves Fung Sei alive. The next day, after Fung Sei's pleas for Wong Hoi fall on deaf ears, Ah Jong does a hit-and-run on Wong Hoi's car, wounding the Triad leader and killing his driver and bodyguard.\n\nLi begins to close in on Ah Jong after Tsang follows Fung Sei; Tsang is killed after revealing the location of his home. Because of their friendship, Fung Sei leaves a large stockpile of weaponry for Ah Jong. The home is another ambush; Li attacks, followed by a group of Triad hitmen. Li gets caught in the middle of the crossfire between Ah Jong and the Triad. Ah Jong and Li flee, and while Ah Jong's wounds are mended, they find themselves bonding and becoming friends. Ah Jong tells Li that should anything happen to him, Li should have Ah Jong's eyes donated for Jennie's surgery or use Ah Jong's money to fly her overseas to have her surgery performed by more experienced doctors.\n\nLi, Ah Jong, and Jennie wait in a church for Fung Sei to return with Ah Jong's money. Fung Sei arrives with the money, horribly beaten by Wong Hoi's gangsters who have followed him. He is mortally wounded when the hitmen barge into the church. After Ah Jong ends Fung Sei's misery with a [[euthanasia|mercy killing]], he and Li engage in a long and bloody shootout with the Triad all over the church. The battle ends with a [[Mexican standoff]] between Ah Jong, Li and Wong Hoi. Ah Jong manages to wound Wong Hoi, but the Triad leader lands two bullets in Ah Jong's [[eye sockets]] before the latter seemingly dies of his wounds. When a police squadron arrives in the scene, Wong Hoi begs to be taken into custody. Frustrated by the outcome of the battle, Li fatally shoots Wong Hoi. As a result, he is surrounded by policemen.\n\nThe credits roll with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as Ah Jong (\u963f\u838a \u0100 Zhu\u0101ng, aa3 zong1), an assassin who accidentally blinds singer Jennie when he is on a mission for the criminal organization, the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]]. Ah Jong decides to take on one last mission to pay for surgery to repair her eyes. Ah Jong is called John and Jeff in some subtitled prints of the film.<ref name=\"Hall213\" /> The nickname given to Ah Jong by Li is \"Har Tau\", which roughly translates as \"Shrimp Head.\"<ref name=\"Hall215\">Hall, 1999. p.215</ref> In some dubbed and subtitled prints, his nickname is \"[[Mickey Mouse]]\" or \"Butthead\".<ref name=\"Hall215\" />\n* [[Danny Lee (actor)|Danny Lee]] as Detective Li Ying (\u674e \u9df9, ''L\u01d0 Y\u012bng'', lei5 jing1).

Jennie falls in love with Ah Jong, before learning of his profession as a killer.\n* [[Kenneth Tsang]] as Sgt. Tsang Yeh, Li's police partner. Tsang helps find the whereabouts of Fung Sei which will lead Li to Ah Jong. In some subtitled prints, his name is Randy Chang.\n* Chu Kong as Fung Sei, Ah Jong's Triad manager and close friend. After Ah Jong is spotted on a hit, Fung Sei is ordered to kill Ah Jong. In some subtitled prints, his name is \"Sidney Fong.\"\n* [[Shing Fui-On|Shing Fui-on]] as Hay Wong Hoi (\u6c6a\u6d77 W\u0101ng H\u01cei, wong1 hoi2), a ruthless Triad boss and a coward who tries to tied up loose ends so he can run the triad. In some subtitled versions he is \"Johnny Weng.\"\n* Ricky Yi Fan-wai as Frank Chen, a contract killer/assassin hired by Wong Hoi to kill Ah Jong.\n\n==Themes== <!-- Themes are unifying or dominant ideas and motifs in a film's elements (such as plot, dialogue, photography, and sound) conveying a position or message about life, society, and human nature.

The first cut of ''A Better Tomorrow 2'' was too long for the studio<ref name=\"Hall20\">Hall, 2009. p.20</ref> so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer [[Tsui Hark]] and Woo.<ref>Heard, 1999. p.55</ref> According to producer [[Terence Chang]], Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined ''A Better Tomorrow 2'' and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio.

John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot.<ref name=\"locations\" /> The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church.<ref name=\"locations\" /> The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.<ref>Elder, 2005. p.80</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nTsui and Woo disagreed on the musical aspects of the film. For the opening scene, Woo wanted the singer to perform a [[jazz music|jazz]] song and have the killer playing a saxophone. Tsui rejected this idea as he felt that the Hong Kong audiences did not understand or like jazz. Woo stated that he \"had to change it to a Chinese song, the kind of song they always use in Hong Kong movies.\"<ref name=\"Heard78\">Heard, 1999. p.78</ref><ref name=\"Heard79\" /> Actress [[Sally Yeh]] who performed the [[Cantopop]] songs did not feel they were appropriate for the film. The songs were requested by the studio and written specifically for ''The Killer''.<ref name=\"Hall20\" /><ref name=\"yehinterview\" />\n\nThe [[Film score|film's music]] was composed by [[Lowell Lo]] and edited by David Wu.<ref name=\"Hall209\">Hall, 1999. p.209</ref> A reoccurring musical theme is a haunting [[vibraphone]] theme which is first heard over the opening credits.<ref name=\"Hall74\">Hall, 1999. p.74</ref> The harmonica motif in the film was influenced by the soundtracks of [[Ennio Morricone]], specifically the soundtrack to ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', and used a bottle blower to give the music a haunting effect. David Wu said the influence of the Harmonica music in [[Sergio Leone]]'s western films was a strong influence on his work.<ref name=\"Hall209\" /> During the final action scene when the statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] is destroyed, the action music transitions to \"Overture\" from ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' by [[George Frideric Handel]]. This was the idea of editor David Wu who felt that it would break up the numbing effect of the kinetic violence.<ref name=\"Hall76\">Hall, 1999. p.76</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n<!-- Provide information on the film's release, expanding upon the information in the infobox where necessary.

Chow plays the assassin Ah Jong, who accidentally damages the eyes of the singer Jennie (Sally Yeh) during a shootout. He later discovers that if Jennie does not undergo an expensive operation she will go blind. To get the money for Jennie, Ah Jong decides to perform one last hit.\n\nAfter the financial backing from [[Tsui Hark]] became problematic following the release of Woo's film ''[[A Better Tomorrow 2]]'', Woo had to find backing through Chow Yun Fat's and Danny Lee's financing companies. Woo went into filming ''The Killer'' with a rough draft whose plot was influenced by the films ''[[Le Samoura\u00ef]]'', ''[[Mean Streets]]'', and ''Narazumono''. Woo desired to make a film about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, Woo referred to ''The Killer'' as a tribute to directors [[Jean-Pierre Melville]] and [[Martin Scorsese]].\n\n''The Killer'' was not an immediate success in Hong Kong, but received critical acclaim in the Western world with reviewers praising the [[Action film|action]] scenes and its over-the-top style. The film became Woo's stepping stone to make Hollywood films and has been a strong influence on many directors, including [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[Robert Rodriguez]] and [[Johnnie To]].\n\n== Plot ==\nHitman Ah Jong is on his last job for the [[Hong Kong]] [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]], but accidentally damages the eyes of a young [[nightclub singer]] named Jennie with a [[muzzle flash]] in a shootout. After the attack, Ah Jong begins to watch Jennie perform at the nightclub and escorts her home when she is attacked by thugs. Jennie and Ah Jong begin to fall in love during his frequent visits to her apartment.\n\nDriven to help her secure the money for a sight-saving [[cornea]]l transplant, he accepts one final hit. Li Ying, a police detective, spots Ah Jong completing the job but the assassin escapes. [[Boss (crime)|Triad boss]] Hay Wong Hoi double crosses Ah Jong, and instead of paying him, sends a group of hitmen to kill him. During Ah Jong's escape from the Triad, a young child is injured by a stray bullet. After dispatching the attackers, Ah Jong rushes the child to the hospital while being followed by Li and his partner Sgt. Tsang Yeh. Once the child regains consciousness at the casualty ward, Ah Jong escapes Li and Tsang.\n\nLi becomes obsessed with Ah Jong's act of good will. He and Tsang find that Ah Jong visits Jennie at her apartment; they plan to arrest him the next time he visits her. Ah Jong visits Jennie and is caught in an ambush from which he manages to escape. Li and Tsang explain to Jennie that Ah Jong was the assassin that blinded her at the nightclub. Ah Jong meets with his Triad manager, Fung Sei, and demands his payment for the job. Fung Sei brings a suitcase for Ah Jong, who discovers it to be filled with sheets of blank paper before finding himself in the middle of a Triad ambush. He kills all of the hitmen, but leaves Fung Sei alive. The next day, after Fung Sei's pleas for Wong Hoi fall on deaf ears, Ah Jong does a hit-and-run on Wong Hoi's car, wounding the Triad leader and killing his driver and bodyguard.\n\nLi begins to close in on Ah Jong after Tsang follows Fung Sei; Tsang is killed after revealing the location of his home. Because of their friendship, Fung Sei leaves a large stockpile of weaponry for Ah Jong. The home is another ambush; Li attacks, followed by a group of Triad hitmen. Li gets caught in the middle of the crossfire between Ah Jong and the Triad. Ah Jong and Li flee, and while Ah Jong's wounds are mended, they find themselves bonding and becoming friends. Ah Jong tells Li that should anything happen to him, Li should have Ah Jong's eyes donated for Jennie's surgery or use Ah Jong's money to fly her overseas to have her surgery performed by more experienced doctors.\n\nLi, Ah Jong, and Jennie wait in a church for Fung Sei to return with Ah Jong's money. Fung Sei arrives with the money, horribly beaten by Wong Hoi's gangsters who have followed him. He is mortally wounded when the hitmen barge into the church. After Ah Jong ends Fung Sei's misery with a [[euthanasia|mercy killing]], he and Li engage in a long and bloody shootout with the Triad all over the church. The battle ends with a [[Mexican standoff]] between Ah Jong, Li and Wong Hoi. Ah Jong manages to wound Wong Hoi, but the Triad leader lands two bullets in Ah Jong's [[eye sockets]] before the latter seemingly dies of his wounds. When a police squadron arrives in the scene, Wong Hoi begs to be taken into custody. Frustrated by the outcome of the battle, Li fatally shoots Wong Hoi. As a result, he is surrounded by policemen.\n\nThe credits roll with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Chow Yun-fat]] as Ah Jong (\u963f\u838a \u0100 Zhu\u0101ng, aa3 zong1), an assassin who accidentally blinds singer Jennie when he is on a mission for the criminal organization, the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]]. Ah Jong decides to take on one last mission to pay for surgery to repair her eyes. Ah Jong is called John and Jeff in some subtitled prints of the film.<ref name=\"Hall213\" /> The nickname given to Ah Jong by Li is \"Har Tau\", which roughly translates as \"Shrimp Head.\"<ref name=\"Hall215\">Hall, 1999. p.215</ref> In some dubbed and subtitled prints, his nickname is \"[[Mickey Mouse]]\" or \"Butthead\".<ref name=\"Hall215\" />\n* [[Danny Lee (actor)|Danny Lee]] as Detective Li Ying (\u674e \u9df9, ''L\u01d0 Y\u012bng'', lei5 jing1).

The nickname given to Li by Ah Jong is \"Ah B\" which roughly translates to baby or kid. In some dubbed and subtitled prints, his nickname is \"[[Dumbo]]\" or \"Numbnuts\".<ref name=\"Hall215\" />\n* [[Sally Yeh]] as Jennie (\u73cd\u59ae ''Zh\u0113nn\u012b'', zan1 nei4), a nightclub singer who is blinded by Ah Jong in a shootout. Jennie falls in love with Ah Jong, before learning of his profession as a killer.\n* [[Kenneth Tsang]] as Sgt. Tsang Yeh, Li's police partner. Tsang helps find the whereabouts of Fung Sei which will lead Li to Ah Jong. In some subtitled prints, his name is Randy Chang.\n* Chu Kong as Fung Sei, Ah Jong's Triad manager and close friend. After Ah Jong is spotted on a hit, Fung Sei is ordered to kill Ah Jong. In some subtitled prints, his name is \"Sidney Fong.\"\n* [[Shing Fui-On|Shing Fui-on]] as Hay Wong Hoi (\u6c6a\u6d77 W\u0101ng H\u01cei, wong1 hoi2), a ruthless Triad boss and a coward who tries to tied up loose ends so he can run the triad. In some subtitled versions he is \"Johnny Weng.\"\n* Ricky Yi Fan-wai as Frank Chen, a contract killer/assassin hired by Wong Hoi to kill Ah Jong.\n\n==Themes== <!-- Themes are unifying or dominant ideas and motifs in a film's elements (such as plot, dialogue, photography, and sound) conveying a position or message about life, society, and human nature.

The first cut of ''A Better Tomorrow 2'' was too long for the studio<ref name=\"Hall20\">Hall, 2009. p.20</ref> so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer [[Tsui Hark]] and Woo.<ref>Heard, 1999. p.55</ref> According to producer [[Terence Chang]], Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined ''A Better Tomorrow 2'' and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio.

However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the superintendent so they could continue filming.<ref name=\"locations\" /> Scenes from the [[Duanwu Festival|Dragon Boat festival]] were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later.

John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot.<ref name=\"locations\" /> The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made to look like a church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church.<ref name=\"locations\" /> The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.<ref>Elder, 2005. p.80</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nTsui and Woo disagreed on the musical aspects of the film. For the opening scene, Woo wanted the singer to perform a [[jazz music|jazz]] song and have the killer playing a saxophone. Tsui rejected this idea as he felt that the Hong Kong audiences did not understand or like jazz. Woo stated that he \"had to change it to a Chinese song, the kind of song they always use in Hong Kong movies.\"<ref name=\"Heard78\">Heard, 1999. p.78</ref><ref name=\"Heard79\" /> Actress [[Sally Yeh]] who performed the [[Cantopop]] songs did not feel they were appropriate for the film. The songs were requested by the studio and written specifically for ''The Killer''.<ref name=\"Hall20\" /><ref name=\"yehinterview\" />\n\nThe [[Film score|film's music]] was composed by [[Lowell Lo]] and edited by David Wu.<ref name=\"Hall209\">Hall, 1999. p.209</ref> A reoccurring musical theme is a haunting [[vibraphone]] theme which is first heard over the opening credits.<ref name=\"Hall74\">Hall, 1999. p.74</ref> The harmonica motif in the film was influenced by the soundtracks of [[Ennio Morricone]], specifically the soundtrack to ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', and used a bottle blower to give the music a haunting effect. David Wu said the influence of the Harmonica music in [[Sergio Leone]]'s western films was a strong influence on his work.<ref name=\"Hall209\" /> During the final action scene when the statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] is destroyed, the action music transitions to \"Overture\" from ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'' by [[George Frideric Handel]]. This was the idea of editor David Wu who felt that it would break up the numbing effect of the kinetic violence.<ref name=\"Hall76\">Hall, 1999. p.76</ref>\n\n== Release ==\n<!-- Provide information on the film's release, expanding upon the information in the infobox where necessary.
