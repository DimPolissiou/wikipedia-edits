of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]]. Xi was [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|vice president]] from 2008 to 2013 and [[Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] from 2010 to 2012.\n\nXi is the first [[List of general secretaries and chairmen of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] born after the [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|establishment]] of the People's Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]]. He has sought to expand China's African and Eurasian influence through the [[Belt and Road Initiative]].\n\nAs the central figure of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|fifth generation of leadership]] of the People's Republic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217211144/http://www.giga-hamburg.de/dl/download.php?d=%2Fcontent%2Fias%2Farchiv%2Fcds%2Fcds_0905.pdf|title=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs|last=|first=|date=May 2009|website=giga-hamburg.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archivedate=17 February 2012|accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref> Xi has significantly centralised institutional power by taking on a wide range of leadership positions, including chairing the newly formed [[National Security Commission of the Communist Party of China|National Security Commission]], as well as new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet.

The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people.

(PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]].

Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

Irving (1818-1901), Photograph of a group of Shakers - single image]][[File:Shakertown Trustees House 2005-05-27.jpeg|thumb|Trustees Office, Shakertown, [[Pleasant Hill, Kentucky]]]]\nThe [[Shakers]] are a sect of Christianity which practices celibacy, communal living, confession of sin, egalitarianism, and pacifism. After starting in England, the Shakers left that country for the English colonies in North America in 1774. As they gained converts, the Shakers established numerous communities in the late-18th century through the entire 19th century. The first villages organized in [[Upstate New York]] and the [[New England]] states, and, through Shaker missionary efforts, '''Shaker communities''' appeared in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states. Communities of Shakers were governed by area bishoprics and within the communities individuals were grouped into \"family\" units and worked together to manage daily activities. By 1836 eighteen major, long-term societies were founded, comprising some sixty families, along with a failed commune in [[Indiana]]. Many smaller, short-lived communities were established over the course of the 19th century, including two failed ventures into the [[Southeastern United States]] and an urban community in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The Shakers peaked in population by the 1840s and early 1850s, with a membership between 4,000 and 9,000. Growth in membership began to stagnate by the mid 1850s. In the turmoil of the [[American Civil War]] and subsequent [[The Industrial Revolution in the United States|Industrial Revolution]], Shakerism went into severe decline. As the number of living Shakers diminished, Shaker communes were disbanded or otherwise ceased to exist. Some of their buildings and sites have become museums, and many are historic districts under the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The only active community is [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]] in Maine, which is composed of at least three active members.\n\n==The first Shaker societies==\nThe first Shaker community was established north of Albany, and was first called \"Niskayuna\", a rendering of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] name for the land. Later the town they were in was officially named [[Watervliet (town), New York|Watervliet]]. That part of the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of Watervliet is now in the town of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] (since 1895), and the name Watervliet is now limited to the [[administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] of [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]] (1896). In addition, [[Niskayuna, New York|Niskayuna]] is now the name of a town to the northwest. This has led to some confusion, because many historical accounts refer to them as the Niskayuna Shakers, while others refer to them as Watervliet Shakers. The [[Watervliet Shaker Historic District]] is where Mother Ann Lee was buried.{{sfn|Stein|1992|pp=10\u201337}}\n\nBy 1780, the missionary work of the Shakers had attracted many new converts. An extensive series of trips throughout New England from 1781 through 1783 brought in followers across the entire region. Converts began appearing in [[New Lebanon, New York|New Lebanon]] and [[Canaan, New York]]; [[Hancock County, Indiana|Hancock]], [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]], [[Richmond, Massachusetts|Richmond]], [[Ashfield, Massachusetts|Ashfield]], [[Harvard, Massachusetts|Harvard]], and [[Shirley, Massachusetts]]; and the states of [[Connecticut]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Maine]] (then part of Massachusetts), among other locations.\n\nIn 1784, Ann Lee and her brother both died, leaving James Whittaker to lead the faith. By 1787, he too had died, and Joseph Meacham assumed the role as leader. Meacham appointed Lucy Wright of Pittsfield to co-lead, and under their auspices they organized a central village in [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society|New Lebanon]], as well as organizing the original settlement of Watervliet. By 1790, the [[Hancock Shaker Village|Hancock Village]] was also organized. After the formation of the New Lebanon, Watervliet, and Hancock communities, within three years nine more communities would organize in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine.\n\n==Settlement growth==\nThe Shakers built more than 20 settlements that attracted at least 20,000 converts over the next century.<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1986|p=xx}}; {{harvnb|Stein|1992|p=114}}</ref> Strict believers in celibacy, Shakers acquired their members through conversion, [[indenturing]] children, and adoption of orphans. Some children, such as [[Isaac N. Youngs]], came to the Shakers when their parents joined, then grew up to become faithful members as adults.{{sfn|Wergland|2006|loc=Chapter 2}}\n\nAs their communities grew, women and men shared leadership of the Shaker communities. Women preached and received revelations as the Spirit fell upon them. Thriving on the religious enthusiasm of the [[Great Awakening|first and second Great Awakenings]], the Shakers declared their messianic, communitarian message with significant response. One early convert observed: \"The wisdom of their instructions, the purity of their doctrine, their Christ-like deportment, and the simplicity of their manners, all appeared truly apostolical.\" The Shakers represent a small but important Utopian response to the gospel. Preaching in their communities knew no boundaries of gender, social class, or education.{{sfn|Duduit|1992|pp=32-33}}\n\n==Village organization==\n\n===Bishoprics===\nShaker communities were grouped into bishoprics, which were governing units. The leadership team, called a ministry, resided in the bishopric's primary community. This ministry consisted of two men known as Elders and two women known as Eldresses. The New Lebanon Bishopric, the primary bishopric unit, was located in New York and included the Mount Lebanon and Watervliet Shaker Villages,{{sfn|Paterwic|2008|p=18}} as well as, after 1859, [[Groveland Shaker Village]]. In addition to its own member communities, the ministry of New Lebanon Bishopric oversaw all other Shaker bishoprics and communes. After New Lebanon closed in 1947, this central Ministry relocated to Hancock Shaker Village, and after the closure of that community in 1960, to [[Canterbury Shaker Village]]. When Canterbury closed in 1992, Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village remained as the last extant Shaker commune.\n\n===Family groups===\nA Shaker village was divided into groups or \"families.\" The leading group in each village was the Church Family, and it was surrounded by satellite families that were often named for points on the [[compass rose]]. Managing each family was a leadership team consisting of two Elders and two Eldresses. Shakers lived together as brothers and sisters. Each house was divided so that men and women did most things separately. They used different staircases and doors. They sat on opposite sides of the room in worship, at meals, and in \"union meetings\" held to provide supervised socialization between the sexes. However, the daily business of a Shaker village required the brethren and sisters to interact, as did the dancing and other vigorous activity of their worship services. Though there was a division of labor between men and women, they also cooperated in carrying out many tasks, such as harvesting apples, food production, laundry, and gathering firewood.{{sfn|Stein|1992|p=94}} Every family was designed to be self-supporting with its own farm and businesses, but in times of hardship, other parts of the village, or even other Shaker villages, pitched in to help the afflicted.\n\n==Communities==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Irving (1818-1901), Photograph of a group of Shakers - single image]][[File:Shakertown Trustees House 2005-05-27.jpeg|thumb|Trustees Office, Shakertown, [[Pleasant Hill, Kentucky]]]]\nThe [[Shakers]] are a sect of Christianity which practices celibacy, communal living, confession of sin, egalitarianism, and pacifism. After starting in England, the Shakers left that country for the English colonies in North America in 1774. As they gained converts, the Shakers established numerous communities in the late-18th century through the entire 19th century. The first villages organized in [[Upstate New York]] and the [[New England]] states, and, through Shaker missionary efforts, '''Shaker communities''' appeared in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] states. Communities of Shakers were governed by area bishoprics and within the communities individuals were grouped into \"family\" units and worked together to manage daily activities. By 1836 eighteen major, long-term societies were founded, comprising some sixty families, along with a failed commune in [[Indiana]]. Many smaller, short-lived communities were established over the course of the 19th century, including two failed ventures into the [[Southeastern United States]] and an urban community in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The Shakers peaked in population by the 1840s and early 1850s, with a membership between 4,000 and 9,000. Growth in membership began to stagnate by the mid 1850s. In the turmoil of the [[American Civil War]] and subsequent [[The Industrial Revolution in the United States|Industrial Revolution]], Shakerism went into severe decline. As the number of living Shakers diminished, Shaker communes were disbanded or otherwise ceased to exist. Some of their buildings and sites have become museums, and many are historic districts under the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The only active community is [[Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village]] in Maine, which is composed of at least three active members.\n\n==The first Shaker societies==\nThe first Shaker community was established north of Albany, and was first called \"Niskayuna\", a rendering of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] name for the land. Later the town they were in was officially named [[Watervliet (town), New York|Watervliet]]. That part of the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of Watervliet is now in the town of [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] (since 1895), and the name Watervliet is now limited to the [[administrative divisions of New York#City|city]] of [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]] (1896). In addition, [[Niskayuna, New York|Niskayuna]] is now the name of a town to the northwest. This has led to some confusion, because many historical accounts refer to them as the Niskayuna Shakers, while others refer to them as Watervliet Shakers. The [[Watervliet Shaker Historic District]] is where Mother Ann Lee was buried.{{sfn|Stein|1992|pp=10\u201337}}\n\nBy 1780, the missionary work of the Shakers had attracted many new converts. An extensive series of trips throughout New England from 1781 through 1783 brought in followers across the entire region. Converts began appearing in [[New Lebanon, New York|New Lebanon]] and [[Canaan, New York]]; [[Hancock County, Indiana|Hancock]], [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts|Pittsfield]], [[Richmond, Massachusetts|Richmond]], [[Ashfield, Massachusetts|Ashfield]], [[Harvard, Massachusetts|Harvard]], and [[Shirley, Massachusetts]]; and the states of [[Connecticut]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Maine]] (then part of Massachusetts), among other locations.\n\nIn 1784, Ann Lee and her brother both died, leaving James Whittaker to lead the faith. By 1787, he too had died, and Joseph Meacham assumed the role as leader. Meacham appointed Lucy Wright of Pittsfield to co-lead, and under their auspices they organized a central village in [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society|New Lebanon]], as well as organizing the original settlement of Watervliet. By 1790, the [[Hancock Shaker Village|Hancock Village]] was also organized. After the formation of the New Lebanon, Watervliet, and Hancock communities, within three years nine more communities would organize in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Maine.\n\n==Settlement growth==\nThe Shakers built more than 20 settlements that attracted at least 20,000 converts over the next century.<ref>{{harvnb|Brewer|1986|p=xx}}; {{harvnb|Stein|1992|p=114}}</ref> Strict believers in celibacy, Shakers acquired their members through conversion, [[indenturing]] children, and adoption of orphans. Some children, such as [[Isaac N. Youngs]], came to the Shakers when their parents joined, then grew up to become faithful members as adults.{{sfn|Wergland|2006|loc=Chapter 2}}\n\nAs their communities grew, women and men shared leadership of the Shaker communities. Women preached and received revelations as the Spirit fell upon them. Thriving on the religious enthusiasm of the [[Great Awakening|first and second Great Awakenings]], the Shakers declared their messianic, communitarian message with significant response. One early convert observed: \"The wisdom of their instructions, the purity of their doctrine, their Christ-like deportment, and the simplicity of their manners, all appeared truly apostolical.\" The Shakers represent a small but important Utopian response to the gospel. Preaching in their communities knew no boundaries of gender, social class, or education.{{sfn|Duduit|1992|pp=32-33}}\n\n==Village organization==\n\n===Bishoprics===\nShaker communities were grouped into bishoprics, which were governing units. The leadership team, called a ministry, resided in the bishopric's primary community. This ministry consisted of two men known as Elders and two women known as Eldresses. The New Lebanon Bishopric, the primary bishopric unit, was located in New York and included the Mount Lebanon and Watervliet Shaker Villages,{{sfn|Paterwic|2008|p=18}} as well as, after 1859, [[Groveland Shaker Village]]. In addition to its own member communities, the ministry of New Lebanon Bishopric oversaw all other Shaker bishoprics and communes. After New Lebanon closed in 1947, this central Ministry relocated to Hancock Shaker Village, and after the closure of that community in 1960, to [[Canterbury Shaker Village]]. When Canterbury closed in 1992, Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village remained as the last extant Shaker commune.\n\n===Family groups===\nA Shaker village was divided into groups or \"families.\" The leading group in each village was the Church Family, and it was surrounded by satellite families that were often named for points on the [[compass rose]]. Managing each family was a leadership team consisting of two Elders and two Eldresses. Shakers lived together as brothers and sisters. Each house was divided so that men and women did most things separately. They used different staircases and doors. They sat on opposite sides of the room in worship, at meals, and in \"union meetings\" held to provide supervised socialization between the sexes. However, the daily business of a Shaker village required the brethren and sisters to interact, as did the dancing and other vigorous activity of their worship services. Though there was a division of labor between men and women, they also cooperated in carrying out many tasks, such as harvesting apples, food production, laundry, and gathering firewood.{{sfn|Stein|1992|p=94}} Every family was designed to be self-supporting with its own farm and businesses, but in times of hardship, other parts of the village, or even other Shaker villages, pitched in to help the afflicted.\n\n==Communities==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
