Known as either \"Trinity\" or \"America's Battalion\", the unit falls under the command of the [[3rd Marine Regiment (United States)|3rd Marine Regiment]] of the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.3rdmardiv.marines.mil/Units/3dMarineRegiment.aspx |accessdate=23 January 2013 |title=3d Marine Regiment |publisher=United States Marine Corps}}</ref> The unit consists of approximately 1124 U.S. Marines and [[United States Navy]] sailors.<ref group=\"nb\">The [[United States Marine Corps]] falls under the [[United States Department of the Navy]]. Traditionally, the [[United States Navy]] has, and still does to this day, supply the U.S. Marine Corps with both [[Hospital Corpsman|hospital corpsmen]] and chaplains. See also [[Marine Corps Operating Forces]].</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe battalion was originally formed at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]] in 1942 and saw action on both [[Bougainville campaign|Bougainville]] and [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]] during World War II, where it was awarded the first of its [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citations]] for \"gallantry, determination, and [[Morale|esprit de corps]] in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions\"; and the first of its [[Navy Unit Commendation]]s for \"outstanding service\".  Marines in the battalion were also awarded one [[Medal of Honor]] and seven [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]] during the war.\n\nFollowing World War II, 3rd Battalion was disbanded until 1951, when it was reformed in California. The battalion was alerted for possible deployment during the 1956 [[Suez War]] and the 1958 intervention in Lebanon. In 1965, the Marines of 3rd Battalion were deployed to the [[Vietnam War]] and participated in [[Operation Starlite]], the first major Marine engagement of that conflict. The battalion continued to see major action through Vietnam and was rotated back to the United States in 1969. Famous alumni from its time in Vietnam include Corporal [[Robert Emmett O'Malley]], the first Marine in Vietnam to be awarded the Medal of Honor, [[Oliver North]], and [[John Ripley (USMC)|John Ripley]]. Around the end of the Vietnam War, the Battalion was deactivated for a second time in 1974.\n\nIn 1975, 3rd Battalion was reformed for the third (and last) time at [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii]]. During this period, the battalion conducted numerous deployments in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In 1983, 3rd Battalion deployed off the coast of Lebanon for several weeks during a particularly tense period in the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]]. During the 1980s, the battalion was briefly commanded by [[Charles Krulak]], later the 31st [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], who nicknamed 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines \"America's Battalion\" because it was similar to the nickname used by the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. 3rd Battalion deployed again in 1990 as part of [[Operation Desert Storm|Operation Desert Shield]] and saw action at the [[Battle of Khafji]] and again during the liberation of Kuwait. In the early 21st century the battalion deployed overseas six times as part of the [[War on Terror|Global War on Terror]]: three times for [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan and three times for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] in Iraq.<ref name = \"3d Marines\"/> One Marine from the battalion, [[Dakota Meyer]], was awarded the Medal of Honor during the Global War on Terror.\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:3rd Battalion 3rd Marines Command and Staff.jpg|thumb|300px|Command and Staff of 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines in 2010]]\n* Headquarters and Service Company\n* Company I (India Company)\n* Company K (Kilo Company)\n* Company L (Lima Company)\n* Weapons Company\n\nLike many infantry battalions in the Marine Corps, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines consists of five companies: three [[Company (military unit)#Marine Corps|Rifle Companies]], a [[Headquarters and Service Company]] (H&S), and a [[Weapons company|Weapons Company]].

It comes from the nickname \"America's Team\", which was used by the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Krulak, who was a big Cowboys fan, modified the nickname to apply to 3rd Battalion. According to Krulak, at one point a friend of his sent him a letter addressed to the \"Commanding Officer, America's Battalion\". With nothing else on the envelope, the [[United States Postal Service]] still managed to deliver the letter properly. Krulak commented that \"if the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] recognized 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines as 'America's Battalion,' then they certainly must be.\" So from then on, he considered it 'official'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikecompany33.com/americasbattalion.html |accessdate=24 November 2006 |title=America's Battalion |author =Robert V.

Known as either \"Trinity\" or \"America's Battalion\", the unit falls under the command of the [[3rd Marine Regiment (United States)|3rd Marine Regiment]] of the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.3rdmardiv.marines.mil/Units/3dMarineRegiment.aspx |accessdate=23 January 2013 |title=3d Marine Regiment |publisher=United States Marine Corps}}</ref> The unit consists of approximately 1124 U.S. Marines and [[United States Navy]] sailors.<ref group=\"nb\">The [[United States Marine Corps]] falls under the [[United States Department of the Navy]]. Traditionally, the [[United States Navy]] has, and still does to this day, supply the U.S. Marine Corps with both [[Hospital Corpsman|hospital corpsmen]] and chaplains. See also [[Marine Corps Operating Forces]].</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe battalion was originally formed at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]] in 1942 and saw action on both [[Bougainville campaign|Bougainville]] and [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]] during World War II, where it was awarded the first of its [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citations]] for \"gallantry, determination, and [[Morale|esprit de corps]] in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions\"; and the first of its [[Navy Unit Commendation]]s for \"outstanding service\".  Marines in the battalion were also awarded one [[Medal of Honor]] and seven [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Crosses]] during the war.\n\nFollowing World War II, 3rd Battalion was disbanded until 1951, when it was reformed in California. The battalion was alerted for possible deployment during the 1956 [[Suez War]] and the 1958 intervention in Lebanon. In 1965, the Marines of 3rd Battalion were deployed to the [[Vietnam War]] and participated in [[Operation Starlite]], the first major Marine engagement of that conflict. The battalion continued to see major action through Vietnam and was rotated back to the United States in 1969. Famous alumni from its time in Vietnam include Corporal [[Robert Emmett O'Malley]], the first Marine in Vietnam to be awarded the Medal of Honor, [[Oliver North]], and [[John Ripley (USMC)|John Ripley]]. Around the end of the Vietnam War, the Battalion was deactivated for a second time in 1974.\n\nIn 1975, 3rd Battalion was reformed for the third (and last) time at [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii]]. During this period, the battalion conducted numerous deployments in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In 1983, 3rd Battalion deployed off the coast of Lebanon for several weeks during a particularly tense period in the [[Lebanese Civil War|civil war]]. During the 1980s, the battalion was briefly commanded by [[Charles Krulak]], later the 31st [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], who nicknamed 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines \"America's Battalion\" because it was similar to the nickname used by the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. 3rd Battalion deployed again in 1990 as part of [[Operation Desert Storm|Operation Desert Shield]] and saw action at the [[Battle of Khafji]] and again during the liberation of Kuwait.

of Representatives''' is the lower house of the bicameral [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]], the [[legislature]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Pennsylvania]]. There are 203 members, elected for two-year terms from single member districts.<ref>Article II, section 2, ''[[Pennsylvania Constitution]]''.</ref><ref>Article II, section 16, ''[[Pennsylvania Constitution]]''.</ref>\n\nRepublican [[Mike Turzai]] was first elected Speaker of the House on January 6, 2015. In 2012, a State Representative district had an average population of 60,498 residents.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIt is the largest full-time state legislature in the country. (The [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]] is larger but only serves part-time.)\n\n==Hall of the House==\nThe Hall of the House contains important symbols to Pennsylvania history and the work of legislators.\n* '''Speaker's Chair:''' a throne-like chair of rank that sits directly behind the Speaker's rostrum. Architect [[Joseph Huston]] designed the chair in 1906, the year the Capitol was dedicated.\n* '''Mace:''' the House symbol of authority, peace, order and respect for law rests in a pedestal to the right of the Speaker. Its base is solid mahogany, intricately carved and capped by a brass globe engraved with the Pennsylvania coat of arms. An American Eagle perches on top. The tradition of the mace may date to the Roman Republic when attendants of Roman consuls carried bundles of sticks wrapped around an axe to enforce order. The tradition may also come directly from Pennsylvania's English heritage.\n* '''Murals:'''  a colorful panorama of Pennsylvania history appear in murals by [[Edwin Austin Abbey]]. The most commanding of the series hangs behind the Speaker's rostrum and dominates the wall behind the Speaker. It is called ''The Apotheosis of Pennsylvania''\n* '''Ceiling:''' a work of art in itself with its ornate geometry of gold leaf buttoned at the center by a charming painted illustration. In \"The Hours\", Abbey represents the passage of time in the form of 24 maidens revolving in an endless circle amidst the moon, the sun and the stars of the Milky Way.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/WU01/VC/visitor_info/our_house/what.htm|title=Page Not Found - The official website for the Pennsylvania General Assembly.|first=Legislativate Data Processing|last=Center|website=The official website for the Pennsylvania General Assembly.}}</ref>\n\n==Speaker of the House==\n{{main|Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives}}\nThe speakership is the oldest elected statewide office in the Commonwealth.  Since its first session in 1682\u2014presided over by [[William Penn]]\u2014over 130 house members have been elevated to the speaker's chair. The house cannot hold an official session in the absence of the speaker or his designated ''speaker pro tempore.''  Speaker [[K. Leroy Irvis|Leroy Irvis]] was the first African American elected speaker of any state legislature in the United States since Reconstruction. Speaker [[Dennis M. O'Brien|Dennis O'Brien]] was the only minority-party Speaker known in Pennsylvania and only the second known nationwide.
