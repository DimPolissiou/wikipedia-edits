Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and [[desk]]s), or to store things (e.g., [[cupboard]]s and [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of [[woodworking joints]] which often reflect the local culture.\n\nPeople have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a [[Venus figurine]] found in [[Russia]], depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of [[Skara Brae]] in [[Scotland]], and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as [[joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] began in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] period of [[ancient Egypt]]. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including [[stool (seat)|stools]] and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], with thrones being commonplace as well as the [[klinai]], multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by [[revival styles]]. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.<ref name=povo />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:furniture|furniture]]'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:fourniture|fourniture]]'',{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|2016}} the noun form of ''[[wikt:fournir|fournir]]'', which means to supply or provide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fournir|title=English Translation of \"fournir\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> Thus ''fourniture'' in French means supplies or provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fourniture|title=English Translation of \"fourniture\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language;{{sfn|Weekley|2013|pp=609\u2013610}} French and other Romance languages as well as German use variants of the word ''[[wikt:meubles|meubles]]'', which derives from Latin ''[[wikt:mobilia|mobilia]]'', meaning \"moveable goods\".{{sfn|Solodow|2010|p=146}}\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric furniture===\n[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 1320259 nevit.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] statue is evidence that furniture existed in the [[neolithic]]]]\nThe practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} Early humans are likely to have used tree stumps as seats, rocks as rudimentary tables, and mossy areas for sleeping.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} During the late [[palaeolithic]] or early [[neolithic]] period, from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone and animal bones.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=1}} The earliest evidence for the existence of constructed furniture is a [[Venus figurine]] found at the [[Gagarino]] site in [[Russia]], which depicts the goddess in a sitting position, on a throne.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}} A similar [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck|statue of a Mother Goddess]] was found in [[Catal Huyuk]] in [[Turkey]], dating to between 6000 and 5500 BCE.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} The inclusion of such a seat in the figurines implies that these were already common artefacts of that age.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}}\n\n[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Skara Brae]] house home furnishings, a dresser with shelves]]\nA range of unique stone furniture has been excavated in [[Skara Brae]], a [[Neolithic]] village in [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. The site dates from 3100\u20132500 BCE and due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each [[house]] shows a high degree of sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and [[limpet]] tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic [[Carved Stone Balls]] also found at the site.\n\n[[Ancient Furniture|Ancient furniture]] has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[tumulus]], the Midas Mound, in [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Gordion]], [[Turkey]]. Pieces found here include [[table (furniture)|tables]] and inlaid serving stands. There are also surviving works from the 9th-8th-century BCE [[Assyria]]n palace of [[Nimrud]]. The earliest surviving carpet, the [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]] Carpet was discovered in a frozen tomb in [[Siberia]] and has been dated between the 6th and 3rd century BCE.\n\n===Ancient Egypt===\n{{main|Art of ancient Egypt#Furniture}}\nCivilisation in [[ancient Egypt]] began with the clearance and irrigation of land along the banks of the [[River Nile]],<ref>Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'' (Charles Schribner's Sons Publishing: New York, 1966) p. 51.</ref> which began in about 6000 BCE. By that time, society in the [[Nile Valley]] was already engaged in organized agriculture and the construction of large buildings.<ref name=\"Redford 6\">Redford, Donald B. ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times.'' (Princeton: University Press, 1992), p. 6.</ref>  At this period, Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and also constructing large buildings. [[Mortar (masonry)|Mortar]] was in use by around 4000 BCE The inhabitants of the Nile Valley and delta were self-sufficient and were raising barley and [[emmer]] (an early variety of wheat) and stored it in pits lined with reed mats.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\">Carl Roebuck, ''The World of Ancient Times'', p. 52.</ref>  They raised cattle, goats and pigs and they wove linens and baskets.<ref name=\"Carl Roebuck p. 52\"/> Evidence of furniture from the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]] is scarce, but samples from [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]] tombs indicate an already advanced use of furnishings in the houses of the age.{{sfn|Metropolitan Museum of Art|1999|p=117}}\n\nDuring the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|dynastic period]], which began in around 3200 BCE, Egyptian art developed significantly, and this included furniture design.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood, but other materials were sometimes used, such as [[leather]],{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} and pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory and ebony, for decoration.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=14}} Wood found in Egypt was not suitable for furniture construction, so it had to be imported into the country from other places,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=1}} particularly [[Phoenicia]].{{sfn|Gadalla|2007|p=243}} The scarcity of wood necessitated innovation in construction techniques. The use of [[scarf joint]]s to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this,{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|pp=13\u201314}} as well as construction of [[Wood veneer|veneers]] in which low quality cheap wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe earliest used seating furniture in the dynastic period was the [[stool (seat)|stool]], which was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|p=6}} and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} and had hinges made of [[bronze]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Full [[chair]]s were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the [[eighteenth dynasty]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items \u2013 perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=21}} as well as beds and storage chests.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=22}}{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=24}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStool with woven seat MET 14.10.3 view 4.jpg|Stool with woven seat; 1991\u20131450 BC; wood & reed; height: 13&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJewelry chest of Sithathoryunet MET DP330328.jpg|Jewelry chest of Sithathoryunet; 1887\u20131813 BC; ebony, ivory, gold, carnelian, blue faience and silver; height: 36.7 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nEgyptian Museum 000 (37).jpg|The ''Throne of [[Tutankhamun]]''; 1336\u20131327 BC; wood covered with sheets of gold, silver, [[semi-precious stone|semi-precious]] and other stones, faience, glass and bronze; height: 1&nbsp;m; [[Egyptian Museum]] (Cairo)\n\nHatnefer's Chair MET 21M CAT047R4 (cropped).jpg|Chair of [[Hatnefer]]; 1492\u20131473&nbsp;BC; boxwood, cypress, ebony & linen cord; height: 53&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n[[File:Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter. a, b-klismos, and c-chair.jpg|thumb|225px|Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter: a, b-klismos, and c-chair]]\nHistorical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources, including [[Greek literature|literature]], [[terracotta]], sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze, or marble.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was an important material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} A common technique was to construct the main sections of the furniture with cheap solid wood, then apply a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Greek furniture construction also made use of [[dowels]] and [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.<ref>Richter, 125.</ref>\n\nThe modern word \u201c[[throne]]\u201d is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.<ref>Richter, 13.</ref> The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.</ref> Other Greek seats included the ''[[klismos]]'', an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design,<ref>Linda Maria Gigante, \u201cFunerary Art,\u201d in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed.

Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe, leading eventually to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BC. Rome thus took over production and distribution of Greek furniture, and the boundary between the two is blurred. The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence, and styles distinctly their own.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nRoman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal and stone, with marble and limestone used for outside furniture. Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly. Some imported wood such as satinwood was used for decoration. The most commonly used metal was bronze, of which numerous examples have survived, for example, headrests for couches and metal stools. Similar to the Greeks, [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together, and also practised veneering.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nThe 1738 and 1748 excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] revealed Roman furniture, preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Vesuvius]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHandbook of ornament; a grammar of art, industrial and architectural designing in all its branches, for practical as well as theoretical use (1900) (14804265373).jpg|Illustration of Roman furniture details, from 1900, very similar with [[Empire style]] furniture\nClevelandart 1995.10.jpg|Tripod base; circa 100 BC; bronze; overall: 77 x 32.3 x 28&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA)\nForziere con sacrificio a giove, I secolo dc, legno, ferro e bronzo, con ageminature, dalla casa di trittolemo a pompei (napoli, man) 01.jpg|Treasure chest with a sacrifice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] depicted on it; 1st century AD; wood, iron and bronze, with ageminature; from [[Pompeii]]; [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Naples]], Italy)\nCouch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays MET DP138722.jpg|Couch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays; 1st\u20132nd century AD; wood, bone and glass; couch: 105.4 \u00d7 76.2 \u00d7 214.6&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===\n[[File:Cassone (one of a pair) MET DP106698.jpg|thumb|Renaissance [[cassone]]; circa 1550-1560; carved and partially gilded walnut; 86.4 x 181.9 x 67.3 cm; from [[Rome]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn contrast to the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, there is comparatively little evidence of furniture from the 5th to the 15th century.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} Very few extant pieces survive, and evidence in literature is also scarce.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the [[middle ages]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} For example, a throne similar to that of [[Zeus]] is depicted in a sixth-century [[diptych]],{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} while the [[Bayeux tapestry]] shows [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] seated on seats similar to the Roman [[sella curulis]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=35}}\n\nThe furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented with carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of culture in general occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs that frequently incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as [[Palladianism]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Louis Quinze]] in [[French furniture]], others, such as the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCoffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen) MET DP273975.jpg|[[Gothic art|Gothic]] German coffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen); circa 1325-1350; oak, inlay, tempera, wrought-iron mounts; overall: 12.1 x 27.3 x 16.5; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nPaschal Candlestick MET DP102923.jpg|Gothic Spanish paschal candlestick; circa 1450-1500; wood with paint and gilding; 195.6 \u00d7 43.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|[[Renaissance]] cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French Renaissance dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570-1590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century, the fashion was set in England by the French art.

In this era, most of the furniture had metal and enamelled decorations in it and some of the furniture was covered in inlays of marbles lapis lazuli, and porphyry and other stones. By mid-century this [[Baroque]] style was displaced by the graceful curves, shining [[ormolu]], and intricate [[marquetry]] of the [[Rococo]] style, which in turn gave way around 1770 to the more severe lines of [[Neoclassicism]], modeled after the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.\n<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nOlanda, guardaroba (kast), 1625-50 ca.jpg|Dutch wardrobe; 1625-1650; oak with ebony and rosewood veneers; overall: 244.5 x 224.3 x 85.2 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nClevelandart 1968.31.jpg|Console table depicting [[Chronos]], or the father time; 1695; painted and gilded wood, with marble at its top; overall: 95.3 x 107.3 x 62.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nGermany, Mainz, 18th century - Gaming Table - 1953.284 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Gaming Table; circa 1735; wood and ivory marquetry; overall: 78.7 x 94 x 54.6 cm; from [[Mainz]] (Germany); Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nCommode by Gilles Joubert, France, c. 1735, oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze, imitation marble - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston - 20180922 164303.jpg|French commode; by [[Gilles Joubert]]; circa 1735; oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze and imitation marble; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nCommode MET DP105695.jpg|Parisian commode; 1745-1749; pine and oak veneered with amaranth and bois satin\u00e9, walnut, gilt-bronze mounts, and portoro marble top; 87.6 x 139.7 x 57.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) (part of a set) MET DP105705.jpg|Armchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine); circa 1754-1756; carved and gilded beech, wool and silk tapestry; overall: 103.8 \u00d7 73.7 \u00d7 66 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJean pierre latz, commode, 1745-50 ca, con terracotta di un seguace di clodion.jpg|Rococo chest of drawers; circa 1750; oak, tulipwood marquetry, gilt metal mounts and marble; overall: 88 x 156.5 x 69.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) MET DP106642.jpg|German armchair; circa 1750\u20131760; carved and gilded beech, covered in blue damask not original to the armchair; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nSk\u00e5p i stora salongen.

Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and [[desk]]s), or to store things (e.g., [[cupboard]]s and [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of [[decorative art]]. In addition to furniture's functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from many materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of [[woodworking joints]] which often reflect the local culture.\n\nPeople have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the beginning of human civilisation. Archaeological research shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a [[Venus figurine]] found in [[Russia]], depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the homes of [[Skara Brae]] in [[Scotland]], and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques such as [[joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] began in the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|early dynastic]] period of [[ancient Egypt]]. This era saw constructed wooden pieces, including [[stool (seat)|stools]] and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], with thrones being commonplace as well as the [[klinai]], multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by [[revival styles]]. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards [[Modernism]]. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.<ref name=povo />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:furniture|furniture]]'' is derived from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[wikt:fourniture|fourniture]]'',{{sfn|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|2016}} the noun form of ''[[wikt:fournir|fournir]]'', which means to supply or provide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fournir|title=English Translation of \"fournir\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> Thus ''fourniture'' in French means supplies or provisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/fourniture|title=English Translation of \"fourniture\" \u2013 Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is specific to that language;{{sfn|Weekley|2013|pp=609\u2013610}} French and other Romance languages as well as German use variants of the word ''[[wikt:meubles|meubles]]'', which derives from Latin ''[[wikt:mobilia|mobilia]]'', meaning \"moveable goods\".{{sfn|Solodow|2010|p=146}}\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric furniture===\n[[File:Museum of Anatolian Civilizations 1320259 nevit.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]] statue is evidence that furniture existed in the [[neolithic]]]]\nThe practice of using natural objects as rudimentary pieces of furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilisation.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} Early humans are likely to have used tree stumps as seats, rocks as rudimentary tables, and mossy areas for sleeping.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} During the late [[palaeolithic]] or early [[neolithic]] period, from around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture, using wood, stone and animal bones.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=1}} The earliest evidence for the existence of constructed furniture is a [[Venus figurine]] found at the [[Gagarino]] site in [[Russia]], which depicts the goddess in a sitting position, on a throne.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}} A similar [[Seated Woman of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck|statue of a Mother Goddess]] was found in [[Catal Huyuk]] in [[Turkey]], dating to between 6000 and 5500 BCE.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=4}} The inclusion of such a seat in the figurines implies that these were already common artefacts of that age.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=2}}\n\n[[File:Skara Brae house 1 5.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Skara Brae]] house home furnishings, a dresser with shelves]]\nA range of unique stone furniture has been excavated in [[Skara Brae]], a [[Neolithic]] village in [[Orkney]], [[Scotland]]. The site dates from 3100\u20132500 BCE and due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone, a readily available material that could be worked easily and turned into items for use within the household. Each [[house]] shows a high degree of sophistication and was equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers and beds to shelves, stone seats, and [[limpet]] tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important as it symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is therefore the first item seen when entering, perhaps displaying symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic [[Carved Stone Balls]] also found at the site.\n\n[[Ancient Furniture|Ancient furniture]] has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE [[Phrygians|Phrygian]] [[tumulus]], the Midas Mound, in [[Gordion Furniture and Wooden Artifacts|Gordion]], [[Turkey]].

The use of [[scarf joint]]s to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam was one example of this,{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|pp=13\u201314}} as well as construction of [[Wood veneer|veneers]] in which low quality cheap wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.{{sfn|Smardzewski|2015|p=14}}\n\nThe earliest used seating furniture in the dynastic period was the [[stool (seat)|stool]], which was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family down to ordinary citizens.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Various different designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs, and others with crossed splayed legs; almost all had rectangular seats, however.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three legged structure with a concave seat, designed for comfort during labour,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|p=6}} and the much more ornate folding stool, with crossed folding legs,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} which were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory,{{sfn|Litchfield|2011|pp=6\u20137}} and had hinges made of [[bronze]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=15}} Full [[chair]]s were much rarer in early Egypt, being limited to only wealthy and high ranking people, and seen as a status symbol; they did not reach ordinary households until the [[eighteenth dynasty]].{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=17}} Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables, which are heavily represented in art, but almost nonexistent as preserved items \u2013 perhaps because they were placed outside tombs rather than within,{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=21}} as well as beds and storage chests.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=22}}{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=24}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nStool with woven seat MET 14.10.3 view 4.jpg|Stool with woven seat; 1991\u20131450 BC; wood & reed; height: 13&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJewelry chest of Sithathoryunet MET DP330328.jpg|Jewelry chest of Sithathoryunet; 1887\u20131813 BC; ebony, ivory, gold, carnelian, blue faience and silver; height: 36.7 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nEgyptian Museum 000 (37).jpg|The ''Throne of [[Tutankhamun]]''; 1336\u20131327 BC; wood covered with sheets of gold, silver, [[semi-precious stone|semi-precious]] and other stones, faience, glass and bronze; height: 1&nbsp;m; [[Egyptian Museum]] (Cairo)\n\nHatnefer's Chair MET 21M CAT047R4 (cropped).jpg|Chair of [[Hatnefer]]; 1492\u20131473&nbsp;BC; boxwood, cypress, ebony & linen cord; height: 53&nbsp;cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n[[File:Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter. a, b-klismos, and c-chair.jpg|thumb|225px|Three illustrations of ancient Greek chairs, each being notated with a letter: a, b-klismos, and c-chair]]\nHistorical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources, including [[Greek literature|literature]], [[terracotta]], sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze, or marble.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was an important material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} A common technique was to construct the main sections of the furniture with cheap solid wood, then apply a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Greek furniture construction also made use of [[dowels]] and [[Mortise and tenon|tenons]] for joining the wooden parts of a piece together.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=39}} Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe, and furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold or other precious materials.<ref>Richter, 125.</ref>\n\nThe modern word \u201c[[throne]]\u201d is derived from the ancient Greek ''thronos'' (Greek singular: \u03b8\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), which was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status or honor.<ref>Richter, 13.</ref> The colossal chryselephantine statue of [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|Zeus at Olympia]], constructed by [[Phidias]] and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne, which was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony and ivory, according to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]].<ref>Richter, 14; NH 5.11.2ff.</ref> Other Greek seats included the ''[[klismos]]'', an elegant Greek chair with a curved backrest and legs whose form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design,<ref>Linda Maria Gigante, \u201cFunerary Art,\u201d in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'', Vol. 1, ed.

Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe, leading eventually to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BC. Rome thus took over production and distribution of Greek furniture, and the boundary between the two is blurred. The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence, and styles distinctly their own.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nRoman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal and stone, with marble and limestone used for outside furniture. Very little wooden furniture survives intact, but there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly. Some imported wood such as satinwood was used for decoration. The most commonly used metal was bronze, of which numerous examples have survived, for example, headrests for couches and metal stools. Similar to the Greeks, [[Demography of the Roman Empire|Romans]] used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together, and also practised veneering.{{sfn|Blakemore|2006|p=61}}\n\nThe 1738 and 1748 excavations of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]] revealed Roman furniture, preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Vesuvius]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nHandbook of ornament; a grammar of art, industrial and architectural designing in all its branches, for practical as well as theoretical use (1900) (14804265373).jpg|Illustration of Roman furniture details, from 1900, very similar with [[Empire style]] furniture\nClevelandart 1995.10.jpg|Tripod base; circa 100 BC; bronze; overall: 77 x 32.3 x 28&nbsp;cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], USA)\nForziere con sacrificio a giove, I secolo dc, legno, ferro e bronzo, con ageminature, dalla casa di trittolemo a pompei (napoli, man) 01.jpg|Treasure chest with a sacrifice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] depicted on it; 1st century AD; wood, iron and bronze, with ageminature; from [[Pompeii]]; [[National Archaeological Museum, Naples|Naples National Archaeological Museum]] ([[Naples]], Italy)\nCouch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays MET DP138722.jpg|Couch and footstool with bone carvings and glass inlays; 1st\u20132nd century AD; wood, bone and glass; couch: 105.4 \u00d7 76.2 \u00d7 214.6&nbsp;cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n</gallery>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Medieval and Renaissance Europe===\n[[File:Cassone (one of a pair) MET DP106698.jpg|thumb|Renaissance [[cassone]]; circa 1550-1560; carved and partially gilded walnut; 86.4 x 181.9 x 67.3 cm; from [[Rome]]; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIn contrast to the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome, there is comparatively little evidence of furniture from the 5th to the 15th century.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} Very few extant pieces survive, and evidence in literature is also scarce.{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} It is likely that the style of furniture prevalent in late antiquity persisted throughout the [[middle ages]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} For example, a throne similar to that of [[Zeus]] is depicted in a sixth-century [[diptych]],{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=33}} while the [[Bayeux tapestry]] shows [[Edward the Confessor]] and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold]] seated on seats similar to the Roman [[sella curulis]].{{sfn|Lucie-Smith|1979|p=35}}\n\nThe furniture of the [[Middle Ages]] was usually heavy, [[oak]], and ornamented with carved designs. Along with the other arts, the Italian [[Renaissance]] of the fourteenth and fifteenth century marked a rebirth in design, often inspired by the [[Greco-Roman]] tradition. A similar explosion of design, and renaissance of culture in general occurred in Northern Europe, starting in the fifteenth century. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded [[Baroque]] designs that frequently incorporated a profusion of vegetal and scrolling ornament. Starting in the eighteenth century, furniture designs began to develop more rapidly. Although there were some styles that belonged primarily to one nation, such as [[Palladianism]] in [[Great Britain]] or [[Louis Quinze]] in [[French furniture]], others, such as the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] were perpetuated throughout Western Europe.\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nCoffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen) MET DP273975.jpg|[[Gothic art|Gothic]] German coffret (Minnek\u00e4stchen); circa 1325-1350; oak, inlay, tempera, wrought-iron mounts; overall: 12.1 x 27.3 x 16.5; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nPaschal Candlestick MET DP102923.jpg|Gothic Spanish paschal candlestick; circa 1450-1500; wood with paint and gilding; 195.6 \u00d7 43.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nCassone (chest), pair with 1975.1.1947 MET SLP1940-1.jpg|[[Renaissance]] cassone (chest); mid 16th century; walnut, carved and partially gilded, coniferous wood; height: 73.6 cm, width: 1.7 m, depth: 63.5 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nDresser (Dressoir aux harpies) MET DP105799.jpg|French Renaissance dresser (dressoir aux harpies); circa 1570-1590; carved walnut with interior elements of oak, pine, and some iron accessories; height: 144.8 cm, width: 137.8 cm, depth: 50.8 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\nDuring the eighteenth century, the fashion was set in England by the French art. In the beginning of the century [[Boulle]] cabinets were at the peak of their popularity and [[Louis XIV]] was reigning in France. In this era, most of the furniture had metal and enamelled decorations in it and some of the furniture was covered in inlays of marbles lapis lazuli, and porphyry and other stones. By mid-century this [[Baroque]] style was displaced by the graceful curves, shining [[ormolu]], and intricate [[marquetry]] of the [[Rococo]] style, which in turn gave way around 1770 to the more severe lines of [[Neoclassicism]], modeled after the architecture of ancient Greece and Rome.\n<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nOlanda, guardaroba (kast), 1625-50 ca.jpg|Dutch wardrobe; 1625-1650; oak with ebony and rosewood veneers; overall: 244.5 x 224.3 x 85.2 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], US)\n\nClevelandart 1968.31.jpg|Console table depicting [[Chronos]], or the father time; 1695; painted and gilded wood, with marble at its top; overall: 95.3 x 107.3 x 62.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nGermany, Mainz, 18th century - Gaming Table - 1953.284 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Gaming Table; circa 1735; wood and ivory marquetry; overall: 78.7 x 94 x 54.6 cm; from [[Mainz]] (Germany); Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nCommode by Gilles Joubert, France, c. 1735, oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze, imitation marble - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston - 20180922 164303.jpg|French commode; by [[Gilles Joubert]]; circa 1735; oak and walnut, veneered with tulipwood, ebony, holly, other woods, gilt bronze and imitation marble; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] ([[Boston]], USA)\n\nCommode MET DP105695.jpg|Parisian commode; 1745-1749; pine and oak veneered with amaranth and bois satin\u00e9, walnut, gilt-bronze mounts, and portoro marble top; 87.6 x 139.7 x 57.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) (part of a set) MET DP105705.jpg|Armchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine); circa 1754-1756; carved and gilded beech, wool and silk tapestry; overall: 103.8 \u00d7 73.7 \u00d7 66 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nJean pierre latz, commode, 1745-50 ca, con terracotta di un seguace di clodion.jpg|Rococo chest of drawers; circa 1750; oak, tulipwood marquetry, gilt metal mounts and marble; overall: 88 x 156.5 x 69.9 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art\n\nArmchair (fauteuil \u00e0 la reine) MET DP106642.jpg|German armchair; circa 1750\u20131760; carved and gilded beech, covered in blue damask not original to the armchair; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\n\nSk\u00e5p i stora salongen.

Most of rural Indians are cut off from access to basic financial services, which include deposits and withdrawals from a trusted source.\n\n===Growth of mobile phones in India===\n[[File:Mobile growth india.svg|thumb|345px|alt=Bar graph showing size of subscriber base|Annual growth of mobile subscriber base in India]]\nHowever, India is the second-largest telecommunications market and has [[Telecommunications statistics in India|1100.37 million]] mobile phone customers. Mobile phones are quite common even in the remote villages. The mobile phone industry is growing at a rate of over [[Telecommunications statistics in India|200 million]] per year. It was expected{{By whom|date=February 2014}} to touch the one and a half billion mark by 2015. The share of the urban subscribers is 66% and the share of the rural subscribers was 34%. In May 2011, the net monthly addition in terms of the number of subscriptions was 13.35 million. Of those, 7.33 million were from the urban segment and 6.02 million from the rural segment. The subscription growth rate on a monthly basis is 55% for urban segments and 45% for rural segments.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.trai.gov.in/annualreport/AnnualReport_09_10English.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027082249/http://www.trai.gov.in/annualreport/AnnualReport_09_10English.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-27 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Given this context, it is possible to consider the mobile phone as an economically viable instrument to enable inclusive access to financial services.\n\n===Impact of mobile phones on welfare===\nMobile telephony has had an impact mainly by allowing for agents in information restricted areas to engage in more optimal arbitrage. The adoption of mobile phones by fishermen and wholesalers resulted in a dramatic reduction in price dispersion, the complete elimination of waste, and a near-perfect adherence to the [[law of one price]]. Both consumer and producer welfare increased.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Robert|title=The Digital Provide: Information (Technology), Market Performance, and Welfare in the South Indian Fisheries Sector|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|year=2007|volume=122|issue=3|pages=879\u2013924|doi=10.1162/qjec.122.3.879|citeseerx=10.1.1.362.7756}}</ref>\n\nMobile payments can have a positive impact on welfare by easing operational aspects and associated costs of cash-based transactions related to cash handling, storage and transfer, and by providing a strong platform for financial inclusion.\n\n==Immediate Payment Service (IMPS)==\n{{Main|Immediate Payment Service}}\nOn November 22, 2010, NPCI launched Immediate Payment Services (IMPS) to offer an instant, 24-hour\u00d77, interbank electronic fund transfer service through mobile phones. IMPS facilitate customers to use mobile instruments as a channel for accessing their bank accounts and put high interbank fund transfers in a secured manner with immediate confirmation features.\n\nWith over 900 million mobile subscriber and robust payment infrastructure, IMPS is well positioned to fulfill its objectives of enabling bank customers to use mobile instruments as a preferred channel for accessing their banks accounts, remit funds and also sub-serve the goal of electronification of retail payments. More than 54 banks already offer IMPS services to their customers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe basic aim of IMPS is to also enable [[micropayments]] on low-end mobile devices which support only voice and text, in addition to higher-end phones which could support web browsing or Java application capabilities. A person who has subscribed to a mobile payment service should be able to send money to any other person who has subscribed as well. This should be independent of the [[mobile network]] and the bank to which either of the persons belong. This is referred to as [[interoperability]] and is a key concern for any major technology to be successful.<ref>Chandrahas, Praveen, Deepti Kumar, Ramya Karthik, Timothy Gonsalves, Ashok Jhunjhunwala, and Gaurav Raina. \"Some design considerations for a mobile payment architecture.\" In Communications (NCC), 2011 National Conference on, pp. 1-5. IEEE, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn India, the model for the delivery of IMPS will be bank-linked;<ref>http://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=1750</ref> which implies that customers wishing to avail themselves of this service should have:\n* Initially, a registered mobile phone account with any network operator in the country, and\n* A bank account\n* Register for the mobile payment service with the bank\n\nIn contrast, in economies such as Kenya, the mobile network operators lead the development of mobile financial services. Choosing a bank-linked model enables offerings of a variety of value added financial service built on top of the basic mobile payment transaction. The idea of mobile financial solutions will only then permeate to all levels of society: customers, merchants, business houses and the government.\n     \nThe technical standards are set up by [http://www.mpfi.org.in/ MPFI], and are implemented by the various participating entities after being ratified by the [[RBI]].\n\n=== Key features ===\nThe key features of IMPS Funds Transfer are as follows:\n* Instant funds transfer\n* 24-hour, 365-day availability\n* Credit and debit confirmations to sender and receiver\n* Simple and easy to use\n* Fast, inexpensive, safe and secure, accessible\n\nCurrently IMPS service is provided to the customers over various channels including SMS, Bank Mobile Application and USSD (*99#).\n\n=== Transaction flow ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mobile payments model india.png|thumb|345px|alt=Flowchart describing the transaction flow of a mobile payment|The transaction flow of a mobile payment]] -->\n\nThe transaction flow for IMPS can be simply described as 'customer-bank-bank-customer'. When a customer initiates a transaction by sending an SMS to the bank's gateway, this SMS is processed by a mobile payment provider (MPP). The role of MPP is defined in the standards document. After appropriate checks with the customer's bank, the transaction is forwarded to a central [[switch]]. The role of the switching agency is played by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). NPCI routes transaction to the payee's bank based on the MMID.\n\nA transaction is initiated by sending the following details:\n* Mobile number of the payee\n* The seven-digit MMID of the payee\n* The amount of money to be transferred\n* The four-digit [[personal identification number]] (PIN) of the payer\n\nDepending on the type of the transaction, either both parties (payer and payee) or only a single party is notified about the transaction. A successful transaction will be notified by an SMS to both parties.\n\nThe communication between the MPPs and the banks takes place using [[ISO 8583]] message format,<ref>Kumar, D.; Gonsalves, T.A.; Jhunjhunwala, A.; Raina, G.; Communications (NCC), 2010 National Conference onDigital Object Identifier:10.1109/NCC.2010.5430160 Publication Year:2010, Page(s):1-5</ref> which is the standard message format for all financial messages in India. In order to test the compliance and conformance to the standards set and the message formats, a certification lab is being set up at IIT Madras.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n=== MMID ===\nThe Mobile Money IDentifier (MMID) is the key identifying detail of a user participating in a transaction. An MMID is a seven-digit number given to a customer upon registration with a bank for the service. In the seven digits of the MMID are four digits used to identify the bank of the user and three digits used to identify the account of the user.\n\nA mobile number and a MMID will uniquely identify a customer\u2019s account with the respective bank. The design of the MMID allows customers to operate multiple bank accounts linked to a single mobile number; each bank account has its own MMID. Additionally, since the MMID of the payee must be entered along with the payee's mobile phone number, it serves to reduce the possibility of an erroneous transaction when the payer inadvertently enters an incorrect mobile number.\n\nThe MMID is not intended to be a secret \u2013 it is simply an identifier and it does not give away any sensitive information about the customer. For example, a merchant will advertise his mobile number and MMID publicly in order to receive payments from the customers.\n\n== Communication channels ==\nThe mobile payments service is available over a wide range of communication channels. The following communication channels are often used in combination to provide a complete end-to-end service:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mpf.org.in/pdf/Mobile%20Payment%20Systems%20and%20Services.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611195810/http://www.mpf.org.in/pdf/Mobile%20Payment%20Systems%20and%20Services.pdf |archive-date=2014-06-11 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n* [[SMS]]\n* [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]\n* [[USSD]]\n* [[IVR]]\n* Phone-based application: J2ME/BREW\n* ATM\n* Internet\n\nA user will use a particular set of communication channels depending on the capabilities of the mobile phone. The implementation of the standards will vary depending on the set used.\n\n=== Application based ===\nMost banks provide a Java application that can be downloaded on a Java-enabled phone which will guide the user through the money transfer process. An SMS sent through a Java application on the mobile device is as secure as an Internet banking transaction, since it can be encrypted between the user and the bank.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n=== SMS and IVR ===\nAn SMS\u2013IVR combination is used for transactions for mobile phones without Java capabilities. An SMS is sent to a phone number provided by the bank, and an IVR call-back is used for authentication and the transaction is carried forward as a voice-based transaction, at the end of which the user will be prompted to enter the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de3PTqjmpWY MPIN]. The SMS channel is used to send notification messages, while the IVR channel which is as secure as a [[GSM#GSM service security|GSM channel]].\n\n=== USSD ===\nA transaction can also be initiated over [[USSD]]. A USSD session will provide the user with simple prompts over a menu allowing the user to input the payee's mobile number and MMID, and the user's own MMID and PIN for authentication.\n\n=== Security ===\nEvery communication channel has its own set of security mechanisms. In addition, the RBI-issued guidelines on security of mobile payments<ref>http://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=1750</ref> require a [[two-factor authentication]] mechanism to be employed. A two-factor authentication in this context consists of:\n* What you know: User PIN, MMID\n* What you have: Mobile number, mobile phone, SIM card\n\nNo transaction can take place without the use of the secret PIN. The guidelines also specify a cap on the amount of money that can be sent during transactions.\n\n== Use cases ==\nMobile payments enable a variety of possible uses, considering that the underlying architecture is interoperable and supports payments to other peers, merchants and government offices.\n\n=== Pre-paid mobile top-up ===\nMobile top-up for prepaid mobile subscribers is one of the most common mobile-related financial transactions. This is made considerably easier, if the payment for topping up the mobile account can also be made over the mobile phone. There are already many online recharge options available and emerging, which point to the rapid growth in this business segment.<ref>http://theagni.com/2011/07/28/state-of-online-recharge-mobile-services-in-india/</ref>\n\n=== Domestic peer-to-peer remittances ===\nMobile payments can also be used to remit money. Migrant workers (from other states) in India need to transfer money to their kin in their native states. Using this service, transfer of money is safe, fast and effective as established by a pilot study conducted.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/Mobile-banking-facility-for-Surats-migrant-workers/articleshow/6493353.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Mobile banking facility for Surat's migrant workers | date=4 September 2010}}</ref> This has potential to act as a very significant driver for adoption of mobile payment services in this demographic.\n\n=== Bill and merchant payments ===\nBill payments provide convenience for the user and for utility companies.

A variety of value-added services based on mobile payment transactions are already entering the market.<ref>https://home.kpmg/cn/en/home/insights/2011/07/2011-mobile-payments-outlook-o-201107.html</ref>\n\n== Adoption of mobile payments ==\nThere are various drivers that push the need and desire of mobile payments services in India, and there are several challenges which need to be addressed in order to ensure adoption of the technology in the Indian context. One of the key roles of The Mobile Payment Forum of India is to address these challenges that may inhibit the widespread use of mobile financial services.\n\n=== Drivers for mobile financial services ===\n* High penetration of mobile subscribers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.infogile.com/pdf/Mobile_Recharge.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023071906/http://infogile.com/pdf/Mobile_Recharge.pdf |archive-date=2013-10-23 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n* Mobile top-up services, domestic remittances and bill payments can be made very conveniently over a mobile phone.\n* Growing demand, and an existing thriving ecosystem, for mobile services like ring tone downloads, Bollywood music, update for cricket matches, etcetera. Thus the uptake for another service, especially financial services, should be positive.\n* Drive to be a part of the financial system for those people who currently do not have a bank account. The cost of cash handling, storage and transfer is very high in the informal sector. The ability to perform basic financial transactions over a mobile could act as a driver.\n* There is a strong demographic dividend in India, where a large proportion of the population is very young. The young are often enthusiastic to take up new technologies and services.\n\n=== Challenges for mobile financial services in India ===\n* Poor levels of literacy are a problem, and voice-based services offer a potential solution. Voice-based solutions, especially in local languages, have two major benefits: they can work on all handsets and can be used by all irrespective of one\u2019s comfort level with technology or level of literacy.\n* The mobile financial services have to be effective in terms of usability, cost, efficiency, interoperability and security for transactions of all ticket sizes.\n* M-payments options should be available even on low end mobile handsets.<ref>http://www.xenglobaltech.com/mobile-payments.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Financial inclusion ==\nThe un-banked population can be classified into broad categories: those who do not open accounts due to lack of banking infrastructure, those who for various reasons (such as poverty and lack of valid identity papers) do not pass the required account opening criteria, and those who currently see no requirement to open an\naccount.<ref>http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_speechesview.aspx?id=342</ref> This process can be broken into three aspects: opening a bank account, managing the account, and having access to a set of financial services and products. To open an account, one has to satisfy the bank\u2019s [[Know your customer|KYC]] (Know Your Customer) norms. For the un-banked, providing a valid identity is a challenge. To that end, the [[Unique Identification Authority of India]] (UIDAI) has embarked on a mission to offer a single source of identity verification which can also be used to open bank accounts. Managing the account is something that mobile money solutions will make much easier, faster and cheaper, both for the customers and the banks. The key challenge is to determine if it is possible to devise demand driven financial products and services which make for a compelling reason to open an account. For example, a common need is a low value, low cost loan, for which the un-banked can typically offer no collateral. If this need can be addressed, via an appropriate business model, then managing that loan in terms of repayments is much easier over a mobile device. In this context, mobile payment solutions can certainly help by providing an effective channel for money transfer for both categories of the un-banked.\n\nThe issue of depositing money into a bank account where banks do not have a presence is addressed by the concept of banking correspondents.\n\n=== Banking correspondent ===\nThough mobile payments allow payments to be made electronically, they do not enable depositing money into a bank. The [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) tended to this issue by creating the post of a banking correspondent (BC).<ref>http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Mode=0&Id=2718</ref> The role of a BC is to act as an interface between the bank and its customers in places where traditional banking is not feasible. Banks can appoint a trusted third party as a BC in a village. All the villagers who wish to transact with the bank can get in touch with the BC. [[Deposit account|Deposit]] and withdrawal of money is handled by the BC. When a person deposits money at the BC, their account immediately gets credited. The person can then use their mobile phone for additional transactions.\n\n== Differences with mobile banking ==\nThe major difference between [[mobile banking]] and mobile payments is the total absenteeism of the bank [[Bank account|account number]]. In mobile banking or [[Internet banking]], money can be transferred only when the account number of the payee is known before-hand. The account of the payee has to be registered with the payer and only then can a fund transfer happen.\n\nIn mobile payments, the account number is masked from being public. One need not know the account number of a person to transfer money.<ref>Kumar, D.; Gonsalves, T.A.; Jhunjhunwala, A.; Raina, G.; Communications (NCC), 2010 National Conference on Digital Object Identifier: 10.1109/NCC.2010.5430160; Publication Year: 2010; Pages: 1\u20135</ref> This opens up a range of possibilities from buying tickets to paying auto fare, both of which would not have been feasible had the account number been mandatory for a simple transaction.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.mpf.org.in/ Mobile Payment Forum]\n\n<!--- Categories --->\n[[Category:Mobile payments in India|*]]\n[[Category:Banking in India]]\n[[Category:E-commerce in India]]\n", "text_old": "'''[[Mobile payments]]''' is a mode of payment using [[mobile phones]].

Most of rural Indians are cut off from access to basic financial services, which include deposits and withdrawals from a trusted source.\n\n===Growth of mobile phones in India===\n[[File:Mobile growth india.svg|thumb|345px|alt=Bar graph showing size of subscriber base|Annual growth of mobile subscriber base in India]]\nHowever, India is the second-largest telecommunications market and has [[Telecommunications statistics in India|1100.37 million]] mobile phone customers. Mobile phones are quite common even in the remote villages. The mobile phone industry is growing at a rate of over [[Telecommunications statistics in India|200 million]] per year. It was expected{{By whom|date=February 2014}} to touch the one and a half billion mark by 2015. The share of the urban subscribers is 66% and the share of the rural subscribers was 34%. In May 2011, the net monthly addition in terms of the number of subscriptions was 13.35 million. Of those, 7.33 million were from the urban segment and 6.02 million from the rural segment.

The adoption of mobile phones by fishermen and wholesalers resulted in a dramatic reduction in price dispersion, the complete elimination of waste, and a near-perfect adherence to the [[law of one price]]. Both consumer and producer welfare increased.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Jensen|first=Robert|title=The Digital Provide: Information (Technology), Market Performance, and Welfare in the South Indian Fisheries Sector|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|year=2007|volume=122|issue=3|pages=879\u2013924|doi=10.1162/qjec.122.3.879|citeseerx=10.1.1.362.7756}}</ref>\n\nMobile payments can have a positive impact on welfare by easing operational aspects and associated costs of cash-based transactions related to cash handling, storage and transfer, and by providing a strong platform for financial inclusion.\n\n==Immediate Payment Service (IMPS)==\n{{Main|Immediate Payment Service}}\nOn November 22, 2010, NPCI launched Immediate Payment Services (IMPS) to offer an instant, 24-hour\u00d77, interbank electronic fund transfer service through mobile phones. IMPS facilitate customers to use mobile instruments as a channel for accessing their bank accounts and put high interbank fund transfers in a secured manner with immediate confirmation features.\n\nWith over 900 million mobile subscriber and robust payment infrastructure, IMPS is well positioned to fulfill its objectives of enabling bank customers to use mobile instruments as a preferred channel for accessing their banks accounts, remit funds and also sub-serve the goal of electronification of retail payments. More than 54 banks already offer IMPS services to their customers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe basic aim of IMPS is to also enable [[micropayments]] on low-end mobile devices which support only voice and text, in addition to higher-end phones which could support web browsing or Java application capabilities. A person who has subscribed to a mobile payment service should be able to send money to any other person who has subscribed as well. This should be independent of the [[mobile network]] and the bank to which either of the persons belong. This is referred to as [[interoperability]] and is a key concern for any major technology to be successful.<ref>Chandrahas, Praveen, Deepti Kumar, Ramya Karthik, Timothy Gonsalves, Ashok Jhunjhunwala, and Gaurav Raina. \"Some design considerations for a mobile payment architecture.\" In Communications (NCC), 2011 National Conference on, pp. 1-5. IEEE, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn India, the model for the delivery of IMPS will be bank-linked;<ref>http://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=1750</ref> which implies that customers wishing to avail themselves of this service should have:\n* Initially, a registered mobile phone account with any network operator in the country, and\n* A bank account\n* Register for the mobile payment service with the bank\n\nIn contrast, in economies such as Kenya, the mobile network operators lead the development of mobile financial services. Choosing a bank-linked model enables offerings of a variety of value added financial service built on top of the basic mobile payment transaction. The idea of mobile financial solutions will only then permeate to all levels of society: customers, merchants, business houses and the government.\n     \nThe technical standards are set up by [http://www.mpf.org.in/ MPFI], and are implemented by the various participating entities after being ratified by the [[RBI]].\n\n=== Key features ===\nThe key features of IMPS Funds Transfer are as follows:\n* Instant funds transfer\n* 24-hour, 365-day availability\n* Credit and debit confirmations to sender and receiver\n* Simple and easy to use\n* Fast, inexpensive, safe and secure, accessible\n\nCurrently IMPS service is provided to the customers over various channels including SMS, Bank Mobile Application and USSD (*99#).\n\n=== Transaction flow ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mobile payments model india.png|thumb|345px|alt=Flowchart describing the transaction flow of a mobile payment|The transaction flow of a mobile payment]] -->\n\nThe transaction flow for IMPS can be simply described as 'customer-bank-bank-customer'. When a customer initiates a transaction by sending an SMS to the bank's gateway, this SMS is processed by a mobile payment provider (MPP). The role of MPP is defined in the standards document. After appropriate checks with the customer's bank, the transaction is forwarded to a central [[switch]]. The role of the switching agency is played by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). NPCI routes transaction to the payee's bank based on the MMID.\n\nA transaction is initiated by sending the following details:\n* Mobile number of the payee\n* The seven-digit MMID of the payee\n* The amount of money to be transferred\n* The four-digit [[personal identification number]] (PIN) of the payer\n\nDepending on the type of the transaction, either both parties (payer and payee) or only a single party is notified about the transaction. A successful transaction will be notified by an SMS to both parties.\n\nThe communication between the MPPs and the banks takes place using [[ISO 8583]] message format,<ref>Kumar, D.; Gonsalves, T.A.; Jhunjhunwala, A.; Raina, G.; Communications (NCC), 2010 National Conference onDigital Object Identifier:10.1109/NCC.2010.5430160 Publication Year:2010, Page(s):1-5</ref> which is the standard message format for all financial messages in India.

Voice-based solutions, especially in local languages, have two major benefits: they can work on all handsets and can be used by all irrespective of one\u2019s comfort level with technology or level of literacy.\n* The mobile financial services have to be effective in terms of usability, cost, efficiency, interoperability and security for transactions of all ticket sizes.\n* M-payments options should be available even on low end mobile handsets.<ref>http://www.xenglobaltech.com/mobile-payments.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Financial inclusion ==\nThe un-banked population can be classified into broad categories: those who do not open accounts due to lack of banking infrastructure, those who for various reasons (such as poverty and lack of valid identity papers) do not pass the required account opening criteria, and those who currently see no requirement to open an\naccount.<ref>http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/bs_speechesview.aspx?id=342</ref> This process can be broken into three aspects: opening a bank account, managing the account, and having access to a set of financial services and products. To open an account, one has to satisfy the bank\u2019s [[Know your customer|KYC]] (Know Your Customer) norms. For the un-banked, providing a valid identity is a challenge. To that end, the [[Unique Identification Authority of India]] (UIDAI) has embarked on a mission to offer a single source of identity verification which can also be used to open bank accounts. Managing the account is something that mobile money solutions will make much easier, faster and cheaper, both for the customers and the banks. The key challenge is to determine if it is possible to devise demand driven financial products and services which make for a compelling reason to open an account. For example, a common need is a low value, low cost loan, for which the un-banked can typically offer no collateral. If this need can be addressed, via an appropriate business model, then managing that loan in terms of repayments is much easier over a mobile device. In this context, mobile payment solutions can certainly help by providing an effective channel for money transfer for both categories of the un-banked.\n\nThe issue of depositing money into a bank account where banks do not have a presence is addressed by the concept of banking correspondents.\n\n=== Banking correspondent ===\nThough mobile payments allow payments to be made electronically, they do not enable depositing money into a bank. The [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) tended to this issue by creating the post of a banking correspondent (BC).<ref>http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Mode=0&Id=2718</ref> The role of a BC is to act as an interface between the bank and its customers in places where traditional banking is not feasible. Banks can appoint a trusted third party as a BC in a village. All the villagers who wish to transact with the bank can get in touch with the BC. [[Deposit account|Deposit]] and withdrawal of money is handled by the BC. When a person deposits money at the BC, their account immediately gets credited. The person can then use their mobile phone for additional transactions.\n\n== Differences with mobile banking ==\nThe major difference between [[mobile banking]] and mobile payments is the total absenteeism of the bank [[Bank account|account number]]. In mobile banking or [[Internet banking]], money can be transferred only when the account number of the payee is known before-hand. The account of the payee has to be registered with the payer and only then can a fund transfer happen.\n\nIn mobile payments, the account number is masked from being public. One need not know the account number of a person to transfer money.<ref>Kumar, D.; Gonsalves, T.A.; Jhunjhunwala, A.; Raina, G.; Communications (NCC), 2010 National Conference on Digital Object Identifier: 10.1109/NCC.2010.5430160; Publication Year: 2010; Pages: 1\u20135</ref> This opens up a range of possibilities from buying tickets to paying auto fare, both of which would not have been feasible had the account number been mandatory for a simple transaction.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.mpf.org.in/ Mobile Payment Forum]\n\n<!--- Categories --->\n[[Category:Mobile payments in India|*]]\n[[Category:Banking in India]]\n[[Category:E-commerce in India]]\n", "name_user": "Dg432", "label": "safe", "comment": "Edited the MPFI link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_payments_in_India"}

First, although PAVN casualties were very high, the campaign had severely depleted the ARVN of experienced leaders and soldiers. Replacements were not well-trained or in sufficient numbers to bring battered battalions up to strength. On the other hand, the PAVN replacement now was copious and free from interference. Second, PAVN command, staff, logistics, and communications had been thoroughly expanded and proven during this campaign; the new 3rd Corps had the valuable experience of a major offensive behind it. Third, the PAVN had pushed its holdings to the edge of the narrow coastal plain and was within artillery range of nearly every major South Vietnamese installation and population center.

In the week after Tet PAVN attacks increased markedly in Duc Duc and Dai Lac Districts of Quang Nam, and the ARVN responded with heavy artillery concentrations and air strikes.

He would pull all combat forces into Quang Nam and defend Da Nang with the 1st, 3rd and Marine Divisions on line and the 2nd Division in reserve, but this deployment would be approached gradually as divisional troops were relieved in Quang Tri and Thua Thien Provinces and terrain in the southern part of the region was abandoned.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|157}}\n\nOn 16 March the PAVN pounded [[Th\u0103ng B\u00ecnh District|Th\u0103ng B\u00ecnh District Town]] with artillery and overran outposts southwest of the village, but by 20 March two battalions of the Division, sent from Quang Nam Province, joined two RF battalions in a counterattack causing high PAVN casualties in tough fighting east of Th\u0103ng B\u00ecnh.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|159}}\n\nBy nightfall on 23 March the official count of refugees in Da Nang, based upon police registrations, was 121,000, but the unofficial estimate by the U.S. Consul General was 400,000. All the necessities of life were missing or rapidly disappearing: food, sanitation, housing, and medical care. On 24 March, the government began moving refugees south on every available boat and ship. Thousands made it, but many more did not.

Early that morning, 14 PAVN heavy rockets struck a refugee camp on the edge of Da Nang Air Base killing and wounding many civilians, mostly women and children. Morale in the Division was plummeting, and distraught soldiers deserted to save their families in Da Nang.

Although the PAVN broke off the attack, and the Division's battalions held their positions, it was apparent that the Division would not be able to contain PAVN attacks in the outlying districts of Quang Nam. General Tr\u01b0\u1edfng therefore ordered a withdrawal to a shorter line within artillery range of the center of Da Nang. Attempts to hold that line failed as large numbers of 3rd Division soldiers deserted to save their families. With defeat imminent, General Tr\u01b0\u1edfng shipped all organized forces, mostly marines, out of Da Nang toward Saigon. Then he and most of his staff left; some of them, General Tr\u01b0\u1edfng included, had to swim through the surf to the rescuing fleet of boats.

First, although PAVN casualties were very high, the campaign had severely depleted the ARVN of experienced leaders and soldiers. Replacements were not well-trained or in sufficient numbers to bring battered battalions up to strength. On the other hand, the PAVN replacement now was copious and free from interference. Second, PAVN command, staff, logistics, and communications had been thoroughly expanded and proven during this campaign; the new 3rd Corps had the valuable experience of a major offensive behind it. Third, the PAVN had pushed its holdings to the edge of the narrow coastal plain and was within artillery range of nearly every major South Vietnamese installation and population center. Similar progress, meanwhile, was being made north of the H\u1ea3i V\u00e2n Pass.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|124}}\n\n===1975===\n{{See also|1975 Spring Offensive|Hue-Da Nang Campaign}}\nIn late January, the Division conducted a successful six-day foray into contested ground in Duy Xuyen and Qu\u1ebf S\u01a1n Districts of Quang Nam, again causing high casualties. In the week after Tet PAVN attacks increased markedly in Duc Duc and Dai Lac Districts of Quang Nam, and the ARVN responded with heavy artillery concentrations and air strikes. All indicators in forward areas pointed to a major offensive as the PAVN 304th and 2nd Divisions, opposing the Division and the 3rd Airborne Brigade, conducted reconnaissance and moved ammunition and artillery forward.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|139}}\n\nFrom 8 March artillery-supported infantry assaults were launched against the Division, 3rd Airborne Brigade and Regional and Popular Force positions from \u0110\u1ea1i L\u1ed9c to Qu\u1ebf S\u01a1n.

He would pull all combat forces into Quang Nam and defend Da Nang with the 1st, 3rd and Marine Divisions on line and the 2nd Division in reserve, but this deployment would be approached gradually as divisional troops were relieved in Quang Tri and Thua Thien Provinces and terrain in the southern part of the region was abandoned.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|157}}\n\nOn 16 March the PAVN pounded [[Th\u0103ng B\u00ecnh District|Th\u0103ng B\u00ecnh District Town]] with artillery and overran outposts southwest of the village, but by 20 March two battalions of the Division, sent from Quang Nam Province, joined two RF battalions in a counterattack causing high PAVN casualties in tough fighting east of Th\u0103ng B\u00ecnh.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|159}}\n\nBy nightfall on 23 March the official count of refugees in Da Nang, based upon police registrations, was 121,000, but the unofficial estimate by the U.S. Consul General was 400,000. All the necessities of life were missing or rapidly disappearing: food, sanitation, housing, and medical care. On 24 March, the government began moving refugees south on every available boat and ship. Thousands made it, but many more did not. PAVN attacks in Quang Nam Province were largely blunted by the Division and Regional and Popular Forces; security, although relative, was better in Da Nang than anywhere else in I Corps.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|159}}\n\nThe situation in Da Nang on 26 March was approaching chaos, but the Division still held in \u0110\u1ea1i L\u1ed9c and Duc Duc Districts against mounting pressure. Early that morning, 14 PAVN heavy rockets struck a refugee camp on the edge of Da Nang Air Base killing and wounding many civilians, mostly women and children. Morale in the Division was plummeting, and distraught soldiers deserted to save their families in Da Nang. Population control was almost totally absent in the city; more than 2,000,000 people were in the streets trying to gather their families and escape.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|161}}\n\nOn the afternoon of the 27 March, RVNAF pilots destroyed four PAVN tanks attacking near [[Landing Zone Baldy|Firebase Baldy]]. Although the PAVN broke off the attack, and the Division's battalions held their positions, it was apparent that the Division would not be able to contain PAVN attacks in the outlying districts of Quang Nam. General Tr\u01b0\u1edfng therefore ordered a withdrawal to a shorter line within artillery range of the center of Da Nang. Attempts to hold that line failed as large numbers of 3rd Division soldiers deserted to save their families. With defeat imminent, General Tr\u01b0\u1edfng shipped all organized forces, mostly marines, out of Da Nang toward Saigon. Then he and most of his staff left; some of them, General Tr\u01b0\u1edfng included, had to swim through the surf to the rescuing fleet of boats. Da Nang had fallen to the PAVN by nightfall on 30 March.<ref name=LeGro/>{{rp|161}}\n\nRemnants of the Division evacuated by sea from Da Nang were eventually regrouped at [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba]].

That, coupled with many new discoveries at Mount Sinai (including significant advances in [[blood transfusion]]s and the first endotracheal [[anesthesia]] apparatus), meant that Mount Sinai's pool of doctors and experts was in increasing demand. A $1.35 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1350000|1904|r=-5}}}} in current dollar terms) expansion of the 1904 hospital site raced to keep pace with demand.  The opening of the new buildings was delayed by the advent of World War I.  Mount Sinai responded to a request from the [[United States Army Medical Corps]] with the creation of Base Hospital No.3. This unit went to France in early 1918, and treated 9,127 patients with 172 deaths: 54 surgical and 118 medical, the latter due mainly to [[influenza]] and [[pneumonia]].\n\n===World War II===\nTwo decades later, with tensions in Europe escalating, a committee dedicated to finding placements for doctors fleeing [[Nazi Germany]] was founded in 1933. With the help of the [[National Refugee Service|National Committee for the Resettlement of Foreign Physicians]], Mount Sinai Hospital became a new home for a large number of ''[[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s''. When World War II broke out, Mount Sinai was the first hospital to throw open its doors to [[Red Cross]] nurses' aides; the hospital trained many in its effort to reduce the [[nursing shortage]] in the States. Meanwhile, the president of the medical board, George Baehr, M.D., was called by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] to serve as the nation's Chief Medical Director of the [[Office of Civilian Defense]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/33/6/764.pdf |title=American Public Health Association (APHA) publications |publisher=Ajph.org |date= |accessdate=2019-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThese wartime roles were eclipsed, however, when the men and women of Mount Sinai's 3rd General Hospital set sail for [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]], eventually setting up a 1,000-bed hospital in war-torn [[Tunisia]].

Gorman who was Department Chairman of Psychiatry at Mount Sinai. Allen stated that; \"... officials at McLean learned that Gorman had, like so many patients at the renowned psychiatric hospital, attempted suicide. But their initial sympathy for a sick man turned to horror when they learned, from a legal document delivered in mid-May, why he had taken such a desperate measure. The married father of two had brought a shameful secret with him to Massachusetts: He had engaged in a long-term sexual relationship with a New York patient... Gorman, 55, inspired great hope when McLean and Partners announced that they had lured him away from New York City's Mount Sinai School of Medicine in October 2005... It was Gorman's decision to contact the New York Board of Professional Medical Conduct that finally brought the episode to public attention. Earlier this month, the board finally acted on what Gorman told them, posting on its website that his medical license had been indefinitely suspended for 'inappropriate sexual contact' with a patient.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/10/14/a_doctors_downfall_mcleans_fallout/?page=full|title=At Belmont's McLean Hospital, a doctor's secret led to a quest for answers - The Boston Globe|website=archive.boston.com}}</ref>\n \t\nThe issue of [[human resources management]] between nurses and doctors at Mount Sinai hospital was reported by Jose Martinez on April 20, 2010 in the New York Daily News.

Created by Alma deLeon Hendricks and a small group of women, Mount Sinai Hospital Training School for Nurses was taken over by the hospital in 1895. In 1923, its name was changed to Mount Sinai Hospital School of Nursing.  This school closed in 1971 after graduating 4,700 nurses\u2014all women, except one man in the last class. An active alumnae association continues.\n\n[[File:PostcardNewYorkNYMountSinaiHospital1920.jpg|287px|thumb|The hospital, from a postcard sent in 1920]]\nThe early 20th century saw the population of New York City explode. That, coupled with many new discoveries at Mount Sinai (including significant advances in [[blood transfusion]]s and the first endotracheal [[anesthesia]] apparatus), meant that Mount Sinai's pool of doctors and experts was in increasing demand. A $1.35 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1350000|1904|r=-5}}}} in current dollar terms) expansion of the 1904 hospital site raced to keep pace with demand.  The opening of the new buildings was delayed by the advent of World War I.  Mount Sinai responded to a request from the [[United States Army Medical Corps]] with the creation of Base Hospital No.3. This unit went to France in early 1918, and treated 9,127 patients with 172 deaths: 54 surgical and 118 medical, the latter due mainly to [[influenza]] and [[pneumonia]].\n\n===World War II===\nTwo decades later, with tensions in Europe escalating, a committee dedicated to finding placements for doctors fleeing [[Nazi Germany]] was founded in 1933. With the help of the [[National Refugee Service|National Committee for the Resettlement of Foreign Physicians]], Mount Sinai Hospital became a new home for a large number of ''[[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s''. When World War II broke out, Mount Sinai was the first hospital to throw open its doors to [[Red Cross]] nurses' aides; the hospital trained many in its effort to reduce the [[nursing shortage]] in the States. Meanwhile, the president of the medical board, George Baehr, M.D., was called by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] to serve as the nation's Chief Medical Director of the [[Office of Civilian Defense]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/33/6/764.pdf |title=American Public Health Association (APHA) publications |publisher=Ajph.org |date= |accessdate=2019-05-25}}</ref>\n\nThese wartime roles were eclipsed, however, when the men and women of Mount Sinai's 3rd General Hospital set sail for [[Casablanca]], [[Morocco]], eventually setting up a 1,000-bed hospital in war-torn [[Tunisia]].

Allen stated that; \"... officials at McLean learned that Gorman had, like so many patients at the renowned psychiatric hospital, attempted suicide. But their initial sympathy for a sick man turned to horror when they learned, from a legal document delivered in mid-May, why he had taken such a desperate measure. The married father of two had brought a shameful secret with him to Massachusetts: He had engaged in a long-term sexual relationship with a New York patient... Gorman, 55, inspired great hope when McLean and Partners announced that they had lured him away from New York City's Mount Sinai School of Medicine in October 2005... It was Gorman's decision to contact the New York Board of Professional Medical Conduct that finally brought the episode to public attention. Earlier this month, the board finally acted on what Gorman told them, posting on its website that his medical license had been indefinitely suspended for 'inappropriate sexual contact' with a patient.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/10/14/a_doctors_downfall_mcleans_fallout/?page=full|title=At Belmont's McLean Hospital, a doctor's secret led to a quest for answers - The Boston Globe|website=archive.boston.com}}</ref>\n \t\nThe issue of [[human resources management]] between nurses and doctors at Mount Sinai hospital was reported by Jose Martinez on April 20, 2010 in the New York Daily News.

have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref

As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism.

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

Their claim that it was impossible to recognise a person in the video footage was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) launched investigations into alleged incidents of police misconduct during the protests. Protesters demanded an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and it lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements, and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> Carrie Lam rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8&nbsp; November 2019, a five-member expert panel headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while its chair [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel had exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nPolice modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1&nbsp;October 2019 confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any disciplinary measures to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer had been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/> The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on the economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancel bookings, and certain banks and shops were forced to close their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed shop openings.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks ran low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions dropped by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries issued travel warnings to their citizens concerning Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] was criticised for its performance during the protests.

Criminals took advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain illegal acts such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency than the same period the year before.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who opposed the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests.

'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations.

As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, an investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, a retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede to the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4&nbsp;October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], would erode the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the Chinese Communist Party's internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping or snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted on by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representative of Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it on the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer young people in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire, along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future drove youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> It has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June 2019, the protesters objective was to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October 2019.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp;June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10&nbsp;years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to rise, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the police force to be disbanded.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12&nbsp;June&nbsp;2019.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March 2019 was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June 2019, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

As of December 2019, no officer had been suspended for their actions or charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/> The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequences.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on the economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales had declined and consumers' appetite for spending had decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancel bookings, and certain banks and shops were forced to close their doors. Supplies of goods were also halted or obstructed because of the protests. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Because of lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed shop openings.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Stock of protest supplies such as gas masks ran low in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. The desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions dropped by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce selling prices.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9&nbsp;June 2019 to late August 2019. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012; two large IPOs were shelved in June and July 2019. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to a year earlier,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13&nbsp;August 2019, the Airport Authority cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

People who opposed the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us. Otherwise the Civil Human Rights Front will plan our next action.'}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"guardian_20190722_thugsgovernment\">{{cite news |last1=Kuo |first1=Lily |title=Hong Kong: why thugs may be
