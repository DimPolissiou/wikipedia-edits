Hearing that from the righteous Yudhishthira, Drona dropped his guard and started meditating for death in the middle of battle. Pandava's Commander-in-Chief Dhristadyumna took Drona's sword and killed Drona immediately. This changed the tide of the war totally. Until that moment, any chariot with Yudhishthira always had its wheels hovering 2 inches above ground surface. But immediately after death of Drona, Yudhishthira lost the merit of total truth, and his chariot dropped to the ground. \n\nYudhishthira had to bend numerous rules of Dharma during the course of the war. Yudhishthira also had to slay a number of warriors, including his own uncle, [[Shalya]] in a spear fight and his another uncle, Shalya's younger brother he killed them both on the 18th day of the war when Shalya was the commander-in-chief.\n\n==Retirement and Ascent To Heaven==\n\n[[File:Yudhisthira with a dog as a chariot from heaven arrive.jpg|thumb|Yudhishthira and His Dog, Ascending]]\n\nAfter the war, Yudhisthira was crowned as the Emperor of [[Hastinapura]] for 36 years. He performed [[Ashwamedha]] Yagya on [[Krishna]]'s insistence and established Bharat Varsh as one country under his rule. Upon the onset of the [[Kali yuga]] and the departure of Krishna, Yudhishthira and his brothers retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to survive the war of Kurukshetra, Arjuna's grandson, [[Parikshit]]. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the [[Himalayas]]. Among the Pandavas and Draupadi, one-by-one died on the way to reach the top, starting from Draupadi. Finally, it was Yudhisthira who was able to reach the top, with the dog accompanying him.\n\n===Dog Test===\n\nOn reaching the top, [[Indra]] asked him to abandon the dog before entering the Heaven. But Yudhishthira refused to do so, citing the dog's unflinching loyalty as a reason. Indra said he let his family die, but Yudhishthira said he could not prevent their deaths, but to abandon a poor creature was a great sin. It turned out that the dog was his god-father Dharma Devatha in disguise.<ref>{{cite book|last=Agarwal|first=Satya P.|title=Selections from the Mahabharata : re-affirming Gita's call for the god of all|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120818743|edition=1.

Instead, he only saw Duryodhana and his allies. The Gods told him that his brothers were in [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] (one of the vedic hells), atoning for their sins.\n\nYudhishthira loyally went to Naraka to meet his brothers, but the sight of gore and blood horrified him. After hearing the voices of his beloved brothers and Draupadi calling out to him, asking him to stay with them in their misery, he remained. Yudhishthira ordered the divine charioteer to return. He preferred to live in hell with good people than in a heaven with his enemies. Eventually this turned out to be another illusion to test him and also to enable him to atone for his sin of deceiving his guru during the war where he half-lied to [[Drona]] about [[Ashwatthama]]'s death. Thereafter, [[Indra]] and Krishna appeared before him and told him that his brothers (including [[Karna]]) were already in heaven but so were his enemies.\n\n===Yudhishthira's Curse===\n\nAfter he was made aware that [[Karna]] was his elder brother, Yudhishthira cursed all women with not being able to hide any secrets.

At his sacrifice, Yudhishthira chose Krishna as his honoured guest.\n\n==Losing Kingdom and Exile==\n\nYudhishthira succumbed to [[Shakuni]]'s challenge in the [[Pachisi]] (game of dice). He lost his kingdom, his brothers and [[Draupadi]]. While playing for second time, he lost all his kingdom in the game and was forced into exile for 13 years, which included one year in anonymity.\n\n{{main|Yaksha Prashna}}\n[[File:Yudhisthira answer to yaksha.jpg|thumb|250px|Yudhisthira answering the questions of Yaksha]]\n\nDuring their exile, the four other Pandavas happened upon a lake, which was haunted by a [[Yaksha]]. The Yaksha challenged the brothers to answer his moral questions before drinking the water; the four Pandavas laughed and drank the water anyway. As a result, they choked on the water and died. Yudhishthira went in last, answered many questions put forth to him by the Yaksha and revived his brothers. This story is often cited as an example of Yudhishthira's upright principles.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Sunil|title=Encyclopaedia of Hinduism|year=1999|publisher=Sarup & Sons|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788176250641|edition=1st}}</ref> The Yaksha later identified himself as Yudhishthira's father, Dharma and pointed them to the kingdom of [[Matsya]] to spend their last year in exile anonymously.\n\nAlong with his brothers, Yudhishthira spent his last year of exile in the kingdom of Matsya. He disguised himself as a [[Brahmin]] named Kank (among themselves Pandavas called him Jaya) and taught the game of dice to the king.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kishore|first=B.

Yudhishthira made numerous diplomatic efforts to retrieve his kingdom peacefully but in vain. He was convinced by Krishna to wage war.\n\nThe flag of Yudhishthira's chariot bore the image of a golden Moon with planets around it. Two large and beautiful kettle-drums, called Nanda and Upananda, were tied to it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mahabharata Text|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/dutt/maha09.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mahabharata Text|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m07/m07023.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Kapoor |editor-first=Subodh |title=The Indian encyclopaedia : biographical, historical, religious, administrative, ethnological, commercial and scientific|year=2002|publisher=Cosmo Publications |location=New Delhi |isbn=9788177552713 |pages=4462 |edition=1st}}</ref> Before the war started, Yudhisthitra stepped down from his chariot to take blessings firm his grand sire [[Bhishma]], teachers [[Drona]] and [[Kripa]] and uncle [[Shalya]], who all were in his opposite side in the war showing his respect towards his elders.\n\n[[File:Sadiq, bhima uccide l'elefante asvatthama, india del nord, periodo mogul, 1598.jpg |thumb|Death of [[Drona]]]]\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the war, [[Bhima]] killed elephant [[Ashwathama]] and Yudhisthira shouted to [[Drona]] about death of a battle elephant named same as [[Drona]]'s son [[Ashwathama]]. Hearing that from the righteous Yudhishthira, Drona dropped his guard and started meditating for death in the middle of battle. Pandava's Commander-in-Chief Dhristadyumna took Drona's sword and killed Drona immediately. This changed the tide of the war totally. Until that moment, any chariot with Yudhishthira always had its wheels hovering 2 inches above ground surface. But immediately after death of Drona, Yudhishthira lost the merit of total truth, and his chariot dropped to the ground. \n\nYudhishthira had to bend numerous rules of Dharma during the course of the war. Yudhishthira also had to slay a number of warriors, including his own uncle, [[Shalya]] in a spear fight and his another uncle, Shalya's younger brother he killed them both on the 18th day of the war when Shalya was the commander-in-chief.\n\n==Retirement and Ascent To Heaven==\n\n[[File:Yudhisthira with a dog as a chariot from heaven arrive.jpg|thumb|Yudhishthira and His Dog, Ascending]]\n\nAfter the war, Yudhisthira was crowned as the Emperor of [[Hastinapura]] for 36 years. He performed [[Ashwamedha]] Yagya on [[Krishna]]'s insistence and established Bharat Varsh as one country under his rule. Upon the onset of the [[Kali yuga]] and the departure of Krishna, Yudhishthira and his brothers retired, leaving the throne to their only descendant to survive the war of Kurukshetra, Arjuna's grandson, [[Parikshit]]. Giving up all their belongings and ties, the Pandavas, accompanied by a dog, made their final journey of pilgrimage to the [[Himalayas]]. Among the Pandavas and Draupadi, one-by-one died on the way to reach the top, starting from Draupadi. Finally, it was Yudhisthira who was able to reach the top, with the dog accompanying him.\n\n===Dog Test===\n\nOn reaching the top, [[Indra]] asked him to abandon the dog before entering the Heaven. But Yudhishthira refused to do so, citing the dog's unflinching loyalty as a reason. Indra said he let his family die, but Yudhishthira said he could not prevent their deaths, but to abandon a poor creature was a great sin. It turned out that the dog was his god-father Dharma Devatha in disguise.<ref>{{cite book|last=Agarwal|first=Satya P.|title=Selections from the Mahabharata : re-affirming Gita's call for the god of all|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|location=Delhi|isbn=9788120818743|edition=1. Aufl.}}</ref>\n\n===Test of Patience in Hell===\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nUpon reaching heaven, Yudhishthira did not find either his virtuous brothers or his wife Draupadi. Instead, he only saw Duryodhana and his allies. The Gods told him that his brothers were in [[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]] (one of the vedic hells), atoning for their sins.\n\nYudhishthira loyally went to Naraka to meet his brothers, but the sight of gore and blood horrified him. After hearing the voices of his beloved brothers and Draupadi calling out to him, asking him to stay with them in their misery, he remained. Yudhishthira ordered the divine charioteer to return. He preferred to live in hell with good people than in a heaven with his enemies. Eventually this turned out to be another illusion to test him and also to enable him to atone for his sin of deceiving his guru during the war where he half-lied to [[Drona]] about [[Ashwatthama]]'s death. Thereafter, [[Indra]] and Krishna appeared before him and told him that his brothers (including [[Karna]]) were already in heaven but so were his enemies.\n\n===Yudhishthira's Curse===\n\nAfter he was made aware that [[Karna]] was his elder brother, Yudhishthira cursed all women with not being able to hide any secrets. Had Yudhishthira's mother [[Kunti]] not kept that fact a secret, the war might have been averted, with millions spared.<ref>{{cite book|last=transl.|title=Book 11.

Yudhishthira was a polyglot, knowing unusual languages.

(Mahabharata Sabha Parva Section 77).\n\n==In The media==\n\nBeing a character in Indian [[Indian epic poetry|epic]] and an important person in ''[[Mahabharata]]'', this role has been enacted by various actors over the years. Two most famous actors to have played this role are [[Gajendra Chauhan]] in the 1988 television series ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'', and [[Rohit Bharadwaj]] in the 2013 series ''[[Mahabharat (2013 TV series)|Mahabharat]]''. Both were offered the role of Lord Krishna first and then Yudhishthira. [[Manoj Bajpayee]] has also voiced the character in the animated ''[[Mahabharat (2013 film)|Mahabharat]]''. In 2015 series [[Suryaputra Karn]], [[Kanan Malhotra]] played the role.\nThere is a red dragon in the [[Iron Realms Entertainment]] game ''[[Aetolia, The Midnight Age]]'' named Yudhishthira.\n\n==Citations==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.mahabharataonline.com/ Persons and stories from ''Mahabharata'']\n\n{{Mahabharata}}\n{{HinduMythology}}\n{{Commons category|Yudhisthira}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in the Mahabharata]]\n[[Category:Entering heaven alive]]\n", "name_user": "99.235.50.11", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBirth and Upbringing)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhishthira"}

All types of games may be used in an educational environment, however Educational games are [[game]]s that are designed to help people learn about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand a historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play. Game types include [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and [[video game]]s.\nAs educators, governments, and parents realize the psychological need and benefits that gaming has on learning, this educational tool has become mainstream. Games are interactive play that teach us goals, rules, adaptation, problem solving, interaction, all represented as a story. They satisfy our fundamental need to learn by providing enjoyment, passionate involvement, structure, motivation, ego gratification, adrenaline, creativity, social interaction and emotion in the game itself while the learning takes place.\n\n==Video games==\n{{main|Educational video game|Video games in education}}\nWith the increase and availability of technological devices, there has been a shift in what types of games people play. Video or electronic gaming has become more widely used than traditional [[board game]]s. Barab (2009) defines conceptual play as \"a state of engagement that involves (a) projection into the role of character who, (b) engaged in a partly fictional problem context, (c) must apply conceptual understandings to make sense of, and ultimately, transform the context\".<ref>p. 991</ref>  The goal of such play spaces is to have the \"gamer\" engage in the narrative while learning cognitive and social skills. The ability to immerse oneself in the gaming process facilitates \"empathetic embodiment\" which occurs when a player learns to identify with the character they have chosen for the game and the virtual environment of the game (Barab, 2009).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barab|first1=S.

Therefore, it can be said that play and learning are synonymous, leading to cognitive and emotional development inside a social and cultural context. For instance, the game of hide and seek. Good hiders need visual and spatial perspective to define the best hiding places, while seekers must be skilled at searching for cues from the surroundings and choosing the most probable location for the hider among various possible places.<ref>{{Cite news|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.012|title= Building virtual cities, inspiring intelligent citizens: Digital games for developing students' problem solving and learning motivation}}</ref> A [[systematic review]] investigated the effects of educational games for mental health students:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Educational game plus standard training compared to standard training for mental health professionals<ref name=Bho2006>{{cite journal|last1=Bhoopathi| first1=P| last2=Sheoran|first2=R| first3=M| last3=V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki|title=Educational games for mental health professionals|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2006|volume=2| issue=2|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD001471/SCHIZ_educational-games-for-mental-health-professionals|pages=CD001471.pub2 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001471.pub2| pmid=16625545|pmc=7028004}}</ref>\n|-\n!

He states that \"humans are only fully human when they play\". While the text is limited by the author's beliefs in concepts such as freedom and beauty, it nevertheless sets the stage for [[Johan Huizinga]]'s classical study, ''[[Homo Ludens (book)|Homo Ludens]]''.\n\nGames have long been employed as a means of education. Using the ancient game of chess, noblemen of the Middle Ages learned strategies of war. During the Civil War, volunteers from Rhode Island played [[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|American Kriegsspiel]], which had originally been created in 1812 for training Prussian officers-of-war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.instituteofplay.org/about/context/history-of-games-learning/ | title=Institute of Play, History of Games & Learning |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref> Then, in the early 19th century, came the creation of Kindergarten by [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel]], which was based on learning through play. Children delighted in his [[Fr\u00f6bel Gifts]], simple educational toys such as blocks, sewing kits, clay, and weaving materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://games.eduxtive.com/news/historical-perspectives-on-games-and-education | title=Historical Perspectives on Games and Education |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Theory===\n\nAccording to Richard N. Van Eck, there are three main approaches to creating software that stimulates cognitive growth in the gamer. These three approaches are: building games from scratch created by educators and programmers; integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS); and creating games from scratch by the students. The most time- and cost-effective approach to designing these educational games is to incorporate COTS games into the classroom with the understanding of the [[learning]] outcomes the instructor has for the course.<ref>Van Eck, R. (2006). Digital game-based learning: It\u2019s not just the digital natives who are restless\u2026 Educase Review, 41,2, 1-16.\n</ref> This requires the teacher to buy into the positive results of using digital games for education. It also requires teachers to have adequate self-efficacy concerning the use of these games and their technology. The students usually have high amounts of self-efficacy in usage of digital games, while the lack of confidence teachers have in incorporating the digital games usually results in less effective educational use of the games. However, Gerber and Price (2013) have found that teachers' inexperience with digital games does not preclude them from the desire to incorporate them in class instruction, but districts must have in place support through regular professional development, supportive learning communities with their colleagues, and adequate financial support to implement game-based learning in their class instruction.<ref>Gerber, H.

The progress a player makes in a game is through learning. It is the process of the human mind grasping and coming to understand a new system.

Well-designed games that motivate players are what make them ideal learning environments.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Real-world challenges are easier faced within a game containing effective, interactive experiences that actively engage people in the learning process.

All types of games may be used in an educational environment, however Educational games are [[game]]s that are designed to help people learn about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand a historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play. Game types include [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and [[video game]]s.\nAs educators, governments, and parents realize the psychological need and benefits that gaming has on learning, this educational tool has become mainstream. Games are interactive play that teach us goals, rules, adaptation, problem solving, interaction, all represented as a story. They satisfy our fundamental need to learn by providing enjoyment, passionate involvement, structure, motivation, ego gratification, adrenaline, creativity, social interaction and emotion in the game itself while the learning takes place.\n\n==Video games==\n{{main|Educational video game|Video games in education}}\nWith the increase and availability of technological devices, there has been a shift in what types of games people play. Video or electronic gaming has become more widely used than traditional [[board game]]s. Barab (2009) defines conceptual play as \"a state of engagement that involves (a) projection into the role of character who, (b) engaged in a partly fictional problem context, (c) must apply conceptual understandings to make sense of, and ultimately, transform the context\".<ref>p. 991</ref>  The goal of such play spaces is to have the \"gamer\" engage in the narrative while learning cognitive and social skills. The ability to immerse oneself in the gaming process facilitates \"empathetic embodiment\" which occurs when a player learns to identify with the character they have chosen for the game and the virtual environment of the game (Barab, 2009).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barab|first1=S.

Generally, game-based learning is designed to balance subject matter with gameplay and the ability of the player to retain, and apply said subject matter to the real world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://edtechreview.in/dictionary/298-what-is-game-based-learning|title=What is GBL (Game-Based Learning)?|last=Team|first=Editorial|work=EdTechReview|access-date=2017-03-15|language=en-gb}}</ref> Children tend to spend hours playing hide and seek, learning the steps of digital games, such as chess, and engaging in creative games. Therefore, it can be said that play and learning are synonymous, leading to cognitive and emotional development inside a social and cultural context. For instance, the game of hide and seek. Good hiders need visual and spatial perspective to define the best hiding places, while seekers must be skilled at searching for cues from the surroundings and choosing the most probable location for the hider among various possible places.<ref>{{Cite news|doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2012.01.012|title= Building virtual cities, inspiring intelligent citizens: Digital games for developing students' problem solving and learning motivation}}</ref> A [[systematic review]] investigated the effects of educational games for mental health students:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Educational game plus standard training compared to standard training for mental health professionals<ref name=Bho2006>{{cite journal|last1=Bhoopathi| first1=P| last2=Sheoran|first2=R| first3=M| last3=V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki|title=Educational games for mental health professionals|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=2006|volume=2| issue=2|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD001471/SCHIZ_educational-games-for-mental-health-professionals|pages=CD001471.pub2 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001471.pub2| pmid=16625545|pmc=7028004}}</ref>\n|-\n!

He states that \"humans are only fully human when they play\". While the text is limited by the author's beliefs in concepts such as freedom and beauty, it nevertheless sets the stage for [[Johan Huizinga]]'s classical study, ''[[Homo Ludens (book)|Homo Ludens]]''.\n\nGames have long been employed as a means of education. Using the ancient game of chess, noblemen of the Middle Ages learned strategies of war. During the Civil War, volunteers from Rhode Island played [[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|American Kriegsspiel]], which had originally been created in 1812 for training Prussian officers-of-war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.instituteofplay.org/about/context/history-of-games-learning/ | title=Institute of Play, History of Games & Learning |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref> Then, in the early 19th century, came the creation of Kindergarten by [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel]], which was based on learning through play. Children delighted in his [[Fr\u00f6bel Gifts]], simple educational toys such as blocks, sewing kits, clay, and weaving materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://games.eduxtive.com/news/historical-perspectives-on-games-and-education | title=Historical Perspectives on Games and Education |date= |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n\n===Theory===\n\nAccording to Richard N. Van Eck, there are three main approaches to creating software that stimulates cognitive growth in the gamer. These three approaches are: building games from scratch created by educators and programmers; integrate commercial off-the-shelf (COTS); and creating games from scratch by the students. The most time- and cost-effective approach to designing these educational games is to incorporate COTS games into the classroom with the understanding of the [[learning]] outcomes the instructor has for the course.<ref>Van Eck, R. (2006). Digital game-based learning: It\u2019s not just the digital natives who are restless\u2026 Educase Review, 41,2, 1-16.\n</ref> This requires the teacher to buy into the positive results of using digital games for education. It also requires teachers to have adequate self-efficacy concerning the use of these games and their technology. The students usually have high amounts of self-efficacy in usage of digital games, while the lack of confidence teachers have in incorporating the digital games usually results in less effective educational use of the games. However, Gerber and Price (2013) have found that teachers' inexperience with digital games does not preclude them from the desire to incorporate them in class instruction, but districts must have in place support through regular professional development, supportive learning communities with their colleagues, and adequate financial support to implement game-based learning in their class instruction.<ref>Gerber, H.

[[Educational video game]]s can motivate children and allow them to develop an awareness of consequentiality.<ref>[http://inkido.indiana.edu/research/onlinemanu/papers/QA_ETRD.pdf \"Making Learning Fun: Quest Atlantis, A Game Without Guns\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930214854/http://inkido.indiana.edu/research/onlinemanu/papers/QA_ETRD.pdf |date=2011-09-30 }}  by Barab, Thomas, Dodge, Carteaux, Tuzun</ref> Children are allowed to express themselves as individuals while learning and engaging in social issues.

The progress a player makes in a game is through learning. It is the process of the human mind grasping and coming to understand a new system. The progress of understanding a new concept through gaming makes an individual feel a sense of reward whether the game is considered entertainment (''[[Call of Duty]]'') or serious (FAA-approved [[flight simulator]]). Well-designed games that motivate players are what make them ideal learning environments.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Real-world challenges are easier faced within a game containing effective, interactive experiences that actively engage people in the learning process. In a successful game-based learning environment, choosing actions, experiencing consequences, and working toward goals allows players to make mistakes through experimentation in a risk-free environment.<ref name=\"bainbridge\"/> Games have rules and structure and goals that inspire motivation.

He came from a lower-class family. His father Pyotr Iossiffovich (\u041f\u0451\u0442\u0440 \u0418\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0444\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447) was a bricklayer and mother Anna Ivanovna a housewife. At the age of 9 Grigory started attending parish school at Zvenigorod church, which he enjoyed immensely. Education was interrupted by his family's disastrous financial situation. After which he started working in a local blacksmith shop. In the spring of 1909 family sold their house in Zvenigorodka and moved to a nearby  small town of Uman. At the age of 16 Grigory moved out of parent's house and became a bricklayer. He joined a local social democratic club in Uman in 1913. Soon he was deported from Kiev province and moved to Kazan.\n\n=== Joining the Bolsheviks ===\nIn January 1915 he was drafted into the army, but due to congenital diseases was only fit for wartime militia units and not for regular service. Early in 1916 Grigory moved to Tavatui near Yekaterinburg and started working at the construction site of the dynamite plant (\u0422\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434). Very soon after moving he was drawn to local Bolsheviks and met Mikhail Kabanov who helped him become a devoted follower of Lenin. By the end of 1916 he was organizing a strike at the dynamite plant. In March 1917 Nikulin became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) i.e. Communist party. Party number \u2013 128185.\n\nAs a result of financing problems with French joint-stock company, plant activists decided to stop all work with the construction of this facility early in 1918. Nikulin was sent to Yekaterinburg along with all the party members of the factory. He met Goloschekin, a member of the Ural Regional Committee of the RSDLP and joined the Ural Cheka on his recommendation. Starting his service in Cheka, Nikulin soon became acquainted with Yakov Yurovsky who noticed Nikulin's modesty, ability to get along with different people, honesty and absolute sobriety. The two became friends and formed a special relationship that lasted for years where Yurovsky simply called him \"son\". Nikulin was appointed Assistant to the Commandant of the House of Special Purpose on the recommendation of Yurovsky. The Commandant was Yurovsky himself.\n\n== Yekaterinburg Cheka ==\nHaving begun work in the Cheka, Grigory was assigned some serious cases. One of the first was discrete surveillance of Alexander Ivanovich Andogsky, the head of the Military Academy of Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Nikulin was introduced as a domestic worker to Andogsky after the Academy was evacuated from Petrograd to Yekaterinburg in March 1918. Later the same year Andogsky joined the White forces, was dismissed from the Military Academy and eventually was appointed as General in [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]]'s Army.\n\nNikulin was also in charge of soldier selection for train convoy L-42, on 30 April 1918 where Tsar Nicholas II and part of his family were moved from Tyumen to Yekaterinburg.\n\n=== Killing of Prince Dolgorukov ===\nExecution of Prince [[Vasily Alexandrovich Dolgorukov]]. Dolgorukov was a close friend of Nicholas II as well as his adviser, Marshal of the Imperial Court (1914\u20131917) and Commander of the Imperial Guard cavalry regiment. Deeply devoted to the Tsar he voluntarily accompanied the Imperial family to imprisonment in Tobolsk. After arriving in Yekaterinburg at the end of May he was separated from the family and arrested. Dolgorukov was executed 10 July 1918 in cold blood by Nikulin, a week before the killing of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Dolgorukov was taken to a field beyond the city's Ivanovskoe Cemetery with Count Tatishchev and the two were shot in the head and thrown into a pit. Nikulin recalled the incident in his radio interview 1964: \"\u042f \u0432\u044b\u0432\u0435\u0437 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043b\u044f\u043b \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u043b \u0447\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434\" (I took him out to the field and cursed everything while I was dragging his suitcases back). Dolgorukov was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1981.\n\nNikulin was also involved in death of Hermogenes, Bishop of Tobolsk and Siberia, who was drowned in the Tura River by the Bolsheviks.\n\n=== Killing of Nicholas II and family ===\nGrigory Nikulin is known for his participating in the killing of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas]] II and his family. Nikulin was living in the House of Special Purpose [[Ipatiev House]] since his appointment as Assistant to the Commandant. He was also in charge of the house in absence of Yurovsky who lived in the \"American Hotel\". The Ural Regional Soviet agreed in a meeting on June 29 that the Romanov family should be executed. After getting the final approval from the Central Executive Committee in Moscow Yurovsky organized a meeting in American Hotel. Participation in the killing was voluntary and people who agreed to participate came to Yurovsky's room. It was agreed that to prevent unnecessary suffering that the condemned were to be shot in the heart.\n\nOn 17 July, right after midnight Yurovsky woke up the Tsar, his family, doctor and servants, 11 persons altogether and guided them to an empty room in the lower floor of the house. On demand of Tsaritsa [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra]] Nikulin brought two chairs. One for her and one for [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Prince Alexei]]. Yurovsky announced the verdict: \"Nikolai Alexandrovich, in view of the fact that your relatives are continuing their attack on Soviet Russia, the Ural Executive Committee has decided to execute you.\" Shooting started. It is controversial who actually shot the Tsar \u2013 Yurovsky, Medvedev, Ermakov, or all of them. Nikulin shot one bullet to Prince Alexei and left the room. Apparently Alexei didn't die from this shot. Yurovsky shot Alexei in the head killing him. Long after this event, in private conversation with the son of Mikhail Medvedev, Nikulin said that he couldn't bear having the sick boy looking at him and stopped shooting.\n\nAfterwards Nikulin oversaw the carrying of the corpses to a truck waiting outside. He had all the jewels and valuables that had been sewn into the clothes of the royal family removed. On 20 July, just a few days before the arrival of the White Army, Nikulin left Yekaterinburg. He personally carried 6,000 carats of the Tsar's diamonds to the State Bank in Moscow.\n\nNikulin initially left a good impression on the Imperial family during visits to the Ipatiev House with Yurovsky. He wasn't like the others. He was well-mannered and polite. From the diary of Alexandra Feodorovna: \"June 21st, Thursday. \"..young assistant, who seems very nice person, compared to other ones that are vulgar and unpleasant.. Young man (Nikulin) enumerated jewelry items and did it thoroughly\". From the diary of Nicholas II: \"June 23th, Saturday. Yurovsky and his assistant (Nikulin) started to understand what sort of people was around, stealing from us and guarded us from them\". However, after Yurovsky became commandant of the Ipatiev House on 4 July and continuously tightened restrictions imposed on the Romanov family, Nicholas wrote in his diary on 11 July, \"We like this man less and less.\"<ref>Rappaport, pp. 118\u2013119.</ref>\n\n== After Yekaterinburg ==\nAfter completing the assignment in Yekaterinburg, Nikulin joined the Red Army. He had several duties at 3rd Army of the Eastern front. He even took part in battles. Early 1919 he started working for political department of the division (politotdel) but contracted typhus and was taken to Moscow. There he met again Yurovsky, who worked for Moscow City Council at the time and offered him a job as head of the Moscow apartment houses. They continued their warm friendship meeting each other on and off duty.\n\nNikulin stayed in Moscow and worked in different jobs. First for City Council (MosSoviet). Later he was allocated to the position of Moscow prisons head. Four months after that the head of inspectorate department of Moscow police. He then worked as the head of [[Moscow Criminal Investigations Department|Moscow Criminal Investigation Department]] from March 1920 to 1922. In 1922 he was awarded with the [[Order of the Red Banner]].\n\n== Later life ==\nBetween 1923 and 1938 Nikulin held several noteworthy positions. From 1923 to 1924 he was Vice-head of the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department. In 1925 he was a member of MosGorIspolCom (Moscow Executive Committee). From 1925 to 1930 he was the head of MosGubStrakh (Moscow Insurance State Company). From 1930 to 1931 he was the head of MosGas (Moscow Gas trest). From 1933 to 1935 he worked at MosSovet on a problem concerning building materials manufacturing, and from 1935 to 1938 he was the head of MosZhilOtdel (Moscow Housing Department).\n\nHe was often visited by comrades such as Rodzinsky and Medvedev. In 1927 Nikulin and Yurovsky made an application to the USSR Revolution Museum and handed them two revolvers which were used in the killing of Imperial Family.\n\nYurovsky died in 1938. Before dying he wrote a warm farewell letter to his dear friend Nikulin leaving him a list of documents to be delivered to the Revolution Museum. From 1938 to his retirement in 1960 Nikulin worked for Department of Water and Sewerage. He was awarded with four state orders, one of which was [[Order of the Patriotic War]] 1st class (1947). During his whole life Nikulin insisted on keeping low profile concerning the killing of imperial family. He even asked Medvedev not to mention his role in the execution. One year before his death he was asked by a high party official to give an interview on radio. It resulted in a 3 hour recording in which he talks about everything. \"All was done consciously, without doubts. I did understand all responsibility. I welcomed the decision of Ural Regional Soviet.. And even more, if it is allowed to say, I considered it as an honor.\"\n\nGrigory Nikulin died on 22 September 1965. He was buried on the site of the \"Old Bolsheviks\" at [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow. Across from Nikulin's grave is the grave of [[Boris Yeltsin]], President of the Russian Federation. Ipatiev House was demolished by order of Boris Yeltsin in 1977 while he was leader of the Sverdlovsk Executive Committee. The Politburo had declared the house not to be of \"sufficient historical significance\".\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n# https://i-podmoskovie.ru/php/podmoskovnii-letopisets/articles/2355-tsareubijtsa.html (\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432. 11.03.2015. \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0446\u0430)\n# \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0441 \u0413.\u041f. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438, \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0426\u041a \u041a\u041f\u0421\u0421 \u0432 1964 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 -  \u0420\u0413\u0410\u0421\u041f\u0418. \u0424. 588. \u041e\u043f. 3\u0441. \u0414. 13. \u041b. 1-71 http://statearchive.ru/assets/images/docs/n10/\n# \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u0418\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u042f.\u041c. \u042e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438 \u0438 \u043e \u043f\u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0443\u043f\u044b (\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u041c.\u041d. \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c) - \u0413\u0410 \u0420\u0424. \u0424. 601. \u041e\u043f. 2. \u0414. 27. \u041b. 31-34  http://statearchive.ru/assets/images/docs/232/\n# \u0423\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438/\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432. - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430: \u0410\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043c, 2016. - 384\u0441. - (\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b. \u0422\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438). {{ISBN|978-5-906861-09-2}}\n# \u0418\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c/\u042d.\u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439. - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430: \u0410\u0421\u0422, 2007. - 272\u0441. - (\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0410\u0418\u0424). {{ISBN|5-17-041661-X}}\n# \u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \"\u0426\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\"/ \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0416\u0443\u043a. - \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0411\u0425\u0412-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433, 2013. - 640\u0441. - (\u041e\u043a\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e) {{ISBN|978-5-9775-0895-7}}\n# \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0437 \u2116 3 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0414\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u042f.\u041c. \u042e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b \u042f\u043a\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u0430\u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 - \u0413\u0410 \u0420\u0424. \u0424. 601. \u041e\u043f.2. \u0414.34. \u041b.  34 http://statearchive.ru/assets/images/docs/123/\n# \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041c\u0423\u0420\u0430 \u0432 1920-1921\u0433\u0433. // \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430, 38.- \u2116 14 (9615) \u043e\u0442 24.04.2018 - http://petrovka-38.com/arkhiv/item/grigorij-nikulin-nachalnik-mura-v-1920-1921-gg\n\n* Rappaport, Helen.

He came from a lower-class family. His father Pyotr Iossiffovich (\u041f\u0451\u0442\u0440 \u0418\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0444\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447) was a bricklayer and mother Anna Ivanovna a housewife. At the age of 9 Grigory started attending parish school at Zvenigorod church, which he enjoyed immensely. Education was interrupted by his family's disastrous financial situation. After which he started working in a local blacksmith shop. In the spring of 1909 family sold their house in Zvenigorodka and moved to a nearby  small town of Uman. At the age of 16 Grigory moved out of parent's house and became a bricklayer. He joined a local social democratic club in Uman in 1913. Soon he was deported from Kiev province and moved to Kazan.\n\n=== Joining the Bolsheviks ===\nIn January 1915 he was drafted into the army, but due to congenital diseases was only fit for wartime militia units and not for regular service. Early in 1916 Grigory moved to Tavatui near Yekaterinburg and started working at the construction site of the dynamite plant (\u0422\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434). Very soon after moving he was drawn to local Bolsheviks and met Mikhail Kabanov who helped him become a devoted follower of Lenin. By the end of 1916 he was organizing a strike at the dynamite plant. In March 1917 Nikulin became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) i.e. Communist party. Party number \u2013 128185.\n\nAs a result of financing problems with French joint-stock company, plant activists decided to stop all work with the construction of this facility early in 1918. Nikulin was sent to Yekaterinburg along with all the party members of the factory. He met Goloschekin, a member of the Ural Regional Committee of the RSDLP and joined the Ural Cheka on his recommendation. Starting his service in Cheka, Nikulin soon became acquainted with Yakov Yurovsky who noticed Nikulin's modesty, ability to get along with different people, honesty and absolute sobriety. The two became friends and formed a special relationship that lasted for years where Yurovsky simply called him \"son\". Nikulin was appointed Assistant to the Commandant of the House of Special Purpose on the recommendation of Yurovsky. The Commandant was Yurovsky himself.\n\n== Yekaterinburg Cheka ==\nHaving begun work in the Cheka, Grigory was assigned some serious cases. One of the first was discrete surveillance of Alexander Ivanovich Andogsky, the head of the Military Academy of Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Nikulin was introduced as a domestic worker to Andogsky after the Academy was evacuated from Petrograd to Yekaterinburg in March 1918. Later the same year Andogsky joined the White forces, was dismissed from the Military Academy and eventually was appointed as General in [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]]'s Army.\n\nNikulin was also in charge of soldier selection for train convoy L-42, on 30 April 1918 where Tsar Nicholas II and part of his family were moved from Tyumen to Yekaterinburg.\n\n=== Killing of Prince Dolgorukov ===\nExecution of Prince [[Vasily Alexandrovich Dolgorukov]]. Dolgorukov was a close friend of Nicholas II as well as his adviser, Marshal of the Imperial Court (1914\u20131917) and Commander of the Imperial Guard cavalry regiment. Deeply devoted to the Tsar he voluntarily accompanied the Imperial family to imprisonment in Tobolsk. After arriving in Yekaterinburg at the end of May he was separated from the family and arrested. Dolgorukov was executed 10 July 1918 in cold blood by Nikulin, a week before the killing of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Dolgorukov was taken to a field beyond the city's Ivanovskoe Cemetery with Count Tatishchev and the two were shot in the head and thrown into a pit. Nikulin recalled the incident in his radio interview 1964: \"\u042f \u0432\u044b\u0432\u0435\u0437 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043b\u044f\u043b \u0432\u0441\u0451 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u0449\u0438\u043b \u0447\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0430\u043d\u044b \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0434\" (I took him out to the field and cursed everything while I was dragging his suitcases back). Dolgorukov was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1981.\n\nNikulin was also involved in death of Hermogenes, Bishop of Tobolsk and Siberia, who was drowned in the Tura River by the Bolsheviks.\n\n=== Killing of Nicholas II and family ===\nGrigory Nikulin is known for his participating in the killing of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas]] II and his family. Nikulin was living in the House of Special Purpose [[Ipatiev House]] since his appointment as Assistant to the Commandant. He was also in charge of the house in absence of Yurovsky who lived in the \"American Hotel\". The Ural Regional Soviet agreed in a meeting on June 29 that the Romanov family should be executed. After getting the final approval from the Central Executive Committee in Moscow Yurovsky organized a meeting in American Hotel. Participation in the killing was voluntary and people who agreed to participate came to Yurovsky's room. It was agreed that to prevent unnecessary suffering that the condemned were to be shot in the heart.\n\nOn 17 July, right after midnight Yurovsky woke up the Tsar, his family, doctor and servants, 11 persons altogether and guided them to an empty room in the lower floor of the house. On demand of Tsaritsa [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra]] Nikulin brought two chairs. One for her and one for [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Prince Alexei]]. Yurovsky announced the verdict: \"Nikolai Alexandrovich, in view of the fact that your relatives are continuing their attack on Soviet Russia, the Ural Executive Committee has decided to execute you.\" Shooting started. It is controversial who actually shot the Tsar \u2013 Yurovsky, Medvedev, Ermakov, or all of them. Nikulin shot one bullet to Prince Alexei and left the room. Apparently Alexei didn't die from this shot. Yurovsky shot Alexei in the head killing him. Long after this event, in private conversation with the son of Mikhail Medvedev, Nikulin said that he couldn't bear having the sick boy looking at him and stopped shooting.\n\nAfterwards Nikulin oversaw the carrying of the corpses to a truck waiting outside. He had all the jewels and valuables that had been sewn into the clothes of the royal family removed. On 20 July, just a few days before the arrival of the White Army, Nikulin left Yekaterinburg. He personally carried 6,000 carats of the Tsar's diamonds to the State Bank in Moscow.\n\nNikulin initially left a good impression on the Imperial family during visits to the Ipatiev House with Yurovsky. He wasn't like the others. He was well-mannered and polite. From the diary of Alexandra Feodorovna: \"June 21st, Thursday. \"..young assistant, who seems very nice person, compared to other ones that are vulgar and unpleasant.. Young man (Nikulin) enumerated jewelry items and did it thoroughly\". From the diary of Nicholas II: \"June 23th, Saturday. Yurovsky and his assistant (Nikulin) started to understand what sort of people was around, stealing from us and guarded us from them\". However, after Yurovsky became commandant of the Ipatiev House on 4 July and continuously tightened restrictions imposed on the Romanov family, Nicholas wrote in his diary on 11 July, \"We like this man less and less.\"<ref>Rappaport, pp. 118\u2013119.</ref>\n\n== After Yekaterinburg ==\nAfter completing the assignment in Yekaterinburg, Nikulin joined the Red Army. He had several duties at 3rd Army of the Eastern front. He even took part in battles. Early 1919 he started working for political department of the division (politotdel) but contracted typhus and was taken to Moscow. There he met again Yurovsky, who worked for Moscow City Council at the time and offered him a job as head of the Moscow apartment houses. They continued their warm friendship meeting each other on and off duty.\n\nNikulin stayed in Moscow and worked in different jobs. First for City Council (MosSoviet). Later he was allocated to the position of Moscow prisons head. Four months after that the head of inspectorate department of Moscow police. He then worked as the head of [[Moscow Criminal Investigations Department|Moscow Criminal Investigation Department]] from March 1920 to 1922. In 1922 he was awarded with the [[Order of the Red Banner]].\n\n== Later life ==\nBetween 1923 and 1938 Nikulin held several noteworthy positions. From 1923 to 1924 he was Vice-head of the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department. In 1925 he was a member of MosGorIspolCom (Moscow Executive Committee). From 1925 to 1930 he was the head of MosGubStrakh (Moscow Insurance State Company). From 1930 to 1931 he was the head of MosGas (Moscow Gas trest). From 1933 to 1935 he worked at MosSovet on a problem concerning building materials manufacturing, and from 1935 to 1938 he was the head of MosZhilOtdel (Moscow Housing Department).\n\nHe was often visited by comrades such as Rodzinsky and Medvedev. In 1927 Nikulin and Yurovsky made an application to the USSR Revolution Museum and handed them two revolvers which were used in the killing of Imperial Family.\n\nYurovsky died in 1938. Before dying he wrote a warm farewell letter to his dear friend Nikulin leaving him a list of documents to be delivered to the Revolution Museum. From 1938 to his retirement in 1960 Nikulin worked for Department of Water and Sewerage. He was awarded with four state orders, one of which was [[Order of the Patriotic War]] 1st class (1947). During his whole life Nikulin insisted on keeping low profile concerning the killing of imperial family. He even asked Medvedev not to mention his role in the execution. One year before his death he was asked by a high party official to give an interview on radio. It resulted in a 3 hour recording in which he talks about everything. \"All was done consciously, without doubts. I did understand all responsibility. I welcomed the decision of Ural Regional Soviet.. And even more, if it is allowed to say, I considered it as an honor.\"\n\nGrigory Nikulin died on 22 September 1965. He was buried on the site of the \"Old Bolsheviks\" at [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow. Across from Nikulin's grave is the grave of [[Boris Yeltsin]], President of the Russian Federation. Ipatiev House was demolished by order of Boris Yeltsin in 1977 while he was leader of the Sverdlovsk Executive Committee. The Politburo had declared the house not to be of \"sufficient historical significance\".\n\n== References ==\n# https://i-podmoskovie.ru/php/podmoskovnii-letopisets/articles/2355-tsareubijtsa.html (\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432. 11.03.2015. \u0426\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0443\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0446\u0430)\n# \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0441 \u0413.\u041f. \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438, \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044e \u0426\u041a \u041a\u041f\u0421\u0421 \u0432 1964 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 -  \u0420\u0413\u0410\u0421\u041f\u0418. \u0424. 588. \u041e\u043f. 3\u0441. \u0414. 13. \u041b. 1-71 http://statearchive.ru/assets/images/docs/n10/\n# \u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u0418\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u042f.\u041c. \u042e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0435 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438 \u0438 \u043e \u043f\u043e\u043f\u044b\u0442\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u0441\u043f\u0440\u044f\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c \u0442\u0440\u0443\u043f\u044b (\u0441 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438, \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u041c.\u041d. \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c) - \u0413\u0410 \u0420\u0424. \u0424. 601. \u041e\u043f. 2. \u0414. 27. \u041b. 31-34  http://statearchive.ru/assets/images/docs/232/\n# \u0423\u0431\u0438\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0441\u0435\u043c\u044c\u0438/\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432. - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430: \u0410\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043c, 2016. - 384\u0441. - (\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b. \u0422\u0430\u0439\u043d\u044b \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438). {{ISBN|978-5-906861-09-2}}\n# \u0418\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c/\u042d.\u0421. \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439. - \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430: \u0410\u0421\u0422, 2007. - 272\u0441. - (\u0417\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0410\u0418\u0424). {{ISBN|5-17-041661-X}}\n# \u0412\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0432 \"\u0426\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\"/ \u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0416\u0443\u043a. - \u0421\u041f\u0431.: \u0411\u0425\u0412-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433, 2013. - 640\u0441. - (\u041e\u043a\u043d\u043e \u0432 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044e) {{ISBN|978-5-9775-0895-7}}\n# \u041f\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0437 \u2116 3 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u0414\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u042f.\u041c. \u042e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430, \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0434\u044b \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u044b \u042f\u043a\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0449\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u0430\u0444\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 - \u0413\u0410 \u0420\u0424. \u0424. 601. \u041e\u043f.2. \u0414.34. \u041b.  34 http://statearchive.ru/assets/images/docs/123/\n# \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0438\u043d. \u041d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041c\u0423\u0420\u0430 \u0432 1920-1921\u0433\u0433. // \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043a\u0430, 38.- \u2116 14 (9615) \u043e\u0442 24.04.2018 - http://petrovka-38.com/arkhiv/item/grigorij-nikulin-nachalnik-mura-v-1920-1921-gg\n\n* Rappaport, Helen.
