Prince Albert visited the institution in 1840, when he descended in the diving bell, and became a patron in 1841.

Pepper wrote several important science education books, one of which is regarded as a significant step towards the understanding of [[continental drift]].\n\n[[File:University of Westminster.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to the university's headquarters at 309 [[Regent Street]]]]\nIn 1848, a theatre was added to the building, purpose-built to accommodate the growing audiences for the Polytechnic's optical shows. These combined magic lantern images with live performances, music, ghosts and spectres, spreading the fame of what was arguably the world's first permanent projection theatre.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brooker|first1=Jeremy|title=The Temple of Minerva: Magic and the Magic Lantern at the Royal Polytechnic Institution London, 1887\u20131901|date=2013|publisher=The Magic Lantern Society}}</ref>\n\nIn 1862, inventor [[Henry Dircks]] developed the [[Dircksian phantasmagoria|Dircksian Phantasmagoria]], where it was seen by Pepper in a booth set up by Dircks at the Polytechnic.<ref name=\"Granta Editions\"/> Pepper first showed the effect during a scene of Charles Dickens's novella ''[[The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain|The Haunted Man]]'' (1848) at the Regent Street theatre to great success. However, Pepper's implementation of the effect tied his name to it permanently. Though he tried many times to give credit to Dircks, the title \"[[Pepper's ghost]]\" has endured.\n\nExpansion gradually gave way to financial difficulty, reflecting a long-standing tension between education and the need to run a successful business. A fatal accident on the premises in 1859 caused the first institution to be wound up and a new one formed. Various regeneration schemes were considered, but in 1879 a fire damaged the roof, precipitating the final crisis.<ref name=\"Granta Editions\"/>\n\n=== 1881\u20131970: Polytechnic Regent Street ===\n[[File:Sculpture of Quintin Hogg in the Portland Place in London, June 2013 (1).jpg|thumb|right|A memorial to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], [[Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone]] stands on [[Portland Place]], opposite [[Broadcasting House|BBC Broadcasting House]]]]\nIn September 1881, the Royal Polytechnic Institution closed, marking a transition to new ownership and a new era of educational development. Christian philanthropist [[Quintin Hogg (merchant)|Quintin Hogg]] (1845\u20131903) acquired the lease to the building in December 1881 for \u00a315,000,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=Ethel Mary|title=Quintin Hogg: a biography|year=1904|place=London |publisher=Constable|url=https://archive.org/details/quintinhoggbiogr00hoggiala}}</ref> and the premises re-opened on 25 September 1882. About 6,000 members and students \u2013 three times the anticipated number \u2013 attended during the first 1882/3 session.  The institute gradually adopted the name the '''Polytechnic Young Men's Christian Institute''', or simply, the Polytechnic, for short.\n\nFrom 1882 an expanded programme of classes began, including science, engineering and art classes held in conjunction with the Science and Art Department (of the Board of Trade), and a scheme of technical and trade education, related to the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] of Technical Instruction and to the London Trades Council. The building housed classrooms, a swimming bath, gymnasium, and a refreshment room. Activities included daily chapels, Parliamentary debating, a Reading Circle, music and drama societies and several sports clubs.\n\nIn the early 1880s the Institute attracted much favourable attention from the technical education lobby. Following the City of London Parochial Charities Act in 1883, it became clear that funds would be available to endow the Polytechnic and to found and support institutions on the same model across London. A public appeal was launched in 1888 to raise the required matching funding. The Scheme was finalised under the auspices of the Charity Commissioners in 1891, when the Institute was reconstituted as '''The Polytechnic-Regent Street''' (often referred to as the '''Regent Street Polytechnic'''), managed by a newly created governing body.<ref>{{cite book|title=Educating Mind, Body and Spirit: The legacy of Quintin Hogg and The Polytechnic, 1864\u20131992|publisher=Granta Editions|location=Cambridge|pages=45\u201377}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 February 1896, the first performance of a moving film ([[Cin\u00e9matographe]]) to a paying UK audience was delivered by the [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] at the Regent Street Cinema.

Pioneering work in emerging professional and commercial disciplines, alongside general interest subjects, was the hallmark of the institution. When [[Quintin Hogg (merchant)|Hogg]] died in 1903, he was succeeded as President by Sir [[Kynaston Studd]] (1858\u20131944), who remained in office until his death in 1944, and did much to continue the traditions of the founder. Two major appeals were launched to support expansion, the first for the rebuilding of 309 Regent Street in 1910\u20131912, and the second to build the Polytechnic Extension building for the Women's Institute in Little Titchfield Street, which was formally opened in 1929. Both buildings continued to provide sporting and social facilities for members of the Institute as well as workshops and classrooms for students of the Education Department.\n\n[[File:Royal visit to the University of Westminster's rebuilt Polytechnic (1912).png|thumb|[[King George V]], [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], and their son [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] visited the Polytechnic after it was rebuilt in 1912.]]\nThe Education Department provided a wide range of courses, with a rapid expansion of commercial subjects alongside the original trade and technical classes. Courses ranged from post-elementary school entry for craft and technical training at 13 to degrees accredited by the [[University of London]] external degrees programme. Most teaching was in the evening and part-time, though day classes increased throughout the period. Following World War Two there was a rapid growth in the demand for further education and training, which was reorganised following the White Paper on Technical Education in 1956.\n\nThe variety of levels of work at Regent Street meant that it was designated a regional college rather than a college of advanced technology, after which the governors decided to reduce the proportion of lower level work. Following the establishment of the Council for National Academic Awards ([[CNAA]]) in 1964, a number of degree courses were approved and became operational; including Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Electronic, Civil, Building, Production, and Manufacturing), Architecture, Photography (1966), Arts Administration (1967), Life Sciences (1973) and Media Studies (1975).\n\n=== 1970\u20131992: Polytechnic of Central London ===\n[[File:University of Westminster Foyer.jpg|thumb|right|The Regent Street campus is a [[Grade II listed building]] due to its historic and architectural interest.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1265181|desc=University of Westminster (formerly Regent Street Polytechnic), Non Civil Parish |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>]]\nIn 1960 the [[London County Council]] announced a plan to turn Regent Street into a tri-partite federal college by adding a new College of Architecture and Advanced Building Technology (CAABT) and also a College of Engineering and Science (CES). The existing commercial subjects would remain centred on no 309 Regent Street.\n\nCAABT was allocated the [[Luxborough Street|Luxborough Lodge]] site in Marylebone Road and CES a site in New Cavendish Street. Both schemes suffered prolonged delays and the new buildings were not finished until 1970. Holborn College of Law, Languages and Commerce was merged with Regent Street Polytechnic to form the '''Polytechnic of Central London''' (PCL).\n\nAt a ceremony on 21 May 1971, the Lord Chancellor [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]], grandson and namesake of [[Quintin Hogg (merchant)|Hogg]], opened the new buildings and designated the new institution.  In 1990, Harrow College of Higher Education became part of the PCL.\n\n=== 1992\u2013present: University of Westminster ===\nThe PCL was re-designated as the '''University of Westminster''' following the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]], which created a single funding council, the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|Higher Education Funding Council]], for England and abolished the remaining distinctions between polytechnics (degrees award nationally) and universities (degrees awarded by individual university). The newly established university was re-dedicated at Westminster Abbey on 1 December 1992. As a university, Westminster gained the power to grant its own degrees.\n\n[[Mary Hogg|Dame Mary Hogg]] (great-granddaughter of Quintin Hogg, founder of the Regent Street Polytechnic) was awarded an honorary [[doctorate of law]] (LLD) by the University of Westminster in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=92086&sectioncode=26|title=Honorary degrees|last=Williams|first=Lynne|date=19 January 1996|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|publisher=TSL Education|accessdate=21 October 2008}}</ref> Hogg also became part of the court of governors at the university, thus continuing the university's close association with the Hogg family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-university/court-of-governors|title=Court of Governors|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nWestminster's efforts in overseas expansion resulted in the university being awarded the [[Queen's Award for Enterprise]] in 2000, and again in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-heritage|title=Our heritage|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the university has established the Africa, Arab and [[China Media Centre]]s; the Centre for the Study of Democracy, the institute for Modern and Contemporary Culture, and absorbed the 90-year-old [[Policy Studies Institute]].

However, in 2006, The Smoke briefly switched to a newspaper format, initially being published fortnightly during term time. The newspaper format was later scrapped for a much smaller magazine format.\n\n''The Quintin Hogg'' (informally known as \"The QH\" or \"The Hogg\") was launched in September 2012 as a university-wide newspaper. The paper is circulated at all four of the university's campuses.\n\nPast student publications included the ''Polytechnic Magazine'' (1935\u20131971), ''Poly-hoo'' (1938\u20131939), ''The Poly Tribune'' (1946), ''Publicity Committee News'' (1946), the ''Journal of the Maths and Physics Department'' (1945\u20131946), ''the Student Forum'' (1949\u20131953), ''New Chameleon'' (1962), ''Polygon'' (1963), ''Polygen'' (1964), ''West One'' (1966\u20131969), ''McGarel'' (1968\u20131993), and ''Gen'' (1970).\n\nThe university also publishes an annual alumni magazine, ''Network'', as well as several academic student journals such as the ''Law Review''<ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.westminsterlawreview.org/about.php|work=Westminster Law Review|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>  and ''Wells Street Journal''.<ref>{{cite web|title=LAUNCH OF THE WELLS STREET JOURNAL|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/humanities/2014/launch-of-the-wells-street-journal|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140402151155/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/humanities/2014/launch-of-the-wells-street-journal|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 April 2014|work=University of Westminster|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://thewellsstreetjournalsubmit.wordpress.com/about/|work=Well Street Journal|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\n{{See also|Polytechnic F.C.}}\n\nSport has played an important role at the institution since the late nineteenth century. In 1883, the athletic club, the Harriers, was established and was for many years the largest athletics club in the country.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of British sport |first1=Richard |last1=Cox |first2=Wray |last2=Vamplew|first3=Grant|last3=Jarvie|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2000|isbn=978-1-85109-344-1|pages=232\u2013238|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JWQTAQAAIAAJ&q=Encyclopedia+of+British+sport++Richard+William+Cox,+Wray+Vamplew,+Grant+Jarvie&dq=Encyclopedia+of+British+sport++Richard+William+Cox,+Wray+Vamplew,+Grant+Jarvie}}</ref>\n\nIn 1908, the polytechnic organised the opening and closing ceremonies of the [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 London Olympic Games]], also hosting a venue at [[The Polytechnic Stadium]] in [[Chiswick]].<ref>{{cite book |title=For God, England & Ethel|first1=Steve|last1=Johnson|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4251-8973-0|page=334|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aqKRl0a6ZI8C&dq=For+God,+England+%26+Ethel}}</ref> From 1898, the polytechnic awarded the [[Studd Trophy]], an annual trophy for the best sports performance. Over the years, the award was given to sportsmen from various disciplines, such as [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[boxing]] and [[cycling]], but the majority of awards have been given to [[track and field]] athletes.\n\nNoted award holders include:\n* [[Willie Applegarth]] (1912/13), [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medallist sprinters\n* [[Albert Hill (athlete)|Albert Hill]] (1919/20), Olympic gold medallist and middle-distance runner\n* [[Harry Edward]] (1922), Olympic sprint bronze medallist\n* [[Alan Pascoe]] (1971/72/73/74/75), hurdler\n\nThe university has grounds in [[Chiswick]] on the Thames with boat house, tennis courts, athletics track and about 12 pitches.

Prince Albert visited the institution in 1840, when he descended in the diving bell, and became a patron in 1841. The first public photographic portrait studio in Europe opened on the roof of the Polytechnic in March 1841.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gernsheim|first1=Helmut|title=A Concise history of photography|date=1986|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=33}}</ref>\n\nIn 1847, [[John Henry Pepper]] joined the Polytechnic and oversaw the introduction of evening lectures in engineering, applied science and technical subjects for young working Londoners. Pepper wrote several important science education books, one of which is regarded as a significant step towards the understanding of [[continental drift]].\n\n[[File:University of Westminster.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance to the university's headquarters at 309 [[Regent Street]]]]\nIn 1848, a theatre was added to the building, purpose-built to accommodate the growing audiences for the Polytechnic's optical shows. These combined magic lantern images with live performances, music, ghosts and spectres, spreading the fame of what was arguably the world's first permanent projection theatre.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brooker|first1=Jeremy|title=The Temple of Minerva: Magic and the Magic Lantern at the Royal Polytechnic Institution London, 1887\u20131901|date=2013|publisher=The Magic Lantern Society}}</ref>\n\nIn 1862, inventor [[Henry Dircks]] developed the [[Dircksian phantasmagoria|Dircksian Phantasmagoria]], where it was seen by Pepper in a booth set up by Dircks at the Polytechnic.<ref name=\"Granta Editions\"/> Pepper first showed the effect during a scene of Charles Dickens's novella ''[[The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain|The Haunted Man]]'' (1848) at the Regent Street theatre to great success. However, Pepper's implementation of the effect tied his name to it permanently. Though he tried many times to give credit to Dircks, the title \"[[Pepper's ghost]]\" has endured.\n\nExpansion gradually gave way to financial difficulty, reflecting a long-standing tension between education and the need to run a successful business. A fatal accident on the premises in 1859 caused the first institution to be wound up and a new one formed. Various regeneration schemes were considered, but in 1879 a fire damaged the roof, precipitating the final crisis.<ref name=\"Granta Editions\"/>\n\n=== 1881\u20131970: Polytechnic Regent Street ===\n[[File:Sculpture of Quintin Hogg in the Portland Place in London, June 2013 (1).jpg|thumb|right|A memorial to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], [[Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone]] stands on [[Portland Place]], opposite [[Broadcasting House|BBC Broadcasting House]]]]\nIn September 1881, the Royal Polytechnic Institution closed, marking a transition to new ownership and a new era of educational development. Christian philanthropist [[Quintin Hogg (merchant)|Quintin Hogg]] (1845\u20131903) acquired the lease to the building in December 1881 for \u00a315,000,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hogg|first=Ethel Mary|title=Quintin Hogg: a biography|year=1904|place=London |publisher=Constable|url=https://archive.org/details/quintinhoggbiogr00hoggiala}}</ref> and the premises re-opened on 25 September 1882. About 6,000 members and students \u2013 three times the anticipated number \u2013 attended during the first 1882/3 session.  The institute gradually adopted the name the '''Polytechnic Young Men's Christian Institute''', or simply, the Polytechnic, for short.\n\nFrom 1882 an expanded programme of classes began, including science, engineering and art classes held in conjunction with the Science and Art Department (of the Board of Trade), and a scheme of technical and trade education, related to the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] of Technical Instruction and to the London Trades Council. The building housed classrooms, a swimming bath, gymnasium, and a refreshment room. Activities included daily chapels, Parliamentary debating, a Reading Circle, music and drama societies and several sports clubs.\n\nIn the early 1880s the Institute attracted much favourable attention from the technical education lobby. Following the City of London Parochial Charities Act in 1883, it became clear that funds would be available to endow the Polytechnic and to found and support institutions on the same model across London. A public appeal was launched in 1888 to raise the required matching funding. The Scheme was finalised under the auspices of the Charity Commissioners in 1891, when the Institute was reconstituted as '''The Polytechnic-Regent Street''' (often referred to as the '''Regent Street Polytechnic'''), managed by a newly created governing body.<ref>{{cite book|title=Educating Mind, Body and Spirit: The legacy of Quintin Hogg and The Polytechnic, 1864\u20131992|publisher=Granta Editions|location=Cambridge|pages=45\u201377}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 February 1896, the first performance of a moving film ([[Cin\u00e9matographe]]) to a paying UK audience was delivered by the [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] at the Regent Street Cinema. For this reason the cinema has been described as \"the birthplace of British cinema\".<ref name=\"guardianreopening\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910131227/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/05/regent-street-cinema-reopen-35-years|title=Remaking a classic: Regent Street Cinema to reopen doors after 35 years|access-date=10 September 2016|archive-date=10 September 2016|url-status=live|first=Hannah|last=Ellis-Petersen|website=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 May 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/05/regent-street-cinema-reopen-35-years|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]}}</ref>\n\nThe building at 309 Regent Street was rebuilt in 1910\u20131912 to reflect the needs of a growing institution whose student members exceeded 15,000. Pioneering work in emerging professional and commercial disciplines, alongside general interest subjects, was the hallmark of the institution. When [[Quintin Hogg (merchant)|Hogg]] died in 1903, he was succeeded as President by Sir [[Kynaston Studd]] (1858\u20131944), who remained in office until his death in 1944, and did much to continue the traditions of the founder. Two major appeals were launched to support expansion, the first for the rebuilding of 309 Regent Street in 1910\u20131912, and the second to build the Polytechnic Extension building for the Women's Institute in Little Titchfield Street, which was formally opened in 1929. Both buildings continued to provide sporting and social facilities for members of the Institute as well as workshops and classrooms for students of the Education Department.\n\n[[File:Royal visit to the University of Westminster's rebuilt Polytechnic (1912).png|thumb|[[King George V]], [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], and their son [[Edward VIII|Edward, Prince of Wales]] visited the Polytechnic after it was rebuilt in 1912.]]\nThe Education Department provided a wide range of courses, with a rapid expansion of commercial subjects alongside the original trade and technical classes. Courses ranged from post-elementary school entry for craft and technical training at 13 to degrees accredited by the [[University of London]] external degrees programme. Most teaching was in the evening and part-time, though day classes increased throughout the period. Following World War Two there was a rapid growth in the demand for further education and training, which was reorganised following the White Paper on Technical Education in 1956.\n\nThe variety of levels of work at Regent Street meant that it was designated a regional college rather than a college of advanced technology, after which the governors decided to reduce the proportion of lower level work. Following the establishment of the Council for National Academic Awards ([[CNAA]]) in 1964, a number of degree courses were approved and became operational; including Engineering (Mechanical, Electrical, Electronic, Civil, Building, Production, and Manufacturing), Architecture, Photography (1966), Arts Administration (1967), Life Sciences (1973) and Media Studies (1975).\n\n=== 1970\u20131992: Polytechnic of Central London ===\n[[File:University of Westminster Foyer.jpg|thumb|right|The Regent Street campus is a [[Grade II listed building]] due to its historic and architectural interest.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1265181|desc=University of Westminster (formerly Regent Street Polytechnic), Non Civil Parish |accessdate=29 August 2019}}</ref>]]\nIn 1960 the [[London County Council]] announced a plan to turn Regent Street into a tri-partite federal college by adding a new College of Architecture and Advanced Building Technology (CAABT) and also a College of Engineering and Science (CES). The existing commercial subjects would remain centred on no 309 Regent Street.\n\nCAABT was allocated the [[Luxborough Street|Luxborough Lodge]] site in Marylebone Road and CES a site in New Cavendish Street. Both schemes suffered prolonged delays and the new buildings were not finished until 1970. Holborn College of Law, Languages and Commerce was merged with Regent Street Polytechnic to form the '''Polytechnic of Central London''' (PCL).\n\nAt a ceremony on 21 May 1971, the Lord Chancellor [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]], grandson and namesake of [[Quintin Hogg (merchant)|Hogg]], opened the new buildings and designated the new institution.  In 1990, Harrow College of Higher Education became part of the PCL.\n\n=== 1992\u2013present: University of Westminster ===\nThe PCL was re-designated as the '''University of Westminster''' following the [[Further and Higher Education Act 1992]], which created a single funding council, the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|Higher Education Funding Council]], for England and abolished the remaining distinctions between polytechnics (degrees award nationally) and universities (degrees awarded by individual university). The newly established university was re-dedicated at Westminster Abbey on 1 December 1992. As a university, Westminster gained the power to grant its own degrees.\n\n[[Mary Hogg|Dame Mary Hogg]] (great-granddaughter of Quintin Hogg, founder of the Regent Street Polytechnic) was awarded an honorary [[doctorate of law]] (LLD) by the University of Westminster in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=92086&sectioncode=26|title=Honorary degrees|last=Williams|first=Lynne|date=19 January 1996|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|publisher=TSL Education|accessdate=21 October 2008}}</ref> Hogg also became part of the court of governors at the university, thus continuing the university's close association with the Hogg family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-university/court-of-governors|title=Court of Governors|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nWestminster's efforts in overseas expansion resulted in the university being awarded the [[Queen's Award for Enterprise]] in 2000, and again in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-heritage|title=Our heritage|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the university has established the Africa, Arab and [[China Media Centre]]s; the Centre for the Study of Democracy, the institute for Modern and Contemporary Culture, and absorbed the 90-year-old [[Policy Studies Institute]].
