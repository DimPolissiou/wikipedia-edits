Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmannesque]] world where the characters\u2019 reality in only enhanced by the strangeness of their surroundings.\"|source=\u2014[[Mikhail German]] on ''Actors...'', in a 1980 artbook ''Antoine Watteau''.{{sfn|German|1980|p=8}}}}\n''Actors ...'' is an oil on panel painting upholstered in wood, and measures approximately 20 \u00d7 25&nbsp;cm.{{sfnm|Nemilova|1964|1p=181|2a1=Grasselli|2a2=Rosenberg|2a3=Parmantier|1984|2p=311}}\n\nIn the painting, Watteau depicts five figures in half-length, standing around a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Completed in the 1710s, it was a part of the collections formed by Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]], and later by his relatives. Since being acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772, the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. Throughout its provenance, the work has also been known under a number of various titles, with ''Coquettes...'' becoming dominant since the later 19th century; in Russian literature, a title of '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}}} has been adopted since the later 20th century, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\nThe painting is a group portrait which is considered to be the rarest kind in Watteau's body of work; it depicts five figures in half-length \u2014 two men, two women and a [[Black people|black]] boy \u2014 set amidst a dark background. Among various explanations of the subject, one is accepted in Russia that identifies the adults as members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] who performed in [[Florent Carton Dancourt]]'s play ''[[The Three Cousins]]'', and the black boy as Pierre Crozat's servant; other scholars presumed it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]] or of a family group preparing for a ball.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks. All this creates an impression of the natural unity of the imagined and the actual, a [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|Hoffmannesque]] world where the characters\u2019 reality in only enhanced by the strangeness of their surroundings.\"|source=\u2014[[Mikhail German]] on ''Actors...'', in a 1980 artbook ''Antoine Watteau''.{{sfn|German|1980|p=8}}}}\n''Actors ...'' is an oil on panel painting upholstered in wood, and measures approximately 20 \u00d7 25&nbsp;cm.{{sfnm|Nemilova|1964|1p=181|2a1=Grasselli|2a2=Rosenberg|2a3=Parmantier|1984|2p=311}}\n\nIn the painting, Watteau depicts five figures in half-length, standing around a stone balustrade. To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Foster care had its early stages in [[South Australia]] in 1867 and stretched to the second half of the 19th century. It is said that the system was mostly run by women until the early 20th century. Then the control was centered in many state children's departments. \"Although boarding-out was also implemented by non-government[al] child rescue organizations, many large institutions remained. These institutions assumed an increasing importance from the late 1920s when the system went into decline.\" The system was re-energized in the postwar era, and in the 1970s. The system is still the main structure for \"out-of-home care.\" The system took care of both local and foreign children. \"The first adoption legislation was passed in [[Western Australia]] in 1896, but the remaining states did not act until the 1920s, introducing the beginnings of the closed adoption that reached it peak in the period 1940\u20131975. New baby adoption dropped dramatically from the mid-1970s, with the greater tolerance of and support for single mothers\".<ref>Swain, Shurlee. \"History of Adoption and Fostering in Australia by Shurlee Swain.\" History of Adoption and Fostering in Australia.

However, despite a later start, the practice is currently making great strides within the country. Left with a large number of official and unofficial [[orphanage]]s from the 1990s, the Cambodian government conducted several research projects in 2006 and 2008, pointing to the overuse of orphanages as a solution for caring for vulnerable children within the country. Most notably, the studies found that the percentage of children within orphanages that had parents approached 80%. At the same time, local NGOs like \"Children In Families\"<ref>[http://www.chlidreninfamilies.org/foster-care/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> began offering limited foster care services within the country. In the subsequent years, the Cambodian government began implementing policies that required the closure of some orphanages and the implementation of minimum standards for [[residential care]] institutions. These actions lead to an increase in the number of NGOs providing foster care placements and helped to set the course for care reform around the country. As of 2015, the Cambodian government is working with UNICEF, USAID, several governments, and many local NGOs in continuing to build the capacity for child protection and foster care within the Kingdom.\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Foster care in Canada}}\n\nFoster children in Canada are known as '''permanent wards''', ('''crown wards''' in Ontario).<ref name=\"anne\">Anne Tweddle, [http://www.voices.mb.ca/assets/Anne%20Tweddle%20Youth%20Leaving%20Care%20Report.pdf \"Youth Leaving Care Report\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021093334/http://www.voices.mb.ca/assets/anne%20tweddle%20youth%20leaving%20care%20report.pdf |date=2014-10-21 }}, September 2005</ref> A [[Ward (law)|ward]] is someone, in this case a child, placed under protection of a [[legal guardian]] and are the legal responsibility of the [[Canadian government|government]].

Print.</ref> The idea of foster care or taking in abandoned children actually came about around 1392-1490s in Japan. The foster care system in Japan is similar to the Orphan Trains because Brace thought the children would be better off on farms. The people in Japan thought the children would do better on farms rather than living in the \"dusty city.\" The families would often send their children to a farm family outside the village and only keep their oldest son. The farm families served as the foster parents and they were financially rewarded for taking in the younger siblings. \"It was considered an honor to be chosen as foster parents, and selection greatly depended on the family's reputation and status within the village\".<ref>Kumasaka, Y, and H Aiba. \"Foster Care in Japan: Past and Present.\" The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. 46.2 (1968): 255.

The UK had \"wardship,\" the family taking in the child had custody by the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery Court]]. Wardship was not used very often because it did not give the guardian \"parental rights.\" In the 19th century came a \"series of baby farming scandals.\" At the end of the 19th century they started calling it \"boarding-out\" like they did in Australia. They started placing the children in [[orphanage]]s and [[workhouse]]s as well. \"The First World War saw an increase in organized adoption through adoption societies and child rescue organizations, and pressure grew for adoption to be given legal status.\" The first laws based on adoption and foster care were passed in 1926. \"The peak number of adoptions was in 1968, since when there has been an enormous decline in adoption in the United Kingdom. The main reasons for children being adopted in the United Kingdom had been unmarried mothers giving up their children for adoption and stepparents adopting their new partner's children\".<ref>Keating, Jenny. \"History of Adoption and Fostering in the United Kingdom.\" Oxford Bibliographies.

''Current status and evidence base of training for foster and treatment foster parents''</ref> In most states, the primary objective is to reconcile children with the biological parents. However, if the parents are unable or unwilling to care for the child, then the first choice of adoptive parents is a relative such as an [[aunt]], [[uncle]] or [[grandparent]], known as [[kinship care]]. If no related family member is willing or able to adopt, the next preference is for the child to be adopted by the foster parents or by someone else involved in the child's life (such as a [[teacher]] or [[Coach (sport)|coach]]).

Voluntary placement may occur when a biological parent or lawful guardian is unable to care for a child.

While having financial resources for foster youth is a huge help, there are other components to look at. Beginning with having support for these youth at the high school level. In order for foster youth to obtain a college degree, they must enroll at a university first.\n\nOut of the different factors that play in increasing college enrollment such as youth participating in extended foster care, reading ability, etc., youth who received assistance or had supportive relationships from adults, were more likely than youth who did not have supportive relationships, to enroll at a university.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt colleges across the nation, there are programs that are specifically put in place to help youth who have aged out of the foster care system and continued into higher education. These programs often help youth financially by giving them supplemental funds and providing support through peer mentor programs or academic counseling services. While funding is an important key in helping get through college, it hasn't been found as the only crucial component in aiding a youth's success. &nbsp;\n\nA study done by Jay and colleagues provides insight on what youth view as important in helping them thrive on a college campus.

The first one is that of developing countries. These countries do not have policies implemented to take care of the basic needs of these children and these children mostly receive assistance from relatives. The second system is that of former socialist governments. The historical context of these states has not allowed for the evolution of their foster care system. NGO's have urged them to evolve; however the traditional system of institutionalizing these children is still in place. Thirdly, liberal democracies do not have the support from its political system in order to take care of these children, even though they have the resources. Finally, social democracies are the most advanced governments in regards to their foster care system. These governments have a massive infrastructure, funding, and support system in order to help foster care children.<ref>George, S, N van Oudenhoven, and R Wazir. \"Foster Care Beyond The Crossroads: Lessons From An International Comparative Analysis.\" Childhood 10.3 (2003): 343\u2013361.

Foster care had its early stages in [[South Australia]] in 1867 and stretched to the second half of the 19th century. It is said that the system was mostly run by women until the early 20th century. Then the control was centered in many state children's departments. \"Although boarding-out was also implemented by non-government[al] child rescue organizations, many large institutions remained. These institutions assumed an increasing importance from the late 1920s when the system went into decline.\" The system was re-energized in the postwar era, and in the 1970s. The system is still the main structure for \"out-of-home care.\" The system took care of both local and foreign children. \"The first adoption legislation was passed in [[Western Australia]] in 1896, but the remaining states did not act until the 1920s, introducing the beginnings of the closed adoption that reached it peak in the period 1940\u20131975. New baby adoption dropped dramatically from the mid-1970s, with the greater tolerance of and support for single mothers\".<ref>Swain, Shurlee. \"History of Adoption and Fostering in Australia by Shurlee Swain.\" History of Adoption and Fostering in Australia.

However, despite a later start, the practice is currently making great strides within the country. Left with a large number of official and unofficial orphanages from the 1990s, the Cambodian government conducted several research projects in 2006 and 2008, pointing to the overuse of orphanages as a solution for caring for vulnerable children within the country. Most notably, the studies found that the percentage of children within orphanages that had parents approached 80%. At the same time, local NGOs like \"Children In Families\"<ref>[http://www.chlidreninfamilies.org/foster-care/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> began offering limited foster care services within the country. In the subsequent years, the Cambodian government began implementing policies that required the closure of some orphanages and the implementation of minimum standards for residential care institutions. These actions lead to an increase in the number of NGOs providing foster care placements and helped to set the course for care reform around the country. As of 2015, the Cambodian government is working with UNICEF, USAID, several governments, and many local NGOs in continuing to build the capacity for child protection and foster care within the Kingdom.\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Foster care in Canada}}\n\nFoster children in Canada are known as '''permanent wards''', ('''crown wards''' in Ontario).<ref name=\"anne\">Anne Tweddle, [http://www.voices.mb.ca/assets/Anne%20Tweddle%20Youth%20Leaving%20Care%20Report.pdf \"Youth Leaving Care Report\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021093334/http://www.voices.mb.ca/assets/anne%20tweddle%20youth%20leaving%20care%20report.pdf |date=2014-10-21 }}, September 2005</ref> A [[Ward (law)|ward]] is someone, in this case a child, placed under protection of a [[legal guardian]] and are the legal responsibility of the [[Canadian government|government]].

The foster care system in Japan is similar to the Orphan Trains because Brace thought the children would be better off on farms. The people in Japan thought the children would do better on farms rather than living in the \"dusty city.\" The families would often send their children to a farm family outside the village and only keep their oldest son. The farm families served as the foster parents and they were financially rewarded for taking in the younger siblings. \"It was considered an honor to be chosen as foster parents, and selection greatly depended on the family's reputation and status within the village\".<ref>Kumasaka, Y, and H Aiba. \"Foster Care in Japan: Past and Present.\" The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly. 46.2 (1968): 255.

The UK had \"wardship,\" the family taking in the child had custody by the [[Court of Chancery|Chancery Court]]. Wardship was not used very often because it did not give the guardian \"parental rights.\" In the 19th century came a \"series of baby farming scandals.\" At the end of the 19th century they started calling it \"boarding-out\" like they did in Australia. They started placing the children in [[orphanage]]s and [[workhouse]]s as well. \"The First World War saw an increase in organized adoption through adoption societies and child rescue organizations, and pressure grew for adoption to be given legal status.\" The first laws based on adoption and foster care were passed in 1926. \"The peak number of adoptions was in 1968, since when there has been an enormous decline in adoption in the United Kingdom.

''Current status and evidence base of training for foster and treatment foster parents''</ref> In most states, the primary objective is to reconcile children with the biological parents. However, if the parents are unable or unwilling to care for the child, then the first choice of adoptive parents is a relative such as an [[aunt]], [[uncle]] or [[grandparent]], known as [[kinship care]]. If no related family member is willing or able to adopt, the next preference is for the child to be adopted by the foster parents or by someone else involved in the child's life (such as a [[teacher]] or [[Coach (sport)|coach]]). This is to maintain continuity in the child's life. If neither above option are available, the child may be adopted by someone who is a stranger to the child.\n\nIf none of these options are viable, the plan for the minor may be to enter OPPLA (Other Planned Permanent Living Arrangement). This option allows the child to stay in custody of the state and the child can stay placed in a foster home, with a relative or a long-term care facility, such as a [[Residential Child Care Community|residential child care community]] or, for children with development disabilities, physical disabilities or mental disabilities, a [[Residential treatment center|treatment center]].\n\n671,000 children were served by the foster care system in the United States in 2015.<ref name=\"pewfostercare.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/trends_fostercare_adoption2015.pdf|title=Trends in Foster Care and Adoption: FY 2006 - FY 2015|last=|first=|date=June 8, 2016|website=|publisher=U.S. Children's Bureau, Administration for Children, Youth and Families|accessdate=May 11, 2017}}</ref> \"After declining more than 20 percent between FY 2006 and FY 2012 to a low of 397,000, the number of children in foster care on the last day of the fiscal year increased to 428,000 in FY 2015, with a slightly higher percent change from 2014 to 2015 (3.3%) than observed from 2013 to 2014 (3.2%).\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/trends_fostercare_adoption2015.pdf|title=Trends in Foster Care and Adoption: FY 2006 - FY 2015|last=|first=|date=June 8, 2016|website=|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> In 2015, there were about 112,000 children ready for adoptive families in the nation's foster care systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/trends_fostercare_adoption2015.pdf|title=Trends in Foster Care and Adoption: FY 2006- FY 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=U.S. Children's Bureau, Administration for Children, Youth and Families|accessdate=2017-05-11}}</ref>\n\nThe median amount of time a child spent in foster care in the U.S. in 2015 was 13.5 months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/foster.pdf|title=Foster Care Statistics 2015|date=March 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308084002/http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/foster.pdf|archive-date=2015-03-08|url-status=dead|access-date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> That year, 74% of children spent less than two years in foster care, while 13% were in care for three or more years.<ref name=\"id.\">Id.</ref> Of the estimated 427,910 children in foster care on September 30, 2015: 43 percent were White, 24 percent were African-American, 21 percent were Hispanic (of any race), 10 percent were other races or multiracial, and 2 percent were unknown or unable to be determined.<ref name=\"id.\"/><!-- -soft copy link differs from hard copy.

Voluntary placement may occur when a biological parent or lawful guardian is unable to care for a child. Involuntary placement occurs when a child is removed from their biological parent or lawful guardian due to the risk or actual occurrence of physical or psychological harm. In the US, most children enter foster care due to neglect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pewfostercare.org/ |title=Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care |publisher=Pewfostercare.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}</ref> If a biological parent or [[legal guardian]] is unwilling to care for a child, the child is deemed to be dependent and is placed under the care of the child protection agency. The policies regarding foster care as well as the criteria to be met in order to become a foster parent vary according to legal jurisdiction.\n\nEspecially egregious failures of child protective services often serve as a catalyst for increased removal of children from the homes of biological parents.

Simultaneously, there are also many barriers that make getting to a college or university difficult.\n\nBorton describes some of the barriers youth face in her article, ''Barriers to Post-Secondary Enrollment for Former Foster Youth''. A few of those barriers include financial hurdles, navigating through the application process with little to no support, and lack of housing.<ref>https://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1024&context=soe_faculty</ref>\n\nMany studies have shown that there are a few factors that have seemingly played a role in the success of foster youth making it to and graduating from a college or university. While having financial resources for foster youth is a huge help, there are other components to look at. Beginning with having support for these youth at the high school level. In order for foster youth to obtain a college degree, they must enroll at a university first.\n\nOut of the different factors that play in increasing college enrollment such as youth participating in extended foster care, reading ability, etc., youth who received assistance or had supportive relationships from adults, were more likely than youth who did not have supportive relationships, to enroll at a university.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt colleges across the nation, there are programs that are specifically put in place to help youth who have aged out of the foster care system and continued into higher education. These programs often help youth financially by giving them supplemental funds and providing support through peer mentor programs or academic counseling services. While funding is an important key in helping get through college, it hasn't been found as the only crucial component in aiding a youth's success. &nbsp;\n\nA study done by Jay and colleagues provides insight on what youth view as important in helping them thrive on a college campus. The study, which had a sample of 51 foster youth, used Conceptual Mapping to break down the different components of support that may be important for youth to receive on a college campus.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jay Miller|first=J.|last2=Benner|first2=Kalea|last3=Kheibari|first3=Athena|last4=Washington|first4=Earl|date=2017|title=Conceptualizing on-campus support programs for collegiate foster youth and alumni: A plan for action|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/cysrev/v83y2017icp57-67.html|journal=Children and Youth Services Review|language=en|volume=83|issue=C|pages=57\u201367|doi=10.1016/j.childyouth.2017.10.028}}</ref> It is important to take in the different factors that can be helpful for youth at a university and to look beyond providing financial support.\n\n=== Psychotropic medication use ===\n\nStudies have revealed that youth in foster care covered by [[Medicaid]] insurance receive [[psychotropic medication]] at a rate that was 3 times higher than that of Medicaid-insured youth who qualify by low family income.

The most frequently used medications were [[antidepressants]] (56.8%), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs (55.9%), and antipsychotic agents (53.2%).

The first one is that of developing countries. These countries do not have policies implemented to take care of the basic needs of these children and these children mostly receive assistance from relatives. The second system is that of former socialist governments. The historical context of these states has not allowed for the evolution of their foster care system. NGO's have urged them to evolve; however the traditional system of institutionalizing these children is still in place. Thirdly, liberal democracies do not have the support from its political system in order to take care of these children, even though they have the resources. Finally, social democracies are the most advanced governments in regards to their foster care system. These governments have a massive infrastructure, funding, and support system in order to help foster care children.<ref>George, S, N van Oudenhoven, and R Wazir. \"Foster Care Beyond The Crossroads: Lessons From An International Comparative Analysis.\" Childhood 10.3 (2003): 343\u2013361.

The all-boys' school was originally housed in only one building, which is now the sixth form block known as \"The Curtis Centre\". In 1961, the school became known as '''Chesham Technical High School''' and during the 1960s, there was huge development in the area, and it became a co-educational grammar school. In 1970, the school changed its name to '''Chesham High School''' as it moved away from its technical roots. The name of the school changed to '''Chesham Grammar School''' on 7 May 2010. As a grammar school, CGS underwent expansion and experienced an improvement in exam results. The school was rated outstanding in all categories by OFSTED in March 2014.\n\n===Headteachers<ref>Chesham High School 60th anniversary guide book, 2007</ref>===\n*Sidney Chapman (1947\u20131966)\n*Paddy Evans (1966\u20131967)\n*Ken Stokes (1967\u20131992)\n*Tim Andrew (1992\u20132007)\n*Nigel Fox (2005\u20132006) <small>(acting during Tim Andrew's sabbatical)</small>\n*Philip Wayne (2007\u20132015)\n*Annmarie McNaney (2015\u2013present)\n\n===Facilities===\nBetween 1980 and 2010, there was major expansion of the school, including a new maths block, a textiles block, an art block, expansion of the English block, a new library and a new drama/psychology block. In 2015, the sixth form centre, located in the original building, was expanded and reopened as the Curtis Centre. \n\n==Admissions and school performance==\nAdmission to the school is brokered through [[Buckinghamshire County Council]], which operates a selective secondary education system throughout the county.

In 2007 the [[Department for Education]] awarded the school [[specialist school]] status as a [[Humanities College]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Specialist Schools Home \n |publisher=Department for Children, Schools and Families \n |date=2007-07-03 \n |url=http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/specialistschools/ \n |accessdate=2007-08-07 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060803055309/http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/specialistschools/ \n |archivedate=2006-08-03 \n}}</ref> In August 2011 the school became an [[Academy (English school)|Academy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Open academies map and schools submitting applications|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/academies/a0069811/open-academies-map-and-schools-submitting-applications|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe school was founded in 1947 as the '''Chesham Technical School''' - a result of the [[Education Act 1944]] which set up the tripartite arrangements of grammar, [[secondary technical school|technical]] and [[secondary modern]] schools. The all-boys' school was originally housed in only one building, which is now the sixth form block known as \"The Curtis Centre\". In 1961, the school became known as '''Chesham Technical High School''' and during the 1960s, there was huge development in the area, and it became a co-educational grammar school. In 1970, the school changed its name to '''Chesham High School''' as it moved away from its technical roots. The name of the school changed to '''Chesham Grammar School''' on 7 May 2010. As as a grammar school, CGS underwent expansion and experienced an improvement in exam results. The school was rated outstanding in all categories by OFSTED in March 2014.\n\n===Headteachers<ref>Chesham High School 60th anniversary guide book, 2007</ref>===\n*Sidney Chapman (1947\u20131966)\n*Paddy Evans (1966\u20131967)\n*Ken Stokes (1967\u20131992)\n*Tim Andrew (1992\u20132007)\n*Nigel Fox (2005\u20132006) <small>(acting during Tim Andrew's sabbatical)</small>\n*Philip Wayne (2007\u20132015)\n*Annmarie McNaney (2015\u2013present)\n\n===Facilities===\nBetween 1980 and 2010, there was major expansion of the school, including a new maths block, a textiles block, an art block, expansion of the English block, a new library and a new drama/psychology block. In 2015, the sixth form centre, located in the original building, was expanded and reopened as the Curtis Centre. \n\n==Admissions and school performance==\nAdmission to the school is brokered through [[Buckinghamshire County Council]], which operates a selective secondary education system throughout the county. Pupils have to achieve a mark of 121 or above in the [[Eleven-plus exam|11-plus]] to be eligible to attend the school. The school's catchment area broadly covers the whole of [[Chiltern District]] area which includes the towns of [[Amersham]], [[Chalfont St Giles]], [[Chalfont St Peter]] and [[Chesham]], and larger villages such as [[Great Missenden]] and [[Little Chalfont]].<ref>[http://www.buckscc.gov.uk/media/134565/Boys_Grammar_Catchments_2013.pdf Bucks CC School catchment Area]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Retrieved 31 May 2013</ref>  A significant proportion of the intake also comes from Hertfordshire.
