Two of the more prominent sites surviving from this time are the [[petroglyph]]s at [[Petroglyphs Provincial Park]] and [[Serpent Mounds Park|Serpent Mounds]]. The petroglyphs are located northeast of Peterborough and are believed to have been carved by the [[Algonquin people]] between 900 and 1400 CE.

The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219. Print</ref>\n\nRobinson was urged by landlords to remove the \"pauper and undesirables\". He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish...to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character...but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming...I found them much more intelligent than I expected. Most of them could read and write'\".<ref>Mackay, Donald, Flight from Famine : The Coming of the Irish to Canada (Toronto : McClelland & Stewart, 1992/ Reissued, Toronto : Dundurn, 2009), 59</ref>\n\nThomas Poole, a nineteenth century writer, wrote that all 2024 passengers boarded nine ships in June 1825, with everything they owned, from Cork across the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec City. The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was

The opening ceremonies were held on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web | url = http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128\n| title = Film crew jumps around the city\n|website = mykawartha.com\n|date = September 5, 2006\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]]. This is due in part to Peterborough's central location in a valley. Peterborough is also home to a single television station, [[CHEX-DT]], which is the local [[Global Television Network|Global]] O&O; as well as [[TVCogeco]], a local cable television channel operated by [[Cogeco]] Cable. Peterborough has two main newspapers, the ''[[Peterborough Examiner]]'', which publishes six days a week except Sunday; and ''[[Peterborough This Week]]'', which publishes every Wednesday and Friday. A non-political publication called SNAP Peterborough is published monthly with sections for home, business, sporting events, etc. with a main focus on providing friendly and photographic news.<ref>{{cite web |title=snapd Peterborough |url=https://peterborough.snapd.com/ |publisher=snapd Inc. |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Sister cities==\n\n* {{flag|United States}} [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] since 1983.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Peterborough, Ontario}}\n<!-- Other than the 3 people mentioned below, individuals should not be listed here, but rather in List of people from Peterborough, Ontario -->\n[[Sir Sandford Fleming]] originally came to the town in the late 1840s with his first impression finding it to be \"rather a poor little place\".<ref name=\"cheekyfleming\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/history/material_culture/sfaulkne/arch.htm\n |title        = Diaries of Sir Sandford Fleming\n |date         = June 17, 1845\n |accessdate   = December 8, 2008\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090209065123/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/history/material_culture/sfaulkne/arch.htm\n |archive-date = February 9, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> However, since, there have been a number of people of note, including athletes, musicians, authors and more who made Peterborough their home.

The following year he began construction of a sawmill and gristmill, establishing the area as Scott's Plains. The mill was located at the foot of present-day King Street and was powered by water from Jackson Creek. This location, adjacent to the Ontario government Ministry of Natural Resources building, and Peterborough's Millennium Park may have been the site of landfall for a portage which connects in a direct line with Bridgenorth. The site has an Ojibway name \"Nogojiwanong\" which means \"the place at the end of the rapids\".\n[[File:Cox Terrace Peterborough Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Cox Terrace on Rubidge Street, built in 1884 and declared a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1991]]\n\nThe year 1825 marked the arrival of [[Irish Immigrants|Irish immigrants]] from the city of Cork to Scott's Plains. In 1822, the British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish Catholic families to [[Upper Canada]].\n\nPeter Robinson, a member of the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada and a prominent businessman from York, Upper Canada was the man who took on the emigration plan of 1825. Scott's Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour. Robinson interviewed families and individual males to make the long voyage. These families had to meet specific criteria in order to be eligible for the voyage. The specifics required for Robinson's settlers were that they had to be Catholic, poor and with a knowledge of farming. Males had to be less than forty-five years of age and in good health and families were unrelated. The majority of the Irish emigrants were chosen from Fermoy, North Cork.<ref>Mannion, John. ''Irish settlements in Eastern Canada: a study of cultural transfer and adaptation''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1974. 219.

He resisted and stated that he had \"no wish...to hold out a bounty to persons of bad character...but as Robinson travelled through the countryside they became flesh and blood 'people of a good sort' he called them, 'bred to farming...I found them much more intelligent than I expected.

The journey took 30 days to cross the Atlantic and on board the ship they were provided with bunks and food rations. Hard tack or ship biscuits were one of the many foods that were made to provide energy for the passengers. Hard tack was very easy to make and could be stored for months without spoiling. After the settlers landed in Quebec City they travelled further down the St-Lawrence River eventually reaching Lachine where they boarded a bateau. Heading west to Kingston and ultimately to Kingston and Cobourg. They camped in tents in Cobourg for several weeks until Peter Robinson joined them to lead them up to their final destination. The long voyage across the ocean was enough to weaken the emigrants but having to camp out in tents in the mid-summer heat brought on several other complications. Nearly all of the settlers experienced fever and ague, and several perished from it. Even faced with these hardships they forged ahead and put their trust in Peter Robinson, the man leading them to their settlement in Peterborough.<ref>Poole, Thomas W, A Sketch of the Early Settlements and Subsequent Progress of the Town of Peterborough: Peterborough, C.W., 1867, 3&ndash;4.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, [[Sandford Fleming]], inventor of [[Standard Time]] and designer of Canada's first postage stamp, moved to the city to live with Dr. John Hutchison and his family, staying until 1847. Dr. Hutchison was one of Peterborough's first resident doctors.\n\nBy 1846, the community was flourishing, with a population of about 2000. A stone jail and court house had been built and there were seven churches and various government offices. There was a fire company, two newspapers and a post office that received mail daily. Industry included  two grist mills, two saw mills, one brewery, one ashery, two distilleries, three foundries, three tanneries and tradesmen of various types worked here.

The [[Peterborough Canoe Company]] was founded in 1893, with the factory being built on the site of the original Adam Scott mill. By 1930, 25% of all employees in the boat-building industry in Canada worked in the Peterborough area.<ref name=\"1930boatemployee\">{{cite web | url = http://www.peterboroughmuseumandarchives.ca/canoe.htm| title=A History of Peterborough's Canoe Industry | work = Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives\n|year = 1997\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\nPeterborough would also see extensive industrial growth as one of the first places in the country to begin generating hydro-electrical power (even before the plants at [[Niagara Falls]]). Companies like [[Edison General Electric Company]] (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become [[Quaker Oats]], and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.\n\n===20th century and onwards===\n[[Image:PeterboroughLiftLock23.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Peterborough Lift Lock]], constructed in 1904]]\nThe first major events of the 20th century in Peterborough occurred in 1904. The first occurrence was the completion of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]] on July 9, eight years after construction was initially approved. To this day, many landmarks in Peterborough memorialize [[Richard Birdsall Rogers|Richard Rogers]], conceptual father of the Lift Lock, such as Rogers Cove on [[Little Lake (Peterborough)|Little Lake]] and Rogers Street in the eastern part of the city.\n\nIn 1905, Peterborough was incorporated as a city on [[Dominion Day]], with a population of about 14,300.{{Citation needed|reason=Where is this verified?|date=November 2018}} The city's [[Flag of Peterborough, Ontario|flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Peterborough|coat of arms]] were adopted later, in 1951.{{Citation needed|reason=What is your source?|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn the 1970s, the Ontario Government helped sponsor the building of Peterborough Square with the aid of the Ontario Downtown Renewal Programme (ODRP). The mall was anchored by an [[Eaton's]] store until the collapse of the Eaton's chain of stores in the late 1990s; it now houses offices, stores and a food court. The provincial government relocated the central office of the [[Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario)|Ministry of Natural Resources]] to 300 Water Street,{{Year needed|date=November 2019}} kitty corner from Peterborough Square. In 2008, a new regional hospital officially opened in Peterborough.\n\n==Geography==\nPeterborough is situated in [[Central Ontario]] within the [[Kawartha Lakes]] region. Peterborough lies in the [[St. Lawrence Lowlands]] [[ecoregion]], just south of the [[Canadian Shield]] and approximately 35 kilometres north of Lake Ontario. The city is sited on a series of rapids in the [[Otonabee River]], approximately halfway between the river's source ([[Katchewanooka Lake]]) and its mouth ([[Rice Lake (Ontario)|Rice Lake]]). The City completely surrounds the only lake on the Otonabee, Little Lake, and the [[Trent Canal]] runs along the eastern edge of the city, connecting Little Lake to a section of the Otonabee above the rapids.\n\n===Topography===\n\nPeterborough's topography is largely defined by land formations created by the receding [[Wisconsian]] glaciers 10,000\u201315,000 years ago. The South End and Downtown portions of the City sit on what was the bottom of the glacial Lake Peterborough\u2014part of a glacial spillway created when glacial meltwaters from ancient Lake Algonquin (now [[Lake Huron]]) travelled south to ancient Lake Iroquois (now [[Lake Ontario]]). This area of relatively low and flat relief (approximately {{convert|191|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level) is prone to flooding, exemplified in the major flood that occurred on July 15, 2004. The ground elevation rises to the west, north, and east where a large upland area (the Peterborough [[Drumlin]] field) defines the landscape. Much of the land in the North and West Ends of the City rises to {{convert|230|\u2013|274|m|ft}} above sea level, with Tower Hill, at {{convert|286|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, being the highest point in the City. Armour Hill, another prominent drumlin located in East City, forms the physical obstacle that the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]] ascends by way of the [[Peterborough Lift Lock]]. The [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] is located approximately 15 kilometres south of the city.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPeterborough has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') with four distinct seasons. It lies in a transitional zone between areas to the south, which have a milder winter climate, and areas to the north (within the Canadian Shield), where the winters are snowier and sharply colder. Peterborough's [[Hardiness zone]] is 5b.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-ontario-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php|title=Ontario Interactive Plant Hardiness Zone Map|website=www.plantmaps.com}}</ref> Peterborough's climate can be quite unpredictable and vary greatly from one part of the City to another due to the effects of the Oak Ridges Moraine and changes in elevation. In the South End and areas south of the City, the Moraine acts as a barrier for weather patterns moving off Lake Ontario, reducing precipitation. In the North and West Ends of Peterborough the effects of the Moraine are not as prominent, at times creating slightly cooler temperatures and more precipitation than the more southern parts of the City and County.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Peterborough was {{convert|102|F|1}} on July 11, 1936.<ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was

In 2005, the Peterborough Sport & Wellness Centre was constructed to accommodate the college's athletic needs.\n\nMcRae Campus was located in a renovated [[textile]] mill located on McDonnel Street near Monaghan Road. Formerly the School of Continuing Education and Skilled Trades, the campus closed in 2014 when the Kawartha Trades and Technology Centre opened on the Sutherland Campus.\n\nThe college also operates satellite campuses in nearby [[Lindsay, Ontario|Lindsay]], [[Cobourg]] and [[Dysart et al, Ontario|Haliburton]].\n\n====Kawartha Lakes Bible College====\n{{Main|Kawartha Lakes Bible College}}\nKawartha Lakes Bible College (KLBC) is a small evangelical Bible college affiliated with the [[Brethren Movement|Plymouth Brethren]]. The school opened in 1973, and moved to its current location in 2001.\n\n====Master's College and Seminary====\n{{Main|Master's College and Seminary}}\nMaster's College and Seminary is a Pentecostal Christian institution of higher education that consists of an on campus Bible College, a church-based Seminary, and a global distance education program. The school has partnerships with Trent University and [[Tyndale University College and Seminary]] of Toronto.\n\n===Public library system===\n[[Image:Peterborough Public Library, Ontario.jpg|thumb|left|Peterborough's main library]]\nThe Peterborough Mechanics Institute, established in 1868, housed a subscription library that allowed members who paid a fee to borrow books. Mechanics Institutes were established across Ontario to make education universal and accessible to all citizens. In Peterborough, the Institute and the Library were located on Water Street. In May 1895, the Mechanics Institute became the Peterborough Public Library. The library remained on Water Street.\n\nLater, the [[Peterborough Public Library]] received funding from the Andrew Carnegie Foundation and the new Carnegie Library located on George Street opened in 1911. This building is currently the Carnegie Wing of City Hall.\n\nIn February 1949, a branch library opened in the south end of Peterborough. It was situated above a hardware store and was a room measuring 50 by 20 feet. It was divided into two sections\u2014one for children, the other for adults.\n\nThe DelaFosse Branch Library opened officially on December 1, 1965. The Peterborough Examiner declared that this branch at 729 Park Street S., made \"south end residents the envy of the rest of the city.\" Currently, it holds a recreational reading collection of approximately 14,000 hardcover and paperback books for all ages. Recent additions to the collection include a variety of multimedia including CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMs and CD audio books. This branch library is named in honour of Frederick Montague de la Fosse, who was the Chief Librarian of Peterborough Public Library from 1910 to 1946.\n\nThe Main Library at 345 Aylmer Street N. opened on September 2, 1980. The new library was built on the site of the old fire hall and had about triple the floor space of the old Carnegie building. The opening ceremonies were on September 17 and featured Dr. Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College, University of Toronto, as the keynote speaker.\n\nThe Main Library is a full-service library with a well-stocked current circulating collection of books, CD audio books, CD-Music, DVDs and magazines. In addition to encyclopedias and dictionaries, the Reference Collection includes a local history collection, government documents, electronic resources and microforms selected to answer the information needs of the community. The Main Library was used in the filming of the 2008 American science fiction film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.<ref name=\"jumper\">\n{{cite web | url = http://www.mykawartha.com/news/article/4128\n| title = Film crew jumps around the city\n|website = mykawartha.com\n|date = September 5, 2006\n|accessdate = December 8, 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Peterborough, Ontario}}\n\nPeterborough is home to a disproportionately large number of radio stations compared to centres closer to [[Toronto]]. This is due in part to Peterborough's central location in a valley. Peterborough is also home to a single television station, [[CHEX-DT]], which is the local [[Global Television Network|Global]] O&O; as well as [[TVCogeco]], a local cable television channel operated by [[Cogeco]] Cable. Peterborough has two main newspapers, the ''[[Peterborough Examiner]]'', which publishes six days a week except Sunday; and ''[[Peterborough This Week]]'', which publishes every Wednesday and Friday. A non-political publication called SNAP Peterborough is published monthly with sections for home, business, sporting events, etc. with a main focus on providing friendly and photographic news.<ref>{{cite web |title=snapd Peterborough |url=https://peterborough.snapd.com/ |publisher=snapd Inc. |accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Sister cities==\n\n* {{flag|United States}} [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] since 1983.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Peterborough, Ontario}}\n<!-- Other than the 3 people mentioned below, individuals should not be listed here, but rather in List of people from Peterborough, Ontario -->\n[[Sir Sandford Fleming]] originally came to the town in the late 1840s with his first impression finding it to be \"rather a poor little place\".<ref name=\"cheekyfleming\">{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/history/material_culture/sfaulkne/arch.htm\n |title        = Diaries of Sir Sandford Fleming\n |date         = June 17, 1845\n |accessdate   = December 8, 2008\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090209065123/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/history/material_culture/sfaulkne/arch.htm\n |archive-date = February 9, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref> However, since, there have been a number of people of note, including athletes, musicians, authors and more who made Peterborough their home.

{"title_page": "History of Antigua and Barbuda", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\nThe '''history of [[Antigua and Barbuda]]''' can be separated into three distinct eras. In the first, the islands were inhabited by three successive [[Amerindian]] societies. The islands were neglected by the first wave of European colonisation, but were settled by [[Kingdom of England|England]] in 1632. Under British control, the islands witnessed an influx of both Britons and African [[slavery|slaves]]. In 1981, the islands were granted independence as the modern state of Antigua and Barbuda.\n\n==Pre-Columbian settlements (2900 BC\u201317th century) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[Antigua]] was first settled by [[hunter-gatherer|pre-agricultural]] Amerindians known as \"Archaic People\" (although they are commonly, but erroneously known in Antigua as [[Ciboney|Siboney]], a pre-ceramic Cuban people). The earliest settlements on the island date to 2900&nbsp;BC. They were succeeded by [[ceramic]]-using agriculturalist [[Saladoid]] people who migrated up the island chain from [[Venezuela]]. They were later replaced by [[Arawakan]] speakers around 1200&nbsp;AD and around 1500 by [[Island Caribs]].\n\nThe Arawaks were the first well-documented group of Antiguans. They paddled to the island by canoe (piragua) from Venezuela, and were ejected by the Caribs\u2014another people indigenous to the area. Arawaks introduced agriculture to Antigua and Barbuda, raising, among other crops, the famous Antiguan \"black\" pineapple. They also cultivated various other foods including:\n* corn\n* sweet potatoes (white with firmer flesh than the bright orange \"sweet potato\" used in the United States)\n* chiles\n* guava\n* tobacco\n* cotton\n \nSome of the vegetables listed, such as corn and sweet potatoes, still play an important role in Antiguan cuisine.\n\nFor example, a popular Antiguan dish, Ducuna (DOO-koo-NAH), is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. In addition, one of the Antiguan staple foods, fungee (FOON-ji), is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water.\n\nThe bulk of the Arawaks left Antigua about 1100&nbsp;AD. Those who remained were subsequently raided by the Caribs. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the Caribs' superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most Arawak nations in the West Indies\u2014enslaving some and cannibalising others.\n\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia does make it clear that the Spanish explorers had some difficulty identifying and differentiating between the various native peoples they encountered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} As a result, the number and types of ethnic-tribal-national groups in existence at the time may be much more varied and numerous than the two mentioned.\n\nAccording to ''A Brief History of the Caribbean'' (Jan Rogozinski, Penguin Putnam, Inc September 2000), European and African diseases, malnutrition and slavery eventually destroyed the vast majority of the Caribbean's native population. No researcher has conclusively proven any of these causes as the real reason for the destruction of West Indian natives. Some historians believe that the psychological stress of slavery may also have played a part in the massive number of native deaths while in servitude. Others believe that the reportedly abundant, but starchy, low-protein diet may have contributed to severe malnutrition of the \"Indians\" who were used to a diet fortified with protein from sea-life.\n\nThe Indigenous West Indians made sea vessels that they used to sail the Atlantic and Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and Arawaks populated much of South American and the Caribbean Islands. Relatives of the Antiguan Arawaks and Caribs still live in various countries in South America, notably Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. The smaller remaining native populations in the West Indies maintain a pride in their heritage.\n\n==European Colonization (1632\u20131981) ==\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Leeward Islands|West Indies Federation}}\n\n[[Christopher Columbus]] sighted islands in 1493 during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]] naming the larger one ''Santa Maria de la Antigua''. However, early attempts by Europeans to settle the islands failed due to the Caribs' excellent defenses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} England succeeded in colonising the islands in 1632, with [[Sir Thomas Warner (explorer)|Thomas Warner]] as the first governor. Settlers raised tobacco, [[indigo]], [[ginger]] and [[sugarcane]] as cash crops. [[Christopher Codrington|Sir Christopher Codrington]] established the first large sugar estate in Antigua in 1674, and leased [[Barbuda]] to raise provisions for his plantations. [[Codrington, Barbuda|Barbuda's only town]] is named after him. In the fifty years after Codrington established his initial plantation, the sugar industry became so profitable that many farmers replaced other crops with sugar, making it the economic backbone of the islands.\n\nSlavery was common in Barbuda in the 1700s and until 1834.<ref>Crocker, John. \"Barbuda Eyes Statehood and Tourists\".

Several slave rebellions took place on the island, with the most serious in 1834\u20135.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.barbudaful.net/barbudaful-history.html | title=History | publisher=Barbudaful | accessdate=5 January 2019 }}</ref> Britain emancipated slaves in most of its colonies in 1834, but that did not include Barbuda, so the island then freed its own slaves. For some years thereafter, the freed slaves had little opportunity of survival on their own because of limited agricultural land and the lack of available credit to buy some. Hence, they continued to work on the plantations for nominal wages or lived in shantytowns and worked as occasional labourers.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Sugar cane production remained the primary economy for over a century.<ref name=\"Leonard2005\"/>\n\nDuring the 18th century, Antigua was used as the headquarters of the British [[Royal Navy]] Caribbean fleet. English Harbour Dockyard, as it came to be called, a sheltered and well-protected deepwater port, was the main base and facilities there were greatly expanded during the later 18th century. Admiral [[Lord Horatio Nelson]] commanded the British fleet for much of this time, and made himself unpopular with local merchants by enforcing the [[Navigation Act]], a British ruling that only British-registered ships could trade with British colonies. As the United States were no longer British colonies, the act posed a problem for merchants, who depended on trade with the fledgling country.\n\n=== Political development  ===\n[[File:Antigua 8 Cent Stamp 1953.jpg|thumb|190px|Postage stamp with portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], 1953]]\nWith all others in the [[British Empire]], Antiguan slaves were [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipated]] in 1834, but remained economically dependent upon the plantation owners. Economic opportunities for the new freedmen were limited by a lack of surplus farming land, no access to credit and an economy built on agriculture rather than manufacturing. Poor labour conditions persisted until 1939 when a member of a royal commission urged the formation of a trade union movement.<ref name=\"Leonard2005\"/>\n\nThe [[Antigua Trades and Labour Union]], formed shortly afterward, became the political vehicle for [[Vere Cornwall Bird]] who became the union's president in 1943. The [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP), formed by Bird and other trade unionists, first ran candidates in the 1946 elections and became the majority party in 1951 beginning a long history of electoral victories.\n\nVoted out of office in the 1971 general elections that swept the progressive labour movement into power, Bird and the ALP returned to office in 1976.\n\n=== Economic development in Antigua from colonial times leading up to independence ===\n\nWhen the Europeans came to Antigua, much like they did in America, they began a plantation system. As the main cash crop changed over the years, the main cash crops/products grown between 1953 and 1956 were cotton, sugar, meat, cereals, and local fruits and vegetables <ref>{{cite journal |last1=O\u2019Loughlin |first1=Carleen |title=The Economy of Antigua |journal=Social and Economic Studies |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=229\u2013264 |publisher=University of a West Indies & Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies |jstor=27851220 |year=1959 }}</ref>. Overtime, the importance of crops and produce went into decline as other nations were able to sell goods at a price no longer feasible to sustain in the Antiguan economy. In more recent times, however, Antigua has developed a primarily service-based economy relying on tourism as their leading source of income <ref>{{cite web |last1=Coleman |first1=Denise |title=Antigua: Economic Overview |url=www.countrywatch.com/intelligence/cwtopic?type=text&countryid=6&topic=APCRD&global=true |website=Country Watch |accessdate=October 23, 2019}}</ref>. Much like other islands and nations that rely on tourism, this can become problematic as their success depends on the willingness of others to travel and explore the area. Moreover, this can tend to follow a seasonal pattern leaving the country vulnerable at certain times in the year.\n\n===Ethnicity and social class===\nBehind the late 20th century reviving and re-specifying of the place of African-Antiguans and Barbudans in the cultural life of the society, is a history of race/ethnic relations that systematically excluded them. A colonial framework was established by the English soon after their initial settlement of Antigua in 1623.\n\nMixed-race relationships and later immigration resulted by the late 19th century in the emergence of five distinct and carefully ranked race/ethnic groups. Among themselves, there were divisions between British Antiguans and non-creolised British.\n\nImmediately below the British,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} were the [[mulattoes]], a mixed-race group resulting from unions between, generally, white European males and enslaved African women, many of which took place in the years before the expansion of enslaved African population. Mulattoes were lighter in shade than the masses of Africans. Some white fathers had their sons educated or trained in crafts. They sometimes benefited them in other ways, which led to the development of a separate class.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Mulattoes gradually distinguished themselves from the masses of enslaved Africans. They developed complex ideologies of shade to legitimate their claims to higher status.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} These ideologies of shade paralleled in many ways British ideologies of [[white supremacy]].{{original research inline|date=October 2013}}\n\nNext in this hierarchy were the Portuguese{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\u2014 2500 of whom migrated as workers from Madeira between 1847 and 1852 because of a severe famine. Many established small businesses and joined the ranks of what was by then the mulatto middle class. The British never really considered Portuguese as their equals,{{original research inline|date=October 2013}} so they were not allowed into their ranks.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Among Portuguese Antiguans and Barbudans, status differences move along a continuum of varying degrees of assimilation into the Anglicised practices of the dominant group.{{original research inline|date=October 2013}}\n\nBelow the Portuguese were the Middle Easterners,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} who began migrating to Antigua and Barbuda around the turn of the 20th century. Starting as itinerant traders, they soon worked their way into the middle strata of the society.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Although Middle Easterners came from a variety of areas in the Middle East, as a group they are usually referred to as Syrians.\n\nThe Irish were first sent to the island as indentured and unpaid servants by Oliver Cromwell during the early to mid 17th century. They were treated harshly and had to live in depraved conditions. Many of Irish died from severe sunstroke and sickness and those who survived lived in extreme poverty. Irish Indentured servant were replaced by African slaves in the mid to late 17th century as they were more suited to working in the sun and heat. The Irish were used by the British as a buffer group between them and the African slaves and became overseers on sugar plantations on the island. Many of the Irish had children with the Africans, which is why many Antiguans and Barbudans have Irish surnames to this day.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSixth and finally were the African-Antiguans and Barbudans who were located at the bottom of this hierarchy.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Enslaved and forcefully transported, Africans started arriving in Antigua and Barbuda in large numbers during the 1670s.

In the first, the islands were inhabited by three successive [[Amerindian]] societies. The islands were neglected by the first wave of European colonisation, but were settled by [[Kingdom of England|England]] in 1632. Under British control, the islands witnessed an influx of both Britons and African [[slavery|slaves]]. In 1981, the islands were granted independence as the modern state of Antigua and Barbuda.\n\n==Pre-Columbian settlements (2900 BC\u201317th century) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[Antigua]] was first settled by [[hunter-gatherer|pre-agricultural]] Amerindians known as \"Archaic People\" (although they are commonly, but erroneously known in Antigua as [[Ciboney|Siboney]], a pre-ceramic Cuban people). The earliest settlements on the island date to 2900&nbsp;BC. They were succeeded by [[ceramic]]-using agriculturalist [[Saladoid]] people who migrated up the island chain from [[Venezuela]]. They were later replaced by [[Arawakan]] speakers around 1200&nbsp;AD and around 1500 by [[Island Caribs]].\n\nThe Arawaks were the first well-documented group of Antiguans. They paddled to the island by canoe (piragua) from Venezuela, and were ejected by the Caribs\u2014another people indigenous to the area. Arawaks introduced agriculture to Antigua and Barbuda, raising, among other crops, the famous Antiguan \"black\" pineapple. They also cultivated various other foods including:\n* corn\n* sweet potatoes (white with firmer flesh than the bright orange \"sweet potato\" used in the United States)\n* chiles\n* guava\n* tobacco\n* cotton\n \nSome of the vegetables listed, such as corn and sweet potatoes, still play an important role in Antiguan cuisine.\n\nFor example, a popular Antiguan dish, Ducuna (DOO-koo-NAH), is a sweet, steamed dumpling made from grated sweet potatoes, flour and spices. In addition, one of the Antiguan staple foods, fungee (FOON-ji), is a cooked paste made of cornmeal and water.\n\nThe bulk of the Arawaks left Antigua about 1100&nbsp;AD. Those who remained were subsequently raided by the Caribs. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the Caribs' superior weapons and seafaring prowess allowed them to defeat most Arawak nations in the West Indies\u2014enslaving some and cannibalising others.\n\nThe Catholic Encyclopedia does make it clear that the Spanish explorers had some difficulty identifying and differentiating between the various native peoples they encountered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} As a result, the number and types of ethnic-tribal-national groups in existence at the time may be much more varied and numerous than the two mentioned.\n\nAccording to ''A Brief History of the Caribbean'' (Jan Rogozinski, Penguin Putnam, Inc September 2000), European and African diseases, malnutrition and slavery eventually destroyed the vast majority of the Caribbean's native population. No researcher has conclusively proven any of these causes as the real reason for the destruction of West Indian natives. Some historians believe that the psychological stress of slavery may also have played a part in the massive number of native deaths while in servitude. Others believe that the reportedly abundant, but starchy, low-protein diet may have contributed to severe malnutrition of the \"Indians\" who were used to a diet fortified with protein from sea-life.\n\nThe Indigenous West Indians made sea vessels that they used to sail the Atlantic and Caribbean. As a result, Caribs and Arawaks populated much of South American and the Caribbean Islands. Relatives of the Antiguan Arawaks and Caribs still live in various countries in South America, notably Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia. The smaller remaining native populations in the West Indies maintain a pride in their heritage.\n\n==European Colonization (1632\u20131981) ==\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Leeward Islands|West Indies Federation}}\n\n[[Christopher Columbus]] sighted islands in 1493 during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]] naming the larger one ''Santa Maria de la Antigua''. However, early attempts by Europeans to settle the islands failed due to the Caribs' excellent defenses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} England succeeded in colonising the islands in 1632, with [[Sir Thomas Warner (explorer)|Thomas Warner]] as the first governor. Settlers raised tobacco, [[indigo]], [[ginger]] and [[sugarcane]] as cash crops. [[Christopher Codrington|Sir Christopher Codrington]] established the first large sugar estate in Antigua in 1674, and leased [[Barbuda]] to raise provisions for his plantations. [[Codrington, Barbuda|Barbuda's only town]] is named after him. In the fifty years after Codrington established his initial plantation, the sugar industry became so profitable that many farmers replaced other crops with sugar, making it the economic backbone of the islands.\n\nSlavery was common in Barbuda in the 1700s and until 1834.<ref>Crocker, John. \"Barbuda Eyes Statehood and Tourists\".

Several slave rebellions took place on the island, with the most serious in 1834-5.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.barbudaful.net/barbudaful-history.html | title=History | publisher=Barbudaful | accessdate=5 January 2019 }}</ref> Britain emancipated slaves in most of its colonies in 1834, but that did not include Barbuda, so the island then freed its own slaves. For some years thereafter, the freed slaves had little opportunity of survival on their own because of limited agricultural land and the lack of available credit to buy some. Hence, they continued to work on the plantations for nominal wages or lived in shantytowns and worked as occasional labourers.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Sugar cane production remained the primary economy for over a century.<ref name=\"Leonard2005\"/>\n\nDuring the 18th century, Antigua was used as the headquarters of the British [[Royal Navy]] Caribbean fleet. English Harbour Dockyard, as it came to be called, a sheltered and well-protected deepwater port, was the main base and facilities there were greatly expanded during the later 18th century. Admiral [[Lord Horatio Nelson]] commanded the British fleet for much of this time, and made himself unpopular with local merchants by enforcing the [[Navigation Act]], a British ruling that only British-registered ships could trade with British colonies. As the United States were no longer British colonies, the act posed a problem for merchants, who depended on trade with the fledgling country.\n\n=== Political development  ===\n[[File:Antigua 8 Cent Stamp 1953.jpg|thumb|190px|Postage stamp with portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], 1953]]\nWith all others in the [[British Empire]], Antiguan slaves were [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipated]] in 1834, but remained economically dependent upon the plantation owners. Economic opportunities for the new freedmen were limited by a lack of surplus farming land, no access to credit and an economy built on agriculture rather than manufacturing. Poor labour conditions persisted until 1939 when a member of a royal commission urged the formation of a trade union movement.<ref name=\"Leonard2005\"/>\n\nThe [[Antigua Trades and Labour Union]], formed shortly afterward, became the political vehicle for [[Vere Cornwall Bird]] who became the union's president in 1943. The [[Antigua Labour Party]] (ALP), formed by Bird and other trade unionists, first ran candidates in the 1946 elections and became the majority party in 1951 beginning a long history of electoral victories.\n\nVoted out of office in the 1971 general elections that swept the progressive labour movement into power, Bird and the ALP returned to office in 1976.\n\n=== Economic development in Antigua from colonial times leading up to independence ===\n\nWhen the Europeans came to Antigua, much like they did in America, they began a plantation system. As the main cash crop changed over the years, the main cash crops/products grown between 1953 and 1956 were cotton, sugar, meat, cereals, and local fruits and vegetables <ref>{{cite journal |last1=O\u2019Loughlin |first1=Carleen |title=The Economy of Antigua |journal=Social and Economic Studies |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=229\u2013264 |publisher=University of a West Indies & Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies |jstor=27851220 |year=1959 }}</ref>. Overtime, the importance of crops and produce went into decline as other nations were able to sell goods at a price no longer feasible to sustain in the Antiguan economy. In more recent times, however, Antigua has developed a primarily service-based economy relying on tourism as their leading source of income <ref>{{cite web |last1=Coleman |first1=Denise |title=Antigua: Economic Overview |url=www.countrywatch.com/intelligence/cwtopic?type=text&countryid=6&topic=APCRD&global=true |website=Country Watch |accessdate=October 23, 2019}}</ref>. Much like other islands and nations that rely on tourism, this can become problematic as their success depends on the willingness of others to travel and explore the area. Moreover, this can tend to follow a seasonal pattern leaving the country vulnerable at certain times in the year.\n\n===Ethnicity and social class===\nBehind the late 20th century reviving and re-specifying of the place of African-Antiguans and Barbudans in the cultural life of the society, is a history of race/ethnic relations that systematically excluded them. A colonial framework was established by the English soon after their initial settlement of Antigua in 1623.\n\nMixed-race relationships and later immigration resulted by the late 19th century in the emergence of five distinct and carefully ranked race/ethnic groups. Among themselves, there were divisions between British Antiguans and non-creolised British.\n\nImmediately below the British,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} were the [[mulattoes]], a mixed-race group resulting from unions between, generally, white European males and enslaved African women, many of which took place in the years before the expansion of enslaved African population. Mulattoes were lighter in shade than the masses of Africans. Some white fathers had their sons educated or trained in crafts. They sometimes benefited them in other ways, which led to the development of a separate class.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Mulattoes gradually distinguished themselves from the masses of enslaved Africans. They developed complex ideologies of shade to legitimate their claims to higher status.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} These ideologies of shade paralleled in many ways British ideologies of [[white supremacy]].{{original research inline|date=October 2013}}\n\nNext in this hierarchy were the Portuguese{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\u2014 2500 of whom migrated as workers from Madeira between 1847 and 1852 because of a severe famine. Many established small businesses and joined the ranks of what was by then the mulatto middle class. The British never really considered Portuguese as their equals,{{original research inline|date=October 2013}} so they were not allowed into their ranks.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Among Portuguese Antiguans and Barbudans, status differences move along a continuum of varying degrees of assimilation into the Anglicised practices of the dominant group.{{original research inline|date=October 2013}}\n\nBelow the Portuguese were the Middle Easterners,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} who began migrating to Antigua and Barbuda around the turn of the 20th century. Starting as itinerant traders, they soon worked their way into the middle strata of the society.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Although Middle Easterners came from a variety of areas in the Middle East, as a group they are usually referred to as Syrians.\n\nThe Irish were first sent to the island as indentured and unpaid servants by Oliver Cromwell during the early to mid 17th century. They were treated harshly and had to live in depraved conditions. Many of Irish died from severe sunstroke and sickness and those who survived lived in extreme poverty. Irish Indentured servant were replaced by African slaves in the mid to late 17th century as they were more suited to working in the sun and heat. The Irish were used by the British as a buffer group between them and the African slaves and became overseers on sugar plantations on the island. Many of the Irish had children with the Africans, which is why many Antiguans and Barbudans have Irish surnames to this day.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nSixth and finally were the African-Antiguans and Barbudans who were located at the bottom of this hierarchy.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Enslaved and forcefully transported, Africans started arriving in Antigua and Barbuda in large numbers during the 1670s. Very quickly they came to constitute the majority of the population. As they entered this hierarchy, Africans were profoundly [[racialised]]. They ceased being [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]], [[Ewe people|Ewe]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and became Negroes or blacks.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} In the 20th century, the colonial hierarchy gradually began to come apart as a result of universal education and better economic opportunity.{{original research inline|date=October 2013}} This process gave rise to Africans reaching the highest strata of society and government.\n\n==Independent Antigua and Barbuda (1981\u2013present) ==\n\nThe islands achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1981, becoming the nation of [[Antigua and Barbuda]]. However, it remains part of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and remains a [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] as [[Monarchy in Antigua and Barbuda|Queen of Antigua and Barbuda]].\n\nIn 1997, Prime Minister [[Lester Bird]] announced that a group of ecologically sensitive islands just off Antigua's northeastern coast, previously proposed for national park status, were being turned over to Malaysian developers. The Guiana Island Development Project deal, calling for a 1000-room hotel, an 18-hole golf course and a world-class casino, sparked widespread criticism by environmentalists, minority members in parliament and the press. The issue came to a head when a local resident shot the PM's brother. Today, the proposed development is mired in lawsuits and politics.\n\nThe ALP won renewed mandates in the general elections in 1984 and 1989.

The buses were part of an extensive test of [[hybrid technology]] that Edmonton Transit and the [[University of Alberta]]  conducted over a year. Bus [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], [[Performance engineering|performance]], maintenance costs, [[fuel efficiency]], noise generation and [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] were monitored and evaluated in all [[weather]] and road conditions. As well, customers were surveyed about their travel experience. Ultimately, the Hybrid buses only recorded fuel savings of 10-20% (in contrast to the 35% touted in the internal ads). In  addition, the ISE-New Flyer hybrids (6003 and 6004) were out of service so much that they could not be included in the evaluation.\n\nAs of fall 2009, only the two Orion hybrids are in service.  New Flyer/ISE hybrids 6003 and 6004 have been parked in the Paterson compound since the early spring, and have since been converted to diesel buses as of 2011, while New Flyer/Allison 6001 was damaged beyond repair in an accident.  New Flyer/Allison 6002 was revamped with new features and technology to become the ETS Platinum Bus, also referred to as the \"Painted Lady\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etspe.ca/special/etsplatinum-08/etsplatinum.php |title=Special Feature - ETS Platinum Bus 6002 |publisher=ETS Photo Express |date=8 November 2008 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Spring 2014, ETS unveiled a full electric bus for a four-month pilot program through October 2014.

Since then, two rounds of public consultations have been held at various locations around the city, and online surveys have taken feedback from riders. The public engagements have identified that transit riders would rather have to walk further to get to higher frequency routes, opposed to more routes operating less frequently. The city released a final draft of the new bus system in 2018, which cut back on routes with low ridership, and increased frequency in high traffic areas. After the redesign, all routes will be renumbered to make the system easier to navigate. New signage and materials will be created to assist in wayfinding. The redesign is scheduled to be rolled out in mid-2020.\n\n===Transit centres===\nThe preliminary engineering of a park-and-ride at 127 Street SW and Ellerslie Road SW is complete.

The buses were part of an extensive test of [[hybrid technology]] that Edmonton Transit and the [[University of Alberta]]  conducted over a year. Bus [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], [[Performance engineering|performance]], maintenance costs, [[fuel efficiency]], noise generation and [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]] were monitored and evaluated in all [[weather]] and road conditions. As well, customers were surveyed about their travel experience. Ultimately, the Hybrid buses only recorded fuel savings of 10-20% (in contrast to the 35% touted in the internal ads). In  addition, the ISE-New Flyer hybrids (6003 and 6004) were out of service so much that they could not be included in the evaluation.\n\nAs of fall 2009, only the two Orion hybrids are in service.  New Flyer/ISE hybrids 6003 and 6004 have been parked in the Paterson compound since the early spring, and have since been converted to diesel buses as of 2011, while New Flyer/Allison 6001 was damaged beyond repair in an accident.  New Flyer/Allison 6002 was revamped with new features and technology to become the ETS Platinum Bus, also referred to as the \"Painted Lady\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etspe.ca/special/etsplatinum-08/etsplatinum.php |title=Special Feature - ETS Platinum Bus 6002 |publisher=ETS Photo Express |date=8 November 2008 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn Spring 2014, ETS unveiled a full electric bus for a four-month pilot program through October 2014. The buses are referred to as \"ETS Stealth Buses\" and are on lease from [[BYD Company|Build Your Dreams (BYD) Co. Ltd.]]. The buses do not have a fare box at the moment, but instead are accepting customer surveys about electric buses as fare.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2014/06/05/edmonton-transit-gets-two-electric-buses |title=Edmonton transit gets two electric buses |work=Edmonton Sun |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate=31 August 2017}}</ref> Even without fare capacity the buses will be placed on several different routes around the city to give many Edmontonians the ability to experience the new exhaust-less bus. The current electric bus is not winterized, but if the city moves forward with the electric bus program they intend to acquire buses with full winter capabilities.\n\nIn 2019, Edmonton received the funding to purchase 50 electric buses from Proterra.

The public engagements have identified that transit riders would rather have to walk further to get to higher frequency routes, opposed to more routes operating less frequently. The city released a final draft of the new bus system in 2018, which cut back on routes with low ridership, and increased frequency in high traffic areas. After the redesign, all routes will be renumbered to make the system easier to navigate. New signage and materials will be created to assist in wayfinding.

L., ''Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period'' in JBL 98 (1979) pp. 45\u201365</ref> but the earliest occurrence of antisemitism has been the subject of debate among scholars, largely because different writers use different definitions of antisemitism. The terms \"[[religious antisemitism]]\" and \"anti-Judaism\" are sometimes used to refer to animosity towards Judaism as a religion rather than to Jews defined as an ethnic or racial group.\n\n===Roman Empire===\n[[File:Francesco Hayez 019.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Hayez]] depicting Roman destruction of Jerusalem]]\nRelations between the Jews in Judea and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were antagonistic from the very start and resulted in several [[Jewish-Roman wars|rebellions]]. It has been argued that European antisemitism has its roots in Roman policy.<ref>Martin Goodman, ''Rome and Jerusalem: the clash of ancient civilisations'', Allen Lane 2006.</ref>\n\nSeveral ancient historians report that in 19 CE the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled Jews from Rome. According to the Roman historian [[Suetonius]], Tiberius tried to suppress all foreign religions. In the case of Jews, he sent young Jewish men, under the pretence of military service, to provinces noted for their unhealthy climate. He dismissed all other Jews from the city, under threat of life slavery for non-compliance.<ref>Suetonius, ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', Vol 3, \"Tiberius\", Section 36</ref> [[Josephus]], in his ''Jewish Antiquities'',<ref>Josephus, ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'' (18.3.5)</ref> confirms that Tiberius ordered all Jews to be banished from Rome. Four thousand were sent to [[Sardinia]] but more, who were unwilling to become soldiers, were punished. [[Cassius Dio]] reports that Tiberius banished most of the Jews, who had been attempting to convert Romans to their religion.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', 57.18.5a.</ref> Philo of Alexandria reported that [[Sejanus]], one of Tiberius's lieutenants, may have been a prime mover in the persecution of the Jews.<ref>Philo of Alexandria. ''Against Flaccus''(1.1)</ref>\n\nThe Romans refused to permit Jews to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem after its [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)#Destruction of Jerusalem|destruction]] by [[Titus]] in 70 CE, imposed a tax on Jews ([[Fiscus Judaicus]]) at the same time, ostensibly to finance the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]] in Rome, and renamed [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] as [[Syria Palestina]]. The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] relates that, following [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] (132\u2013136 CE), the Romans destroyed very many Jews, \"killing until their horses were submerged in blood to their nostrils\".<ref>''The Jerusalem Talmud'', Taanis 4:5</ref> However, some historians argue that Rome brutally suppressed revolts in all its conquered territories and point out that Tiberius expelled all foreign religions from Rome, not just the Jews.\n\nSome accommodation, in fact, was later made with Judaism, and the Jews of the [[Diaspora]] had privileges that others did not. Unlike other subjects of the Roman Empire, they had the right to maintain their religion and were not expected to accommodate themselves to local customs. Even after the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], the Roman authorities refused to rescind Jewish privileges in some cities. And although [[Hadrian]] outlawed circumcision as a mutilation normally visited on people unable to consent, he later exempted the Jews.<ref>[[Clifford Ando]],''Times Literary Supplement'', 6 April 2007, pp. 6\u20137</ref> According to the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]], there was greater tolerance from about 160 CE.

Christian literature began to display extreme hostility towards Jews, which occasionally resulted in attacks and the burning of synagogues. This hostility was reflected in the edicts both of church councils and state laws. In the early 4th century, intermarriage between unconverted Jews and Christians was prohibited under the provisions of the [[Synod of Elvira]]. The [[Council of Antioch]] (341) prohibited Christians from celebrating Passover with the Jews while the [[Council of Laodicea]] forbade Christians from keeping the Jewish Sabbath.<ref>Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 34</ref> The Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]] instituted several laws concerning the Jews: they were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. The conversion of Christians to Judaism was outlawed. Religious services were regulated, congregations restricted, but Jews were allowed to enter Jerusalem on [[Tisha B'Av]], the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple.\n\nDiscrimination became worse in the 5th century. The edicts of the [[Codex Theodosianus]] (438) barred Jews from the civil service, the army and the legal profession.<ref>Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 34\u201335</ref> The Jewish Patriarchate was abolished and the scope of Jewish courts restricted. Synagogues were confiscated and old synagogues could be repaired only if they were in danger of collapse. Synagogues fell into ruin or were converted to churches. Synagogues were destroyed in [[Tortona]] (350), Rome (388 and 500), [[Raqqa]] (388), [[Menorca]] (418), Daphne (near [[Antioch]], 489 and 507), [[Genoa]] (500), [[Ravenna]] (495), [[Tours]] (585) and in [[Orl\u00e9ans]] (590).

Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations only tolerated as a \"necessary evil\". Catholic doctrine at the time held that lending money for interest was a [[sin]], and it was an occupation forbidden to Christians. Not being subject to this restriction, insofar as loans to non-Jews were concerned, Jews made this business their own, despite possible criticism of [[Usury#Religious context|usury]] in the [[Torah]] and later sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Unfortunately, this led to many negative stereotypes of Jews as insolent, greedy usurers and the understandable tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could see them as personally taking their money while unaware of those on whose behalf these Jews worked.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nJews were subject to a wide range of legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] and restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Even moneylending and peddling were at times forbidden to them. The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghettos]] and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own and were forced to swear special [[Oath More Judaico|Jewish Oaths]], and they suffered a variety of other measures. The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 decreed that Jews and Muslims must wear distinguishing clothing.<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing/JewishHat.htm Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia.

Implementation was in the hands of local rulers but by the following century laws had been enacted covering most of Europe. In many localities, members of Medieval society wore badges to distinguish their social status. Some badges (such as those worn by [[guild]] members) were prestigious, while others were worn by ostracised outcasts such as lepers, reformed [[heresy|heretics]] and prostitutes. As with all [[sumptuary law]]s, the degree to which these laws were followed and enforced varied greatly. Sometimes, Jews sought to evade the badges by paying what amounted to bribes in the form of temporary \"exemptions\" to kings, which were revoked and re-paid for whenever the king needed to raise funds.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} By the end of the Middle Ages, the hat seems to have become rare, but the badge lasted longer and remained in some places until the 18th century.\n\n===Crusades===\n{{See also|German Crusade, 1096|History of the Jews and the Crusades|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon}}\n[[File:Execution of Hebrews by Pagans.jpg|thumb|Killing of Jews during the First Crusade, illustration in a 13th-century French Bible]]\nThe Crusades were a series of military campaigns sanctioned by the [[Papacy]] in Rome, which took place from the end of the 11th century until the 13th century. They began as endeavors to recapture Jerusalem from the Muslims but developed into territorial wars.\n\nThe [[People's Crusade]] that accompanied the First Crusade attacked Jewish communities in Germany, France, and England, and killed many Jews. Entire communities, like those of [[Treves]], [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Mainz]], and [[Cologne]], were murdered by armed mobs. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the [[Rhineland]] cities alone between May and July 1096. Before the Crusades, Jews had practically a monopoly on the trade in Eastern products, but the closer connection between Europe and the East brought about by the Crusades raised up a class of Christian merchant traders, and from this time onwards, restrictions on the sale of goods by Jews became frequent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The religious zeal fomented by the Crusades at times burned as fiercely against Jews as against Muslims, although attempts were made by bishops during the first Crusade and by the papacy during the Second Crusade to stop Jews from being attacked. Both economically and socially, the Crusades were disastrous for European Jews. They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of [[Pope Innocent III]].\n\nThe Jewish defenders of Jerusalem retreated to their synagogue to \"prepare for death\" once the Crusaders had breached the outer walls of the city during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|siege of 1099]].<ref>Madden, Thomas.

In the first panel the hosts are stolen, in the second the hosts bleed when pierced by a Jew, in the third the Jews are arrested, and in the fourth they are burned alive]]\nOn many occasions, Jews were accused of drinking the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]]. According to the authors of these so-called blood libels, the 'procedure' for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child who had not yet reached puberty was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. The child would be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The child would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the child would be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from the child's wounds would be caught in bowls or glasses and then drunk. Finally, the child would be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. Its dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of [[black magic]] would be performed on it. This method, with some variations, can be found in all the alleged Christian descriptions of ritual murder by Jews.\n\nThe story of [[William of Norwich]] (d. 1144) is often cited as the first known accusation of [[ritual murder]] against Jews. The Jews of [[Norwich]], England were accused of murder after a Christian boy, William, was found dead. It was claimed that the Jews had tortured and crucified him. The legend of William of Norwich became a cult, and the child acquired the status of a holy martyr.<ref>Bennett, Gillian (2005), \"Towards a revaluation of the legend of 'Saint' William of Norwich and its place in the blood libel legend\". ''Folklore'', 116(2), pp. 119\u201321.</ref> [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] (d. 1255), in the 13th century, reputedly had his belly cut open and his [[Disembowelment|entrails]] removed for some [[occult]] purpose, such as a [[haruspex|divination ritual]], after being taken from a cross. [[Simon of Trent]] (d. 1475), in the fifteenth, was held over a large bowl so that all his blood could be collected, it was alleged.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, such blood libels were directed against Jews in many parts of Europe. The believers of these accusations reasoned that the Jews, having crucified Jesus, continued to thirst for pure and innocent blood, at the expense of innocent Christian children.<ref>Ben-Sasson, H.H., Editor;  (1969).

When the moneylenders could no longer pay the tax, they were accused of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, Edward abolished their \"privilege\" to lend money, restricted their movements and activities and forced Jews to wear a [[Yellow badge|yellow patch]]. The heads of Jewish households were then arrested with over 300 being taken to the [[Tower of London]] and executed. Others were killed in their homes. All Jews were banished from the country in 1290,<ref>By the [[Edict of Expulsion]]</ref> where it was possible that hundreds were killed or drowned while trying to leave the country.<ref>Prestwich, Michael (1997), Edward I, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-07157-4}}.</ref> All the money and property of these dispossessed Jews was confiscated.

There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution in the [[Rhineland massacres]] of 1096 accompanying the lead-up to the First Crusade, many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils.

It was disclosed that President [[Grover Cleveland]] had sold bonds to a syndicate which included [[J. P. Morgan]] and the Rothschilds house, bonds which that syndicate was now selling for a profit.

Rubinstein|William D. Rubenstein]], a respected author and historian, outlines the presence of antisemitism in the English-speaking world in one of his essays with the same title. In the essay, he explains that there are relatively low levels of antisemitism in the English-speaking world, particularly in Britain and the United States, because of the values associated with [[Protestantism]], the rise of capitalism, and the establishment of constitutional governments that protect civil liberties. Rubenstein does not argue that the treatment of Jews was ideal in these countries, rather he argues that there has been less overt antisemitism in the English-speaking world due to political, ideological, and social structures. Essentially, English-speaking nations experienced lower levels of antisemitism because their liberal and constitutional frameworks limited the organized, violent expression of antisemitism. In his essay, Rubinstein tries to contextualize the reduction of the Jewish population that led to a period of reduced antisemitism: \"All Jews were expelled from England in 1290, the first time Jews had been expelled en masse from a European country\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English-Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=William D.|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=459|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Protestantism ===\nAs mentioned, [[Protestantism]] was a major factor that curbed antisemitism in England beginning in the sixteenth century. This assertion is supported by the fact that the number of reported instances in which Jews were killed in England was significantly higher prior to the birth of Protestantism albeit this was also affected by the number of resident Jews. Protestants were comparatively more understanding of Jews relative to [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and other religious groups. One possible reason as to why Protestant groups were more accepting of Jews was the fact that they preferred the [[Old Testament]] rather than the [[New Testament]], so their doctrines shared both content and narrative with Jewish teachings. Rubenstein attests that another reason as to why \"most of these [Protestants] were predisposed to be sympathetic to the Jews\" was because they often \"view[ed] themselves, like the [[Israelites|biblical Hebrews]], as a [[Jews as the chosen people|chosen group]] that had entered into a direct [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] with [[God]].\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Lastly, Protestantism's anti-Catholic bend contributed to lower levels of antisemitism: \"All of these groups were profoundly hostile to [[Catholicism]]. [[Anti-Catholicism]], at both the elite and mass levels, became a key theme in Britain, tending to push antisemitism aside.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Overall, the emergence of [[Protestantism]] lessened the severity of antisemitism through its use of the [[Old Testament]] and its anti-Catholic sentiment.\n\n=== Capitalism ===\nIn post-Napoleonic England, when there was a notable absence of Jews, Britain removed bans on \"[[usury]] and [[Loan|moneylending]],\"<ref name=\":0\" /> and Rubenstein attests that London and Liverpool became economic trading hubs which bolstered England's status as an economic powerhouse. Jews were often associated with being the moneymakers and financial bodies in continental Europe, so it is significant that the English were able to claim responsibility for the country's financial growth and not attribute it to Jews. It is also significant that because Jews were not in the spotlight financially, it took a lot of the anger away from them, and as such, antisemitism was somewhat muted in England. It is said that Jews did not rank among the \"economic elite of many British cities\" in the 19th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> Again, the significance in this is that British Protestants and non-Jews felt less threatened by Jews because they were not imposing on their prosperity and were not responsible for the economic achievements of their nation. [[Albert Lindemann]] also proposes in the introduction to his book ''Antisemitism: A History'' that Jews \"assumed social positions, such as moneylending, that were inherently precarious and tension creating.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism: A History|last=Lindemann|first=Albert|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=28|quote=Assumed social positions, such as moneylending, that were inherently precarious and tension creating.|via=}}</ref> Lindemann believes that moneylending is inevitably riddled with tension, so as long as Jews were moneylenders, they would always be at the center of the problem and synonymous with fraught financial affairs.\n\n=== Constitutional government ===\nThe third major factor that contributed to lessening antisemitism in Britain was the establishment of a constitutional government, something that was later adopted and bolstered in the United States. A constitutional government is one which has a written document that outlines the powers of government in an attempt to balance and protect civil rights. After the [[English Civil War]], the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]] (1640\u201360) and the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), parliament was established in order to make laws that protected the rights of British citizens.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English-Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=WIlliam|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=|page=460|quote=|via=}}</ref> The [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] specifically outlined laws to protect British civil liberties as well. Thus, it is not surprising that having a constitutional government with liberal principles minimized, to some extent, antisemitism in Britain.\n\nIn further attempts to minimize antisemitism within government, the United States' [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] embraced the liberal principles that were previously put forth in England and inspired the formation of a republic that had executive, judicial, and legislative powers and even a law that served to \"forbid the establishment of any religion or any official religious test for office holding.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English-Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=WIlliam|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=461|quote=|via=}}</ref> Having a government that respected and protected civil liberties, especially those pertaining to religious liberties, reduced blatant antisemitism by constitutionally protecting the right to practice different faiths. These sentiments go back to the first President of the United States, [[George Washington]], who asserted his belief in religious inclusion. Rubinstein believes that though instances of antisemitism definitely existed in Britain and America, the moderation of antisemitism was limited in English-Speaking countries largely because of political and social ideologies that come with a constitutional government.\n\n=== Other English-speaking countries ===\nIn addition to being low in the United States and Britain, antisemitism was also low in other English-speaking countries such as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], and [[New Zealand]]. Australia has had a historically positive attitude towards Jews and as a result, it had \"remarkably little overt antisemitism at any point.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=492|quote=|via=}}</ref> Similarly, [[Ireland]] and New Zealand also experienced a lower presence of antisemitism. This is not to say that English-speaking countries have less antisemitic sentiment because their populations speak English, instead, the ideologies that often exist in English-speaking countries affect their acceptance of Jews.\n\nWhile antisemitism tended to be low in English-speaking regions of Canada, it was higher in [[Quebec]] where the native language is French. Quebec has a \"long history of blaring antisemitism, enunciated by French-speaking nationalists steeped in the most extreme forms of Catholic hostility towards Jews.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=491|quote=|via=}}</ref> This is important because other English-speaking parts of Canada were more tolerant of Jews than its non-English speaking parts were, which suggests a correlation between lingual diversity and the level of Jewish hate. Additionally, it seems that Quebec's firm Catholic hostility towards Jews contributed to local antisemitic behavior.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Martyrdom in Judaism]]\n* [[Jewish history]]\n* [[Timeline of antisemitism]]\n* [[Timeline of Jewish history]]\n* [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n* [[History of antisemitism in the United States]]\n* [[History of Israel]]\n* [[History of Palestine]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Poland]]\n* [[Anti-Zionism]]\n* [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]\n* [[Righteous Among the Nations]]\n* [[Antisemitism (resources)]]\n* ''[[From Swastika to Jim Crow]]''\n* [[Scepter of Judah]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Abella, Irving M and Troper, Harold M.

The terms \"[[religious antisemitism]]\" and \"anti-Judaism\" are sometimes used to refer to animosity towards Judaism as a religion rather than to Jews defined as an ethnic or racial group.\n\n===Roman Empire===\n[[File:Francesco Hayez 019.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Hayez]] depicting Roman destruction of Jerusalem]]\nRelations between the Jews in Judea and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were antagonistic from the very start and resulted in several [[Jewish-Roman wars|rebellions]]. It has been argued that European antisemitism has its roots in Roman policy.<ref>Martin Goodman, ''Rome and Jerusalem: the clash of ancient civilisations'', Allen Lane 2006.</ref>\n\nSeveral ancient historians report that in 19 CE the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled Jews from Rome. According to the Roman historian [[Suetonius]], Tiberius tried to suppress all foreign religions. In the case of Jews, he sent young Jewish men, under the pretence of military service, to provinces noted for their unhealthy climate. He dismissed all other Jews from the city, under threat of life slavery for non-compliance.<ref>Suetonius, ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', Vol 3, \"Tiberius\", Section 36</ref> [[Josephus]], in his ''Jewish Antiquities'',<ref>Josephus, ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'' (18.3.5)</ref> confirms that Tiberius ordered all Jews to be banished from Rome. Four thousand were sent to [[Sardinia]] but more, who were unwilling to become soldiers, were punished. [[Cassius Dio]] reports that Tiberius banished most of the Jews, who had been attempting to convert Romans to their religion.<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', 57.18.5a.</ref> Philo of Alexandria reported that [[Sejanus]], one of Tiberius's lieutenants, may have been a prime mover in the persecution of the Jews.<ref>Philo of Alexandria. ''Against Flaccus''(1.1)</ref>\n\nThe Romans refused to permit Jews to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem after its [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)#Destruction of Jerusalem|destruction]] by [[Titus]] in 70 CE, imposed a tax on Jews ([[Fiscus Judaicus]]) at the same time, ostensibly to finance the [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]] in Rome, and renamed [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] as [[Syria Palestina]]. The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] relates that, following [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] (132\u2013136 CE), the Romans destroyed very many Jews, \"killing until their horses were submerged in blood to their nostrils\".<ref>''The Jerusalem Talmud'', Taanis 4:5</ref> However, some historians argue that Rome brutally suppressed revolts in all its conquered territories and point out that Tiberius expelled all foreign religions from Rome, not just the Jews.\n\nSome accommodation, in fact, was later made with Judaism, and the Jews of the [[Diaspora]] had privileges that others did not. Unlike other subjects of the Roman Empire, they had the right to maintain their religion and were not expected to accommodate themselves to local customs. Even after the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]], the Roman authorities refused to rescind Jewish privileges in some cities. And although [[Hadrian]] outlawed circumcision as a mutilation normally visited on people unable to consent, he later exempted the Jews.<ref>[[Clifford Ando]],''Times Literary Supplement'', 6 April 2007, pp. 6\u20137</ref> According to the 18th-century historian [[Edward Gibbon]], there was greater tolerance from about 160 CE.

Christian literature began to display extreme hostility towards Jews, which occasionally resulted in attacks and the burning of synagogues. This hostility was reflected in the edicts both of church councils and state laws. In the early 4th century, intermarriage between unconverted Jews and Christians was prohibited under the provisions of the [[Synod of Elvira]]. The [[Council of Antioch]] (341) prohibited Christians from celebrating Passover with the Jews while the [[Council of Laodicea]] forbade Christians from keeping the Jewish Sabbath.<ref>Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 34</ref> The Roman Emperor [[Constantine I]] instituted several laws concerning the Jews: they were forbidden to own Christian slaves or to circumcise their slaves. The conversion of Christians to Judaism was outlawed. Religious services were regulated, congregations restricted, but Jews were allowed to enter Jerusalem on [[Tisha B'Av]], the anniversary of the destruction of the Temple.\n\nDiscrimination became worse in the 5th century. The edicts of the [[Codex Theodosianus]] (438) barred Jews from the civil service, the army and the legal profession.<ref>Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 34\u201335</ref> The Jewish Patriarchate was abolished and the scope of Jewish courts restricted. Synagogues were confiscated and old synagogues could be repaired only if they were in danger of collapse. Synagogues fell into ruin or were converted to churches.

Local rulers and church officials closed many professions to Jews, pushing them into marginal roles considered socially inferior, such as tax and rent collecting and [[moneylending]], occupations only tolerated as a \"necessary evil\". Catholic doctrine at the time held that lending money for interest was a [[sin]], and it was an occupation forbidden to Christians. Not being subject to this restriction, insofar as loans to non-Jews were concerned, Jews made this business their own, despite possible criticism of [[Usury#Religious context|usury]] in the [[Torah]] and later sections of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Unfortunately, this led to many negative stereotypes of Jews as insolent, greedy usurers and the understandable tensions between creditors (typically Jews) and debtors (typically Christians) added to social, political, religious, and economic strains. Peasants who were forced to pay their taxes to Jews could see them as personally taking their money while unaware of those on whose behalf these Jews worked.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nJews were subject to a wide range of legal [[Disabilities (Jewish)|disabilities]] and restrictions throughout the Middle Ages, some of which lasted until the end of the 19th century. Even moneylending and peddling were at times forbidden to them. The number of Jews permitted to reside in different places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghettos]] and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own and were forced to swear special [[Oath More Judaico|Jewish Oaths]], and they suffered a variety of other measures. The [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 decreed that Jews and Muslims must wear distinguishing clothing.<ref>[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history_community/Medieval/MedievalSocialTO/Clothing/JewishHat.htm Medieval Jewish History: An Encyclopedia.

Implementation was in the hands of local rulers but by the following century laws had been enacted covering most of Europe. In many localities, members of Medieval society wore badges to distinguish their social status. Some badges (such as those worn by [[guild]] members) were prestigious, while others were worn by ostracised outcasts such as lepers, reformed [[heresy|heretics]] and prostitutes. As with all [[sumptuary law]]s, the degree to which these laws were followed and enforced varied greatly. Sometimes, Jews sought to evade the badges by paying what amounted to bribes in the form of temporary \"exemptions\" to kings, which were revoked and re-paid for whenever the king needed to raise funds.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} By the end of the Middle Ages, the hat seems to have become rare, but the badge lasted longer and remained in some places until the 18th century.\n\n===Crusades===\n{{See also|German Crusade, 1096|History of the Jews and the Crusades|Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon}}\n[[File:Execution of Hebrews by Pagans.jpg|thumb|Killing of Jews during the First Crusade, illustration in a 13th-century French Bible]]\nThe Crusades were a series of military campaigns sanctioned by the [[Papacy]] in Rome, which took place from the end of the 11th century until the 13th century. They began as endeavors to recapture Jerusalem from the Muslims but developed into territorial wars.\n\nThe [[People's Crusade]] that accompanied the First Crusade attacked Jewish communities in Germany, France, and England, and killed many Jews. Entire communities, like those of [[Treves]], [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Mainz]], and [[Cologne]], were murdered by armed mobs. About 12,000 Jews are said to have perished in the [[Rhineland]] cities alone between May and July 1096. Before the Crusades, Jews had practically a monopoly on the trade in Eastern products, but the closer connection between Europe and the East brought about by the Crusades raised up a class of Christian merchant traders, and from this time onwards, restrictions on the sale of goods by Jews became frequent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The religious zeal fomented by the Crusades at times burned as fiercely against Jews as against Muslims, although attempts were made by bishops during the first Crusade and by the papacy during the Second Crusade to stop Jews from being attacked. Both economically and socially, the Crusades were disastrous for European Jews. They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of [[Pope Innocent III]].\n\nThe Jewish defenders of Jerusalem retreated to their synagogue to \"prepare for death\" once the Crusaders had breached the outer walls of the city during the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|siege of 1099]].<ref>Madden, Thomas.

In the first panel the hosts are stolen, in the second the hosts bleed when pierced by a Jew, in the third the Jews are arrested, and in the fourth they are burned alive]]\nOn many occasions, Jews were accused of drinking the blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]]. According to the authors of these so-called blood libels, the 'procedure' for the alleged sacrifice was something like this: a child who had not yet reached puberty was kidnapped and taken to a hidden place. The child would be tortured by Jews, and a crowd would gather at the place of execution (in some accounts the synagogue itself) and engage in a mock tribunal to try the child. The child would be presented to the tribunal naked and tied and eventually be condemned to death. In the end, the child would be crowned with thorns and tied or nailed to a wooden cross. The cross would be raised, and the blood dripping from the child's wounds would be caught in bowls or glasses and then drunk. Finally, the child would be killed with a thrust through the heart from a spear, sword, or dagger. Its dead body would be removed from the cross and concealed or disposed of, but in some instances rituals of [[black magic]] would be performed on it. This method, with some variations, can be found in all the alleged Christian descriptions of ritual murder by Jews.\n\nThe story of [[William of Norwich]] (d. 1144) is often cited as the first known accusation of [[ritual murder]] against Jews. The Jews of [[Norwich]], England were accused of murder after a Christian boy, William, was found dead. It was claimed that the Jews had tortured and crucified him. The legend of William of Norwich became a cult, and the child acquired the status of a holy martyr.<ref>Bennett, Gillian (2005), \"Towards a revaluation of the legend of 'Saint' William of Norwich and its place in the blood libel legend\". ''Folklore'', 116(2), pp. 119\u201321.</ref> [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]] (d. 1255), in the 13th century, reputedly had his belly cut open and his [[Disembowelment|entrails]] removed for some [[occult]] purpose, such as a [[haruspex|divination ritual]], after being taken from a cross. [[Simon of Trent]] (d. 1475), in the fifteenth, was held over a large bowl so that all his blood could be collected, it was alleged.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, such blood libels were directed against Jews in many parts of Europe. The believers of these accusations reasoned that the Jews, having crucified Jesus, continued to thirst for pure and innocent blood, at the expense of innocent Christian children.<ref>Ben-Sasson, H.H., Editor;  (1969).

When the moneylenders could no longer pay the tax, they were accused of disloyalty. Already restricted to a limited number of occupations, Edward abolished their \"privilege\" to lend money, restricted their movements and activities and forced Jews to wear a [[Yellow badge|yellow patch]]. The heads of Jewish households were then arrested with over 300 being taken to the [[Tower of London]] and executed. Others were killed in their homes. All Jews were banished from the country in 1290,<ref>By the [[Edict of Expulsion]]</ref> where it was possible that hundreds were killed or drowned while trying to leave the country.<ref>Prestwich, Michael (1997), Edward I, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|0-300-07157-4}}.</ref> All the money and property of these dispossessed Jews was confiscated. No Jews were known to be in England thereafter until 1655, when [[Oliver Cromwell]] reversed the policy.\n\n===Expulsions from the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Further|History of the Jews in Germany}}\nIn Germany, part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], persecutions and formal expulsions of the Jews were liable to occur at intervals, although it should be said that this was also the case for other minority communities, whether religious or ethnic. There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution in the [[Rhineland massacres]] of 1096 accompanying the lead-up to the First Crusade, many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils. The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] generally tried to restrain persecution, if only for economic reasons, but he was often unable to exert much influence. As late as 1519, the Imperial city of [[Regensburg]] took advantage of the recent death of [[Emperor Maximilian I]] to expel its 500 Jews.<ref>[[Christopher Wood (art historian)|Wood, Christopher]], ''Albrecht Altdorfer and the Origins of Landscape'', p. 251, 1993, Reaktion Books, London, {{ISBN|0948462469}}</ref> At this period the rulers of the eastern edges of Europe, in Poland, Lithuania and Hungary, were often receptive to Jewish settlement, and many Jews moved to these regions.<ref name=\"Teacher's\">{{cite web|title=Map of Jewish expulsions and resettlement areas in Europe|url=http://fcit.usf.edu/HOLOCAUST/gallery/expuls.htm|work=Florida Center for Instructional Technology, College of Education, University of South Florida|publisher=A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust|accessdate=24 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n===The Black Death===\n[[File:Pogrom de Strasbourg 1349.jpg|thumb|Illustration by Emile Schweitzer on the Strasbourg massacre (1894)]]\n{{Main|Black Death Jewish persecutions}}\nHundreds of Jewish communities were destroyed by violence during the ravages of the Black Death, particularly in the Iberian peninsula and in the Germanic Empire.

When those who chose to leave the country arrived at the port in Lisbon, they were met by clerics and soldiers who used force, coercion and promises to baptize them and prevent them from leaving the country. This episode technically ended the presence of Jews in Portugal. Afterwards, all converted Jews and their descendants would be referred to as [[New Christians]] or ''[[marrano]]''. They were given a grace period of thirty years during which no inquiry into their faith would be allowed. This period was later extended until 1534. However, a [[Lisbon massacre|popular riot in 1506]] resulted in the deaths of up to four or five thousand Jews, and the execution of the leaders of the riot by King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel]].

Jews were accused of weakening the national spirit through association with [[republicanism]], [[capitalism]] and [[anti-clericalism]], particularly by authoritarian, right wing, clerical and royalist groups.

Along with Italians, Irish and other Eastern and Southern Europeans, Jews faced discrimination in the United States in employment, education and social advancement.

Despite these attacks, very few Eastern European Jews returned to Europe for whatever privations they faced, their situation in the U.S. was still improved.\n\nBeginning in the early 1880s, declining farm prices also prompted elements of the [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]] to blame the perceived evils of capitalism and industrialism on Jews because of their alleged racial/religious inclination for financial exploitation and, more specifically, because of the alleged financial manipulations of Jewish financiers such as the [[Rothschild family|Rothschilds]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Conspiracy theories in American history: an encyclopedia, Volume 1 |first=Peter |last=Knight|publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2003|page=82|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qMIDrggs8TsC&pg=PA82&dq=Jews+Banking#v=onepage&q=Jews%20Banking&f=false|isbn=9781576078129 }}</ref> Although Jews played only a minor role in the nation's commercial banking system, the prominence of Jewish investment bankers such as the Rothschilds in Europe, and [[Jacob Schiff]], of [[Kuhn, Loeb & Co.]] in New York City, made the claims of antisemites believable to some.

It was disclosed that President [[Grover Cleveland]] had sold bonds to a syndicate which included [[J. P. Morgan]] and the Rothschilds house, bonds which that syndicate was now selling for a profit. The Populists used it as an opportunity to uphold their view of history, and prove to the nation that Washington and Wall Street were in the hands of the international Jewish banking houses.

Rubinstein|William D. Rubenstein]], a respected author and historian, outlines the presence of antisemitism in the English-speaking world in one of his essays with the same title. In the essay, he explains that there are relatively low levels of antisemitism in the English-speaking world, particularly in Britain and the United States, because of the values associated with [[Protestantism]], the rise of capitalism, and the establishment of constitutional governments that protect civil liberties. Rubenstein does not argue that the treatment of Jews was ideal in these countries, rather he argues that there has been less overt antisemitism in the English-speaking world due to political, ideological, and social structures. Essentially, English-speaking nations experienced lower levels of antisemitism because their liberal and constitutional frameworks limited the organized, violent expression of antisemitism. In his essay, Rubinstein tries to contextualize the reduction of the Jewish population that led to a period of reduced antisemitism: \"All Jews were expelled from England in 1290, the first time Jews had been expelled en masse from a European country\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English-Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=William D.|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=459|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Protestantism ===\nAs mentioned, [[Protestantism]] was a major factor that curbed antisemitism in England beginning in the sixteenth century. This assertion is supported by the fact that the number of reported instances in which Jews were killed in England was significantly higher prior to the birth of Protestantism albeit this was also affected by the number of resident Jews. Protestants were comparatively more understanding of Jews relative to [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and other religious groups. One possible reason as to why Protestant groups were more accepting of Jews was the fact that they preferred the [[Old Testament]] rather than the [[New Testament]], so their doctrines shared both content and narrative with Jewish teachings. Rubenstein attests that another reason as to why \"most of these [Protestants] were predisposed to be sympathetic to the Jews\" was because they often \"view[ed] themselves, like the [[Israelites|biblical Hebrews]], as a [[Jews as the chosen people|chosen group]] that had entered into a direct [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] with [[God]].\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Lastly, Protestantism's anti-Catholic bend contributed to lower levels of antisemitism: \"All of these groups were profoundly hostile to [[Catholicism]]. [[Anti-Catholicism]], at both the elite and mass levels, became a key theme in Britain, tending to push antisemitism aside.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Overall, the emergence of [[Protestantism]] lessened the severity of antisemitism through its use of the [[Old Testament]] and its anti-Catholic sentiment.\n\n=== Capitalism ===\nIn post-Napoleonic England, when there was a notable absence of Jews, Britain removed bans on \"[[usury]] and [[Loan|moneylending]],\"<ref name=\":0\" /> and Rubenstein attests that London and Liverpool became economic trading hubs which bolstered England's status as an economic powerhouse. Jews were often associated with being the moneymakers and financial bodies in continental Europe, so it is significant that the English were able to claim responsibility for the country's financial growth and not attribute it to Jews. It is also significant that because Jews were not in the spotlight financially, it took a lot of the anger away from them, and as such, antisemitism was somewhat muted in England. It is said that Jews did not rank among the \"economic elite of many British cities\" in the 19th century.<ref name=\":0\" /> Again, the significance in this is that British Protestants and non-Jews felt less threatened by Jews because they were not imposing on their prosperity and were not responsible for the economic achievements of their nation. [[Albert Lindemann]] also proposes in the introduction to his book ''Antisemitism: A History'' that Jews \"assumed social positions, such as moneylending, that were inherently precarious and tension creating.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism: A History|last=Lindemann|first=Albert|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=28|quote=Assumed social positions, such as moneylending, that were inherently precarious and tension creating.|via=}}</ref> Lindemann believes that moneylending is inevitably riddled with tension, so as long as Jews were moneylenders, they would always be at the center of the problem and synonymous with fraught financial affairs.\n\n=== Constitutional government ===\nThe third major factor that contributed to lessening antisemitism in Britain was the establishment of a constitutional government, something that was later adopted and bolstered in the United States. A constitutional government is one which has a written document that outlines the powers of government in an attempt to balance and protect civil rights. After the [[English Civil War]], the [[The Protectorate|Protectorate]] (1640\u201360) and the [[Glorious Revolution]] (1688), parliament was established in order to make laws that protected the rights of British citizens.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English-Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=WIlliam|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=|page=460|quote=|via=}}</ref> The [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] specifically outlined laws to protect British civil liberties as well. Thus, it is not surprising that having a constitutional government with liberal principles minimized, to some extent, antisemitism in Britain.\n\nIn further attempts to minimize antisemitism within government, the United States' [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] embraced the liberal principles that were previously put forth in England and inspired the formation of a republic that had executive, judicial, and legislative powers and even a law that served to \"forbid the establishment of any religion or any official religious test for office holding.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English-Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=WIlliam|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=461|quote=|via=}}</ref> Having a government that respected and protected civil liberties, especially those pertaining to religious liberties, reduced blatant antisemitism by constitutionally protecting the right to practice different faiths. These sentiments go back to the first President of the United States, [[George Washington]], who asserted his belief in religious inclusion. Rubinstein believes that though instances of antisemitism definitely existed in Britain and America, the moderation of antisemitism was limited in English-Speaking countries largely because of political and social ideologies that come with a constitutional government.\n\n=== Other English-speaking countries ===\nIn addition to being low in the United States and Britain, antisemitism was also low in other English-speaking countries such as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], and [[New Zealand]]. Australia has had a historically positive attitude towards Jews and as a result, it had \"remarkably little overt antisemitism at any point.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=492|quote=|via=}}</ref> Similarly, [[Ireland]] and New Zealand also experienced a lower presence of antisemitism. This is not to say that English-speaking countries have less antisemitic sentiment because their populations speak English, instead, the ideologies that often exist in English-speaking countries affect their acceptance of Jews.\n\nWhile antisemitism tended to be low in English-speaking regions of Canada, it was higher in [[Quebec]] where the native language is French. Quebec has a \"long history of blaring antisemitism, enunciated by French-speaking nationalists steeped in the most extreme forms of Catholic hostility towards Jews.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Antisemitism in the English Speaking World|last=Rubenstein|first=William|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|page=491|quote=|via=}}</ref> This is important because other English-speaking parts of Canada were more tolerant of Jews than its non-English speaking parts were, which suggests a correlation between lingual diversity and the level of Jewish hate. Additionally, it seems that Quebec's firm Catholic hostility towards Jews contributed to local antisemitic behavior.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Martyrdom in Judaism]]\n* [[Jewish history]]\n* [[Timeline of antisemitism]]\n* [[Timeline of Jewish history]]\n* [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n* [[History of antisemitism in the United States]]\n* [[History of Israel]]\n* [[History of Palestine]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Poland]]\n* [[Anti-Zionism]]\n* [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]]\n* [[Righteous Among the Nations]]\n* [[Antisemitism (resources)]]\n* ''[[From Swastika to Jim Crow]]''\n* [[Scepter of Judah]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Abella, Irving M and Troper, Harold M.
