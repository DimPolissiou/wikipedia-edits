Generally each carrier has an advanced (police) driver, five constables and a sergeant. Territorial Support Groups often comprise three carriers, eighteen constables, and three sergeants reporting to an Inspector. They separately patrol designated patches. When deployed, it is by the MPS Information Room. Due to the public order nature of their role often numerous carriers will be assigned, a common situation being drunken rowdiness at public house closing time. TSG officers can be identified as TSG from the distinctive \"U\" in their [[collar number|shoulder numbers]].\n\n==Role==\n\nToday the TSG has three main tasks in the policing of the [[Metropolitan Police District]]:<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n* Securing the capital against [[terrorism]].\n* Responding to [[public order|disorder]] anywhere within London.\n* Reducing priority crime through [[London borough|borough]] support.\n\n===Public order===\nAlthough public order is not the TSG's only role, it is certainly their most visible and well-known. Like most [[Police Support Unit]] vehicles, TSG vans are equipped with mesh window shields and officers are equipped with [[acrylic glass]] [[riot shield]]s, visored [[Riotsquad helmet|'NATO' helmets]], shin and elbow guards, along with fireproof coveralls when required. This level of protection allows them to deal with many violent situations, including [[riot]]s, football violence and suspects armed with a variety of weapons. TSG officers are trained to a higher standard of operational readiness in their public order role than most other Police Support Units outside London; TSG training is refreshed every five weeks as a matter of routine. Exercises are conducted predominantly at the [[Metropolitan Police Specialist Training Centre|MPS Specialist Training Centre]] in [[Gravesend, Kent]], though other sites are used as required, and encompass all public order scenarios; officers will undergo extensive riot training including being petrol bombed in large-scale engagements, prison clearance tactics, [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] scenarios, night club scenarios, aircraft, rail and various 'angry-man' scenarios, as well as additional specialist training. TSG units spend considerable time training with other specialist police teams as well as certain [[military]] units. Also, if a siege situation is present, but firearms are not involved, TSG will often be deployed to counter the threat.<ref name=\"waldren\">{{Cite book|title= Armed Police, The Police Use of Firearms since 1945 |last=Waldren |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |year= 2007 |publisher= Sutton |location= England |isbn= 0-7509-4637-7 |page= 224}}</ref> Reflecting this role the unit's former head, Commander Michael Johnson, was [[Gold-silver-bronze command structure#Silver|tactical]] commander for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]].<ref name=\"MPA0915\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/mpa/2011/0915/05/| title=Acting Commissioner\u2019s Report| accessdate=13 March 2012| last= | first= |date=15 September 2011 |work=MPA Committee Reports | publisher=MPA }}</ref>\n\n===Borough support===\nTSG provides support to regular divisional officers through high-visibility patrols, surveillance and decoy operations while also providing a presence on the streets. [[London borough|Borough]]s are also supported through the provision of a 'Commissioner's Reserve' a section of TSG that is on standby all year round; it is designed so such units are always available for rapid response of a sizeable number of officers anywhere within the Metropolis to quell public order problems, from a bar brawl to large-scale public disorder. Day to day TSG assist the boroughs in handling and relocating particularly violent prisoners.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n===Terrorism response===\nTSG is equipped and trained to deal with the aftermath or evacuation during or after a terrorism emergency in London, and the unit includes a [[CBRN]] (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) trained team. Working closely with SO15 (the Metropolitan Police [[Counter Terrorism Command]]) TSG also has counter-terrorism responsibilities.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Recruitment==\n\nPotential TSG candidates are selected from mainstream divisional officers. Officers are selected on merit and much emphasis is placed upon their personal policing ability, motivation, resilience and good communication skills. Fitness and stamina are also seen as essential attributes of TSG personnel. Applicants must be recommended by a senior officer (minimum rank of [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspector]]) whilst on division.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n[[File:TSG Van123.jpg|thumb|right|TSG Public Order Vehicle (Carrier)]]\n[[Mercedes Sprinter]]s are the standard vehicle of TSG and each van transports six [[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|Constable]]s and a [[Sergeant#Police 7|Sergeant]].

TSG does, however, have its own firearms capability with some officers being trained as [[Authorised Firearms Officer]]s (AFOs) on standard-issue firearms such as the [[Glock 17]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] semi-automatic carbine, as well as less-lethal weaponry such as the [[Riot gun|L104A1 Baton Gun]] and [[Taser|X26 Taser]].

He argues this because of their use of shields, batons and helmets, their centralised command structure, their willingness to use force and their squad-like formations. [[Peter Waddington]] counters this conclusion in the [[British Journal of Criminology]] by pointing out that their equipment is mainly defensive. As employees, the police force have a duty to protect them from harm, he also notes that [[paramedic]]s in riot situations also wear similar helmets and armour. Jefferson argues that by the police preparing for an event, such as a march or protest where they expect there to be violence, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy and that violence will occur. Waddington responds to this by pointing out that the TSG were deployed at the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] every year and yet there was not always violence. Jefferson also believes that by controlling the ground the TSG incites violence, Waddington cites examples (including the [[Battle of the Beanfield]]) where problems were caused by the police not controlling the ground and that when they have then tried to gain control violence ensued.\n\nWaddington states that if the presence of the TSG caused violence, then violence would not occur if they were not deployed. Waddington uses examples from three [[Poll Tax Riots]] to illustrate that the assumption that their deployment causes violence is not correct. When the TSG were not deployed, serious disorder occurred, including a fully-fledged riot. In contrast when the TSG, including specialists in riot control, were deployed there was less violence. What is more he found that the more the police planned for the 'worst-case scenario' the less disorder there was. When they controlled the space and the crowd was at its greatest, violence was lowest. Waddington states that whilst the deployment of the TSG in a riot situation is never desirable, it is often essential to maintain order and limit violence.

Generally each carrier has an advanced (police) driver, five constables and a sergeant. Territorial Support Groups often comprise three carriers, eighteen constables, and three sergeants reporting to an Inspector. They separately patrol designated patches. When deployed, it is by the MPS Information Room. Due to the public order nature of their role often numerous carriers will be assigned, a common situation being drunken rowdiness at public house closing time. TSG officers can be identified as TSG from the distinctive \"U\" in their [[collar number|shoulder numbers]].\n\n==Role==\n\nToday the TSG has three main tasks in the policing of the [[Metropolitan Police District]]:<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n* Securing the capital against [[terrorism]].\n* Responding to [[public order|disorder]] anywhere within London.\n* Reducing priority crime through [[London borough|borough]] support.\n\n===Public order===\nAlthough public order is not the TSG's only role, it is certainly their most visible and well-known. Like most [[Police Support Unit]] vehicles, TSG vans are equipped with mesh window shields and officers are equipped with [[acrylic glass]] [[riot shield]]s, visored [[Riotsquad helmet|'NATO' helmets]], shin and elbow guards, along with fireproof coveralls when required. This level of protection allows them to deal with many violent situations, including [[riot]]s, football violence and suspects armed with a variety of weapons. TSG officers are trained to a higher standard of operational readiness in their public order role than most other Police Support Units outside London; TSG training is refreshed every five weeks as a matter of routine. Exercises are conducted predominantly at the [[Metropolitan Police Specialist Training Centre|MPS Specialist Training Centre]] in [[Gravesend, Kent]], though other sites are used as required, and encompass all public order scenarios; officers will undergo extensive riot training including being petrol bombed in large-scale engagements, prison clearance tactics, [[Association football|football]] [[stadium]] scenarios, night club scenarios, aircraft, rail and various 'angry-man' scenarios, as well as additional specialist training. TSG units spend considerable time training with other specialist police teams as well as certain [[military]] units. Also, if a siege situation is present, but firearms are not involved, TSG will often be deployed to counter the threat.<ref name=\"waldren\">{{Cite book|title= Armed Police, The Police Use of Firearms since 1945 |last=Waldren |first=Michael J. |authorlink= |year= 2007 |publisher= Sutton |location= England |isbn= 0-7509-4637-7 |page= 224}}</ref> Reflecting this role the unit's former head, Commander Michael Johnson, was [[Gold-silver-bronze command structure#Silver|tactical]] commander for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympics]].<ref name=\"MPA0915\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/mpa/2011/0915/05/| title=Acting Commissioner\u2019s Report| accessdate=13 March 2012| last= | first= |date=15 September 2011 |work=MPA Committee Reports | publisher=MPA }}</ref>\n\n===Borough support===\nTSG provides support to regular divisional officers through high-visibility patrols, surveillance and decoy operations while also providing a presence on the streets. [[London borough|Borough]]s are also supported through the provision of a 'Commissioner's Reserve' a section of TSG that is on standby all year round; it is designed so such units are always available for rapid response of a sizeable number of officers anywhere within the Metropolis to quell public order problems, from a bar brawl to large-scale public disorder. Day to day TSG assist the boroughs in handling and relocating particularly violent prisoners.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n===Terrorism response===\nTSG is equipped and trained to deal with the aftermath or evacuation during or after a terrorism emergency in London, and the unit includes a [[CBRN]] (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) trained team. Working closely with SO15 (the Metropolitan Police [[Counter Terrorism Command]]) TSG also has counter-terrorism responsibilities.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Recruitment==\n\nPotential TSG candidates are selected from mainstream divisional officers. Officers are selected on merit and much emphasis is placed upon their personal policing ability, motivation, resilience and good communication skills. Fitness and stamina are also seen as essential attributes of TSG personnel. Applicants must be recommended by a senior officer (minimum rank of [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Inspector]]) whilst on division.<ref name=\"mettsgpage\"/>\n\n==Equipment==\n\n[[File:TSG Van123.jpg|thumb|right|TSG Public Order Vehicle (Carrier)]]\n[[Mercedes Sprinter]]s are the standard vehicle of TSG and each van transports six [[Constable#United Kingdom and the Commonwealth|Constable]]s and a [[Sergeant#Police 7|Sergeant]].

TSG does, however, have its own firearms capability with some officers being trained as [[Authorised Firearms Officer]]s (AFOs) on standard-issue firearms such as the [[Glock 17]] and [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] semi-automatic carbine, as well as less-lethal weaponry such as the [[Riot gun|L104A1 Baton Gun]] and [[Taser|X26 Taser]].

He argues this because of their use of shields, batons and helmets, their centralised command structure, their willingness to use force and their squad-like formations. [[Peter Waddington]] counters this conclusion in the [[British Journal of Criminology]] by pointing out that their equipment is mainly defensive. As employees, the police force have a duty to protect them from harm, he also notes that [[paramedic]]s in riot situations also wear similar helmets and armour. Jefferson argues that by the police preparing for an event, such as a march or protest where they expect there to be violence, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy and that violence will occur. Waddington responds to this by pointing out that the TSG were deployed at the [[Notting Hill Carnival]] every year and yet there was not always violence. Jefferson also believes that by controlling the ground the TSG incites violence, Waddington cites examples (including the [[Battle of the Beanfield]]) where problems were caused by the police not controlling the ground and that when they have then tried to gain control violence ensued.\n\nWaddington states that if the presence of the TSG caused violence, then violence would not occur if they were not deployed. Waddington uses examples from three [[Poll Tax Riots]] to illustrate that the assumption that their deployment causes violence is not correct. When the TSG were not deployed, serious disorder occurred, including a fully-fledged riot. In contrast when the TSG, including specialists in riot control, were deployed there was less violence. What is more he found that the more the police planned for the 'worst-case scenario' the less disorder there was. When they controlled the space and the crowd was at its greatest, violence was lowest. Waddington states that whilst the deployment of the TSG in a riot situation is never desirable, it is often essential to maintain order and limit violence. However, he also believes that the use of force should be as minimal as possible and that it should only be used to achieve publicly acceptable purposes.<ref name=\"BJC\">{{Cite journal|last=Waddington|first=P.

With her pendant, she can access her shamanic powers: the ability to leave her physical body and explore the world in spirit form. Using this ability, she can fly through gaps in walls and reach new places. The player can also possess certain objects, such as levers, to manipulate the environment. Throughout the game, the player finds notes from ghosts, which reveal new things. To advance in the game, the player has to find items and use them on certain objects.\n\n==Plot==\nYoung Elena Elkhorn embarks on a harrowing journey to find her missing father and discover the secrets of the Willows Mansion. Aiding her journey is a unique amulet she received from her father, which allows her to astrally project her spirit into a ghostly realm and communicate with the dead.\n\n===Characters===\n*Elena Elkhorn: The protagonist who wants to rescue her father.\n*John Elkhorn: Elena's missing father and descendant of the Kwantako tribe.\n*Wortham Willows: The antagonist.

Arius' position was that the Son was brought forth as the very first of God's creations, and that the Father later created all things through the Son. Arius taught that in the creation of the universe, the Father was the ultimate creator, supplying all the materials and directing the design, while the Son worked the materials, making all things at the bidding and in the service of God, by which \"through [Christ] all things came into existence\".

In the Middle Ages, [[Roscellin of Compiegne]], the founder of [[Nominalism]], argued for three distinct almighty Gods, with three distinct natures, who were one in mind and purpose, acting together as one divine group or godhead over the universe. He said, though, like Philoponus, that unless the three persons are ''tres res'' (three things with distinct natures), the whole Trinity must have been [[incarnate]]. And therefore, since only the Logos was made flesh, the other two persons must have had distinct \"natures\", separate from the Logos, and so had to be separate and distinct Gods, though all three were one in divine work and plan. In this view, they would be considered \"three Gods in one\". This notion was condemned by [[St. Anselm]].<ref>Chapman, John (1912).

Armstrong theology holds that God is a \"Family\" that expands eventually, that \"God reproduces Himself\", but that originally there was a co-eternal \"Duality\", God and the Word, rather than a \"Trinity\".\n* [[Swedenborgianism]] holds that the Trinity exists in one person, the Lord God Jesus Christ. The Father, the being or soul of God, was born into the world and put on a body from [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]. Throughout his life, Jesus put away all human desires and tendencies until he was completely divine. After his resurrection, he influences the world through the Holy Spirit, which is his activity. In this view, Jesus Christ is the one God; the Father as to his soul, the Son as to his body, and the Holy Spirit as to his activity in the world.\n* Numerous [[Unitarianism#Modern Christian Unitarian organizations|Unitarian Christian organizations]] exist around the world, the oldest of which is the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]].

For them, [[early Christianity]] eventually changed after the edicts of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]] and his sentence pronounced on [[Arius]], which was later followed by the declaration by Emperor Theodosius I in the Edict of Thessalonica, ''cunctos populos'' of February 380 that Christianity as defined in the Nicene Creed was the official religion of the Roman Empire. A year later, the Second Ecumenical Council confirmed this in a revised Creed. Nontrinitarians dispute the veracity of the [[Nicene Creed]] based on its adoption nearly 300 years after the life of Jesus as a result of conflict within pre-Nicene [[early Christianity]] during a [[Constantinian shift|dramatic shift in Christianity's status]].\n\n[[File:Nikea-arius.png|upright|thumb|The [[First Council of Nicaea]] depicted with [[Arius]] beneath the feet of Emperor Constantine and the [[bishop]]s]]\nAlthough nontrinitarian beliefs continued and were dominant among some peoples\u2014for example, the [[Lombards]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]] and [[Vandals]]\u2014for hundreds of years, the Trinity doctrine eventually gained prominence in the Roman Empire.

The [[Michael Servetus#Imprisonment and execution|Geneva City Council]], in accord with the judgment of the cantons of Z\u00fcrich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, condemned Servetus to be burned at the stake for this and his opposition to infant baptism.\n\nThe ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of Religion and Ethics'' describes the five stages that led to the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity:<ref>W.

Clark, 1921, Vol. 12, p. 459.</ref>\n# The acceptance of the pre-human existence of Jesus as the ([[Middle Platonism|middle-platonic]]) [[Logos]], namely, as the medium between the transcendent sovereign God and the created cosmos. The doctrine of Logos was accepted by the Apologists and by other Fathers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, such as [[Justin the Martyr]], [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Ireneus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], [[Lactantius]], and in the 4th century by [[Arius]];\n# The doctrine of the timeless generation of the Son from the Father as it was articulated by Origen in his effort to support the ontological [[immutability (theology)|immutability]] of [[God]], that he is ever-being a father and a creator. The doctrine of the timeless generation was adopted by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]];\n# The acceptance of the idea that the son of God is of the same transcendent nature (''[[Homoousian|homoousios]]'') as his father. This position was declared in the [[Nicene Creed]], which specifically states the son of God is as immutable as his father;\n# The acceptance that the Holy Spirit also has ontological equality as a third person in a divine Trinity and the final Trinitarian terminology by the teachings of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]];\n# The addition of the [[Filioque]] to the Nicene Creed, as accepted by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n===Following the Reformation===\n{{expand section|1=information on other sects such as Mormonism and Jehovah's Witnesses|date=August 2016}}\nBy 1530, following the [[Protestant Reformation]], and the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524\u20131525, large areas of Northern Europe were Protestant, and forms of nontrinitarianism began to surface among some \"[[Radical Reformation]]\" groups, particularly [[Anabaptist]]s. The first recorded English antitrinitarian was [[John Assheton]] (1548), an [[Anglican]] priest. The Italian Anabaptist \"[[Council of Venice]]\" (1550) and the trial of [[Michael Servetus]] (1553) marked the clear emergence of markedly antitrinitarian Protestants. Though the only organised nontrinitarian churches were the [[Polish Brethren]] who split from the Calvinists (1565, expelled from Poland 1658), and the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]] (founded 1568). [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s, [[Dissenter]]s and [[Latitudinarian]]s in Britain were often [[Arian]]s or [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], and the [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813]] allowed nontrinitarian worship in Britain. In America, Arian and Unitarian views were also found among some [[Millennialist]] and [[Adventism|Adventist]] groups, though the [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian Church]] itself began to decline in numbers and influence after the 1870s.<ref>''Unitarians face a new age: the report of the Commission of Appraisal.''

They acknowledge the Son's high rank at [[Right hand of God|God's right hand]], but teach that the Father is still greater than the Son in all things.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the Father, Son, and Spirit are essential in creation and salvation, they argue that that in itself does not confirm that the three are each co-equal or co-eternal. They also affirm that God is only explicitly identified as \"one\" in the Bible, and that the doctrine of the Trinity, which word literally meaning ''a set of three'', ascribes a co-equal threeness to the being of the infinite God that is not explicitly scriptural.\n\n===Scriptural support===\nCritics of the Trinity doctrine argue that it, for a teaching described as fundamental, lacks direct scriptural support. Proponents of the doctrine assert that although the doctrine is not stated directly in the New Testament, it is instead an interpretation of elements contained therein that imply the doctrine that was later formulated in the 4th century.\n\n[[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]], a [[Church of Scotland]] minister, says: \"It is important and helpful to remember that the word Trinity is not itself a New Testament word.

They argue that the same Greek word (''hen'') for \"one\" throughout John 17 indicates that Jesus did not expect for his followers to literally become a single Being, or \"one in substance\", with each other, or with God, and therefore that Jesus also did not expect his hearers to think that he and God the Father were one entity either.<ref name=\"WTBTS should you believe trinity\"/>\n\n==== John 20:28-29 ====\n{{bibleref2|John|20:28-29}}\u2014\"And Thomas answered and said to Him, \"My Lord and my God!\" Jesus said to him, \"Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed.

This process was done most thoroughly in the synthesis of Clement of Alexandria. It can be done in several ways. You can rake through Greek literature, and find (especially in the oldest seers and poets) references to 'God' which are more compatible with monotheism than with polytheism (so at length Athenagoras.) You can work out a common chronology between the legends of prehistoric (Homer) Greece and the biblical record (so Theophilus.) You can adapt a piece of pre-Christian Jewish apologetic, which claimed that Plato and other [[Greek philosophers]] got their best ideas indirectly from the teachings of Moses in the Bible, which was much earlier. This theory combines the advantage of making out the Greeks to be plagiarists (and therefore second-rate or criminal), while claiming that they support Christianity by their arguments at least some of the time.

However, the neo-Platonic trinity has the doctrine of emanation, or \"eternal derivation\", a timeless procedure of generation having as a source the One and claimed to be paralleled with the generation of the light from the Sun. This was adopted by Origen and later on by Athanasius, and applied to the generation of the Son from the Father, because they believed that this analogy could be used to support the notion that the Father, as immutable, always had been a Father, and that the generation of the Son is therefore eternal and timeless.<ref>''Select Treatises of St. Athanasius'' \u2013 In Controversy With the Arians \u2013 Freely Translated by John Henry Cardinal Newmann - Longmans, Green, and Co., 1911</ref>\n| The synthesis of Christianity with [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophy was further incorporated in the trinitarian formulas that appeared by the end of the 3rd century. \"The Greek philosophical theology\" was \"developed during the Trinitarian controversies over the relationships among the persons of the Godhead\".<ref>A.

Thus [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 <!--|ISBN=978-0-140-44140-6 --> |isbn=978-0-14044140-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Christian groups with nontrinitarian positions==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[American Unitarian Conference]]\n* [[Arianism]]\n* [[Assemblies of Yahweh]]\n* [[Bethel Ministerial Association]]\n* [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]]\n* [[Christadelphians]]\n* [[Church of Christ, Scientist]] ([[Christian Scientists]])<ref>Neusner, Jacob, ed. 2009.

He said, though, like Philoponus, that unless the three persons are ''tres res'' (three things with distinct natures), the whole Trinity must have been [[incarnate]]. And therefore, since only the Logos was made flesh, the other two persons must have had distinct \"natures\", separate from the Logos, and so had to be separate and distinct Gods, though all three were one in divine work and plan.

Armstrong theology holds that God is a \"Family\" that expands eventually, that \"God reproduces Himself\", but that originally there was a co-eternal \"Duality\", God and the Word, rather than a \"Trinity\".\n* [[Swedenborgianism]] holds that the Trinity exists in one person, the Lord God Jesus Christ. The Father, the being or soul of God, was born into the world and put on a body from [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]. Throughout his life, Jesus put away all human desires and tendencies until he was completely divine. After his resurrection, he influences the world through the Holy Spirit, which is his activity. In this view, Jesus Christ is the one God; the Father as to his soul, the Son as to his body, and the Holy Spirit as to his activity in the world.\n* Numerous [[Unitarianism#Modern Christian Unitarian organizations|Unitarian Christian organizations]] exist around the world, the oldest of which is the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]].

For them, [[early Christianity]] eventually changed after the edicts of [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]] and his sentence pronounced on [[Arius]], which was later followed by the declaration by Emperor Theodosius I in the Edict of Thessalonica, ''cunctos populos'' of February 380 that Christianity as defined in the Nicene Creed was the official religion of the Roman Empire. A year later, the Second Ecumenical Council confirmed this in a revised Creed. Nontrinitarians dispute the veracity of the [[Nicene Creed]] based on its adoption nearly 300 years after the life of Jesus as a result of conflict within pre-Nicene [[early Christianity]] during a [[Constantinian shift|dramatic shift in Christianity's status]].\n\n[[File:Nikea-arius.png|upright|thumb|The [[First Council of Nicaea]] depicted with [[Arius]] beneath the feet of Emperor Constantine and the [[bishop]]s]]\nAlthough nontrinitarian beliefs continued and were dominant among some peoples\u2014for example, the [[Lombards]], [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]] and [[Vandals]]\u2014for hundreds of years, the Trinity doctrine eventually gained prominence in the Roman Empire.

The [[Michael Servetus#Imprisonment and execution|Geneva City Council]], in accord with the judgment of the cantons of Z\u00fcrich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, condemned Servetus to be burned at the stake for this and his opposition to infant baptism.\n\nThe ''Encyclop\u00e6dia of Religion and Ethics'' describes the five stages that led to the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity:<ref>W.

The doctrine of Logos was accepted by the Apologists and by other Fathers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, such as [[Justin the Martyr]], [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], [[Tertullian]], [[Ireneus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Origen]], [[Lactantius]], and in the 4th century by [[Arius]];\n# The doctrine of the timeless generation of the Son from the Father as it was articulated by Origen in his effort to support the ontological [[immutability (theology)|immutability]] of [[God]], that he is ever-being a father and a creator. The doctrine of the timeless generation was adopted by [[Athanasius of Alexandria]];\n# The acceptance of the idea that the son of God is of the same transcendent nature (''[[Homoousian|homoousios]]'') as his father. This position was declared in the [[Nicene Creed]], which specifically states the son of God is as immutable as his father;\n# The acceptance that the Holy Spirit also has ontological equality as a third person in a divine Trinity and the final Trinitarian terminology by the teachings of the [[Cappadocian Fathers]];\n# The addition of the [[Filioque]] to the Nicene Creed, as accepted by the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n===Following the Reformation===\n{{expand section|1=information on other sects such as Mormonism and Jehovah's Witnesses|date=August 2016}}\nBy 1530, following the [[Protestant Reformation]], and the [[German Peasants' War]] of 1524\u20131525, large areas of Northern Europe were Protestant, and forms of nontrinitarianism began to surface among some \"[[Radical Reformation]]\" groups, particularly [[Anabaptist]]s. The first recorded English antitrinitarian was [[John Assheton]] (1548), an [[Anglican]] priest. The Italian Anabaptist \"[[Council of Venice]]\" (1550) and the trial of [[Michael Servetus]] (1553) marked the clear emergence of markedly antitrinitarian Protestants. Though the only organised nontrinitarian churches were the [[Polish Brethren]] who split from the Calvinists (1565, expelled from Poland 1658), and the [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania]] (founded 1568). [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s, [[Dissenter]]s and [[Latitudinarian]]s in Britain were often [[Arian]]s or [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], and the [[Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813]] allowed nontrinitarian worship in Britain. In America, Arian and Unitarian views were also found among some [[Millennialist]] and [[Adventism|Adventist]] groups, though the [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian Church]] itself began to decline in numbers and influence after the 1870s.<ref>''Unitarians face a new age: the report of the Commission of Appraisal.''

They acknowledge the Son's high rank at [[Right hand of God|God's right hand]], but teach that the Father is still greater than the Son in all things.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the Father, Son, and Spirit are essential in creation and salvation, they argue that that in itself does not confirm that the three are each co-equal or co-eternal. They also affirm that God is only explicitly identified as \"one\" in the Bible, and that the doctrine of the Trinity, which word literally meaning ''a set of three'', ascribes a co-equal threeness to the being of the infinite God that is not explicitly scriptural.\n\n===Scriptural support===\nCritics of the Trinity doctrine argue that it, for a teaching described as fundamental, lacks direct scriptural support. Proponents of the doctrine assert that although the doctrine is not stated directly in the New Testament, it is instead an interpretation of elements contained therein that imply the doctrine that was later formulated in the 4th century.\n\n[[William Barclay (theologian)|William Barclay]], a [[Church of Scotland]] minister, says: \"It is important and helpful to remember that the word Trinity is not itself a New Testament word.

They argue that the same Greek word (''hen'') for \"one\" throughout John 17 indicates that Jesus did not expect for his followers to literally become a single Being, or \"one in substance\", with each other, or with God, and therefore that Jesus also did not expect his hearers to think that he and God the Father were one entity either.<ref name=\"WTBTS should you believe trinity\"/>\n\n==== John 20:28-29 ====\n{{bibleref2|John|20:28-29}}\u2014\"And Thomas answered and said to Him, \"My Lord and my God!\" Jesus said to him, \"Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed.

This process was done most thoroughly in the synthesis of Clement of Alexandria. It can be done in several ways. You can rake through Greek literature, and find (especially in the oldest seers and poets) references to 'God' which are more compatible with monotheism than with polytheism (so at length Athenagoras.) You can work out a common chronology between the legends of prehistoric (Homer) Greece and the biblical record (so Theophilus.) You can adapt a piece of pre-Christian Jewish apologetic, which claimed that Plato and other [[Greek philosophers]] got their best ideas indirectly from the teachings of Moses in the Bible, which was much earlier. This theory combines the advantage of making out the Greeks to be plagiarists (and therefore second-rate or criminal), while claiming that they support Christianity by their arguments at least some of the time.

However, the neo-Platonic trinity has the doctrine of emanation, or \"eternal derivation\", a timeless procedure of generation having as a source the One and claimed to be paralleled with the generation of the light from the Sun. This was adopted by Origen and later on by Athanasius, and applied to the generation of the Son from the Father, because they believed that this analogy could be used to support the notion that the Father, as immutable, always had been a Father, and that the generation of the Son is therefore eternal and timeless.<ref>''Select Treatises of St. Athanasius'' \u2013 In Controversy With the Arians \u2013 Freely Translated by John Henry Cardinal Newmann - Longmans, Green, and Co., 1911</ref>\n| The synthesis of Christianity with [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophy was further incorporated in the trinitarian formulas that appeared by the end of the 3rd century. \"The Greek philosophical theology\" was \"developed during the Trinitarian controversies over the relationships among the persons of the Godhead\".<ref>A.

Thus [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://archive.org/details/meditations0000marc_m9z0 |url-access=registration |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 <!--|ISBN=978-0-140-44140-6 --> |isbn=978-0-14044140-6}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Christian groups with nontrinitarian positions==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[American Unitarian Conference]]\n* [[Arianism]]\n* [[Assemblies of Yahweh]]\n* [[Bethel Ministerial Association]]\n* [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]]\n* [[Christadelphians]]\n* [[Church of Christ, Scientist]] ([[Christian Scientists]])<ref>Neusner, Jacob, ed. 2009.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government created [[Subsidy#Consumption subsidies|subsidy]] programs to increase the production of low-income housing and to help families pay their rent. In 1965, the Section 236 Leased Housing Program amended the U.S. Housing Act. This subsidy program, the predecessor to the modern program, was not a pure housing allowance program. Housing authorities selected eligible families from their waiting list, placed them in housing from a master list of available units, and determined the rent that tenants would have to pay. The housing authority would then sign a lease with the private landlord and pay the difference between the tenant's rent and the market rate for the same size unit. In the agreement with the private landlord, housing authorities agreed to perform regular building maintenance and leasing functions for Section 236 tenants, and annually reviewed the tenant's income for program eligibility and rent calculations.\n\nThe Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 introduced the federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program (EHAP) and the Community Development Corporation and authorized larger outlays for housing subsidy programs and rent supplements for moderate-income households.<ref>[http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/about/hud_history \"HUD History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231010927/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fabout%2Fhud_history |date=2012-12-31 }}, HUD website</ref><ref>Winnick, Louis, [http://www.huduser.org/periodicals/cityscpe/vol1num3/winnick.pdf \"The Triumph of Housing Allowance Programs: How a Fundamental Policy Conflict Was Resolved\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128232923/http://www.huduser.org/periodicals/cityscpe/vol1num3/winnick.pdf |date=2012-01-28 }}, ''Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research'', Volume 1, Number 3, September 1995, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, when studies showed that the worst housing problem afflicting low-income people was no longer substandard housing, but the high percentage of income spent on housing, Congress passed the [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1974]], further amending the [[Housing Act of 1937|U.S. Housing Act of 1937]] to create the Section 8 Program. In the Section 8 Program, tenants pay about 30 percent of their income for rent, while the rest of the rent is paid with federal money.\n\nThe Section 8 program initially had three subprograms\u2014New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, and Existing Housing Certificate programs. The Moderate Rehabilitation Program was added in 1978, the Voucher Program in 1983, and the Project-based Certificate program in 1991. The number of units a local housing authority can subsidize under its Section 8 programs is determined by Congressional funding. Since its inception, some Section 8 programs have been phased out and new ones created, although Congress has always renewed existing subsidies.\n\nThe 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (Public Law 110-161) enacted December 26, 2007, allocated $75 million funding for the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) voucher program, authorized under section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing Act of 1937.

This was enacted as part of Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA) (Sec. 508(b); 42 U.S.C. 1437a(d)).

In the article, Anrig accuses Rosin of placing an excessive amount of blame on housing policy for the reported increase in crime. The article makes reference to the fact that Rosin never made a conclusive argument that those who participate in Section 8 were responsible for the higher rates of crime, as those who receive housing support are subject to screenings based on drug use and previous criminal activity. Rosin instead relies on a heat map of crime created by Richard Janikowski and Phyllis Betts who are reported to have said they were \"[\u2026] amazed \u2013 and deflated \u2013 to see how perfectly the two data sets fit together.\"\n\nJanikowski and Betts later disavowed any connection between housing vouchers and increases in crime in the area in a later letter to the editor for the Atlantic. Rosin failed to mention that there was a consistent decrease and increase in crime from inner-cities to the inner-ring suburbs across most metropolitan areas due to shifting populations. Anrig argues that economic factors are more likely responsible for Memphis's increase in crime, as [[male unemployment]] almost doubled between the years of 1990 and 2000. Anrig also makes reference to Moving to Opportunity (MTO), a randomized policy experiment. The study concludes that there was no increase in violent crime for the participants of subsidized housing or their surrounding neighborhoods in the five cities tested; Memphis was not a part of the study. Even though the participants were far more likely to stay in poorer areas when given the chance to leave, families still received a modest academic and psychological benefit.

In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government created [[Subsidy#Consumption subsidies|subsidy]] programs to increase the production of low-income housing and to help families pay their rent. In 1965, the Section 236 Leased Housing Program amended the U.S. Housing Act. This subsidy program, the predecessor to the modern program, was not a pure housing allowance program. Housing authorities selected eligible families from their waiting list, placed them in housing from a master list of available units, and determined the rent that tenants would have to pay. The housing authority would then sign a lease with the private landlord and pay the difference between the tenant's rent and the market rate for the same size unit. In the agreement with the private landlord, housing authorities agreed to perform regular building maintenance and leasing functions for Section 236 tenants, and annually reviewed the tenant's income for program eligibility and rent calculations.\n\nThe Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 introduced the federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program (EHAP) and the Community Development Corporation and authorized larger outlays for housing subsidy programs and rent supplements for moderate-income households.<ref>[http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/about/hud_history \"HUD History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231010927/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fabout%2Fhud_history |date=2012-12-31 }}, HUD website</ref><ref>Winnick, Louis, [http://www.huduser.org/periodicals/cityscpe/vol1num3/winnick.pdf \"The Triumph of Housing Allowance Programs: How a Fundamental Policy Conflict Was Resolved\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128232923/http://www.huduser.org/periodicals/cityscpe/vol1num3/winnick.pdf |date=2012-01-28 }}, ''Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research'', Volume 1, Number 3, September 1995, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, when studies showed that the worst housing problem afflicting low-income people was no longer substandard housing, but the high percentage of income spent on housing, Congress passed the [[Housing and Community Development Act of 1974]], further amending the [[Housing Act of 1937|U.S. Housing Act of 1937]] to create the Section 8 Program. In the Section 8 Program, tenants pay about 30 percent of their income for rent, while the rest of the rent is paid with federal money.\n\nThe Section 8 program initially had three subprograms\u2014New Construction, Substantial Rehabilitation, and Existing Housing Certificate programs. The Moderate Rehabilitation Program was added in 1978, the Voucher Program in 1983, and the Project-based Certificate program in 1991. The number of units a local housing authority can subsidize under its Section 8 programs is determined by Congressional funding. Since its inception, some Section 8 programs have been phased out and new ones created, although Congress has always renewed existing subsidies.\n\nThe 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (Public Law 110-161) enacted December 26, 2007, allocated $75 million funding for the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) voucher program, authorized under section 8(o)(19) of the United States Housing Act of 1937.

In many instances a tenant may be removed from the program if they owe a previous landlord money).\n\nWhether voucher- or project-based, all subsidized units must meet the HQS, thus ensuring that the family has a healthy and safe place to live. This improvement in the landlord's private property is an important byproduct of this program, both for the individual families and for the larger goal of community development.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Applicants===\nApplicants may apply for a Section 8 housing voucher at any county or city housing authority office in their state, and although rules vary according to each authority, in general, residents of a particular area who receive a voucher from the jurisdiction in which they live may use the voucher anywhere in the country, but nonresidents of the jurisdiction must live in the jurisdiction that issues the voucher to them for 12 months before they can move to a different area. Also, priority for vouchers is often reserved for those who reside in the service area of that housing authority.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn many localities, the PHA waiting lists for Section 8 vouchers may be thousands of families long, waits of three to six years to obtain vouchers are common, and many lists are closed to new applicants. Wait lists are often briefly opened (often for just five days), which may occur as little as once every seven years. Some PHAs use a \"lottery\" approach, where there can be as many as 100,000 applicants for 10,000 spots on the waitlist, with spots being awarded on the basis of weighted or non-weighted lotteries, with priority sometimes given to local residents, the disabled, veterans, and the elderly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_17060183|title=Oakland Section 8 wait-list opens for five days beginning Jan. 25|work=InsideBayArea.com|date=2011-01-10|access-date=2011-04-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130015902/http://www.insidebayarea.com/ci_17060183|archive-date=2011-01-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Other PHAs will award a spot on the wait list to all who apply as long as the wait list is open, with vouchers being awarded in the order applications are received.

In recent years, the HUD Office of the Inspector General has spent more time and money on fraud detection and prevention.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n== Fair Market Rents ==\nFair Market Rents (FMRs) are calculated to determine how much a landlord is able to accept for rent of a unit to a Section 8 voucher recipient. FMRs are gross rental rates and dictate the maximum rental rate to be agreed upon in a lease document.<ref name=\":2\">https://www.huduser.gov/portal/sites/default/files/pdf/fmr-overview.pdf</ref> The calculation of FMRs is based on a standard quality rent from the five year [[American Community Survey]], as well as a recent mover adjustment, which is the relationship between the standard quality for five years and the one year recent mover rents. FMRs also include a [[Consumer price index|CPI]] adjustment and a trend factor adjustment. The trend factor adjustment is how HUD expects rental rates to grow. <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFMRs include all major utilities (heat, electricity, etc.), but does not include telephone, cable, satellite television, or internet service.

The project included the following Public Housing Authorities (PHAs): The Housing Authority of the County of Cook (IL), the City of Long Beach (CA) Housing Authority, the Chattanooga (TN) Housing Authority, the Town of Mamaroneck (NY) Housing Authority, and the Housing Authority of Laredo (TX). <ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAn early report states that the effects of this program need to be analyzed over a long period of time before determining results. Vincent Reina, Arthur Acolin, and Raphael W. Bostic, published an early examination of the new SAFMRP in 2019. This study finds varied results in the SAFMRP based on different metropolitan areas. Two areas of note are the highest performing city in the study and the lowest, Dallas, TX, and Chattanooga, TN, respectively. The authors argue that Dallas performed well with the SAFMRP because the city was required by court order to implement the program, and the program has been in place for longer than all other cities in the study. The authors state that the benefits of the SAFMRP change over time, and analysis of the program must include time series analysis for all effects. <ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Reina|first=Vincent|last2=Acolin|first2=Arthur|last3=Bostic|first3=Raphael W.|date=2019-01-02|title=Section 8 Vouchers and Rent Limits: Do Small Area Fair Market Rent Limits Increase Access to Opportunity Neighborhoods?

Two reasons include the fact that most rental units were already in accessible areas, and most residential areas in Chattanooga are low opportunity, therefor voucher recipients did not have increased choice with the implementation of the program. <ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Earned Income Disallowance ==\nThere is a provision for disabled people who have a Section 8 subsidized dwelling to have their rent frozen for a specified time if they are working part-time below a certain income level. This is called the Earned Income Disallowance or Earned Income Disregard (EID) and is stipulated under US 24 CFR 5.617, \"Self-sufficiency incentives for persons with disabilities\u2014Disallowance of increase in annual income\". This was enacted as part of Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA) (Sec. 508(b); 42 U.S.C. 1437a(d)). This requires Public Housing Authorities and some owners, in calculating rent, to temporarily \"disregard\" increased income earned when certain public housing residents and disabled participants in certain housing assistance programs return/go to work or job-related programs. The idea is to foster self-sufficiency for those who are on subsidies and disability and other assistance.<ref>HUD, [http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/phr/about/ao_faq_eid.cfm \"Admission and Occupancy FAQ Frequently Asked Questions : Treatment of Income (24 CFR 5.609)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513194003/http://www.hud.gov/offices/pih/phr/about/ao_faq_eid.cfm |date=2009-05-13 }}</ref><ref>Jordan, Melanie, [http://www.communityinclusion.org/article.php?article_id=195 \"Rent Freeze Basics for Public and Subsidized Housing Tenants Who Go to Work: A Guide for Mass.

In the article, Anrig accuses Rosin of placing an excessive amount of blame on housing policy for the reported increase in crime. The article makes reference to the fact that Rosin never made a conclusive argument that those who participate in Section 8 were responsible for the higher rates of crime, as those who receive housing support are subject to screenings based on drug use and previous criminal activity. Rosin instead relies on a heat map of crime created by Richard Janikowski and Phyllis Betts who are reported to have said they were \"[\u2026] amazed \u2013 and deflated \u2013 to see how perfectly the two data sets fit together.\"\n\nJanikowski and Betts later disavowed any connection between housing vouchers and increases in crime in the area in a later letter to the editor for the Atlantic. Rosin failed to mention that there was a consistent decrease and increase in crime from inner-cities to the inner-ring suburbs across most metropolitan areas due to shifting populations. Anrig argues that economic factors are more likely responsible for Memphis's increase in crime, as [[male unemployment]] almost doubled between the years of 1990 and 2000. Anrig also makes reference to Moving to Opportunity (MTO), a randomized policy experiment. The study concludes that there was no increase in violent crime for the participants of subsidized housing or their surrounding neighborhoods in the five cities tested; Memphis was not a part of the study. Even though the participants were far more likely to stay in poorer areas when given the chance to leave, families still received a modest academic and psychological benefit. In fact, according to a paper prepared for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Office of Policy Development and Research<ref>Ingrid, Gould,  Lens, Michael, O'Regan, Katherine [http://furmancenter.org/files/publications/American_Murder_Mystery_Revisited_32012.pdf \" Memphis Murder Mystery Revisited: Do Housing Voucher Households Cause Crime? \"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518030031/http://furmancenter.org/files/publications/American_Murder_Mystery_Revisited_32012.pdf |date=2016-05-18 }}, ''[[Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy]]'', March 2012</ref> rather than increasing crime, those who use housing vouchers are more likely to move into areas where crime is increasing.\n\n=== Housing Specialists ===\nMatthew Marr published a study of the Los Angeles housing market in Summer of 2001 that examines the effects of housing placement specialists on the Section 8 voucher program. Marr finds that housing placement specialists function as an intermediary between tenants and landlords that help increase mobility of Section 8 voucher recipients. <ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Marr|first=Matthew D.|date=2005-01-01|title=Mitigating apprehension about section 8 vouchers: The positive role of housing specialists in search and placement|journal=Housing Policy Debate|volume=16|issue=1|pages=85\u2013111|doi=10.1080/10511482.2005.9521535|issn=1051-1482|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/290f540cde4da56f7137e2ad28c932ee695976ef}}</ref>\n\nTight rental markets can pose a challenge to Section 8 voucher recipients.
