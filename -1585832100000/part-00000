{"title_page": "Roundedness", "text_new": "{{about|roundedness in vowels|roundedness in consonants|Labialization|other uses|roundness (disambiguation)}}\n{{short description|How the lips form during the articulation of a vowel}}\n{{IPA notice}}\n\nIn [[phonetics]], '''vowel roundedness''' refers to the amount of rounding in the [[lip]]s during the articulation of a [[vowel]]. It is [[labialization]] of a vowel. When a ''rounded'' vowel is pronounced, the lips form a circular opening, and ''unrounded'' vowels are pronounced with the lips relaxed. In most languages, [[front vowel]]s tend to be unrounded, and [[back vowel]]s tend to be rounded. However, some languages, such as [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], distinguish rounded and unrounded front vowels of the same [[vowel height|height]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] distinguishes rounded and unrounded back vowels of the same height. [[Alekano language|Alekano]] has only unrounded vowels.{{sfnp|Deibler|1992}} In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] vowel chart, rounded vowels are the ones that appear on the right in each pair of vowels. There are also diacritics, {{unichar|0339|COMBINING RIGHT HALF RING BELOW|ulink=Phonetic symbols in Unicode|cwith=&ensp;}} and {{unichar|031C|COMBINING LEFT HALF RING BELOW|ulink=Phonetic symbols in Unicode|cwith=&ensp;}}, to indicate greater and lesser degrees of rounding, respectively.\n\n==Types of rounding==\n{{anchor|Protrusion|Compression|Protruded vowel|Compressed vowel}}\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|header=Example 1\n|image1=Vowel-narrow-protruded-1.png\n|width1=714 |height1=680\n|caption1=Protruded rounding\n|image2=Vowel-narrow-compressed-1.png\n|width2=792 |height2=826\n|caption2=Compressed rounding\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|header=Example 2\n|image1=Vowel-narrow-protruded-2.jpg\n|width1=2048 |height1=1536\n|caption1=Protruded rounding\n|image2=Vowel-narrow-compressed-2.jpg\n|width2=2048 |height2=1536\n|caption2=Compressed rounding\n}}\nThere are two types of vowel rounding: ''protrusion'' and ''compression''.<ref>Protrusion is also called ''endolabial'', ''lip-pouting'', ''horizontal lip-rounding'', ''outrounding'', or ''inner rounding'' {{harv|Trask|1996|p=180}}.</ref><ref>Compression is also called ''exolabial'', ''pursed'', ''vertical lip-rounding'', ''inrounding'', or ''outer rounding'' {{harv|Trask|1996|p=252}}.</ref><ref>[[Henry Sweet]] noted in 1890 that \"the term 'inner rounding' derives from the use of the inner surfaces of the lips; the synonymous 'outrounding' derives from the forward projection of the lips. Both terms are justifiable, but their coexistence is likely to lead to serious confusion.\" {{harv|Trask|1996|p=180}}</ref> In protruded rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together and the lips protrude like a tube, with their inner surface visible. In compressed rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together, but the lips are also drawn together horizontally (\"compressed\") and do not protrude, with only their outer surface visible. That is, in protruded vowels the inner surfaces of the lips form the opening (thus the alternate term ''endolabial''), whereas in compressed vowels it is the margins of the lips which form the opening (thus ''exolabial).'' {{harvtxt|Catford|1982|p=172}} observes that back and central rounded vowels, such as German {{IPAslink|o}} and {{IPAslink|u}}, are typically protruded, whereas front rounded vowels such as German {{IPAslink|\u00f8}} and {{IPAslink|y}} are typically compressed. Back or central compressed vowels and front protruded vowels are uncommon,<ref>{{harvtxt|Sweet|1877}} noted that they are less distinctive from unrounded vowels than their counterparts.</ref> and a contrast between the two types has been found to be phonemic in only one instance.<ref>[[Japanese language|Japanese]] has a back compressed {{IPAblink|\u026f\u1d5d}} rather than protruded {{IPA|[u]}} {{harv|Okada|1999|p=118}}; [[Swedish language|Swedish]] also has a back compressed {{IPA|[\u026f\u1d5d]}} {{angbr|o}} as well as both front compressed {{IPA|[y]}} {{angbr|u}} and front protruded {{IPA|[y\u02b7]}} {{angbr|y}} {{harv|Engstrand|1999|p=141}}; the front rounded vowels contrast in ''ruta'' 'window pane' and ''ryta'' 'roar' {{harv|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=292}}.</ref>\n\nThere are no dedicated IPA diacritics to represent the distinction, but the superscript IPA letter {{IPAalink|\u03b2|\u25cc\u1d5d}} or {{IPAalink|\u028b|\u25cc\u1db9}} can be used for compression<ref>E.g. {{angbr IPA|\u0268\u1d5d}} in {{harvtxt|Flemming|2002|p=83}}; the IPA ''Handbook'' recommends that {{angbr IPA|\u1db9}} \"might be used\" for \"a secondary reduction of the lip opening accompanied by neither protrusion nor velar constriction\".</ref> and {{angbr IPA|\u25cc\u02b7}} for protrusion. Compressed vowels may be pronounced either with the corners of the mouth drawn in, by some definitions rounded, or with the corners spread and, by the same definitions, unrounded. The distinction may be transcribed {{angbr IPA|{{IPAplink|\u0289}}\u1d5d u\u1d5d}} vs {{angbr IPA|{{IPAplink|\u0268}}\u1d5d \u026f\u1d5d}} (or {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u1db9 u\u1db9}} vs {{angbr IPA|\u0268\u1db9 \u026f\u1db9}}).<ref>Occasionally other symbols may be used, such as protruded {{angbr|\u1eff}} ({{IPA|[y\u02b7]}}) and compressed {{angbr|\ua761}} ({{IPA|[\u0270\u1d5d]}}). To avoid the implication that the superscript represents an off-glide, it might be placed above the base letter: {{angbr IPA|y&#x1DF1;, \u026f&#x1DE9;}}.</ref>\n\nThe distinction between protruded {{IPA|[u]}} and compressed {{IPA|[y]}} holds for the [[semivowel]]s {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[\u0265]}} as well as labialization. In [[Akan language|Akan]], for example, the {{IPAblink|\u0265}} is compressed, as are [[labio-palatalization|labio-palatalized]] consonants as in ''Twi'' {{IPA|[t\u0255\u1da3i\u0318]}} \"Twi\" and ''adwuma'' {{IPA|[ad\u0291\u1da3u\u0318ma]}} \"work\", whereas {{IPA|[w]}} and simply labialized consonants are protruded.{{sfnp|Dolphyne|1988}} In Japanese, the {{IPA|/w/}} is compressed rather than protruded, paralleling the Japanese {{IPA|/u/}}. The distinction applies marginally to other consonants. In [[Kukuya language|Southern Teke]], the sole language reported to have a phonemic {{IPAslink|\u0271}}, the labiodental sound is \"accompanied by strong protrusion of both lips\",{{sfnp|Paulian|1975}} whereas the {{IPAblink|\u0271}} found as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f, v/}} in languages such as English is not protruded, as the lip contacts the teeth along its upper or outer edge. Also, in at least one account of speech acquisition, a child's pronunciation of ''clown'' involves a lateral {{IPA|[f]}} with the upper teeth contacting the upper-outer edge of the lip, but in ''crown'', a non-lateral {{IPA|[f]}} is pronounced with the teeth contacting the inner surface of the protruded lower lip.{{sfnp|Kelly|Local|1989|p=41}}\n\nSome vowels transcribed with rounded IPA letters may not be rounded at all. An example is {{IPAslink|\u0252}}, the vowel of ''lot'', which in [[Received Pronunciation]] has very little if any rounding of the lips. The \"throaty\" sound of the vowel is instead accomplished with [[sulcalization]], a furrowing of the back of the tongue also found in {{IPAslink|\u025c\u02d0}}, the vowel of ''nurse''.{{sfnp|Lass|1984|p=124}}\n\nIt is possible to mimic the acoustic effect of rounded vowels by narrowing the cheeks, so-called \"cheek rounding\", which is inherent in back protruded (but not front compressed) vowels. The technique is used by ventriloquists to mask the visible rounding of back vowels like {{IPA|[u]}}.{{sfnp|Sweet|1877|pp=14, 20}} It is not clear if it is used by languages with rounded vowels that do not use visible rounding.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Unrounded, compressed and protruded vowels\n!\n!

Front vowels are usually pronounced with the lips spread, and the spreading becomes more significant as the height of the vowel increases.{{sfnp|Westerman|Ward|2015|p=27}} Open vowels are often neutral, i.e. neither rounded nor spread, because the open jaw allows for limited rounding or spreading of the lips.{{sfnp|Robins|2014|p=90}} This is reflected in the IPA's definition of the [[Cardinal vowel|cardinal]] {{IPAblink|a}}, which is unrounded yet not spread either.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=13}}\n\n==Roundedness and labialization==\nProtruded rounding is the vocalic equivalent of consonantal [[labialization]]. Thus, rounded vowels and labialized consonants affect one another by [[assimilation (linguistics)|phonetic assimilation]]: Rounded vowels labialize consonants, and labialized consonants round vowels.\n\nIn many languages, such effects are minor phonetic detail, but in others, they become significant. For example, in [[Standard Chinese phonology|Standard Chinese]], the vowel {{IPA|/\u0254/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[u\u032f\u0254]}} after labial consonants,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} an allophonic effect that is so important that it is encoded in [[pinyin]] transliteration: alveolar {{IPA|/tu\u032f\u0254\u02e5/}} {{IPAc-cmn|d|uo|1}} ({{Zh|p=du\u014d|labels=no|c=\u591a|s=|t=}}) 'many' vs. labial {{IPA|/pu\u032f\u0254\u02e5/}} {{IPAc-cmn|b|o|1}} ({{Zh|p=b\u014d|labels=no|c=\u6ce2}}) 'wave'. In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the opposite assimilation takes place: velar codas {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} are pronounced as labialized {{IPA|[k\u02b7]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b\u02b7]}} or even [[labial-velar consonant|labial-velar]] {{IPA|[kp]}} and {{IPA|[\u014bm]}}, after the rounded vowels {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] of the Caucasus and the [[Sepik languages]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], historically rounded vowels have become unrounded, with the rounding being taken up by the consonant. Thus, Sepik {{IPA|[ku]}} and {{IPA|[ko]}} are phonemically {{IPA|/kw\u0268/}} and {{IPA|/kw\u0259/}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn the extinct [[Ubykh phonology|Ubykh]], {{IPA|[ku]}} and {{IPA|[ko]}} were phonemically {{IPA|/k\u02b7\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b7a/}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A few ancient [[Indo-European languages]] like [[Latin]] had labiovelar consonants.{{sfnp|Allen|1978}}\n\n==Phonemic roundedness in English==\nIt is rare for accents of English to differentiate vowels only by their roundedness. Minimal pairs like this can be found in some [[British English|British]] dialects (such as the [[Cardiff dialect]], [[Geordie]] and [[Port Talbot English]]) as well as in General [[South African English]]. Most commonly, they involve a contrastive pair of [[close-mid vowel]]s, with the unrounded vowel being either {{sc2|SQUARE}} {{IPAc-en|\u025b\u0259r}} or a monophthongal {{sc2|FACE}} {{IPAc-en|e\u026a}} and the rounded counterpart being {{sc2|NURSE}} {{IPAc-en|\u025c\u02d0r}}. Contrasts based on roundedness are rarely categorical in English and they may be enhanced by additional differences in height, backness or diphthongization.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|1990|pp=88, 95}}{{sfnp|Connolly|1990|pp=122\u2013123, 125}}{{sfnp|Lass|2002}}{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Phonemic roundedness in English\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Accent\n! colspan=\"3\" | Vowel\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! {{sc|FACE}}\n! {{sc|SQUARE}}\n! {{sc|NURSE}}\n|-\n!

It is [[labialization]] of a vowel. When a ''rounded'' vowel is pronounced, the lips form a circular opening, and ''unrounded'' vowels are pronounced with the lips relaxed. In most languages, [[front vowel]]s tend to be unrounded, and [[back vowel]]s tend to be rounded. However, some languages, such as [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], distinguish rounded and unrounded front vowels of the same [[vowel height|height]], and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] distinguishes rounded and unrounded back vowels of the same height. [[Alekano language|Alekano]] has only unrounded vowels.{{sfnp|Deibler|1992}} In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] vowel chart, rounded vowels are the ones that appear on the right in each pair of vowels. There are also diacritics, {{unichar|0339|COMBINING RIGHT HALF RING BELOW|ulink=Phonetic symbols in Unicode|cwith=&ensp;}} and {{unichar|031C|COMBINING LEFT HALF RING BELOW|ulink=Phonetic symbols in Unicode|cwith=&ensp;}}, to indicate greater and lesser degrees of rounding, respectively.\n\n==Types of rounding==\n{{anchor|Protrusion|Compression|Protruded vowel|Compressed vowel}}\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|header=Example 1\n|image1=Vowel-narrow-protruded-1.png\n|width1=714 |height1=680\n|caption1=Protruded rounding\n|image2=Vowel-narrow-compressed-1.png\n|width2=792 |height2=826\n|caption2=Compressed rounding\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=300\n|header=Example 2\n|image1=Vowel-narrow-protruded-2.jpg\n|width1=2048 |height1=1536\n|caption1=Protruded rounding\n|image2=Vowel-narrow-compressed-2.jpg\n|width2=2048 |height2=1536\n|caption2=Compressed rounding\n}}\nThere are two types of vowel rounding: ''protrusion'' and ''compression''.<ref>Protrusion is also called ''endolabial'', ''lip-pouting'', ''horizontal lip-rounding'', ''outrounding'', or ''inner rounding'' {{harv|Trask|1996|p=180}}.</ref><ref>Compression is also called ''exolabial'', ''pursed'', ''vertical lip-rounding'', ''inrounding'', or ''outer rounding'' {{harv|Trask|1996|p=252}}.</ref><ref>[[Henry Sweet]] noted in 1890 that \"the term 'inner rounding' derives from the use of the inner surfaces of the lips; the synonymous 'outrounding' derives from the forward projection of the lips. Both terms are justifiable, but their coexistence is likely to lead to serious confusion.\" {{harv|Trask|1996|p=180}}</ref> In protruded rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together and the lips protrude like a tube, with their inner surface visible. In compressed rounding, the corners of the mouth are drawn together, but the lips are also drawn together horizontally (\"compressed\") and do not protrude, with only their outer surface visible. That is, in protruded vowels the inner surfaces of the lips form the opening (thus the alternate term ''endolabial''), whereas in compressed vowels it is the margins of the lips which form the opening (thus ''exolabial).'' {{harvtxt|Catford|1982|p=172}} observes that back and central rounded vowels, such as German {{IPAslink|o}} and {{IPAslink|u}}, are typically protruded, whereas front rounded vowels such as German {{IPAslink|\u00f8}} and {{IPAslink|y}} are typically compressed. Back or central compressed vowels and front protruded vowels are uncommon,<ref>{{harvtxt|Sweet|1877}} noted that they are less distinctive from unrounded vowels than their counterparts.</ref> and a contrast between the two types has been found to be phonemic in only one instance.<ref>[[Japanese language|Japanese]] has a back compressed {{IPAblink|\u026f\u1d5d}} rather than protruded {{IPA|[u]}} {{harv|Okada|1999|p=118}}; [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]] also has a back compressed {{IPA|[\u026f\u1d5d]}} {{angbr|o}} as well as both front compressed {{IPA|[y]}} {{angbr|u}} and front protruded {{IPA|[y\u02b7]}} {{angbr|y}} {{harv|Engstrand|1999|p=141}}; the front rounded vowels contrast in ''ruta'' 'window pane' and ''ryta'' 'roar' {{harv|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=292}}.</ref>\n\nThere are no dedicated IPA diacritics to represent the distinction, but the superscript IPA letter {{IPAalink|\u03b2|\u25cc\u1d5d}} or {{IPAalink|\u028b|\u25cc\u1db9}} can be used for compression<ref>E.g. {{angbr IPA|\u0268\u1d5d}} in {{harvtxt|Flemming|2002|p=83}}; the IPA ''Handbook'' recommends that {{angbr IPA|\u1db9}} \"might be used\" for \"a secondary reduction of the lip opening accompanied by neither protrusion nor velar constriction\".</ref> and {{angbr IPA|\u25cc\u02b7}} for protrusion. Compressed vowels may be pronounced either with the corners of the mouth drawn in, by some definitions rounded, or with the corners spread and, by the same definitions, unrounded. The distinction may be transcribed {{angbr IPA|{{IPAplink|\u0289}}\u1d5d u\u1d5d}} vs {{angbr IPA|{{IPAplink|\u0268}}\u1d5d \u026f\u1d5d}} (or {{angbr IPA|\u0289\u1db9 u\u1db9}} vs {{angbr IPA|\u0268\u1db9 \u026f\u1db9}}).<ref>Occasionally other symbols may be used, such as protruded {{angbr|\u1eff}} ({{IPA|[y\u02b7]}}) and compressed {{angbr|\ua761}} ({{IPA|[\u0270\u1d5d]}}). To avoid the implication that the superscript represents an off-glide, it might be placed above the base letter: {{angbr IPA|y&#x1DF1;, \u026f&#x1DE9;}}.</ref>\n\nThe distinction between protruded {{IPA|[u]}} and compressed {{IPA|[y]}} holds for the [[semivowel]]s {{IPA|[w]}} and {{IPA|[\u0265]}} as well as labialization. In [[Akan language|Akan]], for example, the {{IPAblink|\u0265}} is compressed, as are [[labio-palatalization|labio-palatalized]] consonants as in ''Twi'' {{IPA|[t\u0255\u1da3i\u0318]}} \"Twi\" and ''adwuma'' {{IPA|[ad\u0291\u1da3u\u0318ma]}} \"work\", whereas {{IPA|[w]}} and simply labialized consonants are protruded.{{sfnp|Dolphyne|1988}} In Japanese, the {{IPA|/w/}} is compressed rather than protruded, paralleling the Japanese {{IPA|/u/}}. The distinction applies marginally to other consonants. In [[Kukuya language|Southern Teke]], the sole language reported to have a phonemic {{IPAslink|\u0271}}, the labiodental sound is \"accompanied by strong protrusion of both lips\",{{sfnp|Paulian|1975}} whereas the {{IPAblink|\u0271}} found as an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f, v/}} in languages such as English is not protruded, as the lip contacts the teeth along its upper or outer edge. Also, in at least one account of speech acquisition, a child's pronunciation of ''clown'' involves a lateral {{IPA|[f]}} with the upper teeth contacting the upper-outer edge of the lip, but in ''crown'', a non-lateral {{IPA|[f]}} is pronounced with the teeth contacting the inner surface of the protruded lower lip.{{sfnp|Kelly|Local|1989|p=41}}\n\nSome vowels transcribed with rounded IPA letters may not be rounded at all. An example is {{IPAslink|\u0252}}, the vowel of ''lot'', which in [[Received Pronunciation]] has very little if any rounding of the lips. The \"throaty\" sound of the vowel is instead accomplished with [[sulcalization]], a furrowing of the back of the tongue also found in {{IPAslink|\u025c\u02d0}}, the vowel of ''nurse''.{{sfnp|Lass|1984|p=124}}\n\nIt is possible to mimic the acoustic effect of rounded vowels by narrowing the cheeks, so-called \"cheek rounding\", which is inherent in back protruded (but not front compressed) vowels. The technique is used by ventriloquists to mask the visible rounding of back vowels like {{IPA|[u]}}.{{sfnp|Sweet|1877|pp=14, 20}} It is not clear if it is used by languages with rounded vowels that do not use visible rounding.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Unrounded, compressed and protruded vowels\n!\n!

Front vowels are usually pronounced with the lips spread, and the spreading becomes more significant as the height of the vowel increases.{{sfnp|Westerman|Ward|2015|p=27}} Open vowels are often neutral, i.e. neither rounded nor spread, because the open jaw allows for limited rounding or spreading of the lips.{{sfnp|Robins|2014|p=90}} This is reflected in the IPA's definition of the [[Cardinal vowel|cardinal]] {{IPAblink|a}}, which is unrounded yet not spread either.{{sfnp|International Phonetic Association|1999|p=13}}\n\n==Roundedness and labialization==\nProtruded rounding is the vocalic equivalent of consonantal [[labialization]]. Thus, rounded vowels and labialized consonants affect one another by [[assimilation (linguistics)|phonetic assimilation]]: Rounded vowels labialize consonants, and labialized consonants round vowels.\n\nIn many languages, such effects are minor phonetic detail, but in others, they become significant. For example, in [[Standard Chinese phonology|Standard Chinese]], the vowel {{IPA|/\u0254/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[u\u032f\u0254]}} after labial consonants,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} an allophonic effect that is so important that it is encoded in [[pinyin]] transliteration: alveolar {{IPA|/tu\u032f\u0254\u02e5/}} {{IPAc-cmn|d|uo|1}} ({{Zh|p=du\u014d|labels=no|c=\u591a|s=|t=}}) 'many' vs. labial {{IPA|/pu\u032f\u0254\u02e5/}} {{IPAc-cmn|b|o|1}} ({{Zh|p=b\u014d|labels=no|c=\u6ce2}}) 'wave'. In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the opposite assimilation takes place: velar codas {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} are pronounced as labialized {{IPA|[k\u02b7]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b\u02b7]}} or even [[labial-velar consonant|labial-velar]] {{IPA|[kp]}} and {{IPA|[\u014bm]}}, after the rounded vowels {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] of the Caucasus and the [[Sepik languages]] of [[Papua New Guinea]], historically rounded vowels have become unrounded, with the rounding being taken up by the consonant. Thus, Sepik {{IPA|[ku]}} and {{IPA|[ko]}} are phonemically {{IPA|/kw\u0268/}} and {{IPA|/kw\u0259/}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nIn the extinct [[Ubykh phonology|Ubykh]], {{IPA|[ku]}} and {{IPA|[ko]}} were phonemically {{IPA|/k\u02b7\u0259/}} and {{IPA|/k\u02b7a/}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A few ancient [[Indo-European languages]] like [[Latin]] had labiovelar consonants.{{sfnp|Allen|1978}}\n\n==Phonemic roundedness in English==\nIt is rare for accents of English to differentiate vowels only by their roundedness. Minimal pairs like this can be found in some [[British English|British]] dialects (such as the [[Cardiff dialect]], [[Geordie]] and [[Port Talbot English]]) as well as in General [[South African English]]. Most commonly, they involve a contrastive pair of [[close-mid vowel]]s, with the unrounded vowel being either {{sc2|SQUARE}} {{IPAc-en|\u025b\u0259r}} or a monophthongal {{sc2|FACE}} {{IPAc-en|e\u026a}} and the rounded counterpart being {{sc2|NURSE}} {{IPAc-en|\u025c\u02d0r}}. Contrasts based on roundedness are rarely categorical in English and they may be enhanced by additional differences in height, backness or diphthongization.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|1990|pp=88, 95}}{{sfnp|Connolly|1990|pp=122\u2013123, 125}}{{sfnp|Lass|2002}}{{sfnp|Watt|Allen|2003|p=269}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Phonemic roundedness in English\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Accent\n! colspan=\"3\" | Vowel\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n! {{sc|FACE}}\n! {{sc|SQUARE}}\n! {{sc|NURSE}}\n|-\n!

Others, however, were collaborations with other artists, like composing the superhit ''Ya Nabi Salam Alayka'' for the then-fellow artist in [[Awakening Records]] [[Maher Zain]], and contributing to arranging the cartoony re-make titled ''Egyptian Jingle Bell''s or the ''Oh la la song''<ref>{{Cite news|last=\u0623\u064a\u0645\u0646 [Ayman]|first=\u0643\u0631\u0645\u0629 [Karma]|url=https://masralarabia.net/%D9%81%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%AB%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A9/175951-%D9%81%D9%84%D9%83%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D9%86%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%B6%D9%87-%D9%85%D9%83%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%86|title=\"\u0641\u0644\u0643\u0632\u064a\u0648\u0646\" \u0645\u0639 \u062d\u0645\u0632\u0629 \u0646\u0645\u0631\u0629: \u0628\u0631\u0636\u0647 \u0645\u0643\u0645\u0644\u064a\u0646 [Follkzion with Hamza Namira: we are going on]|date=|work=Masr al-Arabiya|access-date=2 Apr 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Beginnings===\nNamira started to develop an interest in music when he was 17 years old, and he set about learning the guitar, keyboard, and \u2018oud.

It marked the culmination of the [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the third edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], but was the first time a final had been held; both the previous events had been [[round-robin tournament]]s. Both Australia and England had previously won the competition; England won [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|the inaugural tournament in 1973]], while Australia won [[1978 Women's Cricket World Cup|in 1978]]. Australia won the match [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|by three wickets]] to claim their second world title.\n\nAustralia and England won finished first and second in the league-stage to claim their places in the final. Australia had gone unbeaten throughout the round-robin, having won eleven of their matches and [[Tie (cricket)|tied]] with England in the other. England had won seven of their matches, lost three and tied twice, and finished 14 points behind Australia and 6 ahead of New Zealand. The final was [[Umpire (cricket)|umpired]] by [[Dickie Bird]] and [[Fred Goodall]]. England [[Batting (cricket)|batted]] first in the final, and scored slowly, particularly against Australia's [[spin bowling]]. [[Jan Southgate]] top-scored for England with 53 [[Run (cricket)|runs]], as they made 151 for five. In response, Australia initially struggled, losing their first three wickets for 28 runs.

It marked the culmination of the [[1982 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the third edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], but was the first time a final had been held; both the previous events had been [[round-robin tournament]]s. Both Australia and England had previously won the competition; England won [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|the inaugural tournament in 1973]], while Australia won [[1978 Women's Cricket World Cup|in 1978]]. Australia won the match [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|by three wickets]] to claim their second world title.\n\nAustralia and England won finished first and second in the league-stage to claim their places in the final. Australia had gone unbeaten throughout the round-robin, having won eleven of their matches and [[Tie (cricket)|tied]] with England in the other. England had won seven of their matches, lost three and tied twice, and finished 14 points behind Australia and 6 ahead of New Zealand. The final was [[Umpire (cricket)|umpired]] by [[Dickie Bird]] and [[Fred Goodall]]. England [[Batting (cricket)|batted]] first in the final, and scored slowly, particularly against Australia's [[spin bowling]]. [[Jan Southgate]] top-scored for England with 53 [[Run (cricket)|runs]], as they made 151 for five. In response, Australia initially struggled, losing their first three wickets for 28 runs.
