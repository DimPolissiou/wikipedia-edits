{"title_page": "I-message", "text_new": "In [[interpersonal communication]], an '''I-message''' or '''I-statement''' is an assertion about the feelings, beliefs, values, etc. of the person speaking, generally expressed as a sentence beginning with the word \"I\", and is contrasted with a \"'''you-message'''\" or \"'''you-statement'''\", which often begins with the word \"you\" and focuses on the person spoken to.  [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]] coined the term \"I message\" in the 1960s while doing play therapy with children. He added the concept to his book for parents, ''P.E.T.: Parent Effectiveness Training'' (1970).<ref>[[#refGordon1995|Gordon 1995]] p. xiii</ref><ref>Gordon, Thomas. [http://www.gordontraining.com/thomas-gordon/origins-of-the-gordon-model/ Origins of the Gordon Model]. Gordon Training International. Retrieved on: 2012-01-17.</ref>  Not every message that begins with the word \"I\" is an I-message.\n\nI-messages are often used with the intent to be [[assertive]] without putting the listener on the defensive by avoiding [[accusation]]s. They are also used to take ownership for one's feelings rather than implying that they are caused by another person. An example of this would be to say: \"I really am getting backed up on my work since I don't have the financial report yet\", rather than: \"you didn't finish the financial report on time!\" (The latter is an example of a \"you-statement\").<ref>[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/istate.htm \"I\" Statements not \"You\" Statements], International Online Training Program On Intractable Conflict, Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, USA</ref>  \n\nI-messages or I-statements can also be used in [[constructive criticism]]. For instance, one might say, \"I had to read that section of your paper three times before I understood it\", rather than, \"This section is worded in a really confusing way\", or \"You need to learn how to word a paper more clearly.\" The former comment leaves open the possibility that the fault lies with the giver of the criticism. According to the Conflict Resolution Network, I-statements are a [[dispute resolution]] [[conversation opener]] that can be used to state how one sees things and how one would like things to be, without using inflaming language.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023214256/http://www.crnhq.org/windskill4.html When to Use \"I\" Statements] from 12 Skills: 4.

(objective event; 1st event),\n# I feel... (subjective feeling; 2nd event).\nIt should be cautioned that \"when you...\" should be based on an objective event and avoid claims regarding intent. \"When you said my birthday was in the wrong month, I felt like you don't care about me,\" is preferred over, \"When you act like you don't care about me and my birthday...\" This allows people talking to focus on events and feelings as separate events, which both allows people to express their feelings more clearly and helps clarify the initial event and reach agreement between parties.\n\nA three-part model is proposed by the University of Tennessee Family & Consumer Sciences for improving communication with children:\n# I feel... (Insert feeling word)\n# when... (tell what caused the feeling).\n# I would like...

For example: \"I feel..., when you..., and I want you to...\" This can put the receiver of the statement on the defensive. In a dispute, use of a phrase that begins with \"I want\" may encourage the parties to engage in positional [[problem solving]].  Positional problem solving is stating the outcome that the person wants, rather than the reason the person wants the problem solved.  For example, \"I want you to take out the trash every night\" is positional problem solving, and \"I don't want the kitchen to smell bad\" is the reason.  Declaring a single acceptable solution at the start makes many conflicts more difficult to resolve. \n\nAn \"interest-based\" approach to conflict resolution suggests using statements that reflect why the individual wants something.<ref name=\"Ohio\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20101227141411/http://disputeresolution.ohio.gov/schools/contentpages/Istate21.htm Rethinking \"I\" Statements], from Communication Skills, Skills and Concepts of Conflict Management.

[[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]] coined the term \"I message\" in the 1960s while doing play therapy with children. He added the concept to his book for parents, ''P.E.T.: Parent Effectiveness Training'' (1970).<ref>[[#refGordon1995|Gordon 1995]] p. xiii</ref><ref>Gordon, Thomas.

They are also used to take ownership for one's feelings rather than implying that they are caused by another person. An example of this would be to say: \"I really am getting backed up on my work since I don't have the financial report yet\", rather than: \"you didn't finish the financial report on time!\" (The latter is an example of a \"you-statement\").<ref>[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/istate.htm \"I\" Statements not \"You\" Statements], International Online Training Program On Intractable Conflict, Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, USA</ref>  \n\nI-messages or I-statements can also be used in [[constructive criticism]]. For instance, one might say, \"I had to read that section of your paper three times before I understood it\", rather than, \"This section is worded in a really confusing way\", or \"You need to learn how to word a paper more clearly.\" The former comment leaves open the possibility that the fault lies with the giver of the criticism. According to the Conflict Resolution Network, I-statements are a [[dispute resolution]] [[conversation opener]] that can be used to state how one sees things and how one would like things to be, without using inflaming language.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071023214256/http://www.crnhq.org/windskill4.html When to Use \"I\" Statements] from 12 Skills: 4.

Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Ancient Egypt]]ian, [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Babylonian]], [[Phoenicia under Assyrian rule|Assyrian]], [[Hittites|Hittite]] and [[Phoenicia]]n rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDnQwCJXUowC|title=Lebanon a country study|date=1989|language=en}}</ref> More recently, Lebanese cuisine was influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the Bekaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as [[Sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the [[tapas]] of [[Spain]], ''mezeluri'' of [[Romania]] and aperitivo of [[Italy]], ''[[mezze]]'' is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsNyprRS7EIC&pg=PA268|title=The Meal: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 2001|date=2002|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-24-8|page=268}}</ref><ref name=\"Cavendish\">{{Cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Marshall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA979|title=World and Its Peoples|date=September 2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=979}}</ref> This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s.

Family cuisine offers also a range of dishes, such as stews (or yakhneh), which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with [[meat]] and rice vermicelli.

From 1516 to 1918, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. After the Ottomans were defeated in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918), [[France]] took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The [[France|French]] introduced foods such as [[Flan (pie)|flan]], a [[caramel custard]] dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, [[eclairs]], [[french fries]] and [[croissant]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YEcLaAEACAAJ|title=The Culinary Heritage of Lebanon|last=Choueiri|first=Ramzi N.|date=2002-01-01|publisher=Ramzi Choueiri|isbn=978-9953-0-0753-3|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lebanese diaspora]] who live worldwide have introduced new foods, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hannam|first=Kevin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHTDCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|title=Event Mobilities: Politics, place and performance|last2=Mostafanezhad|first2=Mary|last3=Rickly|first3=Jillian|date=2016-03-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-45047-4|page=136}}</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nMost often foods are grilled, baked or saut\u00e9ed in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. Like most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. South Lebanon is famous for its Kibbe, the Bekaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as [[Sfiha]]), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets. \n\nIn [[Lebanon]], very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the [[tapas]] of [[Spain]], ''mezeluri'' of [[Romania]] and aperitivo of [[Italy]], ''[[mezze]]'' is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Walker|first=Harlan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GsNyprRS7EIC&pg=PA268|title=The Meal: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery, 2001|date=2002|publisher=Oxford Symposium|isbn=978-1-903018-24-8|page=268}}</ref><ref name=\"Cavendish\">{{Cite book|last=Cavendish|first=Marshall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA979|title=World and Its Peoples|date=September 2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|page=979}}</ref> This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s. Mezze may be as simple as raw or [[pickled vegetables]], [[hummus]], [[baba ghanouj]] and bread, or it may become an entire meal consisting of grilled marinated [[seafood]], skewered meats, a variety of cooked and raw salads and an arrangement of desserts. Family cuisine offers also a range of dishes, such as stews (or yakhneh), which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with [[meat]] and rice vermicelli.
