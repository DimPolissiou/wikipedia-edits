To be recognised as a ''prima ballerina assoluta'' is a rare honour, traditionally reserved only for the most exceptional dancers of their generation. Originally inspired by the Italian ballet masters of the early [[Romantic ballet]], and literally meaning ''absolute first ballerina'', the title was bestowed on a [[prima ballerina]] who was considered to be exceptionally talented, above the standard of other leading ballerinas. The title is very rarely used today and recent uses have typically been symbolic, either in recognition of a prestigious international career, or for exceptional service to a particular ballet company. There is no universal procedure for designating who may receive the title, which has led to dispute in the ballet community over who can legitimately claim it. It is usually a ballet company that bestows the title, however some dancers have had the title officially sanctioned by a government or head of state, sometimes for political rather than artistic reasons. Less common is for a dancer to become identified as a ''prima ballerina assoluta'' as a result of public and critical opinion.\n\n==History==\nThe first recorded use of the title as a company rank was in 1894, when [[French people|French]] [[ballet master]] [[Marius Petipa]] bestowed it on [[Italian people|Italian]] ballerina [[Pierina Legnani]]. He considered her to be the supreme leading ballerina in all of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe second ballerina to be given the title was Legnani's contemporary [[Mathilde Kschessinska]]. Petipa, however, did not agree that she should hold such a title; although an extraordinary ballerina, he felt that she obtained the title primarily via her connections with the [[Imperial Russia]]n court{{who|date=November 2013}}.\n\nThe only [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ballerinas to hold the title were [[Galina Ulanova]] and [[Maya Plisetskaya]] and [[Natalia Makarova]], who defected to the West in 1970. The Swiss-born American [[Eva Evdokimova]] became recognised as a ''prima ballerina assoluta'' following guest appearances with the [[Kirov Ballet]] in the 1970s, when she was named as such by the company ballet mistress, [[Natalia Dudinskaya]].<ref>R\u00fcbsam, Henning [https://web.archive.org/web/20120119044704/http://www.juilliard.edu/journal/2009-2010/0909/articles/0909_Forum.php \"Eva, Pina, Merce, and Michael\"].

The team is currently ranked first in the [[FIBA World Rankings]].\n\nTraditionally composed of amateur players, the U.S. dominated the first decades of international basketball, winning a record seven consecutive Olympic gold medals. However, by the end of the 1980s, American amateurs were no longer competitive against seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]] and [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Tyler Benson\">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union|publisher=blogs.bu.edu|author=Tyler Benson}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf|title=Soviet Sports and Intelligence Activities|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|work=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005800260002-1.pdf|title=Soviet Sports as an Instrument of Political Propaganda|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|work=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref>\n\nIn 1989, [[FIBA]] modified its rules and allowed [[USA Basketball]] to field teams with [[National Basketball Association]] players.

The [[2004 United States men's Olympic basketball team|2004 Olympic team]], being depleted by a number of withdrawals, lost three games on its way to a bronze medal, a record that represented more losses in a single year than the country's Olympic teams had suffered in all previous Olympiads combined.\n\nDetermined to put an end to these failures, USA Basketball initiated a long-term project aimed at creating better, more cohesive teams. The U.S. won its first seven games at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]] in Japan before losing against [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]] in the semi-finals; ending the competition with the bronze medal. The team won gold two years later \u2013 at the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]] \u2013 in a dominant fashion. This success was followed up at the [[2010 FIBA World Championship]], where despite fielding a roster featuring no players from the [[2008 United States men's Olympic basketball team|2008 Olympic team]], the U.S. did not lose a single game en route to defeating host [[Turkey national basketball team|Turkey]] for the gold medal.\n\nThe Americans continued this streak of dominance in the 2010s by going undefeated and capturing gold at the [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2012 Summer Olympics]], and [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2014 FIBA World Cup]] until [[2019 FIBA World Cup]], where they lost to France in the Quarter-finals, finishing 7th overall. At the [[Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2016 Summer Olympics]], the team, led by [[Mike Krzyzewski]] for a record third time, won its fifteenth gold medal, making him the most decorated coach in USA Basketball history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usab.com/history/national-team-mens/games-of-the-xxxith-olympiad-2016.aspx|title=Games of the XXXIth Olympiad -- 2016|publisher=USA Basketball}}</ref><ref name=\"USA Men's Olympic Team History\"/>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n===1936\u20131968===\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|thumb|left|Game between the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]] in the 1952 Olympics]]\nThe US men were dominant from the first Olympic tournament to hold basketball, held in Berlin in [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936]], going 5\u20130 to win the gold, and joined by continental neighbors Canada and Mexico on the medal platform.

Their roster featured five players returning from the 2008 Olympic team and five others from the 2010 World Championship team.\n\nThe US went undefeated but appeared vulnerable at times in winning five exhibition games. They finished the tournament with a perfect 8\u20130 record, defeating opponents by an average of 32 points while trailing in the fourth quarter only once. The Americans often played with a [[Small ball (basketball)|small lineup]] that emphasized speed, quickness, and outside shooting.

The roster was filled with two players returning from the 2012 Olympic team, three from the 2010 FIBA Championship Team, while seven other NBA players made their senior international debuts. The 2014 roster featured four players 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) or larger, the most of any USA team since [[Mike Krzyzewski]] began coaching the team in 2006. The team was also the youngest American team since [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|1992]] when NBA players were first allowed on the team; the average player was 24.08 years old, roughly a half-year younger than their 2010 team.\n\nThe team advanced to the knockout phase after starting the tournament 5\u20130 during the group stage. They went undefeated 9\u20130 in the tournament, winning by an average margin of 33.0 points. The United States was just the third country in World Cup history to repeat as champions. Combined with their 2010 World Championship along with gold by their 2008 and 2012 Olympic teams, they also became the first country in FIBA basketball history to win four consecutive major titles. The United States defeated [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbia]] in the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] by 37 points and clinched a berth for the [[Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\nMultiple withdrawals (largely triggered by a freak injury to [[Paul George]] in a pre-2014 World Cup scrimmage) left the 2016 U.S. team with just two players with prior Olympic experience (Durant and Anthony). The Americans seemed vulnerable in the preliminary round, narrowly defeating Australia, Serbia, and France by a combined 16 points. However, the team gained momentum in the quarterfinal match against Argentina, winning 105\u201378. The U.S. team then defeated [[Spain men's national basketball team|Spain]] in the semifinals setting up a rematch versus Serbia in the gold medal game. The Americans proved their superiority, easily defeating their rival by 30 points. The team averaged 100.9 points (with an average margin of victory at 22.5 points) a game with Anthony (he won a record third straight Olympic gold medal) and Durant as top scorers.

most successful team in international competition, winning medals in all eighteen Olympic tournaments it has entered, including fifteen golds. In the professional era, the team won the Olympic gold medal in [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics#Men's Tournament|1992]], [[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996]], [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2000]], [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008]], [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2012]], and [[Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2016]]. Two of its gold medal-winning teams were inducted to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in August 2010 \u2013 the [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|1960 team]], which featured six Hall of Famers (4 players, 2 coaches), and the 1992 [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|\"Dream Team\"]], featuring 14 Hall of Famers (11 players, 3 coaches).

The [[2004 United States men's Olympic basketball team|2004 Olympic team]], being depleted by a number of withdrawals, lost three games on its way to a bronze medal, a record that represented more losses in a single year than the country's Olympic teams had suffered in all previous Olympiads combined.\n\nDetermined to put an end to these failures, USA Basketball initiated a long-term project aimed at creating better, more cohesive teams. The U.S. won its first seven games at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]] in Japan before losing against [[Greece national basketball team|Greece]] in the semi-finals; ending the competition with the bronze medal. The team won gold two years later \u2013 at the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]] \u2013 in a dominant fashion.

Their roster featured five players returning from the 2008 Olympic team and five others from the 2010 World Championship team.\n\nThe US went undefeated but appeared vulnerable at times in winning five exhibition games. They finished the tournament with a perfect 8\u20130 record, defeating opponents by an average of 32 points while trailing in the fourth quarter only once. The Americans often played with a [[Small ball (basketball)|small lineup]] that emphasized speed, quickness, and outside shooting.

The roster was filled with two players returning from the 2012 Olympic team, three from the 2010 FIBA Championship Team, while seven other NBA players made their senior international debuts. The 2014 roster featured four players 6 feet 10 inches (2.08 m) or larger, the most of any USA team since [[Mike Krzyzewski]] began coaching the team in 2006. The team was also the youngest American team since [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|1992]] when NBA players were first allowed on the team; the average player was 24.08 years old, roughly a half-year younger than their 2010 team.\n\nThe team advanced to the knockout phase after starting the tournament 5\u20130 during the group stage. They went undefeated 9\u20130 in the tournament, winning by an average margin of 33.0 points. The United States was just the third country in World Cup history to repeat as champions. Combined with their 2010 World Championship along with gold by their 2008 and 2012 Olympic teams, they also became the first country in FIBA basketball history to win four consecutive major titles. The United States defeated [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbia]] in the [[2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] by 37 points and clinched a berth for the [[Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Summer Olympics]].\n\nMultiple withdrawals (largely triggered by a freak injury to [[Paul George]] in a pre-2014 World Cup scrimmage) left the 2016 U.S. team with just two players with prior Olympic experience (Durant and Anthony). The Americans seemed vulnerable in the preliminary round, narrowly defeating Australia, Serbia, and France by a combined 16 points. However, the team gained momentum in the quarterfinal match against Argentina, winning 105\u201378. The U.S. team then defeated [[Spain men's national basketball team|Spain]] in the semifinals setting up a rematch versus Serbia in the gold medal game. The Americans proved their superiority, easily defeating their rival by 30 points. The team averaged 100.9 points (with an average margin of victory at 22.5 points) a game with Anthony (he won a record third straight Olympic gold medal) and Durant as top scorers.

An additional, political goal of the [[Polish Underground State]] was to liberate Poland's capital and assert Polish sovereignty before the Soviet-backed [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] could assume control.  Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German round-ups of able-bodied Poles for [[Death march#During World War II|\"evacuation\"]]; calls by [[Radio Moscow]]'s Polish Service for uprising; and an emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five years of German occupation.{{sfn|Davies|2008|pp=268, 271}}<ref>[https://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/okulicki.pdf Warsaw Uprising 1944] ''www.warsawuprising.com'', accessed 12 September 2019</ref>\n\nInitially, the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw, but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to make radio contact with them and did not advance beyond the city limits.

This, and the lack of air support from the Soviet air base five-minutes flying time away, led to allegations that [[Joseph Stalin]] tactically halted his forces to let the operation fail and allow the Polish resistance to be crushed.

At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either initiate the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk a lack of Soviet support, or fail to rebel and face [[Soviet propaganda]] describing the Home Army as impotent or worse, Nazi collaborators. They feared that if Poland was liberated by the Red Army, then the Allies would ignore the [[Polish government-in-exile|London-based Polish government]] in the aftermath of the war.

In addition, although many  units were already mobilized and waiting at assembly points throughout the city, the mobilization of thousands of young men and women was hard to conceal.

The resistance fighters were most successful in the [[\u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, Warsaw|City Centre]], [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]], and [[Wola]] districts. However, several major German strongholds remained, and in some areas of Wola the Poles sustained heavy losses that forced an early retreat. In other areas such as [[Mokot\u00f3w]], the attackers almost completely failed to secure any objectives and controlled only the residential areas. In [[Praga]], on the east bank of the Vistula, the Poles were sent back into hiding by a high concentration of German forces.<ref name=\"Praga\"/> Most crucially, the fighters in different areas failed to link up with each other and with areas outside Warsaw, leaving each sector isolated from the others. After the first hours of fighting, many units adopted a more defensive strategy, while civilians began erecting barricades.

The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:\n\n* ''Area I'' (city centre and the Old Town): Units captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture areas with strong pockets of resistance from the Germans (the Warsaw University buildings, [[PAST (Poland)|PAST]] skyscraper, the headquarters of the German garrison in the [[Saxon Palace]], the [[Nur f\u00fcr Deutsche|German-only]] area near Szucha Avenue, and the bridges over the Vistula). They thus failed to create a central stronghold, secure communication links to other areas, or a secure land connection with the northern area of [[\u017boliborz]] through the northern railway line and the [[Cytadela|Citadel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area II'' (\u017boliborz, [[Marymont]], [[Bielany]]): Units failed to secure the most important military targets near \u017boliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although they captured most of the area around \u017boliborz, the soldiers of Colonel Mieczys\u0142aw Niedzielski (\"\u017bywiciel\") failed to secure the Citadel area and break through German defences at [[Warszawa Gda\u0144ska station|Warsaw Gda\u0144sk]] railway station.<ref>Borowiec, pp. 89\u201390.</ref>\n* ''Area III'' ([[Wola]]): Units initially secured most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of Colonel Jan Mazurkiewicz (\"Rados\u0142aw\") managed to capture the German barracks, the German supply depot at Stawki Street, and the flanking position at the [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area IV'' ([[Ochota]]): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the [[G\u0119si\u00f3wka]] concentration camp, and the SS and [[Sicherheitspolizei|Sipo]] barracks on Narutowicz Square). After suffering heavy casualties most of the Home Army forces retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under Lieut. Andrzej Chyczewski (\"Gustaw\") remained in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Elite units of the [[Kedyw]] managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German tactical counter-attacks from the south and west.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area V'' ([[Mokot\u00f3w]]): The situation in this area was very serious from the start of hostilities. The partisans aimed to capture the heavily defended Police Area (''Dzielnica policyjna'') on [[Rakowiecka]] Street, and establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at the former airfield of [[Mokot\u00f3w Field]]. As both of the areas were heavily fortified and could be approached only through open terrain, the assaults failed. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokot\u00f3w, which was, however, severed from most communication routes to other areas.<ref>Borowiec, p. 89.</ref>\n* ''Area VI'' ([[Praga]]): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula, where the main task was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the Red Army. It was clear that, since the location was far worse than that of the other areas, there was no chance of any help from outside. After some minor initial successes, the forces of Lt.Col. Antoni \u017burowski (\"Andrzej\") were badly outnumbered by the Germans. The fights were halted, and the Home Army forces were forced back underground.<ref name=\"wutime\"/>\n* ''Area VII'' (''[[Powiat]] warszawski''): this area consisted of territories outside Warsaw city limits. Actions here mostly failed to capture their targets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAn additional area within the Polish command structure was formed by the units of the Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion or ''[[Kedyw]]'', an elite formation that was to guard the headquarters and was to be used as an \"armed ambulance\", thrown into the battle in the most endangered areas. These units secured parts of \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie and Wola; along with the units of ''Area I'', they were the most successful during the first few hours.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAmong the most notable primary targets that were not taken during the opening stages of the uprising were the airfields of [[Ok\u0119cie]] and [[Mokot\u00f3w Field]], as well as the PAST skyscraper overlooking the city centre and the [[Warszawa Gda\u0144ska station|Gda\u0144sk railway station]] guarding the passage between the centre and the northern borough of \u017boliborz.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n=== Wola massacre ===\n<!-- Please DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION - Thanks -->\n{{Main|Wola massacre}}\n[[File:Uprising defender.jpg|thumb|Home Army soldier armed with [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun]] defending a barricade in Powi\u015ble District of Warsaw during the Uprising, August 1944]]\n\nThe Uprising reached its [[apogee]] on 4 August when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish front lines in the westernmost boroughs of [[Wola]] and [[Ochota]].

German tactics hinged on bombardment through the use of [[heavy artillery]]<ref>Davies, p. 282.</ref> and [[tactical bomber]]s, against which the Poles were unable to effectively defend, as they lacked anti-aircraft artillery weapons. Even clearly marked hospitals were dive-bombed by Stukas.<ref>Davies, pp. 333, 355.</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] had already shown the danger a city can pose to armies which fight within it and the importance of local support, the Warsaw Uprising was probably the first demonstration that in an urban terrain, a vastly under-equipped force supported by the civilian population can hold its own against better-equipped professional soldiers\u2014though at the cost of considerable sacrifice on the part of the city's residents.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe Poles held the Old Town until a decision to withdraw was made at the end of August.

The Soviet army under the command of [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] captured Praga and arrived on the east bank of the Vistula in mid-September. By 13 September, the Germans had destroyed the remaining bridges over the Vistula, signalling that they were abandoning all their positions east of the river.<ref>Borowiec, pp.138\u2013141 and Davies, p. 332.</ref> In the Praga area, Polish units under the command of General [[Zygmunt Berling]] (thus sometimes known as ''berlingowcy'' \u2013 \"the Berling men\") fought on the Soviet side. Three patrols of his [[First Polish Army (1944\u20131945)|First Polish Army]] ({{lang|pl|1 Armia Wojska Polskiego}}) landed in the [[Czerniak\u00f3w]] and [[Powi\u015ble]] areas and made contact with Home Army forces on the night of 14/15 September. The artillery cover and air support provided by the Soviets was unable to effectively counter enemy machine-gun fire as the Poles crossed the river, and the landing troops sustained heavy losses.<ref>Davies, pp. 358\u2013359.</ref> Only small elements of the main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division).<ref name=\"Berling landings\"/>\n\n[[File:POL Berling monument, Warsaw 01.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Monument to [[Zygmunt Berling|General Berling]] in Warsaw]]\n\nThe limited landings by the 1st Polish Army represented the only external ground force which arrived to physically support the uprising; and even they were curtailed by the Soviet High Command due to the losses they took.<ref name=\"Berling landings\"/>\n\nThe Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, but were not able to make any significant advances for several days while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for a new expected wave of Soviet landings.

Conditions that prevented the Germans from dislodging the resistance also acted to prevent the Poles from dislodging the Germans. Plans for a river crossing were suspended \"for at least 4 months\", since operations against the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army's]] five [[panzer division]]s were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General Berling was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors.<ref name=\"Soviets_and_AK\"/><ref>Richard J.

However, as the fighting dragged on, the inhabitants of the city faced hunger and starvation. A major break-through took place on 6 August, when Polish units recaptured the [[Haberbusch i Schiele]] brewery complex at Ceglana Street. From that time on the citizens of Warsaw lived mostly on barley from the brewery's warehouses. Every day up to several thousand people organized into cargo teams reported to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city centre. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a so-called spit-soup ({{lang-pl|pluj-zupa}}). The \"Sowi\u0144ski\" Battalion managed to hold the brewery until the end of the fighting.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAnother serious problem for civilians and soldiers alike was a shortage of water.<ref name=\"wutime\"/> By mid-August most of the water conduits were either out of order or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station remained in German hands.<ref name=\"wutime\"/> To prevent the spread of epidemics and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered all janitors to supervise the construction of water wells in the backyards of every house.

This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans, launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces, played out successfully in a number of European capitals, such as [[Liberation of Paris|Paris]]<ref>Davies, p. 304.</ref> and [[Prague uprising|Prague]]. However, despite easy capture of area south-east of Warsaw barely {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} from the city centre and holding these positions for about 40 days, the Soviets did not extend any effective aid to the resistance within Warsaw. At that time city outskirts were defended by the under-manned and under-equipped [[73rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 73rd Infantry Division]] which was destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and was yet-again being reconstituted.<ref>''SS: The Waffen-SS War in Russia 1941\u201345'' Relevant page viewable via [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&id=HAMd81LJJs4C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=73rd+infantry+division&prev=https://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D73rd%2Binfantry%2Bdivision%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&sig=k-va3MBk58jCUKatCmNi6UU10BQ Google book search]</ref> The weak German defence forces did not experience any significant Soviet pressure during that period, which effectively allowed them to strengthen German forces fighting against uprising in the city itself.\n\n[[File:Piesc-czujka.jpg|thumb|right|Soldier from \"Pi\u0119\u015b\u0107\" Battalion led by Stanis\u0142aw Jankowski \"Agaton\", pictured on a rooftop of a house near the Evangelic Cemetery in Wola District of Warsaw, 2 August 1944]]\n\nThe Red Army was fighting intense battles further to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north of the city, to gain bridgeheads over the river Narew. The best German armoured divisions were fighting on those sectors. Despite the fact, both of these objectives had been mostly secured by September. Yet the Soviet 47th Army did not move into [[Praga]] (Warsaw's suburbs) on the right bank of the Vistula, until 11 September (when the Uprising was basically over). In three days the Soviets quickly gained control of the suburb, a few hundred meters from the main battle on the other side of the river, as the resistance by the German 73rd Division collapsed quickly. Had the Soviets done this in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easier, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. However, by mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of [[Czerniak\u00f3w]]. The Poles were counting on the Soviet forces to cross to the left bank where the main battle of the uprising was occurring. Though Berling's communist 1st Polish Army did cross the river, their support from the Soviets was inadequate and the main Soviet force did not follow them.<ref>Borowiec, pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nOne of the reasons given for the collapse of the Uprising was the reluctance of the Soviet Red Army to help the Polish resistance.

These included many infantry units of poor quality,<ref name=\"DWS\"/> and 4\u20135 high quality Panzer Divisions in the 39th Panzer Corps and 4th SS Panzer Corps<ref name=\"Glantz\"/> pulled from their refits.<ref name=\"DWS\"/>\n\nOther explanations for Soviet conduct are possible. The Red Army geared for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania in mid-August and a large proportion of Soviet resources was sent in that direction, while the offensive in Poland was put on hold.<ref>Davies, p. 320.</ref> Stalin had made a strategic decision to concentrate on occupying Eastern Europe, rather than on making a thrust toward Germany.<ref>Davies, p. 417.</ref> The capture of Warsaw was not essential for the Soviets, as they had already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counterattacks.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/> Finally, the Soviet High Command may not have developed a coherent or appropriate strategy with regard to Warsaw because they were badly misinformed.<ref>Davies, p. 418.</ref> Propaganda from the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] minimized the strength of the Home Army and portrayed them as Nazi sympathizers.<ref>Davies, pp. 440\u2013441.</ref> Information submitted to Stalin by intelligence operatives or gathered from the frontline was often inaccurate or omitted key details.<ref>e.g. Davies, pp. 154\u2013155, 388\u2013389.</ref> Possibly because the operatives were unable, due to the harsh political climate, to express opinions or report facts honestly, they \"deliberately resorted to writing nonsense\".<ref>Davies, p. 422.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Glantz]] (military historian and a retired US Army colonel, as well as a member of the Russian Federation's Academy of Natural Sciences), the Red Army was simply unable to extend effective support to the uprising, which began too early, regardless of Stalin's political intentions.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/>  German military capabilities in August\u2014early September were sufficient to halt any Soviet assistance to the Poles in Warsaw, were it intended.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/> In addition, Glantz argued that Warsaw would be a costly city to clear of Germans and an unsuitable location as a start point for subsequent Red Army offensives.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/>\n\nDeclassified documents from Soviet archives reveal that Stalin gave instructions to cut off the Warsaw resistance from any outside help. The urgent orders issued to the Red Army troops in Poland on 23 August 1944 stipulated that the Home Army units in Soviet-controlled areas should be prevented from reaching Warsaw and helping the Uprising, their members apprehended and disarmed. Only from mid-September, under pressure from the Western Allies, the Soviets began to provide some limited assistance to the resistance.<ref name=\"Gibianskii\"/>\n\nModern Russian historians generally hold the view that the failure of the uprising in Warsaw was caused primarily by the mistakes of the leadership of the uprising. They point out that in July 1944, according to the Directive of the command, the Soviet troops did not have the goal of attacking Warsaw, but only to the suburbs of Warsaw - Prague with access to the Vistula river line. Since the Soviet command understood that it was unlikely to be possible to capture the bridges over the Vistula and the Germans would blow them up. The Soviet forces aimed to advance in the northern direction with the capture of East Prussia and with the priority task of reaching the line of the Vistula and Narew rivers and capturing bridgeheads. Then the offensive against East Prussia was to begin from these bridgeheads.

The liberation of Warsaw was planned by a flanking maneuver after the start of a General offensive in the direction of East Prussia and Berlin. This is exactly how it happened, only in January 1945. The AK leadership made a mistake, it took the left flank of the 2nd Tank army, which was advancing to north, for the vanguard, which was allegedly advancing on Warsaw. And the order was given to start the uprising, which led to defeat. A terrible mistake, but in essence inevitable, if the leadership of the uprising took a political line about the lack of coordination with the Soviet command, if the goal was - Warsaw should be freed from the Germans 'by Polish effort alone 12 hours before the entry of the Soviets into the capital'.<ref>Jan.

Hungarians and Poles have maintained very friendly relations for centuries and neither individual soldiers nor their commanders wished to break this tradition. Hungarian military bands often played Polish patriotic songs and anthems which were banned under the death penalty by the Germans, or rendered aid in their field hospitals to wounded Polish partisans. Although their troops were formally subordinated to the German 9th army, they refused to participate in the quelling of the uprising. Instead they supported the Polish side as much as it was possible without actually switching sides and getting into an open conflict with the Germans.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benk\u0151 |first1=Tibor |title=Memorial to Hungarian soldiers assisting 1944 Warsaw uprising is inaugurated in Warsaw |url=https://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-defence/news/memorial-to-hungarian-soldiers-assisting-1944-warsaw-uprising-is-inaugurated-in-warsaw |website=Hungarian Government Website |publisher=Ministry of Defense |accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince August 1943 the elite Hungarian 1st Cavalry Division were stationed on the outskirts of the Polish capital, in the forests of Kampinos. The unit was withdrawn from the front for recuperation and refitting. When the uprising began, the Hungarian soldiers passed equipment, food, supplies, even weapons and ammunition to Polish fighters who they were supposed to disarm and capture. They also informed them about German plans and troop movements. Very often the two sides agreed to feign a \"partisan attack\" on supply vehicles, and after a mock firefight the Hungarians \"fled\" and let the Poles \"pillage\" their supplies, which often included large shipments of firearms. At other times they let Polish units through their lines but blocked the way from Germans who were chasing them. At other times individual Polish soldiers found asylum at Hungarian units who \"captured\" and refused to extradite them to the Germans. There were several incidents when Hungarian soldiers threatened Germans with weapons to protect these refugees. When the Germans ordered the 5th Hungarian infantry division to withdraw from Warsaw's vicinity, they left behind equipment and ammunition for the partisans. They also frequently provided them with Hungarian uniforms. Ironically the Poles and the Hungarians mostly communicated in German language which they both knew.\n\nDuring one event, when the German radio reconnaissance successfully located a strategically important Polish radio station, the Hungarian radio operators thwarted the German raid to capture the station by jamming German radio frequencies.\n\nThe 23rd Reserve Division, commanded by Major General Guszt\u00e1v Dese\u0151 passed on information to the Polish partisans about which bridges can be destroyed in the area without making the Germans suspicious of the Hungarians. In the area between the towns of Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki and Radom, near Diabla G\u00f3ra (Devil's Hill) the same unit got into a firefight with an approximately 200-strong German military police detachment and freed several hundred Polish and Jewish prisoners from a train headed to the concentration camp at Pruszk\u00f3w.\n\nThis cooperation wasn't unofficial or occasional. General Antal Vattay, commander of the Hungarian troops was in secret talks of the leadership of the Polish resistance and held several meetings at various locations. These negotiations were conducted with the knowledge and permission of the Hungarian government and personally Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Regent of Hungary. As it was feared that the Germans may try to arrest Vattay, he was recalled to Budapest and replaced with General B\u00e9la Lengyel, who used to be the military attach\u00e9 to the Hungarian embassy in Warsaw before the war. If possible, he was even more sympathetic to the Polish case than his predecessor and personally knew some of the leaders of the Polish resistance, including General B\u00f3r-Komorowski. Ultimately the Hungarians offered to switch sides and openly engage German troops in combat if the Polish leaders could provide guarantees that the Soviets later won't treat them as enemy combatants. As the Poles were not in the position to make such assurances, this never happened.\n\nThere also are several recorded cases of Hungarian soldiers defecting to the Polish side and fighting with them. Some of them died in the firefights, and some were executed by the Germans. The 1st Cavalry Division also participated in the rescue of Polish civilians from German atrocities. At least 1600 Warsaw families got away from SS troops on Hungarian military vehicles. Many of them were smuggled to Hungary. Ksenia Martysz\u00f3wna, a famous Polish interwar actress, known as Xenia Grey, was one of them.<ref>A magyar korridor: Vars\u00f3 1944 (The Hungarian Corridor: Warsaw 1944) Documentary, 2016, directed by Levente Jamrik</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-054-30, Warschauer Aufstand, polnischer Soldat.jpg|thumb|Home Army soldier from the Mokot\u00f3w District surrenders to German troops.

They later sent 15,000 of them to POW camps in various parts of Germany. Between 5,000 and 6,000 resistance fighters decided to blend into the civilian population hoping to continue the fight later.

Though the figure of 9,000 German WIA is generally accepted and generates no controversy, there is little agreement as to German irrecoverable losses (KIA+MIA). Until the 1990s the Eastern and the Western historiography stuck to two widely different estimates, the former claiming 17,000 and the latter 2,000. The 17,000 figure was first coined by a 1947 issue of a Warsaw historical journal ''Dzieje Najnowsze'', allegedly based on estimates made by Bach Zelewski when interrogated by his Polish captors (and divided into 10,000 KIA and 7,000 MIA). This figure was initially repeated in West Germany.<ref>e.g. a German scholar specialized in Polish history, Hans E. Roos, in ''Der Tag'' of 01.08.1954 repeated the 17,000 KIA+MIA figure, referred after Klaus-Peter Friedrich, ''Kontaminierte Erinnerung: Vom Einflu\u00df der Kriegspropaganda auf das Gedenken an die Warschauer Aufst\u00e4nde von 1943 und 1944'', [in:] ''Zeitschrift fur Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung'' 55/3 ( 2008), p. 427</ref> However, in 1962 a scholarly monograph by Hanns Krannhals coined the 2,000 estimate.<ref>\"auf deutscher Seite w\u00e4hrend des Aufstandes 2 000 Angeh\u00f6rige deutsch gef\u00fchrer Verb\u00e4nde gefallen und 9 000 verwunder worden sind\", see Hanns von Krannhals, ''Der Warschauer Aufstand'', Frankfurt a/M 1962, p. 215; Krannhals dismissed the 17,000 figure as \"Bach\u2019s overestimates which unfortunately made it to the Polish literature\"</ref> It was based on the 1,570 German KIA figure officially reported by Bach in October 1944, rounded up with estimates related to first few days when Bach was not in charge and to losses suffered by [[19th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|19. PzDiv]] (not subordinate to Bach), briefly engaged against the Poles in Northern Warsaw during last days of the fightings.\n\nUntil the late 20th century the 17,000 figure was consistently and unequivocally quoted in the Polish, though also in the East German and Soviet historiography, be it encyclopedias,<ref>see e.g. Kazimierz Sobczak (ed.), ''Encyklopedia II wojny \u015bwiatowej'', Warszawa 1975, p. 626</ref> scientific monographs<ref>see e.g. Jerzy Kirchmayer, ''Powstanie Warszawskie, Warszawa 1978'', ISBN  {{ISBN|830511080X}}, p. 576</ref> or more popular works.<ref>see e.g. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, ''1859 dni Warszawy'', Warszawa 1982, {{ISBN|8370061524}}, p. 758</ref> It was at times paired or otherwise related to the figure of 16,000 German Warsaw KIA+MIA listed by the so-called ''Gehlen report'' of April 1945.<ref>see e.g. Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Militarne aspekty powstania warszawskiego'', [in:] Marek M. Drozdowski (ed.), ''Powstanie Warszawskie z perspektywy p\u00f3\u0142wiecza'', Warszawa 1995, {{ISBN|8386301104}}, p. 129</ref> The 2,000 figure was accepted in West Germany and generally spilled over to Western historiography;<ref>see e.g. Gunther Deschner, ''Warsaw rising'', New York 1972, p. 175</ref> exceptions were studies written in English by the Poles<ref>see e.g. Janusz Kazimierz Zawodny, ''Nothing But Honour: The Story of the Warsaw Uprising'', 1944, Washington 1978, {{ISBN|9780817968311}}</ref> and some other works.<ref>see e.g. ''Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress'', Washington 1983, p. 16309</ref>\n\nRecently the Polish historiography has been increasingly turning towards the 2,000 figure. Komorowski, who in 1995 opted for 16,000, changed his mind and 10 years later cautiously subscribed to the 2,000 figure;<ref>Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Bitwa o Warszaw\u0119 \u201944'', Warszawa 2004, {{ISBN|9788373991330}}, p.  271</ref> also scholars like Sawicki<ref>Tadeusz Sawicki, ''Rozkaz: zd\u0142awi\u0107 Powstanie'', Warszwa 2001, {{ISBN|9788311092846}}, p. 189</ref> and Rozwadowski<ref>Piotr Rozwadowski, ''Warszawa 1944-1945'', Warszawa 2006, {{ISBN|8311104808}}, pp. 110-111</ref> tentatively followed suit. The discrepancy is tackled head-on in a popular work of B\u0105czyk,<ref>Norbert B\u0105czyk, ''Ilu naprawd\u0119 poleg\u0142o w powstaniu warszawskim'', [in:] ''Tygodnik Polityka'' 42 (2014), pp. 54-56</ref> who concludes that 3,000 is the maximum conceivable (though not the most probable) figure. In his 2016 analysis Sowa dismissed the 17,000 figure as \u201centirely improbable\u201d and suggested that its longevity and popularity resulted from manipulation on part of apologists of the Rising.<ref>Andrzej Leon Sowa, ''Kto wyda\u0142 wyrok na miasto?'', Krak\u00f3w 2016, {{ISBN|9788308060957}}, pp. 617-618. The claim should be taken with caution; the 17,000 figure was systematically reproduced also in the Communist propaganda, which first lambasted the Rising as criminal suicidal act and later approached it at least with great deal of skepticism</ref>  In popular discourse in Poland the 17,000 figure still remains in wide circulation.<ref>it is advanced e.g. by ''Dzieje.pl'', a website operated by a number of official Polish institutions, compare [http://dzieje.pl/infografiki/polskie-i-niemieckie-straty-w-powstaniu-warszawskim here]</ref> Popular media seem bewildered; the most popular Polish internet portal ''[[Onet.pl|Onet]]'' in its news section favors the 2,000 figure<ref>compare the ''Onet'' news section, available [http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/powstanie-warszawskie-ile-trwalo-data-mapa-skutki-infografika/s7n9s1 here]</ref> and in its educational section opts for 17,000.<ref>compare the ''Onet'' educational service, available [http://klasowka.onet.pl/podrecznik/poznac-przeszlosc-wiek-xx-klasa-1-liceum/podrozdzial-rozdzial-iv-powstanie-warszawskie/wytlumaczenie here]</ref>\n\nBeyond Poland and Germany both figures remain in circulation, though the ones of 16-17,000 seem to be on the rise.<ref>see e.g. a booklet from the popular Osprey series, which claims 16,000 German KIA, Robert Forczyk, ''Warsaw 1944'', Bloomsbury 2009, {{ISBN|9781846033520}}, p. 89</ref> In the Russian historiography it is given clear preference, be it in encyclopedias and dictionaries<ref>see e.g. the entry ''\u0410\u0440\u043c\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0430'', [in:] \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0432, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432, ''\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 1941\u20131945 \u0433\u0433. \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c'', \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 2017, {{ISBN|9785040341412}}</ref> or general works;<ref>see e.g. \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0432, \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432, ''\u041d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430. \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0438 \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f?'', \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 2017, {{ISBN|9785457906037}}, p. 437</ref> the same opinion might be found in Belorussia.<ref>''\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u044b\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0434\u044b\u044f'', vol. 4, \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a 1997, {{ISBN|9789851100909}}, p. 17.

In literature, they include: ''Kolumbowie. Rocznik 20'' novel by Polish writer Roman Bratny.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn television, they include documentary film ''The ramparts of Warsaw 1943-44'', produced for the 70th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising with support from the European Commission. The Warsaw Uprising is often confused with the revolt in the Warsaw Ghetto which took place a year earlier in the Spring of 1943. Three young Europeans, Alexandra (France), Maria (Poland) and Roman (Germany) meet in Warsaw to enquire into these events; here they meet witnesses who took part in the Warsaw Uprising or lived in the ghetto. Beneath their white hair we can recognise the men and women who formed the living ramparts of freedom in the face of Nazism. Meanwhile, the Polish World War II TV drama series ''[[Czas honoru|Time Of Honor]]'' (''Czas honoru''; Series 7), which aired in 2014, was entirely devoted to the Warsaw Uprising.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}.\n\nIn cinema, they include:\n\n*[[Kana\u0142]], a 1956 Polish film directed by [[Andrzej Wajda]].

The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the German forces from Poland ahead of the Soviet advance.<ref name=sb/> While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city, the [[Red Army]] temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|destroy the city in retaliation]]. The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military effort taken by any European [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement during World War II]].<ref>{{cite book|first1= Eugeniusz |last1= Duraczy\u0144ski |first2= Jerzy Janusz |last2= Terej|title= Europa podziemna: 1939-1945 |year= 1974 |location= Warszawa |publisher= Wiedza Powszechna |oclc= 463203458 |language= Polish |trans-title= Europe underground: 1939-1945}}</ref>\n\nThe Uprising began on 1 August 1944 as part of a nationwide [[Operation Tempest]], launched at the time of the Soviet [[Lublin\u2013Brest Offensive]]. The main Polish objectives were to drive the Germans out of Warsaw while helping the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] defeat [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. An additional, political goal of the [[Polish Underground State]] was to liberate Poland's capital and assert Polish sovereignty before the Soviet-backed [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] could assume control.  Other immediate causes included a threat of mass German round-ups of able-bodied Poles for [[Death march#During World War II|\"evacuation\"]]; calls by [[Radio Moscow]]'s Polish Service for uprising; and an emotional Polish desire for justice and revenge against the enemy after five years of German occupation.{{sfn|Davies|2008|pp=268, 271}}<ref>[https://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/okulicki.pdf Warsaw Uprising 1944] ''www.warsawuprising.com'', accessed 12 September 2019</ref>\n\nInitially, the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw, but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to make radio contact with them and did not advance beyond the city limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By 14 September, the eastern bank of the [[Vistula]] River opposite the Polish resistance positions was taken over by the [[First Polish Army (1944\u20131945)|Polish troops fighting under the Soviet command]]; 1,200 men made it across the river, but they were not reinforced by the [[Red Army]]. This, and the lack of air support from the Soviet air base five-minutes flying time away, led to allegations that [[Joseph Stalin]] tactically halted his forces to let the operation fail and allow the Polish resistance to be crushed. [[Arthur Koestler]] called the Soviet attitude \"one of the major infamies of this war which will rank for the future historian on the same ethical level with [[Lidice Massacre|Lidice]].\"<ref>Koestler, letter in ''Tribune'' magazine 15 September 1944, reprinted in Orwell, Collected Works, ''I Have Tried to Tell the Truth'', p.374</ref>\n\n[[Winston Churchill]] pleaded with Stalin and [[Franklin D.

Later, after gaining Soviet air clearance, the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] sent one high-level mass airdrop as part of [[Operation Frantic]].\n\nAlthough the exact number of casualties is unknown, it is estimated that about 16,000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians died, mostly from mass executions. [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|Jews being harboured by Poles]] were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass evictions of entire neighbourhoods. German casualties totalled  over 2,000 to 17,000 soldiers killed and missing.<ref name=stachnik/> During the [[urban combat]], approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces, German troops systematically levelled another 35% of the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in the [[invasion of Poland|1939 invasion of Poland]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] in 1943, over 85% of the city was destroyed by January 1945 when the course of the events in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] forced the Germans to abandon the city.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|Prelude to the Warsaw Uprising}}\n[[File:Flaga PPP.svg|thumb|White-and-red [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] with superposed \"[[Kotwica|anchor]]\" emblem of the Polish resistance]]\n[[File:Warszawa Powstanie 1944-08-04.png|thumb|Polish [[Home Army]] positions, outlined in red, on the western bank of the [[Vistula]] (4 August 1944)]]\nIn 1944, Poland had been occupied by Nazi Germany for almost five years. The [[Armia Krajowa|Polish Home Army]] planned some form of rebellion against German forces. Germany was fighting a coalition of [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]], led by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States. The initial plan of the Home Army was to link up with the invading forces of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] as they liberated Europe from the Nazis. However, when the Soviet Army began its offensive in 1943, it became clear that Poland would be liberated by it instead of the Western Allies.\n\n{{quote|In this country, we have one point from which every evil emanates.

On the approach of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], local units of the Home Army were to harass the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' in the rear and co-operate with incoming Soviet units as much as possible.

At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either initiate the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk a lack of Soviet support, or fail to rebel and face [[Soviet propaganda]] describing the Home Army as impotent or worse, Nazi collaborators. They feared that if Poland was liberated by the Red Army, then the Allies would ignore the [[Polish government-in-exile|London-based Polish government]] in the aftermath of the war. The urgency for a final decision on strategy increased as it became clear that, after successful Polish-Soviet co-operation in the liberation of Polish territory (for example, in [[Operation Ostra Brama]]), [[NKVD|Soviet security forces]] behind the frontline shot or arrested Polish officers and forcibly conscripted lower ranks into the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Soviet-controlled forces]].<ref name=\"Soviets_and_AK\"/><ref>[http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/nkvd.htm The NKVD Against the Home Army (Armia Krajowa)], Warsaw Uprising, based on Andrzej Paczkowski.

The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:\n\n* ''Area I'' (city centre and the Old Town): Units captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture areas with strong pockets of resistance from the Germans (the Warsaw University buildings, [[PAST (Poland)|PAST]] skyscraper, the headquarters of the German garrison in the [[Saxon Palace]], the [[Nur f\u00fcr Deutsche|German-only]] area near Szucha Avenue, and the bridges over the Vistula). They thus failed to create a central stronghold, secure communication links to other areas, or a secure land connection with the northern area of [[\u017boliborz]] through the northern railway line and the [[Cytadela|Citadel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area II'' (\u017boliborz, [[Marymont]], [[Bielany]]): Units failed to secure the most important military targets near \u017boliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although they captured most of the area around \u017boliborz, the soldiers of Colonel Mieczys\u0142aw Niedzielski (\"\u017bywiciel\") failed to secure the Citadel area and break through German defences at [[Warszawa Gda\u0144ska station|Warsaw Gda\u0144sk]] railway station.<ref>Borowiec, pp. 89\u201390.</ref>\n* ''Area III'' ([[Wola]]): Units initially secured most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of Colonel Jan Mazurkiewicz (\"Rados\u0142aw\") managed to capture the German barracks, the German supply depot at Stawki Street, and the flanking position at the [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area IV'' ([[Ochota]]): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the [[G\u0119si\u00f3wka]] concentration camp, and the SS and [[Sicherheitspolizei|Sipo]] barracks on Narutowicz Square). After suffering heavy casualties most of the Home Army forces retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under Lieut. Andrzej Chyczewski (\"Gustaw\") remained in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city centre. Elite units of the [[Kedyw]] managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German tactical counter-attacks from the south and west.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* ''Area V'' ([[Mokot\u00f3w]]): The situation in this area was very serious from the start of hostilities. The partisans aimed to capture the heavily defended Police Area (''Dzielnica policyjna'') on [[Rakowiecka]] Street, and establish a connection with the city centre through open terrain at the former airfield of [[Mokot\u00f3w Field]]. As both of the areas were heavily fortified and could be approached only through open terrain, the assaults failed. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny Mokot\u00f3w, which was, however, severed from most communication routes to other areas.<ref>Borowiec, p. 89.</ref>\n* ''Area VI'' ([[Praga]]): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula, where the main task was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the Red Army. It was clear that, since the location was far worse than that of the other areas, there was no chance of any help from outside. After some minor initial successes, the forces of Lt.Col. Antoni \u017burowski (\"Andrzej\") were badly outnumbered by the Germans.

Plans for a river crossing were suspended \"for at least 4 months\", since operations against the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|9th Army's]] five [[panzer division]]s were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General Berling was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors.<ref name=\"Soviets_and_AK\"/><ref>Richard J.

Over a million were still living in the city at the start of the Uprising. In Polish-controlled territory, during the first weeks of the Uprising, people tried to recreate the normal day-to-day life of their free country.

However, as the fighting dragged on, the inhabitants of the city faced hunger and starvation. A major break-through took place on 6 August, when Polish units recaptured the [[Haberbusch i Schiele]] brewery complex at Ceglana Street. From that time on the citizens of Warsaw lived mostly on barley from the brewery's warehouses. Every day up to several thousand people organized into cargo teams reported to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city centre. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a so-called spit-soup ({{lang-pl|pluj-zupa}}). The \"Sowi\u0144ski\" Battalion managed to hold the brewery until the end of the fighting.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAnother serious problem for civilians and soldiers alike was a shortage of water.<ref name=\"wutime\"/> By mid-August most of the water conduits were either out of order or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station remained in German hands.<ref name=\"wutime\"/> To prevent the spread of epidemics and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered all janitors to supervise the construction of water wells in the backyards of every house. On 21 September the Germans blew up the remaining pumping stations at Koszykowa Street and after that the public wells were the only source of potable water in the besieged city.<ref name=\"Stacja Filtr\u00f3w\"/> By the end of September, the city centre had more than 90 functioning wells.<ref name=\"wutime\"/>\n\n=== Polish media ===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION -->\n{{Listen|filename=Warsaw Uprising broadcast.ogg|title=Polish Radio broadcast in English|description=A news programme on the daily fights in Warsaw |format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nBefore the Uprising the Bureau of Information and Propaganda of the Home Army had set up a group of war correspondents.

This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans, launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces, played out successfully in a number of European capitals, such as [[Liberation of Paris|Paris]]<ref>Davies, p. 304.</ref> and [[Prague uprising|Prague]]. However, despite easy capture of area south-east of Warsaw barely {{convert|10|km|abbr=off}} from the city centre and holding these positions for about 40 days, the Soviets did not extend any effective aid to the resistance within Warsaw. At that time city outskirts were defended by the under-manned and under-equipped [[73rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|German 73rd Infantry Division]] which was destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and was yet-again being reconstituted.<ref>''SS: The Waffen-SS War in Russia 1941\u201345'' Relevant page viewable via [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&id=HAMd81LJJs4C&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=73rd+infantry+division&prev=https://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D73rd%2Binfantry%2Bdivision%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&sig=k-va3MBk58jCUKatCmNi6UU10BQ Google book search]</ref> The weak German defence forces did not experience any significant Soviet pressure during that period, which effectively allowed them to strengthen German forces fighting against uprising in the city itself.\n\n[[File:Piesc-czujka.jpg|thumb|right|Soldier from \"Pi\u0119\u015b\u0107\" Battalion led by Stanis\u0142aw Jankowski \"Agaton\", pictured on a rooftop of a house near the Evangelic Cemetery in Wola District of Warsaw, 2 August 1944]]\n\nThe Red Army was fighting intense battles further to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north of the city, to gain bridgeheads over the river Narew. The best German armoured divisions were fighting on those sectors. Despite the fact, both of these objectives had been mostly secured by September. Yet the Soviet 47th Army did not move into [[Praga]] (Warsaw's suburbs) on the right bank of the Vistula, until 11 September (when the Uprising was basically over). In three days the Soviets quickly gained control of the suburb, a few hundred meters from the main battle on the other side of the river, as the resistance by the German 73rd Division collapsed quickly. Had the Soviets done this in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easier, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. However, by mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of [[Czerniak\u00f3w]]. The Poles were counting on the Soviet forces to cross to the left bank where the main battle of the uprising was occurring. Though Berling's communist 1st Polish Army did cross the river, their support from the Soviets was inadequate and the main Soviet force did not follow them.<ref>Borowiec, pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nOne of the reasons given for the collapse of the Uprising was the reluctance of the Soviet Red Army to help the Polish resistance.

[[Zygmunt Berling]] became the deputy commander of the Polish Army in the USSR on 22 July 1944. With his own army stopped on the [[Vistula River]] and facing Warsaw itself, and without first consulting his Soviet superiors, Berling may have independently issued orders to engage the German enemy and to come to the aid of the Polish resistance. But it was a small landing without any tactical support from Berling or other Soviet units that could not make a difference in the situation of Warsaw.  Yet this behaviour may have caused Berlings' dismissal from his post soon after.<ref>{{cite book | last = Michta | first = Andrew | title = Red Eagle : the army in Polish politics, 1944-1988 | publisher = Hoover Institution Press | location = Stanford, Calif | year = 1990 | isbn = 978-0-8179-8862-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/redeaglearmyinpo0000mich }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7Ff065RmrAsC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=Zygmunt+Berling&source=bl&ots=BByFDI04Yb&sig=ZKvo7XnXDs__Qze3agX4YwHTe3A&hl=en&ei=lP4oS6LSCo3c7AOg7ZHEBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBAQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Zygmunt%20Berling&f=false p. 33].

The Red Army geared for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania in mid-August and a large proportion of Soviet resources was sent in that direction, while the offensive in Poland was put on hold.<ref>Davies, p. 320.</ref> Stalin had made a strategic decision to concentrate on occupying Eastern Europe, rather than on making a thrust toward Germany.<ref>Davies, p. 417.</ref> The capture of Warsaw was not essential for the Soviets, as they had already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counterattacks.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/> Finally, the Soviet High Command may not have developed a coherent or appropriate strategy with regard to Warsaw because they were badly misinformed.<ref>Davies, p. 418.</ref> Propaganda from the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] minimized the strength of the Home Army and portrayed them as Nazi sympathizers.<ref>Davies, pp. 440\u2013441.</ref> Information submitted to Stalin by intelligence operatives or gathered from the frontline was often inaccurate or omitted key details.<ref>e.g. Davies, pp. 154\u2013155, 388\u2013389.</ref> Possibly because the operatives were unable, due to the harsh political climate, to express opinions or report facts honestly, they \"deliberately resorted to writing nonsense\".<ref>Davies, p. 422.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[David Glantz]] (military historian and a retired US Army colonel, as well as a member of the Russian Federation's Academy of Natural Sciences), the Red Army was simply unable to extend effective support to the uprising, which began too early, regardless of Stalin's political intentions.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/>  German military capabilities in August\u2014early September were sufficient to halt any Soviet assistance to the Poles in Warsaw, were it intended.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/> In addition, Glantz argued that Warsaw would be a costly city to clear of Germans and an unsuitable location as a start point for subsequent Red Army offensives.<ref name=\"Glantz\"/>\n\nDeclassified documents from Soviet archives reveal that Stalin gave instructions to cut off the Warsaw resistance from any outside help. The urgent orders issued to the Red Army troops in Poland on 23 August 1944 stipulated that the Home Army units in Soviet-controlled areas should be prevented from reaching Warsaw and helping the Uprising, their members apprehended and disarmed. Only from mid-September, under pressure from the Western Allies, the Soviets began to provide some limited assistance to the resistance.<ref name=\"Gibianskii\"/>\n\nModern Russian historians generally hold the view that the failure of the uprising in Warsaw was caused primarily by the mistakes of the leadership of the uprising. They point out that in July 1944, according to the Directive of the command, the Soviet troops did not have the goal of attacking Warsaw, but only to the suburbs of Warsaw - Prague with access to the Vistula river line. Since the Soviet command understood that it was unlikely to be possible to capture the bridges over the Vistula and the Germans would blow them up. The Soviet forces aimed to advance in the northern direction with the capture of East Prussia and with the priority task of reaching the line of the Vistula and Narew rivers and capturing bridgeheads. Then the offensive against East Prussia was to begin from these bridgeheads.

The liberation of Warsaw was planned by a flanking maneuver after the start of a General offensive in the direction of East Prussia and Berlin. This is exactly how it happened, only in January 1945. The AK leadership made a mistake, it took the left flank of the 2nd Tank army, which was advancing to north, for the vanguard, which was allegedly advancing on Warsaw. And the order was given to start the uprising, which led to defeat. A terrible mistake, but in essence inevitable, if the leadership of the uprising took a political line about the lack of coordination with the Soviet command, if the goal was - Warsaw should be freed from the Germans 'by Polish effort alone 12 hours before the entry of the Soviets into the capital'.<ref>Jan.

Hungarians and Poles have maintained very friendly relations for centuries and neither individual soldiers nor their commanders wished to break this tradition. Hungarian military bands often played Polish patriotic songs and anthems which were banned under the death penalty by the Germans, or rendered aid in their field hospitals to wounded Polish partisans. Although their troops were formally subordinated to the German 9th army, they refused to participate in the quelling of the uprising. Instead they supported the Polish side as much as it was possible without actually switching sides and getting into an open conflict with the Germans.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Benk\u0151 |first1=Tibor |title=Memorial to Hungarian soldiers assisting 1944 Warsaw uprising is inaugurated in Warsaw |url=https://www.kormany.hu/en/ministry-of-defence/news/memorial-to-hungarian-soldiers-assisting-1944-warsaw-uprising-is-inaugurated-in-warsaw |website=Hungarian Government Website |publisher=Ministry of Defense |accessdate=7 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nSince August 1943 the elite Hungarian 1st Cavalry Division were stationed on the outskirts of the Polish capital, in the forests of Kampinos. The unit was withdrawn from the front for recuperation and refitting. When the uprising began, the Hungarian soldiers passed equipment, food, supplies, even weapons and ammunition to Polish fighters who they were supposed to disarm and capture. They also informed them about German plans and troop movements. Very often the two sides agreed to feign a \"partisan attack\" on supply vehicles, and after a mock firefight the Hungarians \"fled\" and let the Poles \"pillage\" their supplies, which often included large shipments of firearms. At other times they let Polish units through their lines but blocked the way from Germans who were chasing them. At other times individual Polish soldiers found asylum at Hungarian units who \"captured\" and refused to extradite them to the Germans. There were several incidents when Hungarian soldiers threatened Germans with weapons to protect these refugees. When the Germans ordered the 5th Hungarian infantry division to withdraw from Warsaw's vicinity, they left behind equipment and ammunition for the partisans. They also frequently provided them with Hungarian uniforms. Ironically the Poles and the Hungarians mostly communicated in German language which they both knew.\n\nDuring one event, when the German radio reconnaissance successfully located a strategically important Polish radio station, the Hungarian radio operators thwarted the German raid to capture the station by jamming German radio frequencies.\n\nThe 23rd Reserve Division, commanded by Major General Guszt\u00e1v Dese\u0151 passed on information to the Polish partisans about which bridges can be destroyed in the area without making the Germans suspicious of the Hungarians. In the area between the towns of Tomasz\u00f3w Mazowiecki and Radom, near Diabla G\u00f3ra (Devil's Hill) the same unit got into a firefight with an approximately 200-strong German military police detachment and freed several hundred Polish and Jewish prisoners from a train headed to the concentration camp at Pruszk\u00f3w.\n\nThis cooperation wasn't unofficial or occasional. General Antal Vattay, commander of the Hungarian troops was in secret talks of the leadership of the Polish resistance and held several meetings at various locations. These negotiations were conducted with the knowledge and permission of the Hungarian government and personally Admiral Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, Regent of Hungary. As it was feared that the Germans may try to arrest Vattay, he was recalled to Budapest and replaced with General B\u00e9la Lengyel, who used to be the military attach\u00e9 to the Hungarian embassy in Warsaw before the war. If possible, he was even more sympathetic to the Polish case than his predecessor and personally knew some of the leaders of the Polish resistance, including General B\u00f3r-Komorowski. Ultimately the Hungarians offered to switch sides and openly engage German troops in combat if the Polish leaders could provide guarantees that the Soviets later won't treat them as enemy combatants. As the Poles were not in the position to make such assurances, this never happened.\n\nThere also are several recorded cases of Hungarian soldiers defecting to the Polish side and fighting with them. Some of them died in the firefights, and some were executed by the Germans. The 1st Cavalry Division also participated in the rescue of Polish civilians from German atrocities. At least 1600 Warsaw families got away from SS troops on Hungarian military vehicles. Many of them were smuggled to Hungary. Ksenia Martysz\u00f3wna, a famous Polish interwar actress, known as Xenia Grey, was one of them.<ref>A magyar korridor: Vars\u00f3 1944 (The Hungarian Corridor: Warsaw 1944) Documentary, 2016, directed by Levente Jamrik</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1994-054-30, Warschauer Aufstand, polnischer Soldat.jpg|thumb|Home Army soldier from the Mokot\u00f3w District surrenders to German troops.

Though the figure of 9,000 German WIA is generally accepted and generates no controversy, there is little agreement as to German irrecoverable losses (KIA+MIA). Until the 1990s the Eastern and the Western historiography stuck to two widely different estimates, the former claiming 17,000 and the latter 2,000. The 17,000 figure was first coined by a 1947 issue of a Warsaw historical journal ''Dzieje Najnowsze'', allegedly based on estimates made by Bach Zelewski when interrogated by his Polish captors (and divided into 10,000 KIA and 7,000 MIA). This figure was initially repeated in West Germany.<ref>e.g. a German scholar specialized in Polish history, Hans E. Roos, in ''Der Tag'' of 01.08.1954 repeated the 17,000 KIA+MIA figure, referred after Klaus-Peter Friedrich, ''Kontaminierte Erinnerung: Vom Einflu\u00df der Kriegspropaganda auf das Gedenken an die Warschauer Aufst\u00e4nde von 1943 und 1944'', [in:] ''Zeitschrift fur Ostmitteleuropa-Forschung'' 55/3 ( 2008), p. 427</ref> However, in 1962 a scholarly monograph by Hanns Krannhals coined the 2,000 estimate.<ref>\"auf deutscher Seite w\u00e4hrend des Aufstandes 2 000 Angeh\u00f6rige deutsch gef\u00fchrer Verb\u00e4nde gefallen und 9 000 verwunder worden sind\", see Hanns von Krannhals, ''Der Warschauer Aufstand'', Frankfurt a/M 1962, p. 215; Krannhals dismissed the 17,000 figure as \"Bach\u2019s overestimates which unfortunately made it to the Polish literature\"</ref> It was based on the 1,570 German KIA figure officially reported by Bach in October 1944, rounded up with estimates related to first few days when Bach was not in charge and to losses suffered by [[19th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|19. PzDiv]] (not subordinate to Bach), briefly engaged against the Poles in Northern Warsaw during last days of the fightings.\n\nUntil the late 20th century the 17,000 figure was consistently and unequivocally quoted in the Polish, though also in the East German and Soviet historiography, be it encyclopedias,<ref>see e.g. Kazimierz Sobczak (ed.), ''Encyklopedia II wojny \u015bwiatowej'', Warszawa 1975, p. 626</ref> scientific monographs<ref>see e.g. Jerzy Kirchmayer, ''Powstanie Warszawskie, Warszawa 1978'', ISBN  {{ISBN|830511080X}}, p. 576</ref> or more popular works.<ref>see e.g. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski, ''1859 dni Warszawy'', Warszawa 1982, {{ISBN|8370061524}}, p. 758</ref> It was at times paired or otherwise related to the figure of 16,000 German Warsaw KIA+MIA listed by the so-called ''Gehlen report'' of April 1945.<ref>see e.g. Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Militarne aspekty powstania warszawskiego'', [in:] Marek M. Drozdowski (ed.), ''Powstanie Warszawskie z perspektywy p\u00f3\u0142wiecza'', Warszawa 1995, {{ISBN|8386301104}}, p. 129</ref> The 2,000 figure was accepted in West Germany and generally spilled over to Western historiography;<ref>see e.g. Gunther Deschner, ''Warsaw rising'', New York 1972, p. 175</ref> exceptions were studies written in English by the Poles<ref>see e.g. Janusz Kazimierz Zawodny, ''Nothing But Honour: The Story of the Warsaw Uprising'', 1944, Washington 1978, {{ISBN|9780817968311}}</ref> and some other works.<ref>see e.g. ''Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress'', Washington 1983, p. 16309</ref>\n\nRecently the Polish historiography has been increasingly turning towards the 2,000 figure. Komorowski, who in 1995 opted for 16,000, changed his mind and 10 years later cautiously subscribed to the 2,000 figure;<ref>Krzysztof Komorowski, ''Bitwa o Warszaw\u0119 \u201944'', Warszawa 2004, {{ISBN|9788373991330}}, p.  271</ref> also scholars like Sawicki<ref>Tadeusz Sawicki, ''Rozkaz: zd\u0142awi\u0107 Powstanie'', Warszwa 2001, {{ISBN|9788311092846}}, p. 189</ref> and Rozwadowski<ref>Piotr Rozwadowski, ''Warszawa 1944-1945'', Warszawa 2006, {{ISBN|8311104808}}, pp. 110-111</ref> tentatively followed suit. The discrepancy is tackled head-on in a popular work of B\u0105czyk,<ref>Norbert B\u0105czyk, ''Ilu naprawd\u0119 poleg\u0142o w powstaniu warszawskim'', [in:] ''Tygodnik Polityka'' 42 (2014), pp. 54-56</ref> who concludes that 3,000 is the maximum conceivable (though not the most probable) figure. In his 2016 analysis Sowa dismissed the 17,000 figure as \u201centirely improbable\u201d and suggested that its longevity and popularity resulted from manipulation on part of apologists of the Rising.<ref>Andrzej Leon Sowa, ''Kto wyda\u0142 wyrok na miasto?'', Krak\u00f3w 2016, {{ISBN|9788308060957}}, pp. 617-618. The claim should be taken with caution; the 17,000 figure was systematically reproduced also in the Communist propaganda, which first lambasted the Rising as criminal suicidal act and later approached it at least with great deal of skepticism</ref>  In popular discourse in Poland the 17,000 figure still remains in wide circulation.<ref>it is advanced e.g. by ''Dzieje.pl'', a website operated by a number of official Polish institutions, compare [http://dzieje.pl/infografiki/polskie-i-niemieckie-straty-w-powstaniu-warszawskim here]</ref> Popular media seem bewildered; the most popular Polish internet portal ''[[Onet.pl|Onet]]'' in its news section favors the 2,000 figure<ref>compare the ''Onet'' news section, available [http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/powstanie-warszawskie-ile-trwalo-data-mapa-skutki-infografika/s7n9s1 here]</ref> and in its educational section opts for 17,000.<ref>compare the ''Onet'' educational service, available [http://klasowka.onet.pl/podrecznik/poznac-przeszlosc-wiek-xx-klasa-1-liceum/podrozdzial-rozdzial-iv-powstanie-warszawskie/wytlumaczenie here]</ref>\n\nBeyond Poland and Germany both figures remain in circulation, though the ones of 16-17,000 seem to be on the rise.<ref>see e.g. a booklet from the popular Osprey series, which claims 16,000 German KIA, Robert Forczyk, ''Warsaw 1944'', Bloomsbury 2009, {{ISBN|9781846033520}}, p. 89</ref> In the Russian historiography it is given clear preference, be it in encyclopedias and dictionaries<ref>see e.g. the entry ''\u0410\u0440\u043c\u0438\u044f \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u0432\u0430'', [in:] \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0432, \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u043e\u0431\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432, ''\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430\u044f \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 1941\u20131945 \u0433\u0433. \u042d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c'', \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 2017, {{ISBN|9785040341412}}</ref> or general works;<ref>see e.g. \u0410\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0435\u0439 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0435\u0432, \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432, ''\u041d\u0435 \u0442\u0430\u043c \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430. \u041a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0438 \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f?'', \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 2017, {{ISBN|9785457906037}}, p. 437</ref> the same opinion might be found in Belorussia.<ref>''\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u044b\u043a\u043b\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0434\u044b\u044f'', vol. 4, \u041c\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a 1997, {{ISBN|9789851100909}}, p. 17.
