Foster and Frances Nicholson, Thomas Foster was born July 24, 1852, in [[Lambton Mills]], Ontario. His family soon moved to [[Leaskdale]], Ontario after his mother's death.\n\nHe started his working life as a butcher's boy in Toronto, until he saved enough money to purchase his own butcher shop for $50. The earnings from that business allowed him to purchase property which became the source of his eventual wealth.\n\n==Political career==\nHe was first elected as an alderman for St. David Ward in 1891, then reelected in 1892 and 1894. In 1895 he lost the election, and did not return to council until 1900 as an alderman for Ward 2, a position which he held until 1909. He was elected to the [[Toronto Board of Control]] in 1910; however, he lost the 1911 election. In 1912 he was again elected Controller and kept his seat until 1917.\n\nFoster served as a Member of [[House of Commons of Canada]] from 1917 to 1921. He was elected as a [[Unionist Party (Canada)|Union Government]] candidate in the [[1917 Canadian federal election|1917 federal election]] for [[York East|East York]]. He lost in his party's nominations for candidates so he ran as an independent but lost his seat in the [[1921 Canadian federal election|1921 election]].\n\nFoster returned to City Council for the next three years, then was elected as mayor in 1925. He was a great supporter of Hydro expenditures and loved flowers. As an alderman he fought for the rebuilding of the pavilion at [[Allan Gardens]] after it had been destroyed by fire. In his 25 years of civic service he earned the informal title of \"Honest Tom\". As mayor of Toronto he was reported to have saved the city two million dollars by rigid economics. \n[[File:Thomas Foster Memorial Temple.jpg|thumb|left|Thomas Foster Memorial Temple.]]\nFoster was known to collect the rents on his properties in person, even when he was mayor. If a tenant complained about a problem, or wanted a bit of work done, Foster would go out to his car, get his tools and fix the issue on the spot.<ref name=mem/> His penny pinching eventually led to his defeat due to his refusal to raise police salaries.<ref name=mem/>\n\n==Later years and legacy==\nHe was a great traveler and on one of his trips he was inspired by the [[Taj Mahal]]. In 1935 and 1936 he had a memorial temple constructed on a hill between Leaskdale and [[Uxbridge, Ontario (town)|Uxbridge]], Ontario, for his family at a cost of $200,000. The temple was designed by Foster with architects H.H. Madill and James H. Craig<ref>http://www.uxbridge.com/people/tfoster.html</ref> and inspired by [[Mughal architecture]] and [[Byzantine architecture]].\n\nHe died at the age of 93 and is buried in the massive mausoleum on a hill north of town on [[Durham Regional Road 1]] which includes the remains of Foster, his wife and daughter. Foster left $80,000 in funds to maintain the property in perpetuity but the trustees spent the principal and the funds had dried up by the 1990s, leaving the Town of Uxbridge to take over responsibility for the monument. In 2013, it was estimated that $1 million was needed to repair and restore the building, a controversial task given that the entire budget for the municipality was only $14 million.<ref name=mem>{{cite news|title=Uxbridge struggles to repair former Toronto mayor's grandiose mausoleum|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/10/18/uxbridge_struggles_to_repair_former_toronto_mayors_grandiose_mausoleum.html|accessdate=October 18, 2013|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=October 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAmong other things, Foster left $500,000 for cancer research, $100,000 for an annual picnic to be held at Exhibition Park for school children, and funds to feed wild birds in Toronto. Inspired by the [[Great Stork Derby]], Mayor Foster also sponsored a contest to reward mothers for their skills at procreation. The prizes were $1,250 for first, $800 for second, and $450 for third.

It is largely [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], although the degree of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the [[dialect]] and accent of the speaker. Written Norwegian and Danish are usually more easily understood by Swedish speakers than the spoken languages, due to the differences in [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], accent and intonation. Swedish is a descendant of [[Old Norse]], the common language of the [[Germanic peoples]] living in Scandinavia during the [[Viking Era]]. It has the most speakers of the North Germanic languages.\n\n[[Standard Swedish]], spoken by most [[Swedes]], is the [[national language]] that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century. While distinct regional [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] descending from the older rural dialects still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform and [[Standard language|standardized]].\n\nThe standard word order is, as in most [[Germanic languages]], [[V2 word order|V2]], which means that the [[finite verb]] (V) appears in the second position (2) of a declarative [[main clause]]. [[Swedish morphology]] is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few [[inflections]]. Swedish has two [[grammatical gender|genders]] and is generally seen to have two [[grammatical cases]] \u2013 [[nominative]] and [[genitive]] (except for pronouns that, as in English, also are inflected in the [[Object (grammar)|object]] form) \u2013 although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive ''s'', then seen as a [[clitic]]. Swedish has two [[Grammatical number|grammatical numbers]] \u2013 [[plural]] and [[Grammatical number|singular]]. [[Adjectives]] have discrete [[Comparison (grammar)|comparative and superlative]] forms and are also inflected according to gender, number and [[definiteness]]. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through [[suffixes]] (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite [[article (grammar)|articles]]. The [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] features both [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large [[vowel]] inventory. Swedish is also notable for the [[voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative]], a highly variable consonant [[phoneme]].\n\nSwedish has also had historic use in [[Estonia]], although the current status of the [[Estonian Swedish]] speakers is almost extinct. Instead, it is used in the [[Swedish diaspora]], most notably in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], with more than 50,000 resident Swedes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sverige-norge.se/var-tionde-oslobo-ar-nu-svensk/|title=Var tionde Oslobo \u00e4r nu svensk|publisher=Sverige-Norge Personalf\u00f6rmedling|language=sv|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nSwedish is an [[Indo-European language]] belonging to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] branch of the [[Germanic languages]]. In the established classification, it belongs to the [[East Scandinavian languages]], together with [[Danish language|Danish]], separating it from the [[West Scandinavian languages]], consisting of [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. However, more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups: ''Insular Scandinavian'' (Faroese and Icelandic), and ''Continental Scandinavian'' (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), based on mutual intelligibility due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian (particularly Danish) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and Icelandic.<ref name=\"crystal\"/>\n\nBy many general criteria of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages could very well be considered [[dialect]]s of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between [[Denmark]] and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the [[nationalist]] ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate [[Orthography|orthographies]], dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a [[dialect continuum]] of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of [[Bohusl\u00e4n]], [[Dalsland]], western [[V\u00e4rmland]], western [[Dalarna]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[J\u00e4mtland]], and [[Scania]], could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.<ref name=\"crystal\">{{Harvnb|Crystal|1999|loc=''Scandinavian''}}</ref>\n\nSwedish pronunciations also vary greatly from one region to another, a legacy of the vast geographic distances and historical isolation. Even so, the vocabulary is standardized to a level that make dialects within Sweden virtually fully mutually intelligible.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Swedish}}\n\n===Old Norse===\n{{Main|Old Norse}}\n{{Old Norse language map}}\nIn the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], evolved into Old Norse. This language underwent more changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects: ''Old West Norse'' (Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland) and ''Old East Norse'' (Denmark and Sweden). The dialects of Old East Norse spoken in Sweden are called ''[[Runic Swedish]]'', while the dialects of Denmark are referred to as ''Runic Danish''. The dialects are described as \"runic\" because the main body of text appears in the [[runic alphabet]]. Unlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]] alphabet, Old Norse was written with the [[Younger Futhark]] alphabet, which had only 16 letters. Because the number of runes was limited, some runes were used for a range of [[phoneme]]s, such as the rune for the vowel ''u'', which was also used for the vowels ''o'', ''\u00f8'' and ''y'', and the rune for ''i'', also used for ''e''.<ref name=Edlund2010p26-31>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|pp=26\u201331}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1200 onwards, the dialects in Denmark began to diverge from those of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, or [[isogloss]]es, ranging from [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] in the south to [[Norrland]], [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|\u00d6sterbotten]] and northwestern [[Finland]] in the north.<ref name=Edlund2010p26-31/>\n\nAn early change that separated Runic Danish from the other dialects of Old East Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''\u00e6i'' to the [[monophthong]] ''\u00e9'', as in ''st\u00e6inn'' to ''st\u00e9nn'' \"stone\". This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. There was also a change of ''au'' as in ''dau\u00f0r'' into a long open ''\u00f8'' as in ''d\u00f8\u00f0r'' \"dead\". This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tau\u00fer'' into ''tu\u00fer''. Moreover, the ''\u00f8y'' diphthong changed into a long, [[close vowel|close]] ''\u00f8'', as in the Old Norse word for \"island\". By the end of the period, these innovations had affected most of the Runic Swedish-speaking area as well, with the exception of the dialects spoken north and east of [[M\u00e4lardalen]] where the diphthongs still exist in remote areas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bergman|1984|pp=21\u201323}}</ref>\n\n===Old Swedish===\n[[File:V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen blad 21.jpg|thumb|right|The initial page of the first complete copy of ''[[V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen]]'', the [[code of law|law code]] of [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], from {{circa|1280}}. It is one of the earliest texts in Swedish written in the [[Latin script]].]]\n{{Main|Old Swedish}}\nOld Swedish (Swedish: ''fornsvenska'') is the term used for the [[medieval]] Swedish language. The start date is usually set to 1225 since this is the year that ''[[V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen]]'' (\"the V\u00e4stg\u00f6ta Law\") is believed to have been compiled for the first time.<ref>The oldest dated fragments are from 1250 and the oldest complete manuscript is from c. 1280</ref> It is among the most important documents of the period written in [[Latin script]] and the oldest Swedish [[code of law|law codes]]. Old Swedish is divided into ''\u00e4ldre fornsvenska'' (1225\u20131375) and ''yngre fornsvenska'' (1375\u20131526), \"older\" and \"younger\" Old Swedish.<ref>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|pp=28\u201329}}</ref> Important outside influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Christian church]] and various [[Monasticism|monastic]] orders, introducing many [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] loanwords. With the rise of [[Hanseatic league|Hanseatic]] power in the late 13th and early 14th century, [[Middle Low German]] became very influential. The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of [[Low German]]-speaking immigrants. Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society, and brought terms from their native languages into the vocabulary. Besides a great number of loanwords for such areas as warfare, trade and administration, general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions were imported. The League also brought a certain measure of influence from [[Danish language|Danish]] (at the time much more similar than today's language).<ref name=Edlund2010p29,31>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|pp=29, 31}}</ref>\n\nEarly Old Swedish was markedly different from the modern language in that it had a more complex [[case (linguistics)|case]] structure and also retained the original Germanic three-[[gender (grammar)|gender]] system. [[Noun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[pronoun]]s and certain [[Grammatical number|numerals]] were inflected in four cases; besides the extant [[Nominative case|nominative]], there were also the [[Genitive case|genitive]] (later [[possessive case|possessive]]), [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Accusative case|accusative]]. The gender system resembled that of modern [[German language|German]], having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a ''common gender'' with the [[Definiteness|definite suffix]] ''-en'' and the [[definite article]] ''den'', in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents ''-et'' and ''det''. The verb system was also more complex: it included [[subjunctive]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]] [[mood (grammar)|moods]] and verbs were conjugated according to [[person (grammar)|person]] as well as [[number (grammar)|number]]. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|pp=150\u2013157}}</ref>\n\nA transitional change of the Latin script in the Nordic countries was to spell the letter combination \"ae\" as \u00e6 \u2013 and sometimes as a' \u2013 though it varied between persons and regions. The combination \"ao\" was similarly rendered a<sup>o</sup>, and \"oe\" became o<sup>e</sup>. These three were later to evolve into the separate letters [[\u00e4]], [[\u00e5]] and [[\u00f6]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=139}}</ref> The first time the new letters were used in print was in ''Aff dy\u00e4ffwlsens fr\u00e4stilse'' (\"By the Devil's temptation\") published by [[Johan Gerson]] in 1495.<ref>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|p=29}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Swedish===\n{{Main|Modern Swedish}}\n[[File:Gustav Vasa Bible 1541.jpg|thumb|upright|Front page of [[Gustav Vasa]]'s Bible from 1541, using [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]].

Printed in [[Uppsala]]. 1541\".]]\n\nModern Swedish (Swedish: ''nysvenska'') begins with the advent of the [[printing press]] and the European [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. After assuming power, the new monarch [[Gustav Vasa]] ordered a Swedish translation of the [[Bible]]. The [[New Testament]] was published in 1526, followed by a full [[Bible translation]] in 1541, usually referred to as the ''[[Gustav Vasa Bible]]'', a translation deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were [[Laurentius Andre\u00e6]] and the brothers [[Laurentius Petri|Laurentius]] and [[Olaus Petri]].<ref>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|p=33}}</ref>\n\nThe Vasa Bible is often considered to be a reasonable compromise between old and new; while not adhering to the colloquial spoken language of its day, it was not overly conservative in its use of archaic forms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=151}}</ref> It was a major step towards a more consistent [[Swedish orthography]]. It established the use of the vowels \"\u00e5\", \"\u00e4\", and \"\u00f6\", and the spelling \"ck\" in place of \"kk\", distinguishing it clearly from the Danish Bible, perhaps intentionally, given the ongoing rivalry between the countries. All three translators came from central Sweden which is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nordic Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z17C7s3r_nwC&pg=PA1900 |year=2005 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019706-8 |page=1900}}</ref>\n\nThough it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during the remainder of the century.

It saw a democratization of the language with a less formal written form that approached the spoken one. The growth of a public school system also led to the evolution of so-called ''boksvenska'' (literally, \"book Swedish\"), especially among the working classes, where spelling to some extent influenced pronunciation, particularly in official contexts. With the industrialization and urbanization of Sweden well under way by the last decades of the 19th century, a new breed of authors made their mark on [[Swedish literature]]. Many scholars, politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the emerging national language, among them prolific authors like the poet [[Gustaf Fr\u00f6ding]], Nobel laureate [[Selma Lagerl\u00f6f]], and radical writer and playwright [[August Strindberg]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Josephson|2005|loc=chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nIt was during the 20th century that a common, standardized national language became available to all Swedes.

Previously, the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. The use of  ''herr'' (\"Mr\" or \"Sir\"), ''fru'' (\"Mrs\" or \"Ma'am\") or ''fr\u00f6ken'' (\"Miss\") was considered the only acceptable way to begin conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society. In the early 20th century, an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with ''ni''\u2014the standard [[Grammatical person|second person plural]] pronoun)\u2014analogous to the [[French language|French]] ''vous''. (Cf. [[T-V distinction]].) ''Ni'' wound up being used as a slightly less familiar form of ''du'', the singular second person pronoun, used to address people of lower social status. With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 1960s, these class distinctions  became less important, and ''du'' became the standard, even in formal and official contexts. Though the reform was not an act of any centralized political decree, but rather the result of sweeping change in social attitudes, it was completed in just a few years, from the late 1960s to early 1970s.<ref>Nationalencyklopedin, ''du-tilltal'' and ''ni-tilltal''</ref> The use of ''ni'' as a polite form of address is sometimes encountered today in both the written and spoken language, particularly among older speakers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Philip|last2=Hinchliffe|first2=Ian|title=Swedish: An Essential Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGasMbSR-8gC&pg=PA86|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-45800-9|page=86}}</ref>\n\n==Geographic distribution==\nSwedish is the sole official national language of [[Sweden]], and one of two in [[Finland]] (alongside [[Finnish language|Finnish]]).

The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in [[parliament]], and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the [[Russian Empire]] in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern [[Ukraine]], where they founded a village, ''[[Gammalsvenskby]]'' (\"Old Swedish Village\"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.<ref>The number of registered Swedes in Zmeyovka (the modern Ukrainian name of ''Gammalsvenskby'') in 1994 was 116 according to [[Nationalencyklopedin]], article ''svenskbyborna''.</ref>\n\nFrom 1918\u20131940, when Estonia was independent, the small Swedish community was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden before the end of [[World War II]], that is, before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944. Only a handful of speakers remain.<ref>''Nationalencyklopedin'', ''estlandssvenskar''.</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Swedish phonology}}\n\n[[File:Swedish monophthongs chart.svg|thumb|right|The vowel phonemes of Central Standard Swedish<ref>{{Harvnb|Engstrand|1999|p=140}}</ref>]]\n\nSwedish dialects have either 17 or 18 vowel [[phoneme]]s, 9 long and 9 short. As in the other Germanic languages, including English, most long vowels are phonetically paired with one of the short vowels, and the pairs are such that the two vowels are of similar [[vowel quality|quality]], but with the short vowel being slightly lower and slightly centralized. In contrast to e.g. Danish, which has only tense vowels, the short vowels are slightly more lax, but the tense vs. lax contrast is not nearly as pronounced as in English, German or Dutch. In most dialects, the short vowel sound pronounced {{IPA|[\u025b]}} or {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} has merged with the short {{IPA|/e/}} (transcribed {{angbr IPA|\u025b}} in the chart below).<ref name=AndersonEngstrand>{{Harvnb|Andersson|2002|pp=271\u2013312}}; {{Harvnb|Engstrand|1999}}</ref>\n\nThere are 18 consonant phonemes, two of which, {{IPAslink|\u0267}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, vary considerably in pronunciation depending on the dialect and social status of the speaker. In many dialects, sequences of {{IPA|/r/}} (pronounced alveolarly) with a dental consonant result in [[retroflex consonant]]s; alveolarity of the pronunciation of {{IPA|/r/}} is a precondition for this retroflexion. {{IPA|/r/}} has a [[guttural R|guttural]] or \"French R\" pronunciation in the [[South Swedish dialects]]; consequently, these dialects lack [[retroflex consonant]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Garl\u00e9n|1988|pp=73\u201374}}</ref>\n\nSwedish is a [[stress-timed]] language, where the time intervals between [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed syllables]] are equal.

Nouns are of [[common gender]] (''en'' form) or [[neuter gender]] (''ett'' form).<ref>{{Harvnb|Granberry|1991|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> The gender determines the declension of the [[adjective]]s. For example, the word ''fisk'' (\"fish\") is a noun of common gender (''en fisk'') and can have the following forms:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n! Singular\n! Plural\n|-\n! Indefinite form\n| ''fisk''\n| ''fiskar''\n|-\n! Definite form\n| ''fisken''\n| ''fiskarna''\n|}\n\nThe definite singular form of a noun is created by adding a suffix (''-en'', ''-n'', ''-et'' or ''-t''), depending on its gender and if the noun ends in a vowel or not. The definite articles ''den'', ''det'', and ''de'' are used for variations to the definitiveness of a noun. They can double as [[demonstrative]] [[pronoun]]s or [[Determiner (class)|demonstrative determiners]] when used with [[adverb]]s such as ''h\u00e4r'' (\"here\") or ''d\u00e4r'' (\"there\") to form ''den/det h\u00e4r (can also be \"denna/detta\")'' (\"this\"), ''de h\u00e4r (can also be \"dessa\")'' (\"these\"), ''den/det d\u00e4r'' (\"that\"), and ''de d\u00e4r'' (\"those\"). For example, ''den d\u00e4r fisken'' means \"that fish\" and refers to a specific fish; ''den fisken'' is less definite and means \"that fish\" in a more abstract sense, such as that set of fish; while ''fisken'' means \"the fish\". In certain cases, the definite form indicates possession, e. g., ''jag m\u00e5ste tv\u00e4tta h\u00e5r'''et''''' (\"I must wash ''my'' hair\").<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\n[[Adjective]]s are inflected in two declensions \u2013 indefinite and definite \u2013 and they must match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created by adding a suffix (''-t'' or ''-a'') to the common form of the adjective, e. g., ''en gr\u00f6n stol'' (a green chair), ''ett gr\u00f6nt hus'' (a green house), and ''gr\u00f6na stolar'' (\"green chairs\"). The definite form of an adjective is identical to the indefinite plural form, e. g., ''den gr\u00f6na stolen'' (\"the green chair\"), ''det gr\u00f6na huset'' (\"the green house\"), and ''de gr\u00f6na stolarna'' (\"the green chairs\").<ref name=\"Haugen\">{{Harvnb|Haugen|2009}}</ref>\n\nSwedish [[pronoun]]s are similar to those of English. Besides the two natural genders ''han'' and ''hon'' (\"he\" and \"she\"), there are also the two [[grammatical gender]]s ''den'' and ''det'', usually termed [[Gender in Danish and Swedish|common and neuter]]. Unlike the nouns, pronouns have an additional [[object (linguistics)|object]] form, derived from the old [[dative]] form. ''Hon'', for example, has the following nominative, possessive, and object forms:<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\n:''hon'' \u2013 ''hennes'' \u2013 ''henne''\n\nSwedish also uses third-person possessive [[reflexive pronoun]]s that refer to the subject in a clause, a trait which is restricted to North Germanic languages:\n\n:''Anna gav Maria sin bok.''; \"Anna gave Maria her [Anna's] book.\" (reflexive)\n:''Anna gav Maria hennes bok.''; \"Anna gave Maria her [Maria's] book.\" (not reflexive)\n\nSwedish used to have [[genitive]] that was placed at the end of the head of a noun phrase. In modern Swedish, it has become an [[enclitic]] ''-s'', which attaches to the end of the noun phrase, rather than the noun itself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hultman|2003|pp=70, 212\u2013213}}</ref>\n\n:''h\u00e4sten''; \"the horse\" \u2013 ''h\u00e4stens'' \"the horse's\"\n:''h\u00e4sten p\u00e5 den blommande \u00e4ngens svarta man''; \"the horse in the flowering meadow's black mane\"\n\nIn formal written language, it used to be considered correct to place the genitive ''-s'' after the head of the noun phrase (''h\u00e4sten''), though this is today considered dated, and different grammatical constructions are often used.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hultman|2003|p=213}}</ref>\n\nVerbs are [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] according to [[grammatical tense|tense]]. One group of verbs (the ones ending in ''-er'' in present tense) has a special [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form (generally the verb [[word stem|stem]]), but with most verbs the imperative is identical to the [[infinitive]] form. [[perfect (grammar)|Perfect]] and [[present tense|present]] [[participle]]s as adjectival verbs are very common:<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\n:Perfect participle: ''en stekt fisk''; \"a fried fish\" (steka = to fry)\n:Present participle: ''en stinkande fisk''; \"a stinking fish\" (stinka = to stink)\n\nIn contrast to English and many other languages, Swedish does not use the perfect participle to form the present perfect and past perfect. Rather, the [[auxiliary verb]] ''har'' (\"have\"), ''hade'' (\"had\") is followed by a special form, called [[supine]], used solely for this purpose (although often identical to the neuter form of the perfect participle):<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\n:Perfect participle: ''m\u00e5lad'', \"painted\" \u2013 supine ''m\u00e5lat'', present perfect ''har m\u00e5lat''; \"have painted\"\n:Perfect participle: ''stekt'', \"fried\" \u2013 supine ''stekt'', present perfect ''har stekt''; \"have fried\"\n:Perfect participle: ''skriven'', \"written\" \u2013 supine ''skrivit'', present perfect ''har skrivit''; \"have written\"\n\nWhen building the compound passive voice using the verb ''att bli'', the past participle is used:\n\n:''den blir m\u00e5lad''; \"it's being painted\"\n:''den blev m\u00e5lad''; \"it was painted\"\n\nThere exists also an inflected passive voice formed by adding ''-s'', replacing the final ''r'' in the present tense:\n\n:''den m\u00e5las''; \"it's being painted\"\n:''den m\u00e5lades''; \"it was painted\"\n\nIn a subordinate [[clause]], the auxiliary ''har'' is optional and often omitted, particularly in written Swedish.\n\n:''Jag ser att han (har) stekt fisken''; \"I see that he has fried the fish\"\n\n[[Subjunctive mood]] is occasionally used for some verbs, but its use is in sharp decline and few speakers perceive the handful of commonly used verbs (as for instance: ''vore, m\u00e5nne'') as separate conjugations, most of them remaining only as set of [[Idiom|idiomatic expressions]].<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\nWhere other languages may use [[grammatical cases]], Swedish uses numerous [[preposition]]s, similar to those found in [[English language|English]]. As in modern [[German language|German]], prepositions formerly determined case in Swedish, but this feature can only be found in certain idiomatic expressions like ''till fots'' (\"on foot\", genitive).<ref>{{Harvnb|Hultman|2003|pp=182\u2013183}}</ref>\n\nAs Swedish is a Germanic language, the [[syntax]] shows similarities to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] basic word order, but like German it utilizes [[V2 word order|verb-second word order]] in main clauses, for instance after [[adverbs]] and adverbial phrases, and [[dependent clauses]]. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually placed at the beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) [[Prepositional phrase]]s are placed in a [[place\u2013manner\u2013time]] order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolander|2002}}</ref> Verb-second (inverted) word order is also used for questions.<ref name=\"Stensson 2013\">{{cite web|last1=Stensson|first1=Leif|title=Swedish Grammar {{!}} Syntax|url=https://www.lysator.liu.se/language/Languages/Swedish/Grammar.html#syntax|publisher=Lysator Society, Link\u00f6ping University|accessdate=9 March 2018|date=August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe [[vocabulary]] of Swedish is mainly Germanic, either through common Germanic heritage or through loans from German, Middle Low German, and to some extent, English. Examples of Germanic words in Swedish are ''mus'' (\"mouse\"), ''kung'' (\"king\"), and ''g\u00e5s'' (\"goose\"). A significant part of the religious and scientific vocabulary is of [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, often borrowed from [[French language|French]] and, lately, English. Some 1\u2013200 words are also borrowed from [[Scandoromani language|Scandoromani]] or [[Romani language|Romani]], often as slang varieties; a commonly used word from Romani is ''[[:wikt:tjej|tjej]]'' (\"girl\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Wess\u00e9n|1998}}</ref>\n\nA large number of [[French language|French]] words were imported into Sweden around the 18th century. These words have been [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] to the Swedish spelling system and are therefore pronounced recognizably to a French-speaker. Most of them are distinguished by a \"French accent\", characterized by emphasis on the last syllable. For example, ''niv\u00e5'' (fr. ''niveau'', \"level\"), ''f\u00e5t\u00f6lj'' (fr. ''fauteuil'', \"armchair\") and ''aff\u00e4r'' (\"shop; affair\"), etc. Cross-borrowing from other Germanic languages has also been common, at first from Middle Low German, the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic league]] and later from [[Standard German]]. Some compounds are translations of the elements ([[calque]]s) of German original compounds into Swedish, like ''{{lang|sv|bomull}}'' from German ''{{lang|de|Baumwolle}}'' (\"cotton\"; literally, ''tree-wool'').<ref>Nationalencyklopedin, ''svenska: spr\u00e5khistoria''</ref>\n\nAs with many Germanic languages, new words can be formed by compounding, e. g., nouns like ''{{lang|sv|nagellackborttagningsmedel}}'' (\"nail polish remover\") or verbs like ''{{lang|sv|smyglyssna}}'' (\"to eavesdrop\").<ref name=CompoundNoun/><ref>{{cite web |title=Smyglyssna |url=http://ordbok.woxikon.se/sv-en/smyglyssna |website=Woxikon |accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Compound nouns take their [[grammatical gender|gender]] from the [[head (linguistics)|head]], which in Swedish is always the last morpheme.<ref name=CompoundNoun>{{cite web |title=Minor Grammar English-Swedish |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/194349317/Minor-Grammar-English-Swedish |publisher=Scribd |accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> New words can also be coined by [[Morphological derivation|derivation]] from other established words, such as the [[verbification]] of [[noun]]s by the adding of the [[suffix#Derivational suffixes|suffix]] ''-a'', as in ''{{lang|sv|bil}}'' (\"car\") and ''{{lang|sv|bila}}'' (\"travel (recreationally) by car\").<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Gomer |editor1-first=Eva |editor2-last=Morris-Nygren |editor2-first=Mona |title=Bila |work=Modern Svensk Engelsk Ordbok |date=1976 |publisher=Prisma |page=57}}</ref> The opposite, making nouns of verbs, is also possible, as in ''{{lang|sv|t\u00e4nk}}'' (\"way of thinking; concept\") from ''{{lang|sv|t\u00e4nka}}'' (\"to think\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Spr\u00e5ket lever {{!}} t\u00e4nk|url=https://www.sprakinstitutet.fi/sv/aktuellt/spraket_lever/tank.20235.news|publisher=Institutet f\u00f6r de inhemska spr\u00e5ken|accessdate=3 March 2018|language=Swedish|date=18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Main|Swedish orthography}}\nThe [[Swedish alphabet]] is a 29-letter [[alphabet]], using the 26-letter [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] plus the three additional letters ''[[\u00c5|\u00c5''/''\u00e5]]'', ''[[\u00c4|\u00c4''/''\u00e4]]'', and ''[[\u00d6|\u00d6''/''\u00f6]]'' constructed in the 16th century by writing \"o\" and \"e\" on top of an \"a\", and an \"e\" on top of an \"o\". Though these combinations are historically modified versions of [[A]] and [[O]] according to the English range of usage for the term [[diacritic]], these three characters are not considered to be diacritics within the Swedish application, but rather separate letters, and are independent letters following ''z''. Before the release of the 13th edition of ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'' in April 2006, ''w'' was treated as merely a variant of ''v'' used only in names (such as \"Wallenberg\") and foreign words (\"bowling\"), and so was both sorted and pronounced as a ''v''. Other [[diacritic]]s (to use the broader English term usage referenced here) are unusual in Swedish; [[\u00e9]] is sometimes used to indicate that the stress falls on a terminal syllable containing ''e'', especially when the stress changes the meaning (''ide'' vs. ''id\u00e9'', \"winter lair\" vs. \"idea\") as well as in some names, like ''Kastr\u00e9n''; occasionally other [[acute accent]]s and, less often, [[grave accent]]s can be seen in names and some foreign words. The letter [[\u00e0]] is used to refer to unit cost (a loan from the French), equivalent to the [[at sign]] (@) in English.<ref>{{Harvnb|Svenska spr\u00e5kn\u00e4mnden|2000}}</ref>\n\nThe German ''[[\u00fc]]'' is treated as a variant of ''[[y]]'' and sometimes retained in foreign names and words, e. g., ''m\u00fcsli'' (\"muesli/granola\"). A proper [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] may very exceptionally be seen in elaborated style (for instance: \"A\u00efda\"). The German convention of writing ''\u00e4'' and ''\u00f6'' as ''ae'' and ''oe'' if the characters are unavailable is an unusual convention for speakers of modern Swedish. Despite the availability of all these characters in the Swedish national [[top-level domain|top-level Internet domain]] and other such domains, Swedish sites are frequently labelled using ''a'' and ''o'', based on visual similarity, though Swedish domains could be registered using the characters \u00e5, \u00e4, and \u00f6 from 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Domain names with characters like \u00e5, \u00e4, \u00f6 (IDN)|url=https://www.iis.se/english/domains/se/idn/|publisher=iiS|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Swedish [[orthography]], the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used in a [[Colon (punctuation)#Usage|similar manner as in English]], with some exceptions: the colon is used for some abbreviations, such as ''3:e'' for ''tredje'' (\"third\") and ''S:t'' for ''Sankt'' (\"Saint\"), and for all types of [[suffix|endings]] that can be added to numbers, letters and abbreviations, such as ''a:et'' (\"the a\") and ''CD:n'' (\"the CD\"), or the genitive form ''USA:s'' (\"USA's\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Svenska spr\u00e5kn\u00e4mnden|2000|pp=154\u2013156}}</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\n[[File:R-pronounciation in Swedish language.JPG|thumb|[[Isogloss]] for the pronunciation of \"R\" (c. 1960), being [[Alveolar trill|alveolar]] north of the boundary and [[guttural R|uvular]] (\"French R\") south of it.

Many of the genuine rural dialects, such as those of [[Orsa, Sweden|Orsa]] in [[Dalarna]] or [[N\u00e4rpes]] in [[Ostrobothnia (region)|\u00d6sterbotten]], have very distinct phonetic and grammatical features, such as plural forms of verbs or archaic [[case (linguistics)|case]] inflections. These dialects can be near-incomprehensible to a majority of Swedes, and most of their speakers are also fluent in Standard Swedish. The different dialects are often so localized that they are limited to individual [[parish]]es and are referred to by Swedish linguists as ''sockenm\u00e5l'' (lit., \"parish speech\"). They are generally separated into six major groups, with common characteristics of prosody, grammar and vocabulary. One or several examples from each group are given here. Though each example is intended to be also representative of the nearby dialects, the actual number of dialects is several hundred if each individual community is considered separately.<ref>{{Harvnb|Engstrand|2004|p=120}}; {{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=184}}</ref>\n\nThis type of classification, however, is based on a somewhat romanticized [[nationalism|nationalist]] view of ethnicity and language. The idea that only rural variants of Swedish should be considered \"genuine\" is not generally accepted by modern scholars. No dialects, no matter how remote or obscure, remained unchanged or undisturbed by a minimum of influences from surrounding dialects or the standard language, especially not from the late 19th century onwards with the advent of [[mass media]] and advanced forms of transport. The differences are today more accurately described by a scale that runs from \"standard language\" to \"rural dialect\" where the speech even of the same person may vary from one extreme to the other depending on the situation. All Swedish dialects with the exception of the highly diverging forms of speech in [[Dalarna]], [[Norrbotten]] and, to some extent, [[Gotland]] can be considered to be part of a common, mutually intelligible [[dialect continuum]]. This continuum may also include [[Norwegian dialects|Norwegian]] and some [[Danish dialects]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahl|2000|pp=117\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nThe samples linked below have been taken from SweDia, a research project on Swedish modern dialects available for download (though with information in Swedish only), with many more samples from 100 different dialects with recordings from four different speakers: older female, older male, younger female and younger male.

It is largely [[mutually intelligible]] with [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], although the degree of mutual intelligibility is largely dependent on the [[dialect]] and accent of the speaker. Written Norwegian and Danish are usually more easily understood by Swedish speakers than the spoken languages, due to the differences in [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], accent and intonation. Swedish is a descendant of [[Old Norse]], the common language of the [[Germanic peoples]] living in Scandinavia during the [[Viking Era]]. It has the most speakers of the North Germanic languages.\n\n[[Standard Swedish]], spoken by most [[Swedes]], is the [[national language]] that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century. While distinct regional [[Variety (linguistics)|varieties]] descending from the older rural dialects still exist, the spoken and written language is uniform and [[Standard language|standardized]].\n\nThe standard word order is, as in most [[Germanic languages]], [[V2 word order|V2]], which means that the [[finite verb]] (V) appears in the second position (2) of a declarative [[main clause]]. [[Swedish morphology]] is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few [[inflections]]. Swedish has two [[grammatical gender|genders]] and is generally seen to have two [[grammatical cases]] \u2013 [[nominative]] and [[genitive]] (except for pronouns that, as in English, also are inflected in the [[Object (grammar)|object]] form) \u2013 although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive ''s'', then seen as a [[clitic]]. Swedish has two [[Grammatical number|grammatical numbers]] \u2013 [[plural]] and [[Grammatical number|singular]]. [[Adjectives]] have discrete [[Comparison (grammar)|comparative and superlative]] forms and are also inflected according to gender, number and [[definiteness]]. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through [[suffixes]] (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite [[article (grammar)|articles]]. The [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] features both [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large [[vowel]] inventory. Swedish is also notable for the [[voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative]], a highly variable consonant [[phoneme]].\n\nSwedish has also had historic use in [[Estonia]], although the current status of the [[Estonian Swedish]] speakers is almost extinct. Instead, it is used in the [[Swedish diaspora]], most notably in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], with more than 50,000 resident Swedes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sverige-norge.se/var-tionde-oslobo-ar-nu-svensk/|title=Var tionde Oslobo \u00e4r nu svensk|publisher=Sverige-Norge Personalf\u00f6rmedling|language=sv|accessdate=11 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nSwedish is an [[Indo-European language]] belonging to the [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] branch of the [[Germanic languages]]. In the established classification, it belongs to the [[East Scandinavian languages]], together with [[Danish language|Danish]], separating it from the [[West Scandinavian languages]], consisting of [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. However, more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups: ''Insular Scandinavian'' (Faroese and Icelandic), and ''Continental Scandinavian'' (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), based on mutual intelligibility due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian (particularly Danish) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and Icelandic.<ref name=\"crystal\"/>\n\nBy many general criteria of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages could very well be considered [[dialect]]s of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between [[Denmark]] and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the [[nationalist]] ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate [[Orthography|orthographies]], dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a [[dialect continuum]] of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of [[Bohusl\u00e4n]], [[Dalsland]], western [[V\u00e4rmland]], western [[Dalarna]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[J\u00e4mtland]], and [[Scania]], could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.<ref name=\"crystal\">{{Harvnb|Crystal|1999|loc=''Scandinavian''}}</ref>\n\nSwedish pronunciations also vary greatly from one region to another, a legacy of the vast geographic distances and historical isolation. Even so, the vocabulary is standardized to a level that make dialects within Sweden virtually fully mutually intelligible.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Swedish}}\n\n===Old Norse===\n{{Main|Old Norse}}\n{{Old Norse language map}}\nIn the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], evolved into Old Norse. This language underwent more changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects: ''Old West Norse'' (Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland) and ''Old East Norse'' (Denmark and Sweden). The dialects of Old East Norse spoken in Sweden are called ''[[Runic Swedish]]'', while the dialects of Denmark are referred to as ''Runic Danish''. The dialects are described as \"runic\" because the main body of text appears in the [[runic alphabet]]. Unlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the [[Elder Futhark]] alphabet, Old Norse was written with the [[Younger Futhark]] alphabet, which had only 16 letters. Because the number of runes was limited, some runes were used for a range of [[phoneme]]s, such as the rune for the vowel ''u'', which was also used for the vowels ''o'', ''\u00f8'' and ''y'', and the rune for ''i'', also used for ''e''.<ref name=Edlund2010p26-31>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|pp=26\u201331}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1200 onwards, the dialects in Denmark began to diverge from those of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark which created a series of minor dialectal boundaries, or [[isogloss]]es, ranging from [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] in the south to [[Norrland]], [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|\u00d6sterbotten]] and northwestern [[Finland]] in the north.<ref name=Edlund2010p26-31/>\n\nAn early change that separated Runic Danish from the other dialects of Old East Norse was the change of the [[diphthong]] ''\u00e6i'' to the [[monophthong]] ''\u00e9'', as in ''st\u00e6inn'' to ''st\u00e9nn'' \"stone\". This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read ''stain'' and the later ''stin''. There was also a change of ''au'' as in ''dau\u00f0r'' into a long open ''\u00f8'' as in ''d\u00f8\u00f0r'' \"dead\". This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from ''tau\u00fer'' into ''tu\u00fer''. Moreover, the ''\u00f8y'' diphthong changed into a long, [[close vowel|close]] ''\u00f8'', as in the Old Norse word for \"island\". By the end of the period, these innovations had affected most of the Runic Swedish-speaking area as well, with the exception of the dialects spoken north and east of [[M\u00e4lardalen]] where the diphthongs still exist in remote areas.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bergman|1984|pp=21\u201323}}</ref>\n\n===Old Swedish===\n[[File:V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen blad 21.jpg|thumb|right|The initial page of the first complete copy of ''[[V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen]]'', the [[code of law|law code]] of [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], from {{circa|1280}}. It is one of the earliest texts in Swedish written in the [[Latin script]].]]\n{{Main|Old Swedish}}\nOld Swedish (Swedish: ''fornsvenska'') is the term used for the [[medieval]] Swedish language. The start date is usually set to 1225 since this is the year that ''[[V\u00e4stg\u00f6talagen]]'' (\"the V\u00e4stg\u00f6ta Law\") is believed to have been compiled for the first time.<ref>The oldest dated fragments are from 1250 and the oldest complete manuscript is from c. 1280</ref> It is among the most important documents of the period written in [[Latin script]] and the oldest Swedish [[code of law|law codes]]. Old Swedish is divided into ''\u00e4ldre fornsvenska'' (1225\u20131375) and ''yngre fornsvenska'' (1375\u20131526), \"older\" and \"younger\" Old Swedish.<ref>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|pp=28\u201329}}</ref> Important outside influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Christian church]] and various [[Monasticism|monastic]] orders, introducing many [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] loanwords. With the rise of [[Hanseatic league|Hanseatic]] power in the late 13th and early 14th century, [[Middle Low German]] became very influential. The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of [[Low German]]-speaking immigrants. Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society, and brought terms from their native languages into the vocabulary. Besides a great number of loanwords for such areas as warfare, trade and administration, general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions were imported. The League also brought a certain measure of influence from [[Danish language|Danish]] (at the time much more similar than today's language).<ref name=Edlund2010p29,31>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|pp=29, 31}}</ref>\n\nEarly Old Swedish was markedly different from the modern language in that it had a more complex [[case (linguistics)|case]] structure and also retained the original Germanic three-[[gender (grammar)|gender]] system. [[Noun]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[pronoun]]s and certain [[Grammatical number|numerals]] were inflected in four cases; besides the extant [[Nominative case|nominative]], there were also the [[Genitive case|genitive]] (later [[possessive case|possessive]]), [[Dative case|dative]] and [[Accusative case|accusative]]. The gender system resembled that of modern [[German language|German]], having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a ''common gender'' with the [[Definiteness|definite suffix]] ''-en'' and the [[definite article]] ''den'', in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents ''-et'' and ''det''. The verb system was also more complex: it included [[subjunctive]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]] [[mood (grammar)|moods]] and verbs were conjugated according to [[person (grammar)|person]] as well as [[number (grammar)|number]]. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|pp=150\u2013157}}</ref>\n\nA transitional change of the Latin script in the Nordic countries was to spell the letter combination \"ae\" as \u00e6 \u2013 and sometimes as a' \u2013 though it varied between persons and regions. The combination \"ao\" was similarly rendered a<sup>o</sup>, and \"oe\" became o<sup>e</sup>. These three were later to evolve into the separate letters [[\u00e4]], [[\u00e5]] and [[\u00f6]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=139}}</ref> The first time the new letters were used in print was in ''Aff dy\u00e4ffwlsens fr\u00e4stilse'' (\"By the Devil's temptation\") published by [[Johan Gerson]] in 1495.<ref>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|p=29}}</ref>\n\n===Modern Swedish===\n{{Main|Modern Swedish}}\n[[File:Gustav Vasa Bible 1541.jpg|thumb|upright|Front page of [[Gustav Vasa]]'s Bible from 1541, using [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]]. The title translated to English reads: \"The Bible / That is / The Holy Scripture / in Swedish.

After assuming power, the new monarch [[Gustav Vasa]] ordered a Swedish translation of the [[Bible]]. The [[New Testament]] was published in 1526, followed by a full [[Bible translation]] in 1541, usually referred to as the ''[[Gustav Vasa Bible]]'', a translation deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were [[Laurentius Andre\u00e6]] and the brothers [[Laurentius Petri|Laurentius]] and [[Olaus Petri]].<ref>Lars-Erik Edlund, \"Spr\u00e5khistorisk \u00f6versikt\" in {{harvnb|Dahl|Edlund|2010|p=33}}</ref>\n\nThe Vasa Bible is often considered to be a reasonable compromise between old and new; while not adhering to the colloquial spoken language of its day, it was not overly conservative in its use of archaic forms.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=151}}</ref> It was a major step towards a more consistent [[Swedish orthography]]. It established the use of the vowels \"\u00e5\", \"\u00e4\", and \"\u00f6\", and the spelling \"ck\" in place of \"kk\", distinguishing it clearly from the Danish Bible, perhaps intentionally, given the ongoing rivalry between the countries. All three translators came from central Sweden which is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Nordic Languages |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z17C7s3r_nwC&pg=PA1900 |year=2005 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019706-8 |page=1900}}</ref>\n\nThough it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during the remainder of the century.

It saw a democratization of the language with a less formal written form that approached the spoken one. The growth of a public school system also led to the evolution of so-called ''boksvenska'' (literally, \"book Swedish\"), especially among the working classes, where spelling to some extent influenced pronunciation, particularly in official contexts. With the industrialization and urbanization of Sweden well under way by the last decades of the 19th century, a new breed of authors made their mark on [[Swedish literature]]. Many scholars, politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the emerging national language, among them prolific authors like the poet [[Gustaf Fr\u00f6ding]], Nobel laureate [[Selma Lagerl\u00f6f]], and radical writer and playwright [[August Strindberg]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Josephson|2005|loc=chapter 2}}</ref>\n\nIt was during the 20th century that a common, standardized national language became available to all Swedes.

Previously, the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. The use of  ''herr'' (\"Mr\" or \"Sir\"), ''fru'' (\"Mrs\" or \"Ma'am\") or ''fr\u00f6ken'' (\"Miss\") was considered the only acceptable way to begin conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society. In the early 20th century, an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with ''ni''\u2014the standard [[Grammatical person|second person plural]] pronoun)\u2014analogous to the [[French language|French]] ''vous''. (Cf. [[T-V distinction]].) ''Ni'' wound up being used as a slightly less familiar form of ''du'', the singular second person pronoun, used to address people of lower social status. With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 1960s, these class distinctions  became less important, and ''du'' became the standard, even in formal and official contexts. Though the reform was not an act of any centralized political decree, but rather the result of sweeping change in social attitudes, it was completed in just a few years, from the late 1960s to early 1970s.<ref>Nationalencyklopedin, ''du-tilltal'' and ''ni-tilltal''</ref> The use of ''ni'' as a polite form of address is sometimes encountered today in both the written and spoken language, particularly among older speakers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=Philip|last2=Hinchliffe|first2=Ian|title=Swedish: An Essential Grammar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGasMbSR-8gC&pg=PA86|year=2008|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-45800-9|page=86}}</ref>\n\n==Geographic distribution==\nSwedish is the sole official national language of [[Sweden]], and one of two in [[Finland]] (alongside [[Finnish language|Finnish]]).

Indefinite form\n| ''fisk''\n| ''fiskar''\n|-\n! Definite form\n| ''fisken''\n| ''fiskarna''\n|}\n\nThe definite singular form of a noun is created by adding a suffix (''-en'', ''-n'', ''-et'' or ''-t''), depending on its gender and if the noun ends in a vowel or not. The definite articles ''den'', ''det'', and ''de'' are used for variations to the definitiveness of a noun. They can double as [[demonstrative]] [[pronoun]]s or [[Determiner (class)|demonstrative determiners]] when used with [[adverb]]s such as ''h\u00e4r'' (\"here\") or ''d\u00e4r'' (\"there\") to form ''den/det h\u00e4r (can also be \"denna/detta\")'' (\"this\"), ''de h\u00e4r (can also be \"dessa\")'' (\"these\"), ''den/det d\u00e4r'' (\"that\"), and ''de d\u00e4r'' (\"those\"). For example, ''den d\u00e4r fisken'' means \"that fish\" and refers to a specific fish; ''den fisken'' is less definite and means \"that fish\" in a more abstract sense, such as that set of fish; while ''fisken'' means \"the fish\". In certain cases, the definite form indicates possession, e. g., ''jag m\u00e5ste tv\u00e4tta h\u00e5r'''et''''' (\"I must wash ''my'' hair\").<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\n[[Adjective]]s are inflected in two declensions \u2013 indefinite and definite \u2013 and they must match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created by adding a suffix (''-t'' or ''-a'') to the common form of the adjective, e. g., ''en gr\u00f6n stol'' (a green chair), ''ett gr\u00f6nt hus'' (a green house), and ''gr\u00f6na stolar'' (\"green chairs\"). The definite form of an adjective is identical to the indefinite plural form, e. g., ''den gr\u00f6na stolen'' (\"the green chair\"), ''det gr\u00f6na huset'' (\"the green house\"), and ''de gr\u00f6na stolarna'' (\"the green chairs\").<ref name=\"Haugen\">{{Harvnb|Haugen|2009}}</ref>\n\nSwedish [[pronoun]]s are similar to those of English. Besides the two natural genders ''han'' and ''hon'' (\"he\" and \"she\"), there are also the two [[grammatical gender]]s ''den'' and ''det'', usually termed [[Gender in Danish and Swedish|common and neuter]]. Unlike the nouns, pronouns have an additional [[object (linguistics)|object]] form, derived from the old [[dative]] form. ''Hon'', for example, has the following nominative, possessive, and object forms:<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\n:''hon'' \u2013 ''hennes'' \u2013 ''henne''\n\nSwedish also uses third-person possessive [[reflexive pronoun]]s that refer to the subject in a clause, a trait which is restricted to North Germanic languages:\n\n:''Anna gav Maria sin bok.''; \"Anna gave Maria her [Anna's] book.\" (reflexive)\n:''Anna gav Maria hennes bok.''; \"Anna gave Maria her [Maria's] book.\" (not reflexive)\n\nSwedish used to have [[genitive]] that was placed at the end of the head of a noun phrase. In modern Swedish, it has become an [[enclitic]] ''-s'', which attaches to the end of the noun phrase, rather than the noun itself.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hultman|2003|pp=70, 212\u2013213}}</ref>\n\n:''h\u00e4sten''; \"the horse\" \u2013 ''h\u00e4stens'' \"the horse's\"\n:''h\u00e4sten p\u00e5 den blommande \u00e4ngens svarta man''; \"the horse in the flowering meadow's black mane\"\n\nIn formal written language, it used to be considered correct to place the genitive ''-s'' after the head of the noun phrase (''h\u00e4sten''), though this is today considered dated, and different grammatical constructions are often used.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hultman|2003|p=213}}</ref>\n\nVerbs are [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] according to [[grammatical tense|tense]]. One group of verbs (the ones ending in ''-er'' in present tense) has a special [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form (generally the verb [[word stem|stem]]), but with most verbs the imperative is identical to the [[infinitive]] form. [[perfect (grammar)|Perfect]] and [[present tense|present]] [[participle]]s as adjectival verbs are very common:<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\n:Perfect participle: ''en stekt fisk''; \"a fried fish\" (steka = to fry)\n:Present participle: ''en stinkande fisk''; \"a stinking fish\" (stinka = to stink)\n\nIn contrast to English and many other languages, Swedish does not use the perfect participle to form the present perfect and past perfect. Rather, the [[auxiliary verb]] ''har'' (\"have\"), ''hade'' (\"had\") is followed by a special form, called [[supine]], used solely for this purpose (although often identical to the neuter form of the perfect participle):<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\n:Perfect participle: ''m\u00e5lad'', \"painted\" \u2013 supine ''m\u00e5lat'', present perfect ''har m\u00e5lat''; \"have painted\"\n:Perfect participle: ''stekt'', \"fried\" \u2013 supine ''stekt'', present perfect ''har stekt''; \"have fried\"\n:Perfect participle: ''skriven'', \"written\" \u2013 supine ''skrivit'', present perfect ''har skrivit''; \"have written\"\n\nWhen building the compound passive voice using the verb ''att bli'', the past participle is used:\n\n:''den blir m\u00e5lad''; \"it's being painted\"\n:''den blev m\u00e5lad''; \"it was painted\"\n\nThere exists also an inflected passive voice formed by adding ''-s'', replacing the final ''r'' in the present tense:\n\n:''den m\u00e5las''; \"it's being painted\"\n:''den m\u00e5lades''; \"it was painted\"\n\nIn a subordinate [[clause]], the auxiliary ''har'' is optional and often omitted, particularly in written Swedish.\n\n:''Jag ser att han (har) stekt fisken''; \"I see that he has fried the fish\"\n\n[[Subjunctive mood]] is occasionally used for some verbs, but its use is in sharp decline and few speakers perceive the handful of commonly used verbs (as for instance: ''vore, m\u00e5nne'') as separate conjugations, most of them remaining only as set of [[Idiom|idiomatic expressions]].<ref name=\"Haugen\"/>\n\nWhere other languages may use [[grammatical cases]], Swedish uses numerous [[preposition]]s, similar to those found in [[English language|English]]. As in modern [[German language|German]], prepositions formerly determined case in Swedish, but this feature can only be found in certain idiomatic expressions like ''till fots'' (\"on foot\", genitive).<ref>{{Harvnb|Hultman|2003|pp=182\u2013183}}</ref>\n\nAs Swedish is a Germanic language, the [[syntax]] shows similarities to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] basic word order, but like German it utilizes [[V2 word order|verb-second word order]] in main clauses, for instance after [[adverbs]] and adverbial phrases, and [[dependent clauses]]. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually placed at the beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) [[Prepositional phrase]]s are placed in a [[place\u2013manner\u2013time]] order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bolander|2002}}</ref> Verb-second (inverted) word order is also used for questions.<ref name=\"Stensson 2013\">{{cite web|last1=Stensson|first1=Leif|title=Swedish Grammar {{!}} Syntax|url=https://www.lysator.liu.se/language/Languages/Swedish/Grammar.html#syntax|publisher=Lysator Society, Link\u00f6ping University|accessdate=9 March 2018|date=August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe [[vocabulary]] of Swedish is mainly Germanic, either through common Germanic heritage or through loans from German, Middle Low German, and to some extent, English. Examples of Germanic words in Swedish are ''mus'' (\"mouse\"), ''kung'' (\"king\"), and ''g\u00e5s'' (\"goose\"). A significant part of the religious and scientific vocabulary is of [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] origin, often borrowed from [[French language|French]] and, lately, English. Some 1\u2013200 words are also borrowed from [[Scandoromani language|Scandoromani]] or [[Romani language|Romani]], often as slang varieties; a commonly used word from Romani is ''[[:wikt:tjej|tjej]]'' (\"girl\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Wess\u00e9n|1998}}</ref>\n\nA large number of [[French language|French]] words were imported into Sweden around the 18th century. These words have been [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] to the Swedish spelling system and are therefore pronounced recognizably to a French-speaker. Most of them are distinguished by a \"French accent\", characterized by emphasis on the last syllable. For example, ''niv\u00e5'' (fr. ''niveau'', \"level\"), ''f\u00e5t\u00f6lj'' (fr. ''fauteuil'', \"armchair\") and ''aff\u00e4r'' (\"shop; affair\"), etc. Cross-borrowing from other Germanic languages has also been common, at first from Middle Low German, the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic league]] and later from [[Standard German]]. Some compounds are translations of the elements ([[calque]]s) of German original compounds into Swedish, like ''{{lang|sv|bomull}}'' from German ''{{lang|de|Baumwolle}}'' (\"cotton\"; literally, ''tree-wool'').<ref>Nationalencyklopedin, ''svenska: spr\u00e5khistoria''</ref>\n\nAs with many Germanic languages, new words can be formed by compounding, e. g., nouns like ''{{lang|sv|nagellackborttagningsmedel}}'' (\"nail polish remover\") or verbs like ''{{lang|sv|smyglyssna}}'' (\"to eavesdrop\").<ref name=CompoundNoun/><ref>{{cite web |title=Smyglyssna |url=http://ordbok.woxikon.se/sv-en/smyglyssna |website=Woxikon |accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Compound nouns take their [[grammatical gender|gender]] from the [[head (linguistics)|head]], which in Swedish is always the last morpheme.<ref name=CompoundNoun>{{cite web |title=Minor Grammar English-Swedish |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/194349317/Minor-Grammar-English-Swedish |publisher=Scribd |accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> New words can also be coined by [[Morphological derivation|derivation]] from other established words, such as the [[verbification]] of [[noun]]s by the adding of the [[suffix#Derivational suffixes|suffix]] ''-a'', as in ''{{lang|sv|bil}}'' (\"car\") and ''{{lang|sv|bila}}'' (\"travel (recreationally) by car\").<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Gomer |editor1-first=Eva |editor2-last=Morris-Nygren |editor2-first=Mona |title=Bila |work=Modern Svensk Engelsk Ordbok |date=1976 |publisher=Prisma |page=57}}</ref> The opposite, making nouns of verbs, is also possible, as in ''{{lang|sv|t\u00e4nk}}'' (\"way of thinking; concept\") from ''{{lang|sv|t\u00e4nka}}'' (\"to think\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Spr\u00e5ket lever {{!}} t\u00e4nk|url=https://www.sprakinstitutet.fi/sv/aktuellt/spraket_lever/tank.20235.news|publisher=Institutet f\u00f6r de inhemska spr\u00e5ken|accessdate=3 March 2018|language=Swedish|date=18 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Main|Swedish orthography}}\nThe [[Swedish alphabet]] is a 29-letter [[alphabet]], using the 26-letter [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] plus the three additional letters ''[[\u00c5|\u00c5''/''\u00e5]]'', ''[[\u00c4|\u00c4''/''\u00e4]]'', and ''[[\u00d6|\u00d6''/''\u00f6]]'' constructed in the 16th century by writing \"o\" and \"e\" on top of an \"a\", and an \"e\" on top of an \"o\". Though these combinations are historically modified versions of [[A]] and [[O]] according to the English range of usage for the term [[diacritic]], these three characters are not considered to be diacritics within the Swedish application, but rather separate letters, and are independent letters following ''z''. Before the release of the 13th edition of ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordlista]]'' in April 2006, ''w'' was treated as merely a variant of ''v'' used only in names (such as \"Wallenberg\") and foreign words (\"bowling\"), and so was both sorted and pronounced as a ''v''. Other [[diacritic]]s (to use the broader English term usage referenced here) are unusual in Swedish; [[\u00e9]] is sometimes used to indicate that the stress falls on a terminal syllable containing ''e'', especially when the stress changes the meaning (''ide'' vs. ''id\u00e9'', \"winter lair\" vs. \"idea\") as well as in some names, like ''Kastr\u00e9n''; occasionally other [[acute accent]]s and, less often, [[grave accent]]s can be seen in names and some foreign words. The letter [[\u00e0]] is used to refer to unit cost (a loan from the French), equivalent to the [[at sign]] (@) in English.<ref>{{Harvnb|Svenska spr\u00e5kn\u00e4mnden|2000}}</ref>\n\nThe German ''[[\u00fc]]'' is treated as a variant of ''[[y]]'' and sometimes retained in foreign names and words, e. g., ''m\u00fcsli'' (\"muesli/granola\"). A proper [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] may very exceptionally be seen in elaborated style (for instance: \"A\u00efda\"). The German convention of writing ''\u00e4'' and ''\u00f6'' as ''ae'' and ''oe'' if the characters are unavailable is an unusual convention for speakers of modern Swedish. Despite the availability of all these characters in the Swedish national [[top-level domain|top-level Internet domain]] and other such domains, Swedish sites are frequently labelled using ''a'' and ''o'', based on visual similarity, though Swedish domains could be registered using the characters \u00e5, \u00e4, and \u00f6 from 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Domain names with characters like \u00e5, \u00e4, \u00f6 (IDN)|url=https://www.iis.se/english/domains/se/idn/|publisher=iiS|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn Swedish [[orthography]], the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] is used in a [[Colon (punctuation)#Usage|similar manner as in English]], with some exceptions: the colon is used for some abbreviations, such as ''3:e'' for ''tredje'' (\"third\") and ''S:t'' for ''Sankt'' (\"Saint\"), and for all types of [[suffix|endings]] that can be added to numbers, letters and abbreviations, such as ''a:et'' (\"the a\") and ''CD:n'' (\"the CD\"), or the genitive form ''USA:s'' (\"USA's\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Svenska spr\u00e5kn\u00e4mnden|2000|pp=154\u2013156}}</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\n[[File:R-pronounciation in Swedish language.JPG|thumb|[[Isogloss]] for the pronunciation of \"R\" (c. 1960), being [[Alveolar trill|alveolar]] north of the boundary and [[guttural R|uvular]] (\"French R\") south of it.

Many of the genuine rural dialects, such as those of [[Orsa, Sweden|Orsa]] in [[Dalarna]] or [[N\u00e4rpes]] in [[Ostrobothnia (region)|\u00d6sterbotten]], have very distinct phonetic and grammatical features, such as plural forms of verbs or archaic [[case (linguistics)|case]] inflections. These dialects can be near-incomprehensible to a majority of Swedes, and most of their speakers are also fluent in Standard Swedish. The different dialects are often so localized that they are limited to individual [[parish]]es and are referred to by Swedish linguists as ''sockenm\u00e5l'' (lit., \"parish speech\"). They are generally separated into six major groups, with common characteristics of prosody, grammar and vocabulary. One or several examples from each group are given here. Though each example is intended to be also representative of the nearby dialects, the actual number of dialects is several hundred if each individual community is considered separately.<ref>{{Harvnb|Engstrand|2004|p=120}}; {{Harvnb|Pettersson|1996|p=184}}</ref>\n\nThis type of classification, however, is based on a somewhat romanticized [[nationalism|nationalist]] view of ethnicity and language. The idea that only rural variants of Swedish should be considered \"genuine\" is not generally accepted by modern scholars. No dialects, no matter how remote or obscure, remained unchanged or undisturbed by a minimum of influences from surrounding dialects or the standard language, especially not from the late 19th century onwards with the advent of [[mass media]] and advanced forms of transport. The differences are today more accurately described by a scale that runs from \"standard language\" to \"rural dialect\" where the speech even of the same person may vary from one extreme to the other depending on the situation. All Swedish dialects with the exception of the highly diverging forms of speech in [[Dalarna]], [[Norrbotten]] and, to some extent, [[Gotland]] can be considered to be part of a common, mutually intelligible [[dialect continuum]]. This continuum may also include [[Norwegian dialects|Norwegian]] and some [[Danish dialects]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Dahl|2000|pp=117\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nThe samples linked below have been taken from SweDia, a research project on Swedish modern dialects available for download (though with information in Swedish only), with many more samples from 100 different dialects with recordings from four different speakers: older female, older male, younger female and younger male.

These varieties could alternatively be classified as [[sociolect]]s, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers.

The [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Tennessee]] under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the river by capturing this stronghold and defeating [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[John C. Pemberton]]'s forces stationed there.\n\nThe campaign consisted of many important naval operations, troop maneuvers, failed initiatives, and eleven distinct battles from December 26, 1862, to July 4, 1863. Military historians divide the campaign into two formal phases: '''operations against Vicksburg''' (December&nbsp;1862&nbsp;\u2013 January&nbsp;1863) and '''Grant's operations against Vicksburg''' (March\u2013July 1863).\n\nGrant initially planned a two-pronged approach in which half of his army, under Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], would advance to the [[Yazoo River]] and attempt to reach Vicksburg from the northeast, while Grant took the remainder of the army down the Mississippi Central Railroad. Both of these initiatives failed. Grant conducted a number of \"experiments\" or expeditions\u2014Grant's bayou operations\u2014that attempted to enable waterborne access to the Mississippi south of Vicksburg's artillery batteries. All five of these initiatives failed as well. Finally, Union gunboats and troop transport boats ran the batteries at Vicksburg and met up with Grant's men who had marched overland in [[Louisiana]]. On April 29 and April 30, 1863, Grant's army crossed the Mississippi and landed at [[Bruinsburg, Mississippi]]. An elaborate series of demonstrations and diversions fooled the Confederates and the landings occurred without opposition. Over the next 17 days, Grant maneuvered his army inland and won five battles, captured the state capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and assaulted and laid siege to Vicksburg.\n\nAfter Pemberton's army surrendered on July 4 (one day after the Confederate defeat at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]), and when [[Siege of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]] surrendered to Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] on July 9, Texas and Arkansas were effectively cut off from the Confederacy, and the Mississippi River was once again open for northern commerce to reach the Gulf of Mexico, and as a supply line for the Union Army. Grant's Vicksburg campaign is studied as a masterpiece of military operations and a major [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the war.\n\n==Background==\n\n=== Military situation===\n{{Main article|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}{{further|American Civil War}}\n{| align=right\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Army commanders (Vicksburg campaign)\n|-\n|<gallery>\nImage:GenUSGrant.jpg|<center>Maj.

[[Jefferson Davis]] said, \"Vicksburg is the nail head that holds the South's two halves together.\"<ref>Winschel, p. 14.</ref> While in their hands, it blocked Union navigation down the Mississippi; together with control of the mouth of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and of [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]] to the south, it allowed communication with the states west of the river, upon which the Confederates depended extensively for horses, cattle and reinforcements. The natural defenses of the city were ideal, earning it the nickname \"The Gibraltar of the Confederacy\". It was located on a high bluff overlooking a horseshoe-shaped bend in the river, De Soto Peninsula, making it almost impossible to approach by ship. North and East of Vicksburg was the [[Mississippi Delta]] (sometimes known as the Yazoo Delta), an area 200 miles (320&nbsp;km) north to south and up to 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) across, which has been described by geographer Warren E. Grabau as an \"astonishingly complex network of intersecting waterways\", some of which were navigable by small steamboats. The regions between modern rivers and bayous formed closed basins called backswamps, of which Grabau judged, \"Whether permanently flooded or not, the backswamps were, for all practical purposes, untamed wildernesses, utterly impassable by a man on horseback or by any form of wheeled vehicle, and very difficult even for a man on foot.\"<ref>Grabau, p. 19.</ref> About twelve miles (19&nbsp;km) up the [[Yazoo River]] were Confederate batteries and entrenchments at Haynes Bluff. The [[Louisiana]] land west of Vicksburg was also difficult, with many streams and poor country roads, widespread winter flooding, and it was on the opposite side of the river from the fortress.\n\nThe city had been under Union naval attack before. Admiral [[David Farragut]] moved up the river after his [[capture of New Orleans]] and on May 18, 1862, demanded the surrender of Vicksburg. Farragut had insufficient troops to force the issue, and he moved back to New Orleans. He returned with a flotilla in June 1862, but their attempts (June 26\u201328) to bombard the fortress into surrender failed. They shelled Vicksburg throughout July and fought some minor battles with a few Confederate vessels in the area, but their forces were insufficient to attempt a landing, and they abandoned attempts to force the surrender of the city. Farragut investigated the possibility of bypassing the fortified cliffs by digging a canal across the neck of the river's bend, the De Soto Peninsula. On June 28, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Thomas Williams (general)|Thomas Williams]], attached to Farragut's command, began digging work on the canal by employing local laborers and some soldiers. Many of the men fell victim to tropical diseases and heat exhaustion, and the work was abandoned by July 24. (Williams was killed two weeks later in the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1862)|Battle of Baton Rouge]]).<ref>Ballard, pp. 46\u201362; Bearss, vol. I, p. 437; [https://www.nps.gov/vick/learn/historyculture/grants-canal.htm VNMP article] on Grant's Canal.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1862, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]] was promoted from command of the Western Theater to General-in-Chief of all Union armies. On November 23, he indicated to Grant his preference for a major move down the Mississippi to Vicksburg; in Halleck's style, he left considerable initiative to design a campaign, an opportunity that the pugnacious Grant seized. Halleck has received criticism for not moving promptly overland from [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to seize Vicksburg during the summer when he was in command on the scene. He believed that the Navy could capture the fortress on its own, not knowing that the naval force was insufficiently manned with ground troops to finish the job. What might have achieved success in the summer of 1862 was no longer possible by November because the Confederates had amply reinforced the garrison by that time.  Also reliable navigation on the river was seasonal, and the natural fall in the level of the river during the fall and winter months limited the utility of shipping, the usable draft of riverboats, and the quantity of men, supplies, and equipment, they could transport.\n\nGrant's army marched south down the [[Mississippi Central Railroad]], making a forward base at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]]. He planned a two-pronged assault in the direction of Vicksburg. His principal subordinate, Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], was to advance down the river with four divisions (about 32,000 men) and Grant would continue with the remaining forces (about 40,000) down the railroad line to [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], where he would wait for developments, hoping to lure the Confederate army out of the city to attack him in the vicinity of [[Grenada, Mississippi]].\n\nOn the Confederate side, forces in Mississippi were under the command of Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]], an officer from [[Pennsylvania]] who chose to fight for the [[Southern United States|South]]. Pemberton had approximately 12,000 men in Vicksburg and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]] had approximately 24,000 at Grenada.\n\nMeanwhile, political forces were at work. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] had long recognized the importance of Vicksburg; he wrote \"Vicksburg is the key. ...The war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 24.</ref> Lincoln also envisioned a two-pronged offensive, but one up and down the river. Maj. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] politician, had convinced Lincoln that he could lead an army down the river and take Vicksburg. Lincoln approved his proposal and wanted Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to advance up river from New Orleans at the same time. McClernand began organizing regiments, sending them to Memphis. Back in [[Washington, D.C.]], Halleck was nervous about McClernand and gave Grant control of all troops in his own department. McClernand's troops were split into two corps, one under McClernand, the other under Sherman. McClernand complained but to no avail. Grant appropriated his troops, one of several maneuvers in a private dispute within the Union Army between Grant and McClernand that continued throughout the campaign.\n\n==Battles in the operations against Vicksburg, December 1862&nbsp;\u2013 January 1863==\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignDecember62March63.png|thumb|300px|Operations against Vicksburg and Grant's bayou operations {{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}} {{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nThe \"operations against Vicksburg\" phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:\n\n===Chickasaw Bayou (December 26\u201329, 1862)===\n{{main article|Battle of Chickasaw Bayou}}\nSherman disembarked with three divisions at Johnson's Plantation on the Yazoo River to approach the Vicksburg defenses from the northeast. On December 27, the Federals pushed their lines forward through the swamps toward the Walnut Hills, which were strongly defended. On December 28, several futile attempts were made to get around these defenses. On December 29, Sherman ordered a frontal assault, which was repulsed with heavy casualties, and then withdrew.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ms003.htm NPS Chickasaw Bayou.]</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the overland half of Grant's offensive was failing. His lines of communication were disrupted by raids by Van Dorn and [[Brigadier General#United States|Brig. Gen.]] [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], who destroyed his large supply depot at Holly Springs. Unable to subsist his army without these supplies, Grant abandoned his overland advance.\n\nIn early January, McClernand arrived at Memphis with the corps he had recruited (the [[XIII Corps (Union Army)|XIII Corps]] under Brig. Gen. [[George W. Morgan]]) and commenced his operation down the Mississippi. On January 4, he ordered Sherman to attach his [[XV Corps (Union Army)|XV Corps]] to the expedition, calling his combined 32,000-man force the [[Army of the Mississippi]]. This was a direct provocation against Grant, but Sherman acceded to the senior officer. Sherman suggested beginning with a combined land and naval movement against Fort Hindman, on the [[Arkansas River]] at [[Arkansas Post]], 50 miles up the Arkansas from its confluence with the Mississippi, a base from which Confederate gunboats were attacking Union shipping on the river. The expedition started without notifying Grant.<ref>Ballard, pp. 147\u201349.</ref>\n\n===Arkansas Post (January 9\u201311, 1863)===\n{{main article|Battle of Arkansas Post}}\nUnion boats under [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Adm.]] [[David Dixon Porter]] began landing troops near Arkansas Post in the evening of January 9. The troops started up river towards Fort Hindman. Sherman's corps overran Confederate trenches, and the defenders retreated to the protection of the fort and adjacent rifle-pits. Porter, on January 10, moved his fleet towards Fort Hindman and bombarded it, withdrawing at dusk. Union artillery fired on the fort from positions across the river on January 11, and the infantry moved into position for an attack. Union ironclads commenced shelling the fort and Porter's fleet passed it to cut off any retreat. As a result of this envelopment, and the attack by Morgan's troops, the Confederate command surrendered in the afternoon. Although Union losses were high and the victory did not contribute to the capture of Vicksburg, it did eliminate one more impediment to Union shipping on the Mississippi.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ar006.htm NPS Arkansas Post.]</ref>\n\nGrant was not happy to learn that McClernand had conducted the operation without his approval, considering it a distraction from his main objective of Vicksburg, but since it had been successful and his ally Sherman had suggested it, he took no punitive action. However, he ordered McClernand back to the Mississippi and assumed personal command of the campaign on January 13 at Milliken's Bend, 15 miles northwest of Vicksburg.\n\n==Grant's bayou operations, January\u2013March 1863==\nThat winter, Grant conducted a series of initiatives to approach and capture Vicksburg,<ref>''Organization of the Army of the Tennessee, Major General Ulysses S. Grant, U. S. Army, commanding, January 31, 1863'': Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIV, Part 3, [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moawar&cc=moawar&idno=waro0038&node=waro0038%3A1&view=image&seq=23&size=100 page 23.]</ref> termed \"Grant's bayou operations\". Their general theme was to use or construct alternative waterways so that troops could be positioned within striking distance of Vicksburg, without requiring a direct approach on the Mississippi under the Confederate guns.\n\n===Grant's Canal===\nThe Williams Canal across De Soto Peninsula had been abandoned by Adm. Farragut and Brig. Gen. Williams in July 1862, but it had the potential to offer a route downriver that bypassed Vicksburg's guns. In late January 1863, Sherman's men, at the urging of Grant\u2014who was advised by the navy that President Lincoln liked the idea\u2014resumed digging. Sherman derisively called the work \"Butler's Ditch\" (since it was Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] who had sent Williams upriver to do the work), which was barely 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep. Grant, undoubtedly influenced by Lincoln's continuous inquiries as to the status of the canal, ordered Sherman to expand the canal to 60 feet wide and 7 feet deep and the effort became known as Grant's Canal. It was not properly engineered based upon the hydrology of the Mississippi River, however, and a sudden rise in the river broke through the dam at the head of the canal and flooded the area. The canal began to fill up with back water and sediment. In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, ''Hercules'' and ''Sampson'', attempted to clear the channel, but the dredges were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and driven away. By late March, work on the canal was abandoned. (Remnants of about 200 yards of Grant's Canal are maintained by the Vicksburg National Military Park in Louisiana).<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 436\u201350; [http://www.nps.gov/archive/vick/grntcanl/grantsc.htm VNMP article] on Grant's Canal.</ref>\n\n===Lake Providence expedition===\nGrant ordered Brig. Gen. [[James B. McPherson]] to construct a canal of several hundred yards from the Mississippi to [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]], northwest of the city. This would allow passage to the Red River, through Bayous Baxter and Macon, and the Tensas and Black Rivers. Reaching the Red River, Grant's force could join with Banks at Port Hudson. McPherson reported that the connection was navigable on March 18, but the few \"ordinary Ohio River boats\" that had been sent to Grant for navigation of the bayous could only transport 8,500 men, far too few to tip the balance at Port Hudson. Although this was the only one of the bayou expeditions to successfully bypass the Vicksburg defenses, historian [[Ed Bearss]] calls this episode the \"Lake Providence Boondoggle\".<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 467\u201378; Ballard, pp. 173\u201374.</ref>\n\n==pass expedition===\n{{main article|Yazoo Pass expedition}}\nThe next attempt was to get to the high ground of the [[loess]] bluffs above Hayne's Bluff and below Yazoo City by blowing up the Mississippi River levee near [[Moon Lake (Mississippi)|Moon Lake]], some 150 miles (240&nbsp;km) above Vicksburg, near [[Helena, Arkansas]], and following the Yazoo Pass (an old route from Yazoo City to Memphis, which was curtailed by the 1856 levee construction that sealed off the Pass from the Mississippi River to Moon Lake) into the Coldwater River, then to the [[Tallahatchie River]], and finally into the Yazoo River at [[Greenwood, Mississippi]]. The dikes were blown up on February 3, beginning what was called the Yazoo Pass Expedition. Ten Union boats, under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Watson Smith, with army troops under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Benjamin Prentiss]], began moving through the pass on February 7. But low-hanging trees destroyed anything on the gunboats above deck and Confederates felled more trees to block the way. These delays allowed the Confederates time to quickly construct a \"Fort Pemberton\" near the confluence of the Tallahatchie and [[Yalobusha River]]s near [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], which repulsed the naval force on March 11, March 14, and March 16. The Union effort collapsed in early April.<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 479\u2013548; Ballard, pp. 174\u201384; Eicher, pp. 439\u201340.</ref>\n\n===Steele's Bayou expedition===\n{{main article|Steele's Bayou expedition}}\nAdmiral Porter started an effort on March 14 to go up the Yazoo Delta via Steele's Bayou, just north of Vicksburg, to [[Deer Creek (Mississippi)|Deer Creek]]. This would [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] Fort Pemberton and allow landing troops between Vicksburg and [[Yazoo City, Mississippi|Yazoo City]]. Confederates once again felled trees in their path, and willow reeds fouled the boats' paddlewheels. This time the Union boats became immobilized, and Confederate cavalry and infantry threatened to capture them. Sherman sent infantry assistance to repel the Confederates bedeviling Porter, but Porter's approach was abandoned as too difficult.<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 549\u201390; Ballard, pp. 184\u201388.</ref>\n\n===Duckport Canal===\nGrant's final attempt was to dig another canal from Duckport Landing to Walnut Bayou, aimed at getting lighter boats past Vicksburg. By the time the canal was almost finished, on April 6, water levels were declining, and none but the lightest of flatboats could get through. Grant abandoned this canal and started planning anew.<ref>Ballard, p. 193.</ref>\n\nFrom December through March, including Chickasaw Bayou and the Mississippi Central advance, seven initiatives, or \"experiments\", by Grant had failed. Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had undertaken these experiments primarily to keep his troops busy during the flooded and disease-laden winter months and that he had had no expectation of success. This claim is contradicted by correspondence from Grant at the time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Plan for the 1863 campaign and initial movements==\n[[File:View of Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|View of Vicksburg vicinity and fortifications, 1863]]\nAll of the bayou operations were failures, but Grant was known for his stubborn determination and would not quit. His final option was bold but risky: March the army down the west side of the Mississippi, cross the river south of Vicksburg, and either attack Vicksburg from the south and the east or join forces with Banks, capture Port Hudson, and then together reduce Vicksburg. Porter would have to sneak past the guns to get sufficient gunboats and transport ships south of the city. Once they had completed the downstream passage, they would not be able to return past Vicksburg's guns because the river current would slow them too much.\n\nOn March 29, McClernand set his troops to work building bridges and [[corduroy road]]s. They filled in the swamps in their way as well, and by April 17 they had a rough, tortuous 70-mile (110&nbsp;km) road from Milliken's Bend to the proposed river crossing at [[Hard Times, Louisiana]], below Vicksburg.\n\n[[File:Porter's flotilla below Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|left|Porter's flotilla arrives; General Sherman is going in a yawl to the flagship, {{USS|Benton|1861}}.]]\nOn April 16, a clear night with no moon, Porter sent seven gunboats and three empty troop transports loaded with stores to run the bluff, taking care to minimize noise and lights. But the preparations were ineffective. Confederate sentries sighted the boats, and the bluff exploded with massive artillery fire. Fires were set along the banks to improve visibility. The Union gunboats answered back. Porter observed that the Confederates mainly hit the high parts of his boats, reasoned that they could not depress their guns, and had them hug the east shore, right under Confederate cannon, so close he could hear their commanders giving orders, shells flying overhead. The fleet survived with little damage; thirteen men were wounded and none killed. The ''Henry Clay'' was disabled and burned at the water's edge. On April 22, six more boats loaded with supplies made the run; one boat did not make it, though no one was killed.  The crew floated downstream on the boat's remnants.\n\nThe final piece of Grant's strategy was to divert Pemberton's attention from the river crossing site that the Union troops would use. Grant chose two operations: a feint by Sherman against [[Snyder's Bluff, Mississippi]], north of Vicksburg (see the [[Battle of Snyder's Bluff]] below), and a daring cavalry raid through central Mississippi by [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Benjamin Grierson]], known as [[Grierson's Raid]]. The former was inconclusive, but the latter was a success. Grierson was able to draw out significant Confederate forces to chase him, and Pemberton's defenses were dispersed too far around the state. (Pemberton was also wary of Nathaniel Banks's impending advance up the river from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] to threaten Port Hudson.){{citation needed|reason=whole section lacks sources|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Union===\n{{further|Champion Hill Union order of battle|Vicksburg Union order of battle|l2=Siege of Vicksburg Union order of battle}}\n\nMaj.

Sherman]]; the [[XVII Corps (Union Army)|XVII Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[James B. McPherson]]; a three-division detachment of the [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[Cadwallader C. Washburn]]; and a detachment from the District of Northeast Louisiana, under Brig. Gen. [[Elias S. Dennis]]. The [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[John G.

Walker]].\n\n==Battles in Grant's operations against Vicksburg, April&nbsp;\u2013 July 1863==\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignAprilJuly63.png|thumb|350px|Grant's operations against Vicksburg]]\nThe \"Grant's operations against Vicksburg\" phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:\n\n===Grand Gulf (April 29, 1863)===\n{{main article|Battle of Grand Gulf}}\nAdmiral Porter led seven ironclads in an attack on the fortifications and batteries at [[Grand Gulf, Mississippi]], with the intention of silencing the Confederate guns and then securing the area with troops of McClernand's XIII Corps who were on the accompanying transports and barges. The attack by the seven ironclads began at 8 a.m. and continued until about 1:30&nbsp;p.m. During the fight, the ironclads moved within 100 yards of the Confederate guns and silenced the lower batteries of Fort Wade. The Confederate upper batteries at Fort Cobun remained out of reach and continued to fire. The Union ironclads (one of which, the [[USS Tuscumbia (1862)|''Tuscumbia'']], had been put out of action) and the transports drew off. After dark, however, the ironclads engaged the Confederate guns again while the steamboats and barges ran the gauntlet. Grant marched his men overland across Coffee Point to below the Gulf. After the transports had passed Grand Gulf, they embarked the troops at [[Disharoon's plantation]] and disembarked them on the Mississippi shore at Bruinsburg, below Grand Gulf. Grant landed 17,000 soldiers there, the largest amphibious operation in American military history until the [[Invasion of Normandy]]. The men immediately began marching overland towards [[Port Gibson, Mississippi]]. The Confederates had won a hollow victory, since the loss at Grand Gulf caused just a slight change in Grant's offensive.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bruinsburg Crossing (April 30 \u2013 May 1) | publisher = National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/vick/historyculture/bruincross.htm | accessdate = 7 September 2018}}; [http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ms004.htm NPS Grand Gulf.]</ref>\n\n===Snyder's Bluff (April 29&nbsp;\u2013 May 1)===\n{{main article|Battle of Snyder's Bluff}}\nTo ensure that troops would not be withdrawn to Grand Gulf to assist Confederates there, a combined Union army-navy force feigned an attack on Snyder's Bluff. After noon on April 29, Lt. Cdr. [[Kidder Breese|K. Randolph Breese]], with his eight gunboats and ten transports carrying Maj. Gen. [[Francis Preston Blair, Jr.|Francis P. Blair]]'s division, inched up the Yazoo River to the mouth of Chickasaw Bayou where they spent the night. At 9 a.m., the next morning, the force, minus one gunboat, continued upriver to Drumgould's Bluff and engaged the enemy batteries. During the fighting, [[USS Choctaw (1856)|''Choctaw'']] suffered more than fifty hits, but no casualties occurred. Around 6 p.m., the troops disembarked and marched along Blake's Levee toward the guns. As they neared Drumgould's Bluff, a battery opened on them, creating havoc and casualties. The Union advance halted and, after dark, the men reembarked on the transports. The next morning, transports disembarked other troops. The swampy terrain and enemy heavy artillery fire forced them to retire. The gunboats opened fire again, about 3 p.m. on May 1, causing some damage. Later, the boats' fire slackened and stopped altogether after dark. Sherman had received orders to land his troops at Milliken's Bend, so the gunboats returned to their anchorages at the mouth of the Yazoo.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms005.htm NPS Snyder's Bluff.]</ref>\n\n===Port Gibson (May 1)===\n{{main article|Battle of Port Gibson}}\nGrant's army began marching inland from Bruinsburg. Advancing on the Rodney Road towards Port Gibson, they ran into Confederate outposts after midnight and skirmished with them for around three hours. After 3 a.m., the fighting stopped. Union forces advanced on the Rodney Road and a plantation road at dawn. At 5:30&nbsp;a.m., the Confederates engaged the Union advance and the battle ensued. Federals forced the Confederates to fall back. The Confederates established new defensive positions at different times during the day but they could not stop the Union onslaught and left the field in the early evening. This defeat demonstrated that the Confederates were unable to defend the Mississippi River line, and the Federals had secured their beachhead.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms006.htm NPS Port Gibson.]</ref>\n\nAt this point, Grant faced a decision. His original orders were to capture Grand Gulf and then proceed south to link up with Banks and reduce Port Hudson, after which their combined armies would return and capture Vicksburg. Unfortunately for Grant, such a course would put him under the command of the more senior major general and the credit for any success in the theater would go to Banks. Since Banks was occupied with operations on the Red River and had informed Grant that he was not ready to begin operations against Port Hudson within the next few days, Grant decided to move on his own against Vicksburg. He sent a message to Halleck about his intentions, knowing that it would take as many as eight days for Washington to receive the message and respond.\n\nAfter the Union army seized the crossing at Grindstone Ford, any Confederate forces between the Big Bayou Pierre and the Big Black River were compromised. Realizing this, Bowen evacuated Grand Gulf and proceeded with all speed to Hankinson's Ford across the Big Black, barely escaping the Union trap. Grant's intention at this time was to move north over this same route and advance directly on Vicksburg. However, scouting parties that he sent out found that Pemberton had good defensive positions to the south of the city. Instead, he decided to break the city's supply line by seizing the railroad from Jackson to Vicksburg. He gave orders for his three corps (Sherman having arrived across the river) to advance over three separate routes to attack the railroad at [[Edwards, Mississippi|Edwards Station]] (the westernmost objective, with McClernand's corps), [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] (easternmost, with McPherson's) and Midway Station (center, with Sherman's).\n\n===Raymond (May 12)===\n{{main article|Battle of Raymond}}\nOn May 10, Pemberton ordered all reinforcements arriving at Jackson to march to [[Raymond, Mississippi|Raymond]], 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) to the southwest. Brig. Gen. [[John Gregg (CSA)|John Gregg]]'s overstrength brigade, having endured a grueling march from [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]], began marching to Raymond the next morning, arriving late in the afternoon of May 11. On May 12, Gregg's brigade moved to ambush a Union raiding party at Fourteen Mile Creek. The raiding party turned out to be Maj. Gen. [[John A. Logan]]'s Division of the XVII Corps. Gregg decided to dispute the crossing of Fourteen Mile Creek and arrayed his men and artillery accordingly. As Logan's men approached, the Confederates opened fire, initially causing heavy casualties. Some Union troops broke, but Logan rallied a force to hold the line. Confederate troops attacked the line but were forced to retire. Additional Union troops arrived and counterattacked. Heavy fighting ensued that continued for six hours, but the overwhelming Union force prevailed. Gregg's men left the field. Although they lost the battle, they had held up a much superior Union force for a day. General Gregg, under orders to withdraw to Jackson in the face of a superior force, withdrew five miles (8&nbsp;km) in the direction of Jackson to Mississippi Springs, Mississippi. This retrograde movement exposed the Southern Railroad of Mississippi to Union forces, thus severing the lifeline of Vicksburg.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms007.htm NPS Raymond.]</ref>\n\nDespite McPherson's victory, the presence of Confederate forces attacking Grant's right flank caused him to reconsider his plan. He learned that Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]] was due in Jackson with reinforcements within the next couple of days, and there was a rumor that Gen. [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] would also arrive on the scene. In this situation, the Union army would be between enemy forces on each flank. Therefore, he chose to deal with the threat from the east first and ordered Sherman and McPherson to seize Jackson.\n\n===Jackson (May 14)===\n{{main article|Battle of Jackson, Mississippi}}\nOn May 9, Gen. Johnston received a dispatch from the Confederate Secretary of War directing him to \"proceed at once to Mississippi and take chief command of the forces in the field\". When he arrived in Jackson on May 13 from [[Middle Tennessee]], he learned that two army corps\u2014Sherman's and McPherson's\u2014were advancing on Jackson and that Gregg had only about 6,000 troops available to defend the city. Johnston ordered the evacuation of Jackson, but Gregg was to defend Jackson until the evacuation was completed. By 10 a.m., both Union army corps were near Jackson and had engaged the enemy. Rain, Confederate resistance, and poor defenses prevented heavy fighting until around 11 a.m., when Union forces attacked in numbers and slowly but surely pushed the enemy back. In mid-afternoon, Johnston informed Gregg that the evacuation was complete and that he should disengage and follow. Soon after, the Union troops entered Jackson and had a celebration hosted by Grant, who had been traveling with Sherman's corps, in the Bowman House. They then burned part of the town, destroyed numerous factories, and cut the railroad connections with Vicksburg. Johnston's evacuation is seen as a mistake because he could, by late on May 14, have had 11,000 troops at his disposal and by the morning of May 15, another 4,000. The fall of the Mississippi state capital was a blow to Confederate morale.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/Battles/ms008.htm NPS Jackson.]</ref>  Having broken the rail links, Grant temporarily abandoned the city to allow his troops to concentrate on Vicksburg.\n\nJohnston retreated with most of his army up the Canton Road, but he ordered Pemberton to leave Edwards Station and attack the Federals at Clinton. Pemberton and his generals felt that Johnston's plan was dangerous and decided instead to attack the Union supply trains moving from Grand Gulf to Raymond. On May 16, however, Pemberton received another order from Johnston repeating his former directions. Pemberton had already started after the supply trains and was on the Raymond-Edwards Road with his rear at the crossroads one-third mile south of the crest of Champion Hill. Thus, when he ordered a countermarch, his rear, including his many supply wagons, became the vanguard of his force.\n\n===Champion Hill (May 16)===\n{{main article|Battle of Champion Hill}}\nOn May 16, about 7 a.m., the Union forces engaged the Confederates and the Battle of Champion Hill began. Pemberton's force drew up into a defensive line along a crest of a ridge overlooking Jackson Creek. Pemberton was unaware that one Union column was moving along the Jackson Road against his unprotected left flank. For protection, Pemberton posted Brig. Gen. [[Stephen D. Lee]]'s men atop Champion Hill where they could watch for the reported Union column moving to the crossroads. Lee spotted the Union troops and they soon saw him. If this force was not stopped, it would cut the Confederates off from their Vicksburg base. Pemberton received warning of the Union movement and sent troops to his left flank. Union forces at the Champion House moved into action and emplaced artillery to begin firing. When Grant arrived at Champion Hill, around 10 a.m., he ordered the attack to begin. By 11:30&nbsp;a.m., Union forces had reached the Confederate main line and about 1 p.m., they took the crest while the Confederates retreated in disorder. The Federals swept forward, capturing the crossroads and closing the Jackson Road escape route. One of Pemberton's divisions (Bowen's) then counterattacked, pushing the Federals back beyond the Champion Hill crest before their surge came to a halt. Grant then counterattacked, committing forces that had just arrived from Clinton by way of Bolton. Pemberton's men could not stand up to this assault, so he ordered his men from the field to the one escape route still open: the Raymond Road crossing of Bakers Creek. Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]]'s brigade formed the rearguard, and they held at all costs, including the loss of Tilghman. In the late afternoon, Union troops seized the Bakers Creek Bridge, and by midnight, they occupied Edwards. The Confederates were in full retreat towards Vicksburg.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms009.htm NPS Champion Hill.]</ref>\n\n===Big Black River Bridge (May 17)===\n{{main article|Battle of Big Black River Bridge}}\nThe Confederate retreat reached [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]] Bridge the night of May 16\u201317. Pemberton ordered Brig. Gen. Bowen, with three brigades, to man the fortifications on the east bank of the river and impede any Union pursuit. Three divisions of McClernand's corps moved out from Edwards Station on the morning of May 17. The corps encountered the Confederates behind breastworks and took cover as enemy artillery began firing. Union Brig. Gen. [[Michael K. Lawler]] formed his 2nd Brigade, Brig. Gen. [[Eugene Asa Carr|Eugene A. Carr]]'s Division, which surged out of a river meander scar, across the front of the Confederate forces, and into the enemy's breastworks, held by Brig. Gen. [[John C. Vaughn]]'s inexperienced East Tennessee Brigade. Confused and panicked, the Confederates began to withdraw across the Big Black on two bridges: the railroad bridge and the steamboat dock moored athwart the river. As soon as they had crossed, the Confederates set fire to the bridges, preventing close Union pursuit. The fleeing Confederates who arrived in Vicksburg later that day were disorganized. The Union forces captured approximately 1,800 troops at Big Black, a loss that the Confederates could ill afford.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms010.htm NPS Big Black River Bridge.]</ref>\n\n===Siege of Vicksburg (May 18&nbsp;\u2013 July 4)===\n{{main article|Siege of Vicksburg}}\n[[File:VicksburgSiege.png|thumb|300px|Siege of Vicksburg. Corps and division commanders are shown for the period June 23&nbsp;\u2013 July 4.]]\nThe Union army converged on Vicksburg, trapping Pemberton's force. Grant attempted two assaults to break through the strong Confederate fieldworks: May 19 and May 22. The latter assault initially achieved some success in McClernand's sector, but it was repulsed with 3,200 casualties. Johnston ordered Pemberton to evacuate the city and save his army, but Pemberton thought it impossible to withdraw safely. Johnston planned to attack Grant and relieve Pemberton but was unable to arrange it in time. Grant besieged the Confederate army. On July 4, after six weeks in which the soldiers and civilians of Vicksburg had no food supplies and were bombarded constantly, Pemberton surrendered the city and his army.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms011.htm NPS Vicksburg.]</ref>\n\nIn addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant had to be concerned with Confederate forces in his rear. He stationed one division in the vicinity of the Big Black River bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as [[Mechanicsburg, Mississippi|Mechanicsburg]], both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[John G. Parke]], was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]], from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. [[Frederick Steele]] replaced him at the XV Corps on June 22. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson.<ref>Esposito, text for map 107.</ref>\n\n==Louisiana operations==\nDuring the Siege of Vicksburg, three other battles took place in the vicinity:\n\n===Milliken's Bend (June 7)===\n{{further|Battle of Milliken's Bend}}\nIn an effort to cut Grant's supply line during the siege, the Confederates attacked the Milliken's Bend supply area up the Mississippi. This was mainly defended by untrained [[African-American|black]] troops, who fought bravely with inferior weaponry and finally fought off the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at significant cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battles-detail.htm?battleCode=la011 NPS Milliken's Bend.]</ref>\n\n===Goodrich's Landing (June 29\u201330)===\n{{further|Battle of Goodrich's Landing}}\nAfter Union forces began occupying the Louisiana river parishes, thousands of escaped slaves flocked to them. The Federals, therefore, leased some plantations and put the freedmen to work growing cotton or other crops; the proceeds from the sale of the crops helped defray expenses for food, clothing, etc. African-American troops were assigned to protect these plantations, releasing other troops to fight. Confederates, determined to recapture some of these freedmen and destroy the crops, undertook an expedition from [[Gaines's Landing, Arkansas]], to Lake Providence. Although the Confederates disrupted these operations, destroyed much property, and captured many supplies and weapons, the raid was only a minor setback for the Union. The Confederates could cause momentary disturbances, but they were unable to effect any lasting changes.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/la014.htm NPS Goodrich's Landing.]</ref>\n\n===Helena (July 4)===\n{{further|Battle of Helena}}\nConfederate Lt. Gen. [[Theophilus H. Holmes]]'s troops attacked [[Helena, Arkansas]], in an attempt to relieve pressure on Vicksburg. Although the Confederates had more troops and did initially capture some of the fortifications, the Union forces repelled them.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/Battles/ar008.htm NPS Helena.]</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAlthough the Confederate killed and wounded in the battle and siege of Vicksburg were a relatively small 2,872, and Union 4,910, Grant captured his second Confederate army in its entirety (the first being at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]]): 29,495 surrendered.<ref>Kennedy, p. 173.</ref> Most of the Confederates were paroled. The Union also captured significant quantities of artillery, small arms, and ammunition. The full campaign, since March 29, claimed 10,142 Union and 9,091 Confederate killed and wounded.<ref>Ballard, pp. 398\u201399.</ref>\n\nThis was the second major blow to the Confederacy in the summer of 1863. On July 3, Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s invasion of the North collapsed at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]. On July 4, the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] rose over Vicksburg. To the Confederates, surrendering on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] was a bitter defeat. Union troops behaved well, mixing with Confederates and giving rations to starving soldiers. Speculators who had been hoarding food for higher prices saw their stores broken open and the contents thrown on the streets for the starving rebels. In his ''Personal Memoirs'', Grant observed, \"The men of the two armies fraternized as if they had been fighting for the same cause.\"<ref>Grant, chapter XXXVIII, p. 38.</ref> But resentments lingered: allegedly tradition holds that the [[Fourth of July]] holiday was not celebrated by Vicksburg until [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This claim has been challenged because large Fourth of July celebrations were being held by 1907.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waldrep|first=Christopher|title=Vicksburg's Long Shadow: The Civil War Legacy Of Race And Remembrance |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0742548688 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esDgeo7QYJEC&pg=PA247 |page=247}}</ref><ref>Historian Michael G. Ballard, in his ''Vicksburg'' campaign history, pp. 420-21, claims that this story has little foundation in fact. Although it is unknown whether city officials sanctioned the day as a local holiday, Southern observances of July 4 were for many years characterized more by family picnics than by formal city or county activities.</ref>\nThe most significant result of the campaign was control of the Mississippi River, which the Union obtained completely after [[Battle of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]], which had been besieged by Banks since May 27, heard news of Vicksburg's fall and surrendered on July 9. The Confederacy was now cut in two; one week later, an unarmed ship arrived in Union-held New Orleans from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] after an uneventful trip down the river. President Lincoln announced, \"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 410.</ref>\n\nGrant deployed Sherman and 50,000 troops against Johnston's 31,000 in Jackson. Johnston tried to lure Sherman into a frontal assault, but Sherman had seen the results of such at Vicksburg. He demurred and began surrounding the city. Johnston escaped with his army, which was more than Pemberton had achieved, but all of central Mississippi was now under Sherman's control. He used a subsequent operation against [[Meridian, Mississippi]], as a harbinger of the [[scorched earth]] tactics he later employed in his [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and then [[Carolinas campaign|South Carolina]].\n\nOne of Grant's actions during the siege was to settle a lingering rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, claiming much of the credit for the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the [[Battle of Arkansas Post]]. Grant finally relieved McClernand on June 18. McClernand's XIII Corps was turned over to Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord]]. In May 1864, McClernand was restored to a command in remote [[Texas]].<ref>Bearss, vol. III, pp. 875\u201379; Ballard, pp. 358\u201359; Korn, pp. 147\u201348.</ref>\n\nGrant was the undisputed victor of the Vicksburg campaign. He was rewarded for his victory with a promotion to major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]], effective on July 4, 1863. He also received an unusual letter:\n\n{{Quote|My dear General\n\nI do not remember that you and I ever met personally. I write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost inestimable service you have done the country. I wish to say a word further. When you first reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should do, what you finally did\u2014march the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the transports, and thus go below; and I never had any faith, except a general hope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition, and the like, could succeed. When you got below, and took Port Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river and join Gen. Banks; and when you turned Northward East of the Big Black, I feared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right, and I was wrong.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Lincoln<ref>Smith, p. 257.</ref>}}\n\nGrant went on to rescue Union forces besieged at [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] and then replaced Halleck as general in chief of all Union armies, with the recently re-activated rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]]. Despite his ultimate success in winning the war, historians have often considered Vicksburg his finest campaign\u2014imaginative, audacious, relentless, and a masterpiece of maneuver warfare. [[James M. McPherson]] called Vicksburg \"the most brilliant and innovative campaign of the Civil War\"; [[T. Harry Williams]] described it as \"one of the classic campaigns of the Civil War and, indeed, of military history\"; and the U.S. Army ''[[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 100-5|Field Manual&nbsp;100\u20135]]'' (May&nbsp;1986) called it \"the most brilliant campaign ever fought on American soil\".<ref>Bonekemper, ''A Victor, Not a Butcher'', p. 83.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Steven E. Woodworth]] wrote that Pemberton \"had a strong claim to the title of the most hated man in the South, certainly the most hated to wear a Confederate uniform\". There were accusations that adequate supplies had been on hand and that it was only his treachery that caused the surrender. Even his friend, Confederate general [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]], wrote after the war that a large part of the population believed \"He had joined the South for the express purpose of betraying it, and this was clearly proven by the fact that he surrendered on the 4th of July, a day sacred to the Yankees.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis and His Generals'', p. 218.</ref><ref>David Zimring, ''To live and Die in Dixie: Native Northerners Who Fought for the Confederacy'', Univ Tennessee Press, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1621901068}}; p. 262.</ref>\n\nThe blame for losing Vicksburg fell not only on John Pemberton, but on the overcautious Joseph E. Johnston. Jefferson Davis said of the defeat, \"Yes, from a want of provisions inside and a General outside who wouldn't fight.\"<ref>McPherson, p. 637.</ref> Anguished soldiers and civilians starving in the siege held hopes that he would come to their aid, but he never did. Accusations of cowardice that had dogged him since the 1862 [[Peninsula Campaign]] continued to follow him in the 1864 [[Atlanta Campaign]] against Sherman. However, Johnston was far outnumbered. While he was one of few Confederate generals whom Grant respected, he was outgeneraled.\n\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:Grant Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The monument to U.S. Grant at the national military park in Vicksburg, MS, unveiled in 1919]]\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1863]]\n* [[List of costliest American Civil War land battles]]\n* [[Armies in the American Civil War]]\n* [[Commemoration of the American Civil War]] \n* [[Commemoration of the American Civil War on postage stamps]]\n* [[Vicksburg National Military Park]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Ballard, Michael B.

The [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Tennessee]] under [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] gained control of the river by capturing this stronghold and defeating [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[John C. Pemberton]]'s forces stationed there.\n\nThe campaign consisted of many important naval operations, troop maneuvers, failed initiatives, and eleven distinct battles from December 26, 1862, to July 4, 1863. Military historians divide the campaign into two formal phases: '''operations against Vicksburg''' (December&nbsp;1862&nbsp;\u2013 January&nbsp;1863) and '''Grant's operations against Vicksburg''' (March\u2013July 1863).\n\nGrant initially planned a two-pronged approach in which half of his army, under Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], would advance to the [[Yazoo River]] and attempt to reach Vicksburg from the northeast, while Grant took the remainder of the army down the Mississippi Central Railroad. Both of these initiatives failed. Grant conducted a number of \"experiments\" or expeditions\u2014Grant's bayou operations\u2014that attempted to enable waterborne access to the Mississippi south of Vicksburg's artillery batteries. All five of these initiatives failed as well. Finally, Union gunboats and troop transport boats ran the batteries at Vicksburg and met up with Grant's men who had marched overland in [[Louisiana]]. On April 29 and April 30, 1863, Grant's army crossed the Mississippi and landed at [[Bruinsburg, Mississippi]]. An elaborate series of demonstrations and diversions fooled the Confederates and the landings occurred without opposition. Over the next 17 days, Grant maneuvered his army inland and won five battles, captured the state capital of [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and assaulted and laid siege to Vicksburg.\n\nAfter Pemberton's army surrendered on July 4 (one day after the Confederate defeat at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]), and when [[Siege of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]] surrendered to Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] on July 9, Texas and Arkansas were effectively cut off from the Confederacy, and the Mississippi River was once again open for northern commerce to reach the Gulf of Mexico, and as a supply line for the Union Army. Grant's Vicksburg campaign is studied as a masterpiece of military operations and a major [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]] of the war.\n\n==Background==\n\n=== Military situation===\n{{Main article|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}{{further|American Civil War}}\n{| align=right\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Army commanders (Vicksburg campaign)\n|-\n|<gallery>\nImage:GenUSGrant.jpg|<center>Maj.

Pemberton]], CSA</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\nVicksburg was strategically vital to the Confederates. [[Jefferson Davis]] said, \"Vicksburg is the nail head that holds the South's two halves together.\"<ref>Winschel, p. 14.</ref> While in their hands, it blocked Union navigation down the Mississippi; together with control of the mouth of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and of [[Port Hudson, Louisiana|Port Hudson]] to the south, it allowed communication with the states west of the river, upon which the Confederates depended extensively for horses, cattle and reinforcements. The natural defenses of the city were ideal, earning it the nickname \"The Gibraltar of the Confederacy\". It was located on a high bluff overlooking a horseshoe-shaped bend in the river, De Soto Peninsula, making it almost impossible to approach by ship. North and East of Vicksburg was the [[Mississippi Delta]] (sometimes known as the Yazoo Delta), an area 200 miles (320&nbsp;km) north to south and up to 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) across, which has been described by geographer Warren E. Grabau as an \"astonishingly complex network of intersecting waterways\", some of which were navigable by small steamboats. The regions between modern rivers and bayous formed closed basins called backswamps, of which Grabau judged, \"Whether permanently flooded or not, the backswamps were, for all practical purposes, untamed wildernesses, utterly impassable by a man on horseback or by any form of wheeled vehicle, and very difficult even for a man on foot.\"<ref>Grabau, p. 19.</ref> About twelve miles (19&nbsp;km) up the [[Yazoo River]] were Confederate batteries and entrenchments at Haynes Bluff. The [[Louisiana]] land west of Vicksburg was also difficult, with many streams and poor country roads, widespread winter flooding, and it was on the opposite side of the river from the fortress.\n\nThe city had been under Union naval attack before. Admiral [[David Farragut]] moved up the river after his [[capture of New Orleans]] and on May 18, 1862, demanded the surrender of Vicksburg. Farragut had insufficient troops to force the issue, and he moved back to New Orleans. He returned with a flotilla in June 1862, but their attempts (June 26\u201328) to bombard the fortress into surrender failed. They shelled Vicksburg throughout July and fought some minor battles with a few Confederate vessels in the area, but their forces were insufficient to attempt a landing, and they abandoned attempts to force the surrender of the city. Farragut investigated the possibility of bypassing the fortified cliffs by digging a canal across the neck of the river's bend, the De Soto Peninsula. On June 28, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Thomas Williams (general)|Thomas Williams]], attached to Farragut's command, began digging work on the canal by employing local laborers and some soldiers. Many of the men fell victim to tropical diseases and heat exhaustion, and the work was abandoned by July 24. (Williams was killed two weeks later in the [[Battle of Baton Rouge (1862)|Battle of Baton Rouge]]).<ref>Ballard, pp. 46\u201362; Bearss, vol. I, p. 437; [https://www.nps.gov/vick/learn/historyculture/grants-canal.htm VNMP article] on Grant's Canal.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1862, Maj. Gen. [[Henry W. Halleck]] was promoted from command of the Western Theater to General-in-Chief of all Union armies. On November 23, he indicated to Grant his preference for a major move down the Mississippi to Vicksburg; in Halleck's style, he left considerable initiative to design a campaign, an opportunity that the pugnacious Grant seized. Halleck has received criticism for not moving promptly overland from [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to seize Vicksburg during the summer when he was in command on the scene. He believed that the Navy could capture the fortress on its own, not knowing that the naval force was insufficiently manned with ground troops to finish the job. What might have achieved success in the summer of 1862 was no longer possible by November because the Confederates had amply reinforced the garrison by that time.  Also reliable navigation on the river was seasonal, and the natural fall in the level of the river during the fall and winter months limited the utility of shipping, the usable draft of riverboats, and the quantity of men, supplies, and equipment, they could transport.\n\nGrant's army marched south down the [[Mississippi Central Railroad]], making a forward base at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]]. He planned a two-pronged assault in the direction of Vicksburg. His principal subordinate, Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], was to advance down the river with four divisions (about 32,000 men) and Grant would continue with the remaining forces (about 40,000) down the railroad line to [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], where he would wait for developments, hoping to lure the Confederate army out of the city to attack him in the vicinity of [[Grenada, Mississippi]].\n\nOn the Confederate side, forces in Mississippi were under the command of Lt. Gen. [[John C. Pemberton]], an officer from [[Pennsylvania]] who chose to fight for the [[Southern United States|South]]. Pemberton had approximately 12,000 men in Vicksburg and [[Jackson, Mississippi]], and Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]] had approximately 24,000 at Grenada.\n\nMeanwhile, political forces were at work. [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] had long recognized the importance of Vicksburg; he wrote \"Vicksburg is the key. ...The war can never be brought to a close until that key is in our pocket.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 24.</ref> Lincoln also envisioned a two-pronged offensive, but one up and down the river. Maj. Gen. [[John A. McClernand]], a [[War Democrats|War Democrat]] politician, had convinced Lincoln that he could lead an army down the river and take Vicksburg. Lincoln approved his proposal and wanted Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] to advance up river from New Orleans at the same time. McClernand began organizing regiments, sending them to Memphis. Back in [[Washington, D.C.]], Halleck was nervous about McClernand and gave Grant control of all troops in his own department. McClernand's troops were split into two corps, one under McClernand, the other under Sherman. McClernand complained but to no avail. Grant appropriated his troops, one of several maneuvers in a private dispute within the Union Army between Grant and McClernand that continued throughout the campaign.\n\n==Battles in the operations against Vicksburg, December 1862&nbsp;\u2013 January 1863==\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignDecember62March63.png|thumb|300px|Operations against Vicksburg and Grant's bayou operations {{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}} {{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\nThe \"operations against Vicksburg\" phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:\n\n===Chickasaw Bayou (December 26\u201329, 1862)===\n{{main article|Battle of Chickasaw Bayou}}\nSherman disembarked with three divisions at Johnson's Plantation on the Yazoo River to approach the Vicksburg defenses from the northeast. On December 27, the Federals pushed their lines forward through the swamps toward the Walnut Hills, which were strongly defended. On December 28, several futile attempts were made to get around these defenses. On December 29, Sherman ordered a frontal assault, which was repulsed with heavy casualties, and then withdrew.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ms003.htm NPS Chickasaw Bayou.]</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the overland half of Grant's offensive was failing. His lines of communication were disrupted by raids by Van Dorn and [[Brigadier General#United States|Brig. Gen.]] [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], who destroyed his large supply depot at Holly Springs. Unable to subsist his army without these supplies, Grant abandoned his overland advance.\n\nIn early January, McClernand arrived at Memphis with the corps he had recruited (the [[XIII Corps (Union Army)|XIII Corps]] under Brig. Gen. [[George W. Morgan]]) and commenced his operation down the Mississippi. On January 4, he ordered Sherman to attach his [[XV Corps (Union Army)|XV Corps]] to the expedition, calling his combined 32,000-man force the [[Army of the Mississippi]]. This was a direct provocation against Grant, but Sherman acceded to the senior officer. Sherman suggested beginning with a combined land and naval movement against Fort Hindman, on the [[Arkansas River]] at [[Arkansas Post]], 50 miles up the Arkansas from its confluence with the Mississippi, a base from which Confederate gunboats were attacking Union shipping on the river. The expedition started without notifying Grant.<ref>Ballard, pp. 147\u201349.</ref>\n\n===Arkansas Post (January 9\u201311, 1863)===\n{{main article|Battle of Arkansas Post}}\nUnion boats under [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Adm.]] [[David Dixon Porter]] began landing troops near Arkansas Post in the evening of January 9. The troops started up river towards Fort Hindman. Sherman's corps overran Confederate trenches, and the defenders retreated to the protection of the fort and adjacent rifle-pits. Porter, on January 10, moved his fleet towards Fort Hindman and bombarded it, withdrawing at dusk. Union artillery fired on the fort from positions across the river on January 11, and the infantry moved into position for an attack. Union ironclads commenced shelling the fort and Porter's fleet passed it to cut off any retreat. As a result of this envelopment, and the attack by Morgan's troops, the Confederate command surrendered in the afternoon. Although Union losses were high and the victory did not contribute to the capture of Vicksburg, it did eliminate one more impediment to Union shipping on the Mississippi.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ar006.htm NPS Arkansas Post.]</ref>\n\nGrant was not happy to learn that McClernand had conducted the operation without his approval, considering it a distraction from his main objective of Vicksburg, but since it had been successful and his ally Sherman had suggested it, he took no punitive action. However, he ordered McClernand back to the Mississippi and assumed personal command of the campaign on January 13 at Milliken's Bend, 15 miles northwest of Vicksburg.\n\n==Grant's bayou operations, January\u2013March 1863==\nThat winter, Grant conducted a series of initiatives to approach and capture Vicksburg,<ref>''Organization of the Army of the Tennessee, Major General Ulysses S. Grant, U. S. Army, commanding, January 31, 1863'': Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIV, Part 3, [http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moawar&cc=moawar&idno=waro0038&node=waro0038%3A1&view=image&seq=23&size=100 page 23.]</ref> termed \"Grant's bayou operations\". Their general theme was to use or construct alternative waterways so that troops could be positioned within striking distance of Vicksburg, without requiring a direct approach on the Mississippi under the Confederate guns.\n\n===Grant's Canal===\nThe Williams Canal across De Soto Peninsula had been abandoned by Adm. Farragut and Brig. Gen. Williams in July 1862, but it had the potential to offer a route downriver that bypassed Vicksburg's guns. In late January 1863, Sherman's men, at the urging of Grant\u2014who was advised by the navy that President Lincoln liked the idea\u2014resumed digging. Sherman derisively called the work \"Butler's Ditch\" (since it was Maj. Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] who had sent Williams upriver to do the work), which was barely 6 feet wide by 6 feet deep. Grant, undoubtedly influenced by Lincoln's continuous inquiries as to the status of the canal, ordered Sherman to expand the canal to 60 feet wide and 7 feet deep and the effort became known as Grant's Canal. It was not properly engineered based upon the hydrology of the Mississippi River, however, and a sudden rise in the river broke through the dam at the head of the canal and flooded the area. The canal began to fill up with back water and sediment. In a desperate effort to rescue the project, two huge steam-driven dipper dredges, ''Hercules'' and ''Sampson'', attempted to clear the channel, but the dredges were exposed to Confederate artillery fire from the bluffs at Vicksburg and driven away. By late March, work on the canal was abandoned. (Remnants of about 200 yards of Grant's Canal are maintained by the Vicksburg National Military Park in Louisiana).<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 436\u201350; [http://www.nps.gov/archive/vick/grntcanl/grantsc.htm VNMP article] on Grant's Canal.</ref>\n\n===Lake Providence expedition===\nGrant ordered Brig. Gen. [[James B. McPherson]] to construct a canal of several hundred yards from the Mississippi to [[Lake Providence, Louisiana|Lake Providence]], northwest of the city. This would allow passage to the Red River, through Bayous Baxter and Macon, and the Tensas and Black Rivers. Reaching the Red River, Grant's force could join with Banks at Port Hudson. McPherson reported that the connection was navigable on March 18, but the few \"ordinary Ohio River boats\" that had been sent to Grant for navigation of the bayous could only transport 8,500 men, far too few to tip the balance at Port Hudson. Although this was the only one of the bayou expeditions to successfully bypass the Vicksburg defenses, historian [[Ed Bearss]] calls this episode the \"Lake Providence Boondoggle\".<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 467\u201378; Ballard, pp. 173\u201374.</ref>\n\n===Yazoo Pass expedition===\n{{main article|Yazoo Pass expedition}}\nThe next attempt was to get to the high ground of the [[loess]] bluffs above Hayne's Bluff and below Yazoo City by blowing up the Mississippi River levee near [[Moon Lake (Mississippi)|Moon Lake]], some 150 miles (240&nbsp;km) above Vicksburg, near [[Helena, Arkansas]], and following the Yazoo Pass (an old route from Yazoo City to Memphis, which was curtailed by the 1856 levee construction that sealed off the Pass from the Mississippi River to Moon Lake) into the Coldwater River, then to the [[Tallahatchie River]], and finally into the Yazoo River at [[Greenwood, Mississippi]]. The dikes were blown up on February 3, beginning what was called the Yazoo Pass Expedition. Ten Union boats, under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Watson Smith, with army troops under the command of Brig. Gen. [[Benjamin Prentiss]], began moving through the pass on February 7. But low-hanging trees destroyed anything on the gunboats above deck and Confederates felled more trees to block the way. These delays allowed the Confederates time to quickly construct a \"Fort Pemberton\" near the confluence of the Tallahatchie and [[Yalobusha River]]s near [[Greenwood, Mississippi]], which repulsed the naval force on March 11, March 14, and March 16. The Union effort collapsed in early April.<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 479\u2013548; Ballard, pp. 174\u201384; Eicher, pp. 439\u201340.</ref>\n\n===Steele's Bayou expedition===\n{{main article|Steele's Bayou expedition}}\nAdmiral Porter started an effort on March 14 to go up the Yazoo Delta via Steele's Bayou, just north of Vicksburg, to [[Deer Creek (Mississippi)|Deer Creek]]. This would [[flanking maneuver|outflank]] Fort Pemberton and allow landing troops between Vicksburg and [[Yazoo City, Mississippi|Yazoo City]]. Confederates once again felled trees in their path, and willow reeds fouled the boats' paddlewheels. This time the Union boats became immobilized, and Confederate cavalry and infantry threatened to capture them. Sherman sent infantry assistance to repel the Confederates bedeviling Porter, but Porter's approach was abandoned as too difficult.<ref>Bearss, vol. I, pp. 549\u201390; Ballard, pp. 184\u201388.</ref>\n\n===Duckport Canal===\nGrant's final attempt was to dig another canal from Duckport Landing to Walnut Bayou, aimed at getting lighter boats past Vicksburg. By the time the canal was almost finished, on April 6, water levels were declining, and none but the lightest of flatboats could get through. Grant abandoned this canal and started planning anew.<ref>Ballard, p. 193.</ref>\n\nFrom December through March, including Chickasaw Bayou and the Mississippi Central advance, seven initiatives, or \"experiments\", by Grant had failed. Grant claimed in his memoirs that he had undertaken these experiments primarily to keep his troops busy during the flooded and disease-laden winter months and that he had had no expectation of success. This claim is contradicted by correspondence from Grant at the time.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n==Plan for the 1863 campaign and initial movements==\n[[File:View of Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|View of Vicksburg vicinity and fortifications, 1863]]\nAll of the bayou operations were failures, but Grant was known for his stubborn determination and would not quit. His final option was bold but risky: March the army down the west side of the Mississippi, cross the river south of Vicksburg, and either attack Vicksburg from the south and the east or join forces with Banks, capture Port Hudson, and then together reduce Vicksburg. Porter would have to sneak past the guns to get sufficient gunboats and transport ships south of the city. Once they had completed the downstream passage, they would not be able to return past Vicksburg's guns because the river current would slow them too much.\n\nOn March 29, McClernand set his troops to work building bridges and [[corduroy road]]s. They filled in the swamps in their way as well, and by April 17 they had a rough, tortuous 70-mile (110&nbsp;km) road from Milliken's Bend to the proposed river crossing at [[Hard Times, Louisiana]], below Vicksburg.\n\n[[File:Porter's flotilla below Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|left|Porter's flotilla arrives; General Sherman is going in a yawl to the flagship, {{USS|Benton|1861}}.]]\nOn April 16, a clear night with no moon, Porter sent seven gunboats and three empty troop transports loaded with stores to run the bluff, taking care to minimize noise and lights. But the preparations were ineffective. Confederate sentries sighted the boats, and the bluff exploded with massive artillery fire. Fires were set along the banks to improve visibility. The Union gunboats answered back. Porter observed that the Confederates mainly hit the high parts of his boats, reasoned that they could not depress their guns, and had them hug the east shore, right under Confederate cannon, so close he could hear their commanders giving orders, shells flying overhead. The fleet survived with little damage; thirteen men were wounded and none killed. The ''Henry Clay'' was disabled and burned at the water's edge. On April 22, six more boats loaded with supplies made the run; one boat did not make it, though no one was killed.  The crew floated downstream on the boat's remnants.\n\nThe final piece of Grant's strategy was to divert Pemberton's attention from the river crossing site that the Union troops would use. Grant chose two operations: a feint by Sherman against [[Snyder's Bluff, Mississippi]], north of Vicksburg (see the [[Battle of Snyder's Bluff]] below), and a daring cavalry raid through central Mississippi by [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Benjamin Grierson]], known as [[Grierson's Raid]]. The former was inconclusive, but the latter was a success. Grierson was able to draw out significant Confederate forces to chase him, and Pemberton's defenses were dispersed too far around the state. (Pemberton was also wary of Nathaniel Banks's impending advance up the river from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] to threaten Port Hudson.){{citation needed|reason=whole section lacks sources|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Union===\n{{further|Champion Hill Union order of battle|Vicksburg Union order of battle|l2=Siege of Vicksburg Union order of battle}}\n\nMaj.

Sherman]]; the [[XVII Corps (Union Army)|XVII Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[James B. McPherson]]; a three-division detachment of the [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[Cadwallader C. Washburn]]; and a detachment from the District of Northeast Louisiana, under Brig. Gen. [[Elias S. Dennis]]. The [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], commanded by Maj. Gen. [[John G.

Walker]].\n\n==Battles in Grant's operations against Vicksburg, April&nbsp;\u2013 July 1863==\n[[File:VicksburgCampaignAprilJuly63.png|thumb|350px|Grant's operations against Vicksburg]]\nThe \"Grant's operations against Vicksburg\" phase of the Vicksburg campaign comprises the following battles:\n\n===Grand Gulf (April 29, 1863)===\n{{main article|Battle of Grand Gulf}}\nAdmiral Porter led seven ironclads in an attack on the fortifications and batteries at [[Grand Gulf, Mississippi]], with the intention of silencing the Confederate guns and then securing the area with troops of McClernand's XIII Corps who were on the accompanying transports and barges. The attack by the seven ironclads began at 8 a.m. and continued until about 1:30&nbsp;p.m. During the fight, the ironclads moved within 100 yards of the Confederate guns and silenced the lower batteries of Fort Wade. The Confederate upper batteries at Fort Cobun remained out of reach and continued to fire. The Union ironclads (one of which, the [[USS Tuscumbia (1862)|''Tuscumbia'']], had been put out of action) and the transports drew off. After dark, however, the ironclads engaged the Confederate guns again while the steamboats and barges ran the gauntlet. Grant marched his men overland across Coffee Point to below the Gulf. After the transports had passed Grand Gulf, they embarked the troops at [[Disharoon's plantation]] and disembarked them on the Mississippi shore at Bruinsburg, below Grand Gulf. Grant landed 17,000 soldiers there, the largest amphibious operation in American military history until the [[Invasion of Normandy]]. The men immediately began marching overland towards [[Port Gibson, Mississippi]]. The Confederates had won a hollow victory, since the loss at Grand Gulf caused just a slight change in Grant's offensive.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bruinsburg Crossing (April 30 \u2013 May 1) | publisher = National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/vick/historyculture/bruincross.htm | accessdate = 7 September 2018}}; [http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/ms004.htm NPS Grand Gulf.]</ref>\n\n===Snyder's Bluff (April 29&nbsp;\u2013 May 1)===\n{{main article|Battle of Snyder's Bluff}}\nTo ensure that troops would not be withdrawn to Grand Gulf to assist Confederates there, a combined Union army-navy force feigned an attack on Snyder's Bluff. After noon on April 29, Lt. Cdr. [[Kidder Breese|K. Randolph Breese]], with his eight gunboats and ten transports carrying Maj. Gen. [[Francis Preston Blair, Jr.|Francis P. Blair]]'s division, inched up the Yazoo River to the mouth of Chickasaw Bayou where they spent the night. At 9 a.m., the next morning, the force, minus one gunboat, continued upriver to Drumgould's Bluff and engaged the enemy batteries. During the fighting, [[USS Choctaw (1856)|''Choctaw'']] suffered more than fifty hits, but no casualties occurred. Around 6 p.m., the troops disembarked and marched along Blake's Levee toward the guns. As they neared Drumgould's Bluff, a battery opened on them, creating havoc and casualties. The Union advance halted and, after dark, the men reembarked on the transports. The next morning, transports disembarked other troops. The swampy terrain and enemy heavy artillery fire forced them to retire. The gunboats opened fire again, about 3 p.m. on May 1, causing some damage. Later, the boats' fire slackened and stopped altogether after dark. Sherman had received orders to land his troops at Milliken's Bend, so the gunboats returned to their anchorages at the mouth of the Yazoo.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms005.htm NPS Snyder's Bluff.]</ref>\n\n===Port Gibson (May 1)===\n{{main article|Battle of Port Gibson}}\nGrant's army began marching inland from Bruinsburg. Advancing on the Rodney Road towards Port Gibson, they ran into Confederate outposts after midnight and skirmished with them for around three hours. After 3 a.m., the fighting stopped. Union forces advanced on the Rodney Road and a plantation road at dawn. At 5:30&nbsp;a.m., the Confederates engaged the Union advance and the battle ensued. Federals forced the Confederates to fall back. The Confederates established new defensive positions at different times during the day but they could not stop the Union onslaught and left the field in the early evening. This defeat demonstrated that the Confederates were unable to defend the Mississippi River line, and the Federals had secured their beachhead.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms006.htm NPS Port Gibson.]</ref>\n\nAt this point, Grant faced a decision. His original orders were to capture Grand Gulf and then proceed south to link up with Banks and reduce Port Hudson, after which their combined armies would return and capture Vicksburg. Unfortunately for Grant, such a course would put him under the command of the more senior major general and the credit for any success in the theater would go to Banks. Since Banks was occupied with operations on the Red River and had informed Grant that he was not ready to begin operations against Port Hudson within the next few days, Grant decided to move on his own against Vicksburg. He sent a message to Halleck about his intentions, knowing that it would take as many as eight days for Washington to receive the message and respond.\n\nAfter the Union army seized the crossing at Grindstone Ford, any Confederate forces between the Big Bayou Pierre and the Big Black River were compromised. Realizing this, Bowen evacuated Grand Gulf and proceeded with all speed to Hankinson's Ford across the Big Black, barely escaping the Union trap. Grant's intention at this time was to move north over this same route and advance directly on Vicksburg. However, scouting parties that he sent out found that Pemberton had good defensive positions to the south of the city. Instead, he decided to break the city's supply line by seizing the railroad from Jackson to Vicksburg. He gave orders for his three corps (Sherman having arrived across the river) to advance over three separate routes to attack the railroad at [[Edwards, Mississippi|Edwards Station]] (the westernmost objective, with McClernand's corps), [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] (easternmost, with McPherson's) and Midway Station (center, with Sherman's).\n\n===Raymond (May 12)===\n{{main article|Battle of Raymond}}\nOn May 10, Pemberton ordered all reinforcements arriving at Jackson to march to [[Raymond, Mississippi|Raymond]], 20 miles (32&nbsp;km) to the southwest. Brig. Gen. [[John Gregg (CSA)|John Gregg]]'s overstrength brigade, having endured a grueling march from [[Port Hudson, Louisiana]], began marching to Raymond the next morning, arriving late in the afternoon of May 11. On May 12, Gregg's brigade moved to ambush a Union raiding party at Fourteen Mile Creek. The raiding party turned out to be Maj. Gen. [[John A. Logan]]'s Division of the XVII Corps. Gregg decided to dispute the crossing of Fourteen Mile Creek and arrayed his men and artillery accordingly. As Logan's men approached, the Confederates opened fire, initially causing heavy casualties. Some Union troops broke, but Logan rallied a force to hold the line. Confederate troops attacked the line but were forced to retire. Additional Union troops arrived and counterattacked. Heavy fighting ensued that continued for six hours, but the overwhelming Union force prevailed. Gregg's men left the field. Although they lost the battle, they had held up a much superior Union force for a day. General Gregg, under orders to withdraw to Jackson in the face of a superior force, withdrew five miles (8&nbsp;km) in the direction of Jackson to Mississippi Springs, Mississippi. This retrograde movement exposed the Southern Railroad of Mississippi to Union forces, thus severing the lifeline of Vicksburg.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms007.htm NPS Raymond.]</ref>\n\nDespite McPherson's victory, the presence of Confederate forces attacking Grant's right flank caused him to reconsider his plan. He learned that Gen. [[Joseph E. Johnston]] was due in Jackson with reinforcements within the next couple of days, and there was a rumor that Gen. [[P.G.T. Beauregard]] would also arrive on the scene. In this situation, the Union army would be between enemy forces on each flank. Therefore, he chose to deal with the threat from the east first and ordered Sherman and McPherson to seize Jackson.\n\n===Jackson (May 14)===\n{{main article|Battle of Jackson, Mississippi}}\nOn May 9, Gen. Johnston received a dispatch from the Confederate Secretary of War directing him to \"proceed at once to Mississippi and take chief command of the forces in the field\". When he arrived in Jackson on May 13 from [[Middle Tennessee]], he learned that two army corps\u2014Sherman's and McPherson's\u2014were advancing on Jackson and that Gregg had only about 6,000 troops available to defend the city. Johnston ordered the evacuation of Jackson, but Gregg was to defend Jackson until the evacuation was completed. By 10 a.m., both Union army corps were near Jackson and had engaged the enemy. Rain, Confederate resistance, and poor defenses prevented heavy fighting until around 11 a.m., when Union forces attacked in numbers and slowly but surely pushed the enemy back. In mid-afternoon, Johnston informed Gregg that the evacuation was complete and that he should disengage and follow. Soon after, the Union troops entered Jackson and had a celebration hosted by Grant, who had been traveling with Sherman's corps, in the Bowman House. They then burned part of the town, destroyed numerous factories, and cut the railroad connections with Vicksburg. Johnston's evacuation is seen as a mistake because he could, by late on May 14, have had 11,000 troops at his disposal and by the morning of May 15, another 4,000. The fall of the Mississippi state capital was a blow to Confederate morale.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/Battles/ms008.htm NPS Jackson.]</ref>  Having broken the rail links, Grant temporarily abandoned the city to allow his troops to concentrate on Vicksburg.\n\nJohnston retreated with most of his army up the Canton Road, but he ordered Pemberton to leave Edwards Station and attack the Federals at Clinton. Pemberton and his generals felt that Johnston's plan was dangerous and decided instead to attack the Union supply trains moving from Grand Gulf to Raymond. On May 16, however, Pemberton received another order from Johnston repeating his former directions. Pemberton had already started after the supply trains and was on the Raymond-Edwards Road with his rear at the crossroads one-third mile south of the crest of Champion Hill. Thus, when he ordered a countermarch, his rear, including his many supply wagons, became the vanguard of his force.\n\n===Champion Hill (May 16)===\n{{main article|Battle of Champion Hill}}\nOn May 16, about 7 a.m., the Union forces engaged the Confederates and the Battle of Champion Hill began. Pemberton's force drew up into a defensive line along a crest of a ridge overlooking Jackson Creek. Pemberton was unaware that one Union column was moving along the Jackson Road against his unprotected left flank. For protection, Pemberton posted Brig. Gen. [[Stephen D. Lee]]'s men atop Champion Hill where they could watch for the reported Union column moving to the crossroads. Lee spotted the Union troops and they soon saw him. If this force was not stopped, it would cut the Confederates off from their Vicksburg base. Pemberton received warning of the Union movement and sent troops to his left flank. Union forces at the Champion House moved into action and emplaced artillery to begin firing. When Grant arrived at Champion Hill, around 10 a.m., he ordered the attack to begin. By 11:30&nbsp;a.m., Union forces had reached the Confederate main line and about 1 p.m., they took the crest while the Confederates retreated in disorder. The Federals swept forward, capturing the crossroads and closing the Jackson Road escape route. One of Pemberton's divisions (Bowen's) then counterattacked, pushing the Federals back beyond the Champion Hill crest before their surge came to a halt. Grant then counterattacked, committing forces that had just arrived from Clinton by way of Bolton. Pemberton's men could not stand up to this assault, so he ordered his men from the field to the one escape route still open: the Raymond Road crossing of Bakers Creek. Brig. Gen. [[Lloyd Tilghman]]'s brigade formed the rearguard, and they held at all costs, including the loss of Tilghman. In the late afternoon, Union troops seized the Bakers Creek Bridge, and by midnight, they occupied Edwards. The Confederates were in full retreat towards Vicksburg.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms009.htm NPS Champion Hill.]</ref>\n\n===Big Black River Bridge (May 17)===\n{{main article|Battle of Big Black River Bridge}}\nThe Confederate retreat reached [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]] Bridge the night of May 16\u201317. Pemberton ordered Brig. Gen. Bowen, with three brigades, to man the fortifications on the east bank of the river and impede any Union pursuit. Three divisions of McClernand's corps moved out from Edwards Station on the morning of May 17. The corps encountered the Confederates behind breastworks and took cover as enemy artillery began firing. Union Brig. Gen. [[Michael K. Lawler]] formed his 2nd Brigade, Brig. Gen. [[Eugene Asa Carr|Eugene A. Carr]]'s Division, which surged out of a river meander scar, across the front of the Confederate forces, and into the enemy's breastworks, held by Brig. Gen. [[John C. Vaughn]]'s inexperienced East Tennessee Brigade. Confused and panicked, the Confederates began to withdraw across the Big Black on two bridges: the railroad bridge and the steamboat dock moored athwart the river. As soon as they had crossed, the Confederates set fire to the bridges, preventing close Union pursuit. The fleeing Confederates who arrived in Vicksburg later that day were disorganized. The Union forces captured approximately 1,800 troops at Big Black, a loss that the Confederates could ill afford.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms010.htm NPS Big Black River Bridge.]</ref>\n\n===Siege of Vicksburg (May 18&nbsp;\u2013 July 4)===\n{{main article|Siege of Vicksburg}}\n[[File:VicksburgSiege.png|thumb|300px|Siege of Vicksburg. Corps and division commanders are shown for the period June 23&nbsp;\u2013 July 4.]]\nThe Union army converged on Vicksburg, trapping Pemberton's force. Grant attempted two assaults to break through the strong Confederate fieldworks: May 19 and May 22. The latter assault initially achieved some success in McClernand's sector, but it was repulsed with 3,200 casualties. Johnston ordered Pemberton to evacuate the city and save his army, but Pemberton thought it impossible to withdraw safely. Johnston planned to attack Grant and relieve Pemberton but was unable to arrange it in time. Grant besieged the Confederate army. On July 4, after six weeks in which the soldiers and civilians of Vicksburg had no food supplies and were bombarded constantly, Pemberton surrendered the city and his army.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/battles/ms011.htm NPS Vicksburg.]</ref>\n\nIn addition to Pemberton at his front, Grant had to be concerned with Confederate forces in his rear. He stationed one division in the vicinity of the Big Black River bridge and another reconnoitered as far north as [[Mechanicsburg, Mississippi|Mechanicsburg]], both to act as a covering force. By June 10, the [[IX Corps (Union Army)|IX Corps]], under Maj. Gen. [[John G. Parke]], was transferred to Grant's command. This corps became the nucleus of a special task force whose mission was to prevent Johnston, gathering his forces at [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]], from interfering with the siege. Sherman was given command of this task force and Brig. Gen. [[Frederick Steele]] replaced him at the XV Corps on June 22. Johnston eventually began moving to relieve Pemberton and reached the Big Black River on July 1, but he delayed a potentially difficult encounter with Sherman until it was too late for the Vicksburg garrison, and then fell back to Jackson.<ref>Esposito, text for map 107.</ref>\n\n==Louisiana operations==\nDuring the Siege of Vicksburg, three other battles took place in the vicinity:\n\n===Milliken's Bend (June 7)===\n{{further|Battle of Milliken's Bend}}\nIn an effort to cut Grant's supply line during the siege, the Confederates attacked the Milliken's Bend supply area up the Mississippi. This was mainly defended by untrained [[African-American|black]] troops, who fought bravely with inferior weaponry and finally fought off the Confederates with help from gunboats, although at significant cost; the defenders lost 652 to the Confederate 185.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battles-detail.htm?battleCode=la011 NPS Milliken's Bend.]</ref>\n\n===Goodrich's Landing (June 29\u201330)===\n{{further|Battle of Goodrich's Landing}}\nAfter Union forces began occupying the Louisiana river parishes, thousands of escaped slaves flocked to them. The Federals, therefore, leased some plantations and put the freedmen to work growing cotton or other crops; the proceeds from the sale of the crops helped defray expenses for food, clothing, etc. African-American troops were assigned to protect these plantations, releasing other troops to fight. Confederates, determined to recapture some of these freedmen and destroy the crops, undertook an expedition from [[Gaines's Landing, Arkansas]], to Lake Providence. Although the Confederates disrupted these operations, destroyed much property, and captured many supplies and weapons, the raid was only a minor setback for the Union. The Confederates could cause momentary disturbances, but they were unable to effect any lasting changes.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/la014.htm NPS Goodrich's Landing.]</ref>\n\n===Helena (July 4)===\n{{further|Battle of Helena}}\nConfederate Lt. Gen. [[Theophilus H. Holmes]]'s troops attacked [[Helena, Arkansas]], in an attempt to relieve pressure on Vicksburg. Although the Confederates had more troops and did initially capture some of the fortifications, the Union forces repelled them.<ref>[https://www.nps.gov/abpp/Battles/ar008.htm NPS Helena.]</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAlthough the Confederate killed and wounded in the battle and siege of Vicksburg were a relatively small 2,872, and Union 4,910, Grant captured his second Confederate army in its entirety (the first being at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]]): 29,495 surrendered.<ref>Kennedy, p. 173.</ref> Most of the Confederates were paroled. The Union also captured significant quantities of artillery, small arms, and ammunition. The full campaign, since March 29, claimed 10,142 Union and 9,091 Confederate killed and wounded.<ref>Ballard, pp. 398\u201399.</ref>\n\nThis was the second major blow to the Confederacy in the summer of 1863. On July 3, Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]]'s invasion of the North collapsed at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]. On July 4, the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] rose over Vicksburg. To the Confederates, surrendering on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]] was a bitter defeat. Union troops behaved well, mixing with Confederates and giving rations to starving soldiers. Speculators who had been hoarding food for higher prices saw their stores broken open and the contents thrown on the streets for the starving rebels. In his ''Personal Memoirs'', Grant observed, \"The men of the two armies fraternized as if they had been fighting for the same cause.\"<ref>Grant, chapter XXXVIII, p. 38.</ref> But resentments lingered: allegedly tradition holds that the [[Fourth of July]] holiday was not celebrated by Vicksburg until [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This claim has been challenged because large Fourth of July celebrations were being held by 1907.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waldrep|first=Christopher|title=Vicksburg's Long Shadow: The Civil War Legacy Of Race And Remembrance |year=2005 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0742548688 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=esDgeo7QYJEC&pg=PA247 |page=247}}</ref><ref>Historian Michael G. Ballard, in his ''Vicksburg'' campaign history, pp. 420-21, claims that this story has little foundation in fact. Although it is unknown whether city officials sanctioned the day as a local holiday, Southern observances of July 4 were for many years characterized more by family picnics than by formal city or county activities.</ref>\nThe most significant result of the campaign was control of the Mississippi River, which the Union obtained completely after [[Battle of Port Hudson|Port Hudson]], which had been besieged by Banks since May 27, heard news of Vicksburg's fall and surrendered on July 9. The Confederacy was now cut in two; one week later, an unarmed ship arrived in Union-held New Orleans from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] after an uneventful trip down the river. President Lincoln announced, \"The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea.\"<ref>Ballard, p. 410.</ref>\n\nGrant deployed Sherman and 50,000 troops against Johnston's 31,000 in Jackson. Johnston tried to lure Sherman into a frontal assault, but Sherman had seen the results of such at Vicksburg. He demurred and began surrounding the city. Johnston escaped with his army, which was more than Pemberton had achieved, but all of central Mississippi was now under Sherman's control. He used a subsequent operation against [[Meridian, Mississippi]], as a harbinger of the [[scorched earth]] tactics he later employed in his [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] through [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and then [[Carolinas campaign|South Carolina]].\n\nOne of Grant's actions during the siege was to settle a lingering rivalry. On May 30, General McClernand wrote a self-adulatory note to his troops, claiming much of the credit for the soon-to-be victory. Grant had been waiting six months for him to slip, ever since they clashed early in the campaign, around the [[Battle of Arkansas Post]]. Grant finally relieved McClernand on June 18. McClernand's XIII Corps was turned over to Maj. Gen. [[Edward Ord]]. In May 1864, McClernand was restored to a command in remote [[Texas]].<ref>Bearss, vol. III, pp. 875\u201379; Ballard, pp. 358\u201359; Korn, pp. 147\u201348.</ref>\n\nGrant was the undisputed victor of the Vicksburg campaign. He was rewarded for his victory with a promotion to major general in the [[Regular Army (United States)|regular army]], effective on July 4, 1863. He also received an unusual letter:\n\n{{Quote|My dear General\n\nI do not remember that you and I ever met personally. I write this now as a grateful acknowledgment for the almost inestimable service you have done the country. I wish to say a word further. When you first reached the vicinity of Vicksburg, I thought you should do, what you finally did\u2014march the troops across the neck, run the batteries with the transports, and thus go below; and I never had any faith, except a general hope that you knew better than I, that the Yazoo Pass expedition, and the like, could succeed. When you got below, and took Port Gibson, Grand Gulf, and vicinity, I thought you should go down the river and join Gen. Banks; and when you turned Northward East of the Big Black, I feared it was a mistake. I now wish to make the personal acknowledgment that you were right, and I was wrong.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. Lincoln<ref>Smith, p. 257.</ref>}}\n\nGrant went on to rescue Union forces besieged at [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]] and then replaced Halleck as general in chief of all Union armies, with the recently re-activated rank of [[Lieutenant General (United States)|lieutenant general]]. Despite his ultimate success in winning the war, historians have often considered Vicksburg his finest campaign\u2014imaginative, audacious, relentless, and a masterpiece of maneuver warfare. [[James M. McPherson]] called Vicksburg \"the most brilliant and innovative campaign of the Civil War\"; [[T. Harry Williams]] described it as \"one of the classic campaigns of the Civil War and, indeed, of military history\"; and the U.S. Army ''[[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 100-5|Field Manual&nbsp;100\u20135]]'' (May&nbsp;1986) called it \"the most brilliant campaign ever fought on American soil\".<ref>Bonekemper, ''A Victor, Not a Butcher'', p. 83.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Steven E. Woodworth]] wrote that Pemberton \"had a strong claim to the title of the most hated man in the South, certainly the most hated to wear a Confederate uniform\". There were accusations that adequate supplies had been on hand and that it was only his treachery that caused the surrender. Even his friend, Confederate general [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]], wrote after the war that a large part of the population believed \"He had joined the South for the express purpose of betraying it, and this was clearly proven by the fact that he surrendered on the 4th of July, a day sacred to the Yankees.\"<ref>Woodworth, ''Jefferson Davis and His Generals'', p. 218.</ref><ref>David Zimring, ''To live and Die in Dixie: Native Northerners Who Fought for the Confederacy'', Univ Tennessee Press, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1621901068}}; p. 262.</ref>\n\nThe blame for losing Vicksburg fell not only on John Pemberton, but on the overcautious Joseph E. Johnston. Jefferson Davis said of the defeat, \"Yes, from a want of provisions inside and a General outside who wouldn't fight.\"<ref>McPherson, p. 637.</ref> Anguished soldiers and civilians starving in the siege held hopes that he would come to their aid, but he never did. Accusations of cowardice that had dogged him since the 1862 [[Peninsula Campaign]] continued to follow him in the 1864 [[Atlanta Campaign]] against Sherman. However, Johnston was far outnumbered. While he was one of few Confederate generals whom Grant respected, he was outgeneraled.\n\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:Grant Vicksburg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The monument to U.S. Grant at the national military park in Vicksburg, MS, unveiled in 1919]]\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|American Civil War}}\n* [[Troop engagements of the American Civil War, 1863]]\n* [[List of costliest American Civil War land battles]]\n* [[Armies in the American Civil War]]\n* [[Commemoration of the American Civil War]] \n* [[Commemoration of the American Civil War on postage stamps]]\n* [[Vicksburg National Military Park]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Ballard, Michael B.

{"title_page": "Forensic search", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2012}}\n{{essay-like|date=October 2014}}\n}}\n'''Forensic Search''' is an emerging field of [[Computer Forensics|computer forensics]]. Forensic Search focuses on user created data such as email files, cell phone records, office documents, PDFs and other files that are easily interpreted by a person.\n\nForensic Search differs from computer forensic analysis in that it does not seek to review or analyze the lower level system files such as [[Windows Registry|the registry]], link files or disk level issues more commonly associated with traditional computer forensic analysis.\n\n==Why Forensic Search==\n\nForensic Search has emerged due to a number of factors including:\n* Improvements in technologies to enable lesser qualified users to undertake search and analysis of data that would have previously been undertaken only by a computer forensic expert. (This trend can be seen in many industries).\n* A need to reduce the high cost of undertaking a full computer forensic analysis of a user's computer, when in most cases the evidence found in the user created data is most useful and all that is required.\n* The rise of [[Cloud computing]] which has seen a move away from data storage on local computer hardware to data storage in any number of remote locations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crawford |first=Stephanie |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/cloud-computing/files-safe-in-the-cloud.htm |title=HowStuffWorks \"Are my files really safe if I store them in the cloud?\" |publisher=Computer.howstuffworks.com |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>\n* A lack of qualified computer forensic experts\n* The need to address the backlog of cases in most policing agencies where computer-based information requires review.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2011/11/25/news/state/backlog-at-maine-computer-crimes-unit-keeps-child-pornographers-on-the-streets/ |title=Backlog at Maine Computer Crimes Unit keeps child pornographers on the streets \u2014 State \u2014 Bangor Daily News \u2014 BDN Maine |publisher=Bangordailynews.com |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Matrix Group International, Inc.

Data that is typically considered to be user created ESI is made up of emails, documents, pictures and other file types created by a user, as opposed to data created by the computer's operating system (i.e. registry files, link files, unallocated space.  These are controlled or created by the computer and not the user). The objective of reviewing the user created data is to find information that may be used to base decisions on as part of an investigation.\n\n==Advantages of Forensic Search Software==\n\nForensic Search software differs from using the native applications (e.g. Outlook) or [[desktop search]] software (e.g. [[Google Desktop]]) to search the data in that no changes are made to the data during processing or searching that may impact the results or skew the findings. Forensic Search software will also allow access to the base metadata of items not available via the native application. A good example of this would be the metadata in MS Word documents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computerbytesman.com/privacy/blair.htm |title=Microsoft Word bytes Tony Blair in the butt |publisher=Computerbytesman.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018075955/http://www.computerbytesman.com/privacy/blair.htm |archive-date=2012-10-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  A number of Forensic Search software products will be able to perform data recovery on a range of email file types.\n\nSome examples of how using the native application or non-forensic application can affect the data:\n* Opening a Microsoft Word document in Microsoft Word may change the created, modified or last accessed dates in the document. This could lead to the incorrect dates being supplied in evidence.\n* Reviewing data in some native applications will trigger the systems Antivirus, again changing data or altering evidence.\n* Failure to freeze the evidence prior to opening the files, coupled with the fact that merely opening the files changes them, can and has invalidated critical evidence.<ref>http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/program/law/08-732/Evidence/RyanShpantzer.pdf</ref>\n\n== Other Types of Review ==\n\nForensic Search software has been likened to [[eDiscovery]] review software, however this is not strictly the case. eDiscovery review software, while dealing with many of the same type of computer records and search options, offer extra functionality to that of Forensic Search software. Features such as redaction and legal hold are standard in eDiscovery review software. It is also the case that Forensic Search software does not meet with the higher end tasks outlined in the widely accepted Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM). Tasks such as Identification, Collection, Preservation or Presentation are generally not covered by Forensic Search software.\n\nHowever, true eDiscovery review is generally the domain of qualified legal practitioners or companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/ethics/legal_ethics/opinions/opinion362.cfm |title=Ethics Opinion 362: Non-lawyer Ownership of Discovery Service Vendors |publisher=Dcbar.org |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://it-lex.org/district-of-columbia-bar-ediscovery-vendors-with-non-lawyers-cant-practice-law/ |title=District of Columbia Bar: eDiscovery Vendors with Non-Lawyers Can't Practice Law |publisher=IT-Lex |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>\n\nThe use of the term eDiscovery has become a catchall in some circles for the processing and searching of Electronically Stored Information (ESI). However, this is not a true representation of the term of eDiscovery. For a more detailed understanding of eDiscovery, the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) is a [http://www.edrm.net/resources/edrm-stages-explained good guideline].\n\nIt could be said that Forensic Search is more closely related to [[Early case assessment|Early Case Assessment (ECA)]] than eDiscovery as ECA does not require the rigor of a full eDiscovery review.\n\n==Evidence Values of User Created Data Versus Other Types of Data==\n\nWhen presenting data as part of a report that may be used to form a decision or as evidence, it is important that the data be correctly represented so the reader can understand it.\n\nIn the case of generating reports on system created data such as registry files, link files and other system created data this can be a costly exercise. It can also be the case that there is no straightforward answer or explanation.\n\nAn example of this would be attempting to explain to a lay person the method and techniques of decoding the [http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/userassist/ UserAssist Key] in the Windows System Registry. The UserAssist key can hold a great deal of information about the actions of the user of the computer. However to explain this key, the reviewer has to be able to identify the key and correctly interpret the key setting. The keys are often encoded by ROT 13.\n\nOnce these keys are decoded to human readable formats, the reviewer then has to show how a setting relates to the case.  It is often time-consuming to review hundreds, even thousands, of settings that at times only deliver very circumstantial and sometimes contentious findings.\n\nWhen reviewing user created data such as e-mail or contracts, reporting and understanding the findings is often much more straight forward. The semi skilled user will usually have a good grasp of how email works as they use it in their day-to-day work. A legal person will understand a contract and does not need specialist forensic knowledge to do so. This can lead to much lower costs of review and less contentious or circumstantial findings.\n\n==High-Level Functionality of Forensic Search Software==\n\nThe features of Forensic Search software are focused on allowing the user to search and view a range of data and users\u2019 files at one time.\n\nSpecific features of Forensic Search software are:\n* The ability to process varying types of data enabling it to be searched by the reviewer with little or no computer forensic knowledge\n* Keyword searching across all data and data types processed\n* The ability to create complex searches such as including or excluding data\n* Using MD5 and other algorithms to search and identify files and data\n* The ability to filter based on metadata such as dates, email addresses and file types\n* The ability to review different data typed in the same search results\n* The ability to view all results in the same user interface\n* The ability to export items to various formats i.e. email, Word, HTML\n* The ability to create shareable reports\n\n==Changes in Computer Forensics==\n\nThere are many newer and emerging fields of computer forensics such as Cloud forensics, Mobile Phone forensics, Network forensics, Memory Analysis, Browser forensics, forensic triage and Internet forensics.<ref>[http://www.e-discovery.co.nz/blog/facilitating-a-forensic-search.html]</ref> In the not so distant past a computer forensic expert's most common role was to attend a person's house, place of work or data center to forensically [http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Category:Forensics_File_Formats 'image'] all computers or devices that may be involved in a case. This was categorized as the collection phase.\n\nOnce collection phase was complete these images were reviewed and the ESI that was relevant was supplied to the interested parties. This required the computer forensic investigator to have a good deal of experience and training in:\n* Identifying which computer, applications or devices may be involved\n* How to disassemble a computer and extract the hard drives of the computer without causing damage.\n* How to correctly take a forensic image to keep chain of custody\n* How to use the forensic analysis software to correctly interpret and supply the results\n\nThis process was time-consuming and costly.  The computer forensic expert's primary role is to investigate the computer evidence (ESI).  They may not have been as familiar with the entire case or objectives as that of the case agent, detective, forensic accountant or crime analyst. This often led to non-perfect or time-consuming identification of the correct evidence items between the differing parties. What would immediately flag the interest of a detective with a deep knowledge of the case and parties involved may go unnoticed by a computer forensic expert. An example would be an email from a suspect in another case to a suspect in this case, or contact / phone calls to a witness from a suspect.\n\nTo compound the issue, there has been a massive increase in the size of the data that the computer forensic expert needs to collect. It is now often the case that the computer hard drive is not able to be imaged, for example if the computer that contains the evidence is too big, or the system cannot be shut down to take an image as it is a mission critical server such as an email server or company file server. The rise of [[Cloud computing]] has also added challenges to the collection of evidence. The data that requires collection and review may reside in the Cloud. In this case there is no computer available to image.  The forensic expert then needs to collect the information using forensic software designed to work with certain Cloud providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-response.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=344:f-response-404-and-the-new-cloud-connector&catid=34:blog-posts |title=F-Response 4.0.4 and the new Cloud Connector |publisher=F-response.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn short the collection of evidence has changed significantly in the past few years. Recognizing these challenges, the concept of Hybrid Forensics has been discussed and the creation of tools that adopt a different approach to collecting data.

Forensic Search focuses on user created data such as email files, cell phone records, office documents, PDFs and other files that are easily interpreted by a person.\n\nForensic Search differs from computer forensic analysis in that it does not seek to review or analyze the lower level system files such as [[Windows Registry|the registry]], link files or disk level issues more commonly associated with traditional computer forensic analysis.\n\n==Why Forensic Search==\n\nForensic Search has emerged due to a number of factors including:\n* Improvements in technologies to enable lesser qualified users to undertake search and analysis of data that would have previously been undertaken only by a computer forensic expert. (This trend can be seen in many industries).\n* A need to reduce the high cost of undertaking a full computer forensic analysis of a user's computer, when in most cases the evidence found in the user created data is most useful and all that is required.\n* The rise of [[Cloud computing]] which has seen a move away from data storage on local computer hardware to data storage in any number of remote locations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Crawford |first=Stephanie |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/cloud-computing/files-safe-in-the-cloud.htm |title=HowStuffWorks \"Are my files really safe if I store them in the cloud?\" |publisher=Computer.howstuffworks.com |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>\n* A lack of qualified computer forensic experts\n* The need to address the backlog of cases in most policing agencies where computer-based information requires review.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2011/11/25/news/state/backlog-at-maine-computer-crimes-unit-keeps-child-pornographers-on-the-streets/ |title=Backlog at Maine Computer Crimes Unit keeps child pornographers on the streets \u2014 State \u2014 Bangor Daily News \u2014 BDN Maine |publisher=Bangordailynews.com |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Matrix Group International, Inc.

Data that is typically considered to be user created ESI is made up of emails, documents, pictures and other file types created by a user, as opposed to data created by the computer's operating system (i.e. registry files, link files, unallocated space.  These are controlled or created by the computer and not the user). The objective of reviewing the user created data is to find information that may be used to base decisions on as part of an investigation.\n\n==Advantages of Forensic Search Software==\n\nForensic Search software differs from using the native applications (e.g. Outlook) or desktop search software (e.g. Google desktop) to search the data in that no changes are made to the data during processing or searching that may impact the results or skew the findings. Forensic Search software will also allow access to the base metadata of items not available via the native application. A good example of this would be the metadata in MS Word documents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computerbytesman.com/privacy/blair.htm |title=Microsoft Word bytes Tony Blair in the butt |publisher=Computerbytesman.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018075955/http://www.computerbytesman.com/privacy/blair.htm |archive-date=2012-10-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  A number of Forensic Search software products will be able to perform data recovery on a range of email file types.\n\nSome examples of how using the native application or non-forensic application can affect the data:\n* Opening a Microsoft Word document in Microsoft Word may change the created, modified or last accessed dates in the document. This could lead to the incorrect dates being supplied in evidence.\n* Reviewing data in some native applications will trigger the systems Antivirus, again changing data or altering evidence.\n* Failure to freeze the evidence prior to opening the files, coupled with the fact that merely opening the files changes them, can and has invalidated critical evidence.<ref>http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/program/law/08-732/Evidence/RyanShpantzer.pdf</ref>\n\n== Other Types of Review ==\n\nForensic Search software has been likened to [[eDiscovery]] review software, however this is not strictly the case. eDiscovery review software, while dealing with many of the same type of computer records and search options, offer extra functionality to that of Forensic Search software. Features such as redaction and legal hold are standard in eDiscovery review software. It is also the case that Forensic Search software does not meet with the higher end tasks outlined in the widely accepted Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM). Tasks such as Identification, Collection, Preservation or Presentation are generally not covered by Forensic Search software.\n\nHowever, true eDiscovery review is generally the domain of qualified legal practitioners or companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcbar.org/for_lawyers/ethics/legal_ethics/opinions/opinion362.cfm |title=Ethics Opinion 362: Non-lawyer Ownership of Discovery Service Vendors |publisher=Dcbar.org |date=2012-01-12 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://it-lex.org/district-of-columbia-bar-ediscovery-vendors-with-non-lawyers-cant-practice-law/ |title=District of Columbia Bar: eDiscovery Vendors with Non-Lawyers Can't Practice Law |publisher=IT-Lex |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>\n\nThe use of the term eDiscovery has become a catchall in some circles for the processing and searching of Electronically Stored Information (ESI). However, this is not a true representation of the term of eDiscovery. For a more detailed understanding of eDiscovery, the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM) is a [http://www.edrm.net/resources/edrm-stages-explained good guideline].\n\nIt could be said that Forensic Search is more closely related to [[Early case assessment|Early Case Assessment (ECA)]] than eDiscovery as ECA does not require the rigor of a full eDiscovery review.\n\n==Evidence Values of User Created Data Versus Other Types of Data==\n\nWhen presenting data as part of a report that may be used to form a decision or as evidence, it is important that the data be correctly represented so the reader can understand it.\n\nIn the case of generating reports on system created data such as registry files, link files and other system created data this can be a costly exercise. It can also be the case that there is no straightforward answer or explanation.\n\nAn example of this would be attempting to explain to a lay person the method and techniques of decoding the [http://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/userassist/ UserAssist Key] in the Windows System Registry. The UserAssist key can hold a great deal of information about the actions of the user of the computer. However to explain this key, the reviewer has to be able to identify the key and correctly interpret the key setting. The keys are often encoded by ROT 13.\n\nOnce these keys are decoded to human readable formats, the reviewer then has to show how a setting relates to the case.  It is often time-consuming to review hundreds, even thousands, of settings that at times only deliver very circumstantial and sometimes contentious findings.\n\nWhen reviewing user created data such as e-mail or contracts, reporting and understanding the findings is often much more straight forward. The semi skilled user will usually have a good grasp of how email works as they use it in their day-to-day work. A legal person will understand a contract and does not need specialist forensic knowledge to do so. This can lead to much lower costs of review and less contentious or circumstantial findings.\n\n==High-Level Functionality of Forensic Search Software==\n\nThe features of Forensic Search software are focused on allowing the user to search and view a range of data and users\u2019 files at one time.\n\nSpecific features of Forensic Search software are:\n* The ability to process varying types of data enabling it to be searched by the reviewer with little or no computer forensic knowledge\n* Keyword searching across all data and data types processed\n* The ability to create complex searches such as including or excluding data\n* Using MD5 and other algorithms to search and identify files and data\n* The ability to filter based on metadata such as dates, email addresses and file types\n* The ability to review different data typed in the same search results\n* The ability to view all results in the same user interface\n* The ability to export items to various formats i.e. email, Word, HTML\n* The ability to create shareable reports\n\n==Changes in Computer Forensics==\n\nThere are many newer and emerging fields of computer forensics such as Cloud forensics, Mobile Phone forensics, Network forensics, Memory Analysis, Browser forensics, forensic triage and Internet forensics.<ref>[http://www.e-discovery.co.nz/blog/facilitating-a-forensic-search.html]</ref> In the not so distant past a computer forensic expert's most common role was to attend a person's house, place of work or data center to forensically [http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Category:Forensics_File_Formats 'image'] all computers or devices that may be involved in a case. This was categorized as the collection phase.\n\nOnce collection phase was complete these images were reviewed and the ESI that was relevant was supplied to the interested parties. This required the computer forensic investigator to have a good deal of experience and training in:\n* Identifying which computer, applications or devices may be involved\n* How to disassemble a computer and extract the hard drives of the computer without causing damage.\n* How to correctly take a forensic image to keep chain of custody\n* How to use the forensic analysis software to correctly interpret and supply the results\n\nThis process was time-consuming and costly.  The computer forensic expert's primary role is to investigate the computer evidence (ESI).  They may not have been as familiar with the entire case or objectives as that of the case agent, detective, forensic accountant or crime analyst. This often led to non-perfect or time-consuming identification of the correct evidence items between the differing parties. What would immediately flag the interest of a detective with a deep knowledge of the case and parties involved may go unnoticed by a computer forensic expert. An example would be an email from a suspect in another case to a suspect in this case, or contact / phone calls to a witness from a suspect.\n\nTo compound the issue, there has been a massive increase in the size of the data that the computer forensic expert needs to collect. It is now often the case that the computer hard drive is not able to be imaged, for example if the computer that contains the evidence is too big, or the system cannot be shut down to take an image as it is a mission critical server such as an email server or company file server. The rise of [[Cloud computing]] has also added challenges to the collection of evidence. The data that requires collection and review may reside in the Cloud. In this case there is no computer available to image.  The forensic expert then needs to collect the information using forensic software designed to work with certain Cloud providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-response.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=344:f-response-404-and-the-new-cloud-connector&catid=34:blog-posts |title=F-Response 4.0.4 and the new Cloud Connector |publisher=F-response.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn short the collection of evidence has changed significantly in the past few years. Recognizing these challenges, the concept of Hybrid Forensics has been discussed and the creation of tools that adopt a different approach to collecting data. The concept of Hybrid Forensics is the selective collection of data from 'live' systems in such a way that is may be considered as being reliable evidence in court.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dr. Richard Adams|date=2014-11-05|title=Fusing digital forensics, electronic discovery and incident response|url=https://www.slideshare.net/RichardAdams3/fusing-digital-forensics-electronic-discovery-and-aspects2}}</ref>\n\n==Barriers to the Adoption of Forensic Search in Law Enforcement==\n\nLaw enforcement organizations like many other organizations are divided into skill specific units.
