He is a member of the [[underground hip hop]] group [[Living Legends (group)|Living Legends]].\n\n==History==\nEligh's inspiration for making hip hop music came in the mid 1980s from the film ''[[Beat Street]]'' and [[LL Cool J]]'s \"[[I'm Bad]].\" In high school, he co-founded the hip hop duo Boogalu Badboys with [[Scarub]]. When they crossed paths with another rapper [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]], the three formed [[3 Melancholy Gypsys]] (3MG). Eligh then moved from Los Angeles up north to the [[Bay Area]], where he met [[The Grouch (rapper)|The Grouch]], which ultimately led to 3MG's incorporation into [[Living Legends (group)|Living Legends]].\n\nIn the mid and late 1990s, while simultaneously continuing to produce with [[Living Legends (group)|Living Legends]], Eligh released several self-pressed solo albums, such as ''As They Pass''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spidey.kfjc.org/?p=10212|title=Eligh - \"As They Pass\"|publisher=KFJC|author=abacus|date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> and ''[[Gas Dream]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gas-dream-mw0000107837|title=Gas Dream - Eligh|publisher=Allmusic|first=Matt|last=Conaway}}</ref> In the early 2000s, he released darker and more cryptic albums such as ''Poltergeist'' and ''Enigma''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/enigma-mw0000251167|title=Enigma - Eligh|publisher=Allmusic|first=Stewart|last=Mason}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Eligh took a break from music to confront his growing drug and alcohol addiction problems.

{"title_page": "Germani cisrhenani", "text_new": "{{short description|Group of tribes west of the Rhine river during classical times}}\n{{italic title}}\nThe '''''Germani cisrhenani''''' ([[Latin]]  ''[[:wikt:cis#Latin|cis-]][[:wikt:Rhenanus#Latin|rhenanus]]'' \"on this side of the Rhine\", referring to the Roman or western side), or \"'''Left bank Germani'''\".<ref name=wightman13/>, were a group of tribes who lived west of the [[Lower Rhine]] at the time of the [[Gallic Wars]] (mid-1st century BC).\n\nThe tribe is first described this way by [[Julius Caesar]], who was writing specifically about tribes near the [[Meuse]] river, who had settled among the [[Belgae]] before Roman intrusion into the area. Tribes who were certainly considered to be among the original ''Germani cisrhenani'' include the [[Eburones]], the [[Condrusi]], the [[Caeraesi]], the [[Segni (tribe)|Segni]] and the [[Paemani]], who collectively form a group which apparently later came to be referred to as [[Tungri]], in order to avoid confusion with other \"[[Germanic peoples|Germani]]\" once, by the time of [[Tacitus]], the term had been extended to include, or more strongly associated with, the vast area of [[Germania magna]] beyond the limits of the Roman Empire.\n\n==Name and terminology==\n{{see|Germani|Germania#Etymology}}\nStarting with Caesar, Roman historians described the Rhine as an important natural border between [[Gaul]] on the west, which became part of the [[Roman empire]], and the \"Germanic\" territories to the east. The ''Germani'' on the east side of the Rhine were considered to be living in their original homeland. So this land was referred to not only as \"''Germania Transrhenana,''\" (the opposite of cisrhenana) but also, for example by  [[Ptolemy]] and [[Strabo]], as ''Germania magna'', meaning \"Greater Germany.\" In contrast, the cisrhenane ''Germani'' were sometimes referred to as living in ''Germania cisrhenana'', but this territory was considered to also be part of Gaul, and later part of the Roman empire.\n\nIt is possible that the original ''Germani'' were, in modern terminology, [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking]], and not Germanic language-speaking. It is important to note that the name ''Germani'' in antiquity can not be assumed to imply linguistic unity, let alone the use of [[Germanic languages]] according to the modern definition of [[Indo-European languages|Indo-european]] languages which underwent [[Grimm's law|the first Germanic soudshift]].\n\nThe name ''Germani'' itself is assumed to be Celtic (Gaulish) in origin, and the tribal names grouped with the ''Germani cisrhenani'' seem to be Celtic as well, such as the [[Usipetes]] and [[Tencteri]], which may be grouped as either [[Gauls]] or [[Belgae]].

But it remains unclear which Belgic Gauls were considered ''Germani'' ancestry and which, if any, might have spoken a Germanic language.\n\nIn the list of Belgic nations given as being in arms are [[Bellovaci]], [[Suessiones]], [[Nervii]], [[Atrebates]], [[Ambiani]], [[Morini]], [[Menapii]], [[Caleti]], [[Velocasses]], and [[Veromandui]], who together make up a major part of all the Belgic nations.  When it comes to tribes in the extreme northeast of Gaul, against the Rhine, the [[Condrusi]], the [[Eburones]], the [[Caeraesi]], and the [[Paemani]], \"are called by the common name of Germans\" [''Germani'']. These ''Germani'' provided one joint force to the alliance, and apparently the number of men they committed was uncertain to the Remi.<ref name=\"GW2.4\" />  \nCaesar later added the [[Segni (tribe)|Segni]] to the list of tribes among the Belgae who went by the name of the ''Germani''.<ref name=\"GW6.32\">\"Gallic War\" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=6:chapter=32&highlight=segui 6.32]</ref> There is another group living close to these tribes, in the northeast, called the [[Aduatuci]], who descended from the above-mentioned Cimbri, but these are ''not'' referred to as Germani, even though their ancestry is clearly to the east of the Rhine also and \"Germanic\" in that sense.<ref>\"Gallic War\" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=2:chapter=29&highlight=Aduatuci 2.29]</ref>\n\nAfter the battle of the Sabis, which the Romans won, some Belgic tribes renewed fighting against the Romans in 54 BCE.  Caesar clearly differentiates between two types of remaining rebel groups: \"the Nervii, Aduatuci, and Menapii\" and with them \"the addition of all the Germans on this side of the Rhine.\"  Within this last group were the Eburones, whose king [[Ambiorix]] had become a major rebel leader.<ref>\"Gallic War\" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0001%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D2 6.2]</ref>\n\nWhen the Eburones were defeated, the Segni and Condrusi \"of the nation and number of the Germans [''Germani''], and who are between the Eburones and the Treviri, sent embassadors to Caesar to entreat that he would not regard them in the number of his enemies, nor consider that the cause of all the Germans on this side the Rhine [''omnium '''Germanorum''', qui essent '''citra Rhenum'''''] was one and the same; that they had formed no plans of war, and had sent no auxiliaries to Ambiorix\".<ref name=\"GW6.32\" />\n\nIn the time of Tacitus, long after Caesar claimed to have annihilated the name of the Eburones, the area where the Eburones had lived was inhabited by the [[Tungri]], but Tacitus claimed that this was not their original name:-\n{{quotation|The name Germany [''Germania''], on the other hand, they say, is modern and newly introduced, from the fact that the tribes which first crossed the Rhine and drove out the Gauls, and are now called Tungrians, were then called Germans [''Germani''].

Some believe he may have been the first to do so.\n\nApart from the ''Germani'' in this strict sense then, it is unclear to what extent if any that Caesar believed the other Belgae to have similar transrhenane ancestry. But in any case it is clear that he, like Tacitus, apparently makes a distinction between two types of ''Germani'', as shown by the above quotations where the Nervii, Aduatuci, and Menapii are both contrasted with the cisrhenane ''Germani'' such as the Eburones and the Condrusi. So in the northern Belgic region of Gaul, at least some of the other Belgic nations, apart from the group containing the Eburones and Condrusi, might or might not have been considered ''Germani'' in a broad sense. Tacitus on the other hand certainly knew of such claims, but expressed doubt about them, writing of two of the tribes most geographically and politically close to the ''Germani'', that the \"Treveri and Nervii are even eager in their claims of a German origin, thinking that the glory of this descent distinguishes them from the uniform level of Gallic effeminacy\".<ref name=germ28>\"Germania\" [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0083:chapter=28&highlight=nervii chapter 28]</ref>\n\n\nOne of the reasons (or excuses) for Caesar's interventions in Gaul in the first place was an apparent increase in movements of transrhenane peoples, attempting to enter Gaul, apparently due to major movements of people such as the [[Suevi]] deep in ''Germania''. Some of the ''Germani'' who Caesar mentions did stay in Gaul under its new Roman overlords. Apart from the [[Ubii]], [[Sicambri]] and [[Tencteri]] and [[Usipetes]] in Germania inferior, some others had attempted to cross to the west of the Rhine further south, but in that region of the Rhine, such crossing were apparently a new thing in his time.\n\n==Later history==\n[[File:RomanEmpire 117.svg|thumb|500px|Map of the Roman Empire and Magna Germania in the early 2nd century]]\nAlready during the Gallic Wars of Caesar, tribes of Germanic people were raiding over the Rhine, and many were eventually settled there. As Tacitus wrote, \"The Rhine bank itself is occupied by tribes unquestionably German,\u2014the [[Vangiones]], the [[Triboci]], and the [[Nemetes]]. Nor do even the [[Ubii]], though they have earned the distinction of being a Roman colony, and prefer to be called Agrippinenses, from the name of their founder, blush to own their origin.\"<ref name=germ28/> The tribes he mentions are all tribes mentioned by Caesar also, as having made attempts to cross the Rhine when he was in the area.\n\nThe Ubii, were in the north, the region of the Eburones, and became the people of the region of [[Cologne]] and [[Bonn]] during Roman imperial times. The other three tribes had been invaders on the upper Rhine, closer to modern Switzerland.\n\nThe [[Roman empire]] proceeded to form two new cisrhenane provinces named \"Germania\" on the Gaulish, western, side of the Rhine. \n*[[Germania Superior]] was the more southern of the two provinces of cisrhenane Germania. It had its capital at [[Mainz]] and included the area of modern [[Alsace]], and the corner of Switzerland, Germany and France.\n*[[Germania Inferior]] (\"lower Germany\") ran along the lower Rhine and had its capital on the German frontier in [[Cologne]]. It included modern [[Bonn]], [[Neuss]], [[Xanten]], [[Nijmegen]], and the [[Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta]]. Along the Rhine in Germania Inferior were not only the Ubii, but also other tribes who had crossed the Rhine into the empire, or were forcibly moved - the [[Cugerni]], sometimes proposed to be descendants of the [[Sugambri]], and the [[Batavians]] and [[Cananefates]], named by Tacitus as descendants of the [[Chatti]]. The origin of others such as the [[Marsacii]], [[Frisiavones]], [[Baetasii]], and [[Sunuci]] is less certain, but they are all thought to be Germanic. At some point, the ''[[Civitas Tungrorum]]'', the district of the Tungri, who lived where the supposed original ''Germani'' had lived, became part of Germania Inferior.\n\nSo the two Roman provinces named ''Germania'', both mainly on the west of the Rhine, gave an official form to the concept of ''Germani cisrhenani''.\n\nAs the empire grew older, new tribes arrived into ''Germania cisrhenana'', and these regions started to become more independent. By the time of the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|collapse]] of the empire's central power in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] (5th century), there is little doubt about the fact that all or most of these peoples were unified in their use of Germanic languages or dialects. \nThe ''cisrhenane Germani'' eventually ceased to be restricted to a band of occupation near the border, and all Roman provinces west of the Rhine were eventually conquered by Germanic tribes, speaking Germanic languages: the [[Franks]] ([[Germania inferior]], [[Francia]]), the [[Alemanni]] ([[Germania superior]], [[Alemannia]]), the [[Burgundians]] ([[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]]), the [[Visigoths]] ([[Visigothic Kingdom]]), and so on.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation|title=Gecheidenis van de Beide Limburgen|last=Jappe Alberts|year=1974|publisher=Van Gorcum|ref=none}}\n*{{Citation|last1=Lamarcq|last2=Rogge|first1=Danny|first2=Marc|title=De Taalgrens: Van de oude tot de nieuwe Belgen|publisher=Davidsfonds |year=1996|ref=none}}\n*{{Citation|first=Nico |last=Roymans| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfpKN-oMaWoC |title=Ethnic Identity and Imperial Power.

Tribes who were certainly considered to be among the original ''Germani cisrhenani'' include the [[Eburones]], the [[Condrusi]], the [[Caeraesi]], the [[Segni (tribe)|Segni]] and the [[Paemani]], who collectively form a group which apparently later came to be referred to as [[Tungri]], in order to avoid confusion with other \"[[Germanic peoples|Germani]]\" once, by the time of [[Tacitus]], the term had been extended to include, or more strongly associated with, the vast area of [[Germania magna]] beyond the limits of the Roman Empire.\n\n==Name and terminology==\n{{see|Germani|Germania#Etymology}}\nStarting with Caesar, Roman historians described the Rhine as an important natural border between [[Gaul]] on the west, which became part of the [[Roman empire]], and the \"Germanic\" territories to the east. The ''Germani'' on the east side of the Rhine were considered to be living in their original homeland. So this land was referred to not only as \"''Germania Transrhenana,''\" (the opposite of cisrhenana) but also, for example by  [[Ptolemy]] and [[Strabo]], as ''Germania magna'', meaning \"Greater Germany.\" In contrast, the cisrhenane ''Germani'' were sometimes referred to as living in ''Germania cisrhenana'', but this territory was considered to also be part of Gaul, and later part of the Roman empire.\n\nIt is possible that the original ''Germani'' were, in modern terminology, [[Celtic languages|Celtic-speaking]], and not Germanic language-speaking. It is important to note that the name ''Germani'' in antiquity can not be assumed to imply linguistic unity, let alone the use of [[Germanic languages]] according to the modern definition of [[Indo-european]] languages which underwent [[Grimm's law|the first Germanic soudshift]].\n\nThe name ''Germani'' itself is assumed to be Celtic (Gaulish) in origin, and the tribal names grouped with the ''Germani cisrhenani'' seem to be Celtic as well, such as the [[Usipetes]] and [[Tencteri]], which may be grouped as either [[Gauls]] or [[Belgae]]. The name of the [[Tungri]], on the other hand, has been interpreted as being genuinely Germanic. [[Jacob Grimm]] even suggested that ''Germani'' represents the Celtic translation of the Germanic tribal name ''Tungri''.<ref>Gustav Solling,\n''Diutiska, an historical and critical survey of the literature of Germany, from the earliest period to the death of G\u00f6the'' (1863), [https://books.google.com/books?id=W4ZaAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA3  p. 3].</ref>\n\nThe question of the possible presence of Germanic languages on the lower Rhine in the 1st century BC is limited to placename analyses, such as those of [[Maurits Gysseling]].\nAs for the historicity of Caesar's account of the arrival of the ''Germani'' from beyond the Rhine, Wightman (1985) distinguishes two main scenarios,\narrival in remote prehistory (as early as [[Urnfield]] times, long before the development of Germanic as a separate linguistic phylum, and predating the arrival of the [[Belgae]] with the spread of the [[La T\u00e8ne Culture]] after 500 BC), or derivation of both Belgae and Germani out of the \n[[Hunsr\u00fcck-Eifel culture]] found near the [[Moselle river]] (\"The left-bank Germans would then be people who went northward across the [[Ardennes]] rather than westwards to the [[Marne (river)|Marne]]\")<ref name=wightman13/>\n\n==Gallic Wars==\nThe earliest surviving record referring to ''Germani'' is [[Julius Caesar]]'s account of the ''[[Gallic War]]'', the \"''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''\".

By the time of the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|collapse]] of the empire's central power in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]] (5th century), there is little doubt about the fact that all or most of these peoples were unified in their use of Germanic languages or dialects. \nThe ''cisrhenane Germani'' eventually ceased to be restricted to a band of occupation near the border, and all Roman provinces west of the Rhine were eventually conquered by Germanic tribes, speaking Germanic languages: the [[Franks]] ([[Germania inferior]], [[Francia]]), the [[Alemanni]] ([[Germania superior]], [[Alemannia]]), the [[Burgundians]] ([[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]]), the [[Visigoths]] ([[Visigothic Kingdom]]), and so on.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation|title=Gecheidenis van de Beide Limburgen|last=Jappe Alberts|year=1974|publisher=Van Gorcum|ref=none}}\n*{{Citation|last1=Lamarcq|last2=Rogge|first1=Danny|first2=Marc|title=De Taalgrens: Van de oude tot de nieuwe Belgen|publisher=Davidsfonds |year=1996|ref=none}}\n*{{Citation|first=Nico |last=Roymans| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfpKN-oMaWoC |title=Ethnic Identity and Imperial Power.

Wesley was raised by his pacifist mother after they were abandoned by his father, causing him to grow up into a wimp. All this changes when he is visited by the Fox, an assassin who shoots everyone in a sandwich shop before revealing herself to be a member of the Fraternity, a powerful organization of supervillains that rules the world. So long as they maintain secrecy, they are able to commit any crime without any consequences. The Fraternity wishes to recruit Wesley to replace his father, a supervillain known as the Killer, who was killed by an unknown assassin.\n\nThe Fox introduces Wesley to Professor Solomon Selzer, a brilliant mad scientist and leader of the North and South American chapter of the Fraternity. The Professor helps Wesley realize his powers by provoking him into shooting the wings off flies. The Professor explains that a long time ago, the world was overrun by both superheroes and supervillains. Tired of being repeatedly defeated and jailed, the supervillains joined together and staged a revolution that Wesley's father was a part of. After a long, bloody war, the superheroes were defeated. Using magic and advanced technology, the newly formed Fraternity was able to erase the world's memories of superheroes and supervillains. All that remained were faint, inaccurate memories, which were the cause of superhero [[comic books]] and other media. Many of the surviving heroes now believed themselves to be actors who had played superheroes.\n[[File:4.25.13MarkMillarByLuigiNovi42.jpg|thumb|left|Writer [[Mark Millar]] signing a copy of the book during an appearance at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan.]]\nThe Professor also explains to Wesley that Fox and his father had once worked for Mr. Rictus, who controlled the Australian chapter of the Fraternity. When Rictus visits the Professor's headquarters, Fox implies that she and the Killer left Rictus' chapter because he had been harming children.\n\nThe Fraternity begins training Wesley to use his newfound powers. The training focuses on not just his physical skills but on his personality. He is desensitized to violence and eventually learns to enjoy it. He is told to commit random acts of violence before undertaking acts of revenge on anyone who even slightly wronged him. He soon becomes a full-fledged Fraternity member, accompanying them on raids of alternate universes and other missions.\n\nWesley is assigned to be the Professor's personal bodyguard during a Fraternity convention in which the leaders of the Fraternity's five chapters will meet. The five leaders are the Professor, Mr. Rictus, Adam-One, the Future, and the Emperor. Here, he learns that Rictus and the Future had long wanted to end the Fraternity's policy of secrecy and rule the world openly. The Professor, Adam-One, and the Emperor favored secrecy for supervillains in order to get \"the loot without the leg-breaking\" and avoid gaining the attention of the larger multiverse, and have always managed to outvote Rictus and the Future. Though it seems that the Emperor is about to switch sides, the Professor subtly manipulates him to vote in favor of secrecy yet again.\n\nAfter the meeting, the Professor leaves in a limo hoping to pick up a child prostitute. However, his driver is actually being impersonated by Shithead, Rictus's right-hand man, and the Professor is murdered by him. Rictus and Future's factions of the Fraternity begin a revolt against the other three. With most of the Professor's supervillains killed, Wesley and Fox must fight off the rival factions on their own. They manage to kill off many of the rebel supervillains, including the Future. This culminates in an attack on their own headquarters, occupied by Rictus and his gang. Defeating Rictus and deflecting a bullet through his throat, Wesley demands to know who killed his father but Rictus refuses to answer (or is simply unable to) before he dies. A figure steps out of the shadows revealing himself to be Wesley's father, the original Killer. The Killer reveals that he and Fox left Rictus's chapter not because they objected to harming children but because they knew of his planned revolt. The Killer also says that his skills have been deteriorating with age and he does not want to be killed by anyone inferior to him. After Wesley's training, the Killer believes that he is the only one worthy of ending his life and orders Wesley to put a bullet through his head. Afterwards, Wesley indicates that he wants to return to his former life and stop being a super villain. However, he reveals to Fox shortly after that he was just joking, and they go off to plan another heist. The comic ends with Wesley calling out the audience about their \"pathetic\" lives, and stating: \"This is my face when I'm fucking you in the ass.\"\n\n==Main characters==\n<!-- Please stop adding in who you think these characters resemble. Original research is not allowed. -->\n\n===The American Fraternity===\n*'''The Killer (II)''' - Wesley Gibson, the protagonist of the series.\n*'''The Fox''' - Wesley's mentor and lover.

Wesley was raised by his pacifist mother after they were abandoned by his father, causing him to grow up into a wimp. All this changes when he is visited by the Fox, an assassin who shoots everyone in a sandwich shop before revealing herself to be a member of the Fraternity, a powerful organization of supervillains that rules the world. So long as they maintain secrecy, they are able to commit any crime without any consequences. The Fraternity wishes to recruit Wesley to replace his father, a supervillain known as the Killer, who was killed by an unknown assassin.\n\nThe Fox introduces Wesley to Professor Solomon Selzer, a brilliant mad scientist and leader of the North and South American chapter of the Fraternity. The Professor helps Wesley realize his powers by provoking him into shooting the wings off flies. The Professor explains that a long time ago, the world was overrun by both superheroes and supervillains. Tired of being repeatedly defeated and jailed, the supervillains joined together and staged a revolution that Wesley's father was a part of. After a long, bloody war, the superheroes were defeated. Using magic and advanced technology, the newly formed Fraternity was able to erase the world's memories of superheroes and supervillains. All that remained were faint, inaccurate memories, which were the cause of superhero [[comic books]] and other media. Many of the surviving heroes now believed themselves to be actors who had played superheroes.\n[[File:4.25.13MarkMillarByLuigiNovi42.jpg|thumb|left|Writer [[Mark Millar]] signing a copy of the book during an appearance at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan.]]\nThe Professor also explains to Wesley that Fox and his father had once worked for Mr. Rictus, who controlled the Australian chapter of the Fraternity. When Rictus visits the Professor's headquarters, Fox implies that she and the Killer left Rictus' chapter because he had been harming children.\n\nThe Fraternity begins training Wesley to use his newfound powers. The training focuses on not just his physical skills but on his personality. He is desensitized to violence and eventually learns to enjoy it. He is told to commit random acts of violence before undertaking acts of revenge on anyone who even slightly wronged him. He soon becomes a full-fledged Fraternity member, accompanying them on raids of alternate universes and other missions.\n\nWesley is assigned to be the Professor's personal bodyguard during a Fraternity convention in which the leaders of the Fraternity's five chapters will meet. The five leaders are the Professor, Mr. Rictus, Adam-One, the Future, and the Emperor. Here, he learns that Rictus and the Future had long wanted to end the Fraternity's policy of secrecy and rule the world openly. The Professor, Adam-One, and the Emperor favored secrecy for supervillains in order to get \"the loot without the leg-breaking\" and avoid gaining the attention of the larger multiverse, and have always managed to outvote Rictus and the Future. Though it seems that the Emperor is about to switch sides, the Professor subtly manipulates him to vote in favor of secrecy yet again.\n\nAfter the meeting, the Professor leaves in a limo hoping to pick up a child prostitute. However, his driver is actually being impersonated by Shithead, Rictus's right-hand man, and the Professor is murdered by him. Rictus and Future's factions of the Fraternity begin a revolt against the other three. With most of the Professor's supervillains killed, Wesley and Fox must fight off the rival factions on their own. They manage to kill off many of the rebel supervillains, including the Future. This culminates in an attack on their own headquarters, occupied by Rictus and his gang. Defeating Rictus and deflecting a bullet through his throat, Wesley demands to know who killed his father but Rictus refuses to answer (or is simply unable to) before he dies. A figure steps out of the shadows revealing himself to be Wesley's father, the original Killer. The Killer reveals that he and Fox left Rictus's chapter not because they objected to harming children but because they knew of his planned revolt. The Killer also says that his skills have been deteriorating with age and he does not want to be killed by anyone inferior to him. After Wesley's training, the Killer believes that he is the only one worthy of ending his life and orders Wesley to put a bullet through his head. Afterwards, Wesley indicates that he wants to return to his former life and stop being a super villain. However, he reveals to Fox shortly after that he was just joking, and they go off to plan another heist. The comic ends with Wesley calling out the audience about their \"pathetic\" lives, and stating: \"This is my face when I'm fucking you in the ass.\"\n\n==Main characters==\n<!-- Please stop adding in who you think these characters resemble.

Then in the bottom of the inning, [[Max Muncy]] walked against [[Nathan Eovaldi]], advanced to second on a pop out to N\u00fa\u00f1ez in foul territory (Nu\u00f1ez made a great catch and tumbled into the stands after making the catch, which allowed Muncy to advance) and then scored the tying run after an infield hit by [[Yasiel Puig]] and a throwing error by [[Ian Kinsler]]. In the bottom of the fifteenth, Muncy appeared to hit a walk-off home run down the right-field line but the ball hooked foul. Muncy hit a [[walk-off home run]] off Eovaldi in the 18th inning to win it for the Dodgers, 3\u20132, to cut their series deficit to 2\u20131.

Standing there from about 170 to 50 BC was a Late [[Iron Age]], Late [[Celts|Celtic]] fortification complex, or ''[[castellum]]'', of the [[Treveri]], a people of mixed [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] stock, from whom the [[Latin]] name for the city of [[Trier]], ''[[History of Trier|Augusta Treverorum]]'', is also derived. This hill castle was first laid out as a lightly fortified settlement on the heights and only later given strong walls. The last traces of human presence there vanished in the mid 1st century BC. It is said to be the most thoroughly explored complex of its kind.<ref>Alfred Haffner: ''Die Altburg von Bundenbach im s\u00fcdlichen Hunsr\u00fcck.'' In: Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier: ''Trier. Augustusstadt der Treverer.'' Philipp von Zabern, Mainz 1984, {{ISBN|3-8053-0792-6}}.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the exploratory digs, the Altburg has been partly restored to its form in the 1st century BC, and has been expanded into a unique, [[Protohistory|protohistoric]] [[open-air museum]]. The ''Freilichtmuseum Altburg'' was dedicated and opened to the public in 1988.\n\nBundenbach's founding may be placed in the earlier half of the 10th century. It had its first documentary mention, though, in a [[Waldgrave|Waldgravial]] partition document on 14 March 1283. The Waldgraves had the forest cleared and thereby gained freehold land for themselves. This was named ''Beunde''. The settlement on the ''Beunde'', which also lay on a brook (''Bach'' in [[German language|German]]), thereby got its name: Bundenbach.\n\nMentioned much nearer the presumed founding date, however, was the Schmidtburg, the [[Waldgrave]]s\u2019 ancestral seat in the Hahnenbach valley. This first cropped up in history in 1084. Bundenbach was always bound to the Schmidtburg, even after the childless Waldgrave Heinrich von der Schmidtburg enfeoffed [[Electorate of Trier|Archbishop and Elector of Trier]] [[Baldwin of Luxembourg|Baldwin]] in 1324 with the Schmidtburg and the villages belonging to it. From 1330 to 1794, Bundenbach belonged to the [[Electorate of Trier|Electoral-Trier]] ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of Schmidtburg.\n\nThe Schmidtburg, which actually lies within [[Schneppenbach]]\u2019s limits, was thoroughly repaired between 1981 and 1987. It is among the Hunsr\u00fcck\u2019s oldest castles.\n\nPolitically, after the ''Amt'' of Schmidtburg was dissolved and after its short time in the [[France|French]] [[Cantons of France|canton]] of Rhaunen in [[Napoleon]]ic times, from 1817 to 1937 Bundenbach was part of the Grand Duchy and Free State of [[Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]], and more locally to the Principality (later Province) of Birkenfeld. In the course of administrative restructuring in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], Bundenbach passed from the ''Amt'' of Herrstein to the ''Verbandsgemeinde'' [[Herrstein-Rhaunen]] in the [[Birkenfeld (district)|Birkenfeld]] district (and also in the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Koblenz, although Rhineland-Palatinate abolished ''Regierungsbezirke'' in 1999) in 1970.\n\nBundenbach is  known internationally for its [[slate]] mining and important fossil finds. The use of slate in the Bundenbach area has a demonstrably long history: the Celtic hill castle\u2019s defensive wall was built of slate quarrystones. The first slate mining lease agreement is witnessed on [[Saint Walpurga]]\u2019s Day 1519: The Lords of Wiltberg leased their ''\u201cLaienkaul unden an Prorschitt uff der Bach gelegen\u201d'' (\u201c''Laienkaul'' down below at [[Bruschied]], lying on the brook\u201d) for four years to, among others, the two Bundenbach residents Peter and Niklas Huppen.\n\nIn 1865 21 slate mines still existed within Bundenbach's limits. In 2000, open-cast slate mining came to an end at Bundenbach's last slate pit. Since then, only slates delivered from elsewhere have been worked.\n\nAnother mine, the Herrenberg slate pit near the Altburg and opposite the Schmidtburg, first mentioned in 1822, ceased operations in 1964. Eleven years later, a private initiative by Bundenbach residents was begun to open this mine as a tourist attraction. It was dedicated and opened to the public in 1976. It was later expanded with the addition of a fossil museum that displays noteworthy pieces along with old photographs and equipment.<ref>[http://www.hunsnet.de/bundenbach/home/index.php3?spr=ge Bundenbach\u2019s history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331145706/http://www.hunsnet.de/bundenbach/home/index.php3?spr=ge |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hunsnet.de/bundenbach/home/history.php3?spr=ge Bundenbach\u2019s history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331145732/http://www.hunsnet.de/bundenbach/home/history.php3?spr=ge |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Municipal council===\nThe council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by [[proportional representation]] at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:<ref>[http://wahlen.rlp.de/kw/wahlen/2009/gemeinderatswahlen/ergebnisse/1340401700.html Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat]</ref>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"300\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\"\n| &nbsp; || [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] || WGR || '''Total'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2009 || 5 || 7 || 12 seats\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2004 || 9 || 7 || 16 seats\n|}\n\n===Mayor===\nBundenbach's mayor is Klaus Hartmann.<ref>[http://www.vg-rhaunen.de/index.php?ModID=9&object=tx%7c2.3.1&FID=283.35.1&NavID=1999.72&La=1 Bundenbach\u2019s mayor]</ref>\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe German blazon reads: ''In gespaltenem Schild vorne in Blau ein mit drei schwarzen Kugeln belegtes silbernes Buch schr\u00e4g, hinten in Silber ein rotes Balkenkreuz.''\n\nThe municipality's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might in English [[Heraldry|heraldic]] language be described thus: Per pale azure a book bendwise argent charged with three roundels sable and argent a cross gules.\n\nThe [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is [[Saint Nicholas]]\u2019s attribute, thus representing the municipality\u2019s and the church\u2019s patron saint.

Standing there from about 170 to 50 BC was a Late [[Iron Age]], Late [[Celts|Celtic]] fortification complex, or ''[[castellum]]'', of the [[Treveri]], a people of mixed [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] stock, from whom the [[Latin]] name for the city of [[Trier]], ''[[History of Trier|Augusta Treverorum]]'', is also derived. This hill castle was first laid out as a lightly fortified settlement on the heights and only later given strong walls. The last traces of human presence there vanished in the mid 1st century BC. It is said to be the most thoroughly explored complex of its kind.<ref>Alfred Haffner: ''Die Altburg von Bundenbach im s\u00fcdlichen Hunsr\u00fcck.'' In: Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier: ''Trier. Augustusstadt der Treverer.'' Philipp von Zabern, Mainz 1984, {{ISBN|3-8053-0792-6}}.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the exploratory digs, the Altburg has been partly restored to its form in the 1st century BC, and has been expanded into a unique, [[Protohistory|protohistoric]] [[open-air museum]]. The ''Freilichtmuseum Altburg'' was dedicated and opened to the public in 1988.\n\nBundenbach's founding may be placed in the earlier half of the 10th century. It had its first documentary mention, though, in a [[Waldgrave|Waldgravial]] partition document on 14 March 1283. The Waldgraves had the forest cleared and thereby gained freehold land for themselves. This was named ''Beunde''. The settlement on the ''Beunde'', which also lay on a brook (''Bach'' in [[German language|German]]), thereby got its name: Bundenbach.\n\nMentioned much nearer the presumed founding date, however, was the Schmidtburg, the [[Waldgrave]]s\u2019 ancestral seat in the Hahnenbach valley. This first cropped up in history in 1084. Bundenbach was always bound to the Schmidtburg, even after the childless Waldgrave Heinrich von der Schmidtburg enfeoffed [[Electorate of Trier|Archbishop and Elector of Trier]] [[Baldwin of Luxembourg|Baldwin]] in 1324 with the Schmidtburg and the villages belonging to it. From 1330 to 1794, Bundenbach belonged to the [[Electorate of Trier|Electoral-Trier]] ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of Schmidtburg.\n\nThe Schmidtburg, which actually lies within [[Schneppenbach]]\u2019s limits, was thoroughly repaired between 1981 and 1987. It is among the Hunsr\u00fcck\u2019s oldest castles.\n\nPolitically, after the ''Amt'' of Schmidtburg was dissolved and after its short time in the [[France|French]] [[Cantons of France|canton]] of Rhaunen in [[Napoleon]]ic times, from 1817 to 1937 Bundenbach was part of the Grand Duchy and Free State of [[Duchy of Oldenburg|Oldenburg]], and more locally to the Principality (later Province) of Birkenfeld. In the course of administrative restructuring in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], Bundenbach passed from the ''Amt'' of Herrstein to the ''Verbandsgemeinde'' [[Herrstein-Rhaunen]] in the [[Birkenfeld (district)|Birkenfeld]] district (and also in the ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'' of Koblenz, although Rhineland-Palatinate abolished ''Regierungsbezirke'' in 1999) in 1970.\n\nBundenbach is  known internationally for its [[slate]] mining and important fossil finds. The use of slate in the Bundenbach area has a demonstrably long history: the Celtic hill castle\u2019s defensive wall was built of slate quarrystones. The first slate mining lease agreement is witnessed on [[Saint Walpurga]]\u2019s Day 1519: The Lords of Wiltberg leased their ''\u201cLaienkaul unden an Prorschitt uff der Bach gelegen\u201d'' (\u201c''Laienkaul'' down below at [[Bruschied]], lying on the brook\u201d) for four years to, among others, the two Bundenbach residents Peter and Niklas Huppen.\n\nIn 1865 21 slate mines still existed within Bundenbach's limits. In 2000, open-cast slate mining came to an end at Bundenbach's last slate pit. Since then, only slates delivered from elsewhere have been worked.\n\nAnother mine, the Herrenberg slate pit near the Altburg and opposite the Schmidtburg, first mentioned in 1822, ceased operations in 1964. Eleven years later, a private initiative by Bundenbach residents was begun to open this mine as a tourist attraction. It was dedicated and opened to the public in 1976. It was later expanded with the addition of a fossil museum that displays noteworthy pieces along with old photographs and equipment.<ref>[http://www.hunsnet.de/bundenbach/home/index.php3?spr=ge Bundenbach\u2019s history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331145706/http://www.hunsnet.de/bundenbach/home/index.php3?spr=ge |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hunsnet.de/bundenbach/home/history.php3?spr=ge Bundenbach\u2019s history] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331145732/http://www.hunsnet.de/bundenbach/home/history.php3?spr=ge |date=March 31, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n\n===Municipal council===\nThe council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by [[proportional representation]] at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.\n\nThe municipal election held on 7 June 2009 yielded the following results:<ref>[http://wahlen.rlp.de/kw/wahlen/2009/gemeinderatswahlen/ergebnisse/1340401700.html Kommunalwahl Rheinland-Pfalz 2009, Gemeinderat]</ref>\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"300\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" align=\"center\"\n| &nbsp; || [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] || WGR || '''Total'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2009 || 5 || 7 || 12 seats\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2004 || 9 || 7 || 16 seats\n|}\n\n===Mayor===\nBundenbach's mayor is Klaus Hartmann.<ref>[http://www.vg-rhaunen.de/index.php?ModID=9&object=tx%7c2.3.1&FID=283.35.1&NavID=1999.72&La=1 Bundenbach\u2019s mayor]</ref>\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe German blazon reads: ''In gespaltenem Schild vorne in Blau ein mit drei schwarzen Kugeln belegtes silbernes Buch schr\u00e4g, hinten in Silber ein rotes Balkenkreuz.''\n\nThe municipality's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might in English [[Heraldry|heraldic]] language be described thus: Per pale azure a book bendwise argent charged with three roundels sable and argent a cross gules.\n\nThe [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is [[Saint Nicholas]]\u2019s attribute, thus representing the municipality\u2019s and the church\u2019s patron saint.

She is known internationally for sculptural works and installations created from plastic debris, primarily from marine and coastal environments, as a primary material. Much of her work includes community-based research, such as carbon or plastic audits, as well as collaborative art creation. \n\nIn 2013, Longobardi was awarded The Hudgens Prize <ref>https://thehudgens.org/hudgens-prize/</ref> and in 2014, she earned the title Distinguished University Professor of Art at [[Georgia State]], and was named  Artist-in-Residence of the [[Oceanic Society]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title=Drifters Project |url=http://www.oceanicsociety.org/projects/drifters-project |website=The Oceanic Society}}</ref> In 2019, she was appointed Regents\u2019 Professor by the Board of Regents for the State of Georgia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pam Longobardi Awarded Regents' Professorship |url=https://news.gsu.edu/2019/06/28/pam-longobardi-awarded-regents-professorship/ |website=gsu.edu News Hub |publisher=Georgia State University |accessdate=3/31/2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nPam Longobardi grew up in New Jersey,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://globaljournalist.org/2019/04/turning-ocean-garbage-into-advocacy-art/ |title = Turning ocean garbage into advocacy art|date = 2019-04-25}}</ref> the child of an ocean lifeguard and a Delaware state diving champion, and credits her parents' relationship to the water with her own scientific and artistic interests.

Ocean drift is, today, primarily plastic. Longobardi has collected this drift plastic to create abstract sculptures and installations.  One iteration of The Drifters Project was displayed at the 2009 [[Venice Biennale]], at the ARTE VISIVI collateral exhibitions. In 2010, Edizione Charta (Milan, NY) produced a photo-essay book entitled Drifters: Plastics, Pollution, Personhood that included photographs and essays by Longobardi and three other writers.<ref>https://openlibrary.org/books/OL26052308M/Drifters_Plastics_Pollution_And_Personhood</ref>\n\n\"All these things collapse for me in the drifting ocean plastic object: it IS an artifact of my specific human evolutionary time; it IS made from petroleum that is the fossil sunlight and ancient plants, animals and yes, dinosaurs, that roamed the past Earth; it IS a biological raft for invasive creatures; it IS a toxic floating time bomb that is changing the human and animal body and the very ocean itself; and it IS a future fossil of the Anthropocene.\"<ref name=\"Jeffery interview\"/>\n\nIn 2013 Longobardi was selected to be lead artist in the GYRE Expedition, an art-science research expedition that assembled a team of notable marine scientists, journalists, filmmakers and artists to trawl remote Alaskan coastlines and to document collaboratively the impacts of plastic pollution on these delicate ecosystems. Her colleagues on the expedition included chief exhibition scientist Carl Safina, artist Mark Dion, filmmaker J.J. Kelly, photographer Andy Hughes, and others: all of these are featured, along with Longobardi, in a twenty-minute National Geographic film, ''GYRE'', which aired in 2013.
