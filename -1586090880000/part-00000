Gann's Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator (1946), in which Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, and 103\u00b0 is also where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were on that day.]]\nOne of the most controversial techniques that Gann used is that he converted the price directly to zodiac degrees.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> For example, if a commodity is trading at $120 per share, he would convert it to 120\u00b0 of the zodiac, which is 0\u00b0 Leo. If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0. Therefore, it will become 0\u00b0 Aries in the zodiac.\n\nHere is an example from a private letter to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" /> \n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n** Using a scale of one point to one degree, 8729\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 24 + 89\u00b0, and 89\u00b0 is 29\u00b0 Gemini. \n** Using a scale of 30 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/30 = 291\u00b0, and 291\u00b0 is 21\u00b0 Capricorn. \n** Using a scale of 12 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/12 = 727.5\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 2 + 7.5\u00b0, and 7.5\u00b0 is 7\u00b030\u2019 Aries. \n** Using a scale of one cent (100 points) to one degree, 8729\u00b0/100 = 87.29\u00b0, and 87.29\u00b0 is 27\u00b017\u2019 Gemini\n\n=== Gann angles ===\n{{main|Gann angles}}\nGann described the use of angles in the [[stock market]] in ''The Basis of My Forecasting Method'' (1935).

D. Gann|300x300px]]Very similar to the Spiral Chart, the Hexagon Chart is also a matrix of consecutive natural numbers, but the difference is that it starts with 0 in the central point, and the numbers spiral out in the form of a hexagon instead a square.<ref name=\":3\" /> The spiral direction in Gann's original course is also counterclockwise, because of its astrological overlay.<ref name=\":4\" /> Mathematically, the numbers in each additional layer represent the [[hexagonal number]]s, which are the number of distinct dots consisting of the outlines of regular hexagons.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wonders of Numbers: Adventures in Mathematics, Mind, and Meaning|last=Pickover|first=Clifford A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0195157994|location=New York: NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, it is found that Gann used the following method to overlay planetary positions on the Hexagon Chart:<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n* The axis going from 0 to 1,11, 28, and so on are 60\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 2, 10, 24, and so on are 120\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 3, 12, 27, and so on are 180\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 4, 14, 30, and so on are 240\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 5, 16, 33, and so on are 300\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]].\n* The axis going from 0 to 6, 18, 36, and so on are 0\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]].\n\nAgain, the above mathematical relationship could be demonstrated by this mathematical formula:<ref name=\":18\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Integers on the cardinal angles (60\u00b0\u00d7) of the Hexagon Chart\n!{{diagonal split header|Layer|Degree}}\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |60\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |120\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |180\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |240\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |300\u00b0\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50pt\" |360\u00b0\n|-\n!1\n|1\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|5\n|6\n|-\n!2\n|8\n|10\n|12\n|14\n|16\n|18\n|-\n!3\n|21\n|24\n|27\n|30\n|33\n|36\n|-\n!4\n|40\n|44\n|48\n|52\n|56\n|60\n|-\n!5\n|65\n|70\n|75\n|80\n|85\n|90\n|-\n!n\n|3n\u00b2\u22122n\n|3n\u00b2\u2212n\n|3n\u00b2\n|3n\u00b2+n\n|3n\u00b2+2n\n|3(n\u00b2+n)\n|}\n\n===== Mathematical formula of the Hexagon Chart =====\nLike the Spiral Chart, there are two methods of calculation.<ref name=\":13\" /> The first one is simpler not as accurate as the second one.\n\n====== Method 1 ======\nSimilar to the Spiral Chart, for any natural number P>1, its approximate angular value A (in degrees) is given by:\n\nA\u209a = MOD[210\u00d7P<sup>\u00bd</sup>\u2212180,360]\u00b0\n\nFor example, from the Hexagon Chart, it is known that the angular value of 44 is 120\u00b0.

For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

D. Gann's Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator (1946), in which Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, and 103\u00b0 is also where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were on that day.]]\nOne of the most controversial techniques that Gann used is that he converted the price directly to zodiac degrees.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" /> For example, if a commodity is trading at $120 per share, he would convert it to 120\u00b0 of the zodiac, which is 0\u00b0 Leo. If the price makes a [[Astrological aspect|major aspect]] (e.g. conjunction, trine, square, etc.), then it is believed that the price will reach a short-term top or bottom.\n\nWhen a price, after converting into a degree in the longitude, is in aspect with the planets, the trend is likely to change. For example, in Mechanical Method and Trend Indicator,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trading Systems and Methods|last=Kaufman|first=Perry J.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2013|isbn=9781118043561|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}</ref> Gann drew attention to the price level (\u00a2103) on 16 April 1925, \u201cApr 16 low 103, down 79\u00bd cents from 182\u00bd and nearing $1.00 per bushel, a natural support level\u2014Time to watch for change in trend.\u201d<ref name=\":19\" /> Coincidentally, 103\u00b0 (or 13\u00b0 Cancer) was where the heliocentric Mars and Pluto were in conjunction on that day.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Nautical Almanac And Astronomical Ephemeris for the Year 1925|last=Commissioners Of Longitude|first=|publisher=The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|year=1922|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nGann also used scales other than 1 dollar or point per 1 degree.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=http://ganntrade6.com/wp-content/uploads/Coffee.pdf|title=May Coffee Santos D|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|date=19 Mar 1954|website=|access-date=14 Feb 2018}}</ref> Two notable scales are $12 and $30 to one degree, because the two largest planets in the solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, take approximately 12 and 30 years to orbit the Sun respectively.<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example again, it would become 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0, which are 10\u00b0 and 4\u00b0 Aries in terms of zodiac. Gann also uses a scale of $0.07 ($1/15) to 1 degree, which is based on the Earth's rotation in 24 hours (for 24 times 15\u00b0 is 360\u00b0).<ref name=\":2\" /> Using $120 as an example, $120 times 15 will be 1800\u00b0, and when it is divided by 360\u00b0, the remainder is 0. Therefore, it will become 0\u00b0 Aries in the zodiac.\n\nHere is an example from a private letter to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" /> \n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n** Using a scale of one point to one degree, 8729\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 24 + 89\u00b0, and 89\u00b0 is 29\u00b0 Gemini. \n** Using a scale of 30 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/30 = 291\u00b0, and 291\u00b0 is 21\u00b0 Capricorn. \n** Using a scale of 12 points to one degree, 8729\u00b0/12 = 727.5\u00b0 = 360\u00b0 \u00d7 2 + 7.5\u00b0, and 7.5\u00b0 is 7\u00b030\u2019 Aries. \n** Using a scale of one cent (100 points) to one degree, 8729\u00b0/100 = 87.29\u00b0, and 87.29\u00b0 is 27\u00b017\u2019 Gemini\n\n=== Gann angles ===\n{{main|Gann angles}}\nGann described the use of angles in the [[stock market]] in ''The Basis of My Forecasting Method'' (1935).

The most important angle Gann called the 1x1 or the 45\u00b0 angle, which he said represented one unit of price for one unit of time. When one draws a perfect square and then draw a diagonal line from one corner of the square to the other, it illustrates the concept of the 1x1 angle which moves up one point per day.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxYA1U7JZ6oC&pg=PA26&dq=%27%27The+Basis+of+My+Forecasting+Method%27%27+gann&client=firefox-a\n|title=Forecasting profits using price & time\n|last=Gately\n|first=Edward\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=1998\n|accessdate=2009-03-25\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fibonacci Analysis|last=Brown|first=Constance M.|publisher=Bloomberg Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1576602614|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHere is an example from a private letter of Gann to a client on the coffee market:<ref name=\":5\" />\n* The high in the May Coffee Santos D on 19 March 1954 was 8729.\n* The low on 16 April 1932 was 435.

For example, as stated above, corn is sensitive to Venus and Saturn.\n# Look for a date when the planetary combinations ruling the commodity makes a major [[astrological aspect]], like opposition, trine and square.\n# Overlay the Spiral or Hexagon Chart onto the horoscope in the following way:\n#* On the Spiral Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 1, 2, 11, 28, 53 and so on.\n#* On the Hexagon Chart, 0\u00b0 Aries shall align with the axis of 0, 6, 18, 36, 60 and so on.\n# Find the current price on the Spiral or Hexagon Chart. For example, $36 is roughly at 135\u00b0 on the Spiral Chart, and at 0\u00b0 on the Hexagon Chart.\n# See if the price makes any aspect to the planetary combination:\n#* If the combination involves Jupiter, then compare the angle of the price to Jupiter;\n#* Else, compare to the outer planet of the two.\n#* In the case of Venus-Saturn, since Jupiter is not involved, the price is compared against Saturn.\n# If the price makes an important aspect to Jupiter or the outer planet, then a turning point may have been reached.\n#* The important aspects in the Spiral Chart are the multiples of 45\u00b0 and 120\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 315\u00b0.\n#* The important aspects in the Hexagon Chart are the multiples of 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, i.e. 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 300\u00b0\n# By repeated experimentation, the trader can determine with chart (Spiral or Hexagon) works better on which commodity, and so forth.\n\nHere are a few actual trading examples in Corn given by Gann in ''How to Make Profits Trading in Commodities: A Study of the Commodity Market''.<ref name=\":6\" /> As stated earlier, Gann thought that the price of corn was influenced by the aspects of Venus and Saturn, thus the angle of the price on the Hexagon Chart is compared against Saturn.

The first one is that, when a planet returns to its position during a recent eclipse, then trend is likely to change.<ref name=\":3\" /> The second way is that when a planet crosses an eclipse spot which happens during a market top or bottom, then the down or up move will accelerate.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Planetary averages ===\nGann maintained two formulas for calculating planetary averages.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The first one is called the Mean of Five (MOF), which is arithmetic mean of the geocentric and heliocentric longitudes of the outer five planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The other is called the Cycle of Eight (COE), which include all eight planets in its calculation, using both geocentric and heliocentric longitudes (the Sun replaces the Earth in the geocentric calculation). He thinks that when these averaged values make an aspect to the price, it will create support or resistance.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Personal view on religion ==\nEven though Gann was thought to be \u201creligious\u201d,<ref name=\":1\" /> a careful analysis of his writings finds that he did not agree with the conventional Christian teachings. On page 99 to 100 of his novel ''[[The Tunnel Thru the Air; Or, Looking Back from 1940|The Tunnel Thru the Air]]'' (1927),<ref name=\":0\" /> Gann revealed some of his personal believes towards religion through a conversation between the protagonist, Robert Gordon, and his mother:\n\n\u201cShe talked to Robert of his future and told him she hoped he would be a preacher. Robert confided to her that he could never be an orthodox minister, for he could not preach and teach the things which the orthodox ministers were teaching. He did not believe in a personal devil or believe in Hell, but believed in a God of Love and Justice. He did not believe that God would inflict upon any of his children eternal punishment but thought that whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap and that we receive our reward here upon earth.\n\n\u201cHe told her that the Bible plainly said that the kingdom of heaven is within us and he believed it. If we kept our conscience clear and did unto others as we would like to have them do unto us, he believed we would find our heaven and our reward here upon earth. Said that times and conditions were changing rapidly; that the new inventions and discoveries caused men to think differently than in the old days; that the old religious ideas would pass away and give place to more liberal, advanced ideas. He hoped to live to see the day when men would not only be too proud to fight, but would be too full of love for their fellowman to settle disputes with the sword. This was God's plan and it would come to pass this way, and he believed that he could be a great power for peace and hoped to live to see a world of peace with all nations united under one kingdom and one God, the God of Love and Justice.\u201d\n\nTwenty-three years later, on page 21 of his book ''The Magic Word'' (1950),<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Magic Word|last=Gann|first=William Delbert|publisher=Lambert Gann|year=1950|isbn=|location=Pomeroy, WA|pages=}}</ref> he expressed similar ideas:\n\n\u201cThe Bible is simple when rightly understood. It teaches the Divine Law, its uses and abuses. Whether a law is divine or natural, it is made plain that if you disobey the law, you must pay the penalty and if you obey or follow the law, your reward is certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible does not teach reward after death but promises reward or a reaping now while you are here on this earth. Jesus said, \u2018As ye sow, also shall ye reap.\u2019 He did not say \u2018after death\u2019 but here and now. Too many have preached that we should live a life of sacrifice here on earth and wait until after death to receive the reward. This is not what people want. They want something practical. They want to receive their reward here on earth. If they put forth the right effort, they want to know that they will receive the reward here on earth.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll natural laws teach and prove that we do get our reward on this earth. Job obeyed the law and got twice as much as he had while he was still on earth. There is nothing in the Bible that says these laws will not work today and I shall prove by the Bible that they do.\u201d\n\n== Controversy ==\nThere has been a general disagreement whether Gann himself made profits by speculation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moneystockstycoons.com/articles/w-d-gann-fraud-or-trading-genius-part-2/|title=W.D.

All three of the men were from Charleston.\n\nIn 1904, the [[College of Charleston]] was a small, [[municipal college]]. The all-male college was the first municipal college in the country, and the thirteenth oldest educational institution in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cofc.edu/about/historyandtraditions/briefhistory.php|title=A Brief History of the College - College of Charleston|website=www.cofc.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref>  The school had a campus literary society called the Chrestomathics, which held activities such as debates. The college's monthly magazine was staffed by the officers of the Chrestomathics, forming the equivalent of a modern-day student government.\n\nThe three men set a goal to obtain officer positions within the Chrestomathic Literary Society. At that time, the organization was dominated by the three chapters of national fraternities on campus. All fraternity men were sworn to vote for their candidates, making it virtually impossible for any non-fraternity men to win election.\n\nKroeg, Mixson, Fogarty, and a group of their friends, all non-fraternity men, began forming an opposition party. Several meetings were held at Mixson's home on Wentworth Street leading to the formation of Nu Phi, which stood for \"non-fraternity.\" The group of 15 men developed an opposing slate and began campaigning. Nu Phi adopted the outline of a hand as its secret symbol. A sketched hand on a classroom chalkboard signified an upcoming meeting. Inside the hand was written the meeting time and the host's last name.\n\nThe Nu Phi group assigned a member to kidnap those who might vote for the fraternity ticket on election day. However, the Nu Phi ticket lost the elections. Later, it was revealed that several disloyal members cast their votes for the opposing fraternity slate. Kroeg, determined to see his friends have a chance at winning elections, decided that the only way to gain the influence of the fraternity men on campus was to begin his own fraternity.<ref name=nonfraternity>{{cite web\n|title = Non fraternity\n|url= http://www.pikapp.org/flash/history/non_fraternity.swf|publisher= Pi Kappa Phi\n|accessdate=2007-12-17\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030010346/http://www.pikapp.org/flash/history/non_fraternity.swf\n|archivedate=2008-10-30\n|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Founding===\n\n[[Image:Kroeg.png|thumb|left|98px|Andrew Alexander Kroeg, Jr.]]\nOn December 10, 1904, a meeting of the loyal Nu Phis was held at Fogarty's home at 90 Broad Street to establish a new fraternity. There were seven men in attendance at the meeting: Kroeg, Fogarty, Mixson, Anthony Pelzer Wagener, Thomas F. Mosimann, Theodore (\"Teddy\") Barnwell Kelley, and James Fogarty (Simon's younger brother). All of the original members were students at the college and had grown up together in Charleston.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\nWagener, who was a student of Greek and Latin, recommended the letters Pi Kappa Phi and their secret meaning as the official new name of the group. Simon proposed the design of the fraternity's pin, a black enamel diamond with the Greek letters \u03a0\u039a\u03a6 engraved in gold with a star and lamp as additional elements. Kroeg was selected as the new chapter's first president, which was termed \"[[Archon]]\", from the Greek term. He then began work on a constitution for chapter. The group quickly set out to recruit new members to its ranks.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\nOn December 10, 1905, the first anniversary of the fraternity's founding, Mixson's mother cooked the men a special dinner in her home to celebrate a successful first year as a fraternity. The fraternity celebrate that date as \"Founders Day\" with a dinner or a similar ceremony. In 1906 Mixson and Wagener wrote the fraternity's initiation ritual as the \"highest ideals of Christian manhood\".<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\n===Expansion===\nThat same year, the group was offered a charter from another U.S. fraternity. Instead, they chose to expand and create more Pi Kappa Phi chapters. A second chapter (\"Beta Chapter\") was formed at [[Presbyterian College]] on March 9, 1907. Due to a state law banning fraternities at state supported schools, Presbyterian College and the College of Charleston were the only two South Carolina schools where fraternities were allowed. A third chapter was formed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which was the first chapter to obtain a house.\n\nKroeg developed \"Articles of Incorporation\" and the name Pi Kappa Phi became legally registered in the state of [[South Carolina]] on December 23, 1907.\n\nThe interest in Pi Kappa Phi within South Carolina was growing despite laws and policies banning fraternities. In 1909, Delta Chapter at [[Furman University]] formed and operated in secret until state laws changed, allowing fraternal organizations. In 1910, a charter was granted to Sigma Chapter at the [[University of South Carolina]] and the chapter was operated as the Sigma Club due to the laws banning fraternities.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\n===The ''Star and Lamp''===\n''The Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity Journal'' was begun in 1909, with Henry Wagener as editor. In 1911, the name was changed to the ''Star & Lamp''.<ref name=\"nonfraternity\"/>\n\n==Controversies==\nIn 2019, several members of the fraternity at [[Texas State University]] brutally attacked a fellow student they mistakenly assumed was a member of their rival fraternity on campus [[Phi Kappa Psi]], leaving him with a fractured skull and a traumatic brain injury.  As a result, the fraternity was placed on suspension, some members are facing criminal charges, and the attacked student filed a lawsuit against the fraternity.<ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/texas-state-fraternity-arrest/index.html</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the fraternity at [[Central Michigan University]] was suspended indefinitely by the university for failure to adhere to previous sanctions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sheffield|first1=Paige|title=Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity suspended indefinitely|url=http://www.cm-life.com/article/2017/11/pi-kappa-phi|accessdate=December 15, 2017|work=Central Michigan Life|date=November 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2017, the Alpha chapter at the [[College of Charleston]] was suspended by the college following a probe investigating allegations of drug and alcohol use, hazing, and the alleged beating of a student.

All three of the men were from Charleston.\n\nIn 1904, the [[College of Charleston]] was a small, [[municipal college]]. The all-male college was the first municipal college in the country, and the thirteenth oldest educational institution in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cofc.edu/about/historyandtraditions/briefhistory.php|title=A Brief History of the College - College of Charleston|website=www.cofc.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}</ref>  The school had a campus literary society called the Chrestomathics, which held activities such as debates. The college's monthly magazine was staffed by the officers of the Chrestomathics, forming the equivalent of a modern-day student government.\n\nThe three men set a goal to obtain officer positions within the Chrestomathic Literary Society. At that time, the organization was dominated by the three chapters of national fraternities on campus. All fraternity men were sworn to vote for their candidates, making it virtually impossible for any non-fraternity men to win election.\n\nKroeg, Mixson, Fogarty, and a group of their friends, all non-fraternity men, began forming an opposition party. Several meetings were held at Mixson's home on Wentworth Street leading to the formation of Nu Phi, which stood for \"non-fraternity.\" The group of 15 men developed an opposing slate and began campaigning. Nu Phi adopted the outline of a hand as its secret symbol. A sketched hand on a classroom chalkboard signified an upcoming meeting. Inside the hand was written the meeting time and the host's last name.\n\nThe Nu Phi group assigned a member to kidnap those who might vote for the fraternity ticket on election day. However, the Nu Phi ticket lost the elections. Later, it was revealed that several disloyal members cast their votes for the opposing fraternity slate. Kroeg, determined to see his friends have a chance at winning elections, decided that the only way to gain the influence of the fraternity men on campus was to begin his own fraternity.<ref name=nonfraternity>{{cite web\n|title = Non fraternity\n|url= http://www.pikapp.org/flash/history/non_fraternity.swf|publisher= Pi Kappa Phi\n|accessdate=2007-12-17\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030010346/http://www.pikapp.org/flash/history/non_fraternity.swf\n|archivedate=2008-10-30\n|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Founding===\n\n[[Image:Kroeg.png|thumb|left|98px|Andrew Alexander Kroeg, Jr.]]\nOn December 10, 1904, a meeting of the loyal Nu Phis was held at Fogarty's home at 90 Broad Street to establish a new fraternity. There were seven men in attendance at the meeting: Kroeg, Fogarty, Mixson, Anthony Pelzer Wagener, Thomas F. Mosimann, Theodore (\"Teddy\") Barnwell Kelley, and James Fogarty (Simon's younger brother). All of the original members were students at the college and had grown up together in Charleston.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\nWagener, who was a student of Greek and Latin, recommended the letters Pi Kappa Phi and their secret meaning as the official new name of the group. Simon proposed the design of the fraternity's pin, a black enamel diamond with the Greek letters \u03a0\u039a\u03a6 engraved in gold with a star and lamp as additional elements. Kroeg was selected as the new chapter's first president, which was termed \"[[Archon]]\", from the Greek term. He then began work on a constitution for chapter. The group quickly set out to recruit new members to its ranks.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\nOn December 10, 1905, the first anniversary of the fraternity's founding, Mixson's mother cooked the men a special dinner in her home to celebrate a successful first year as a fraternity. The fraternity celebrate that date as \"Founders Day\" with a dinner or a similar ceremony. In 1906 Mixson and Wagener wrote the fraternity's initiation ritual as the \"highest ideals of Christian manhood\".<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\n===Expansion===\nThat same year, the group was offered a charter from another U.S. fraternity. Instead, they chose to expand and create more Pi Kappa Phi chapters. A second chapter (\"Beta Chapter\") was formed at [[Presbyterian College]] on March 9, 1907. Due to a state law banning fraternities at state supported schools, Presbyterian College and the College of Charleston were the only two South Carolina schools where fraternities were allowed. A third chapter was formed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], which was the first chapter to obtain a house.\n\nKroeg developed \"Articles of Incorporation\" and the name Pi Kappa Phi became legally registered in the state of [[South Carolina]] on December 23, 1907.\n\nThe interest in Pi Kappa Phi within South Carolina was growing despite laws and policies banning fraternities. In 1909, Delta Chapter at [[Furman University]] formed and operated in secret until state laws changed, allowing fraternal organizations. In 1910, a charter was granted to Sigma Chapter at the [[University of South Carolina]] and the chapter was operated as the Sigma Club due to the laws banning fraternities.<ref name=nonfraternity />\n\n===The ''Star and Lamp''===\n''The Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity Journal'' was begun in 1909, with Henry Wagener as editor. In 1911, the name was changed to the ''Star & Lamp''.<ref name=\"nonfraternity\"/>\n\n==Controversies==\nIn 2019, several members of the fraternity at [[Texas State University]] brutally attacked a fellow student they mistakenly assumed was a member of their rival fraternity on campus [[Phi Kappa Psi]], leaving him with a fractured skull and a traumatic brain injury.  As a result, the fraternity was placed on suspension, some members are facing criminal charges, and the attacked student filed a lawsuit against the fraternity.<ref>https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/17/us/texas-state-fraternity-arrest/index.html</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the fraternity at [[Central Michigan University]] was suspended indefinitely by the university for failure to adhere to previous sanctions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sheffield|first1=Paige|title=Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity suspended indefinitely|url=http://www.cm-life.com/article/2017/11/pi-kappa-phi|accessdate=December 15, 2017|work=Central Michigan Life|date=November 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2017, the Alpha chapter at the [[College of Charleston]] was suspended by the college following a probe investigating allegations of drug and alcohol use, hazing, and the alleged beating of a student.

Each year this society was composed of boys who were interested in conditions which would help to keep up the standard of morals on the campus and the high ideals for which the school stands. The majority of the boys having graduated training school and continued to college, and decided on March 15, 1925 to discontinue their organization as a training school society and unite in forming a new secret society to be known as the Aztecs. Twelve members made up the charter roll of this new fraternity. They were: Robert L. Taylor, Robert Clark, Wendell Collums, Grant Collar, William Huddleston, Howard Perrin, Louis Moles, Marvin Crittenden, Jeff Shemwell, Doyle Patton, Lester Adair, and Evan Douglas.\n\nIn 1927, the college allowed fraternities to assume Greek letter names. The name Aztec was dropped for the name Phi Lambda Chi, in 1930. The college faculty, in 1934, voted to allow the fraternities on campus to nationalize. However, it was five years later that Phi Lambda Chi would nationalize. The group preferred to continue under its own name and with its old organization, which had over 300 alumni.\n\nOn January 19, 1939, Phi Lambda Chi voted to nationalize and elected a provisional Grand Council with Troy Jones, Faculty Advisor, as provisional National President. This provisional National Council authorized to grant charters to new chapters and to set up a provisional constitution. It was authorized to govern the national fraternity until such time as there might be three chapters in existence when it was to call a national convention.\n\nThe provisional National Council was instructed to develop the fraternity as a national fraternity along lines that would qualify it for admission into the Association of Teachers College Fraternities. This council voted to charter to the local Phi Lambda Chi to become the Alpha chapter of the national fraternity and at once began to make contacts with groups at other colleges. The fraternity established a national magazine and named it \"The Aztec\" in honor of the local organization from which it was derived.\n\nThe first conclave was held March 15\u201316, 1940, at the Arkansas State Teachers College (now the [[University of Central Arkansas]]), the home of the Alpha chapter. At this meeting the pouring of the national foundation was completed with the setting up of permanent constitutional and administrative machinery.\n\n==Symbols==\nFlower: White Carnation\n\nColors: Blue and Gold\n\nMascot: Lion\n\n==  Chapters of Phi Lambda Chi==\nBold Greek Letters indicate active\n*Alpha - [[University of Central Arkansas]] (1925)\n*'''Beta''' - [[Northeastern State University]] (1939)\n*'''Gamma''' - [[University of Arkansas-Monticello]] (1940)\n*Delta - [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] (1941)\n*'''Epsilon''' - [[Henderson State University]] (1946)\n*Zeta - [[Pittsburg State University]] (1950)\n*Eta - [[University of Central Oklahoma]]\n*Theta - [[University of Arkansas-Little Rock]]\n*Iota - [[Northwest Missouri State University]]\n*Kappa - [[Northwestern Oklahoma State University]] (1960)\n*Lambda - [[Truman State University]] (1969)\n*'''Mu''' - [[Arkansas Tech University]] (1976)\n*'''Nu''' - [[Southern Arkansas University]] (1977)\n*Xi - [[Lincoln University (Missouri)]] (1991)\n*Pi - [[Louisiana State University Shreveport]] (2009)\n*'''Rho''' - [[Keene State College]] (2014)\n*'''Sigma''' - [[University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma]] (1994)\n*'''Tau ''' - [[Texas A&M University-Texarkana]] (2013)\n*'''Phi''' - [[Lindenwood University]] (2017)\n*Chi - [[Cameron University]] (2005)\n\n==The Founders of Phi Lambda Chi==\n*Dr. Robert L.

The group preferred to continue under its own name and with its old organization, which had over 300 alumni.\n\nOn January 19, 1939, Phi Lambda Chi voted to nationalize and elected a provisional Grand Council with Troy Jones, Faculty Advisor, as provisional National President. This provisional National Council authorized to grant charters to new chapters and to set up a provisional constitution. It was authorized to govern the national fraternity until such time as there might be three chapters in existence when it was to call a national convention.\n\nThe provisional National Council was instructed to develop the fraternity as a national fraternity along lines that would qualify it for admission into the Association of Teachers College Fraternities. This council voted to charter to the local Phi Lambda Chi to become the Alpha chapter of the national fraternity and at once began to make contacts with groups at other colleges. The fraternity established a national magazine and named it \"The Aztec\" in honor of the local organization from which it was derived.\n\nThe first conclave was held March 15\u201316, 1940, at the Arkansas State Teachers College (now the [[University of Central Arkansas]]), the home of the Alpha chapter. At this meeting the pouring of the national foundation was completed with the setting up of permanent constitutional and administrative machinery.\n\n==Symbols==\nFlower: White Carnation\n\nColors: Blue and Gold\n\nMascot: Lion\n\n==  Chapters of Phi Lambda Chi==\nBold Greek Letters indicate active\n*Alpha - [[University of Central Arkansas]] (1925)\n*'''Beta''' - [[Northeastern State University]] (1939)\n*'''Gamma''' - [[University of Arkansas-Monticello]] (1940)\n*Delta - [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] (1941)\n*'''Epsilon''' - [[Henderson State University]] (1946)\n*Zeta - [[Pittsburg State University]] (1950)\n*Eta - [[University of Central Oklahoma]]\n*Theta - [[University of Arkansas-Little Rock]]\n*Iota - [[Northwest Missouri State University]]\n*Kappa - [[Northwestern Oklahoma State University]] (1960)\n*Lambda - [[Truman State University]] (1969)\n*'''Mu''' - [[Arkansas Tech University]] (1976)\n*'''Nu''' - [[Southern Arkansas University]] (1977)\n*Xi - [[Lincoln University (Missouri)]] (1991)\n*Pi - [[Louisiana State University Shreveport]] (2009)\n*'''Rho''' - [[Keene State College]] (2014)\n*'''Sigma''' - [[University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma]] (1994)\n*'''Tau ''' - [[Texas A&M University-Texarkana]] (2013)\n*'''Phi''' - [[Lindenwood University]] (2017)\n*Chi - [[Cameron University]] (2005)\n\n==The Founders of Phi Lambda Chi==\n*Dr. Robert L.
