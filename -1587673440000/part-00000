Based on the [[Machete (character)|eponymous character]] from the [[Spy Kids (franchise)|''Spy Kids'' franchise]], the film is an expansion of a fake trailer of the same name published as a part of the promotion of Rodriguez's and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 2007 ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' double-feature. ''Machete'' continues the [[B movie]] and exploitation style of ''Grindhouse'', and includes some of the footage from the original.<ref name=\"AutoMR-4\"/>\n\nThe film stars [[Danny Trejo]] reprising the title role from the ''Spy Kids'' series and the fake trailer, and co-stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Steven Seagal]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Cheech Marin]] and [[Jeff Fahey]]. This was Trejo's first lead role as the character, and Seagal's first theatrically released film since 2002's ''[[Half Past Dead]]''. ''Machete'' was released in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]] and Rodriguez's company, [[Troublemaker Studios]], on September 3, 2010.<ref name=\"AutoMR-5\"/> A sequel, ''[[Machete Kills]]'', directed by Rodriguez alone, was released on October 11, 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Mexico, [[Machete (character)|Machete Cortez]] ([[Danny Trejo]]), a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] ''[[Federales|Federal]]'' and his younger partner are on a mission to rescue a kidnapped girl. During the operation, his partner is killed, the kidnapped girl stabs him in the leg before being killed herself, and Machete is betrayed by his corrupt Chief to the powerful drug lord and former Federal, Rogelio Torrez ([[Steven Seagal]]), who kills Machete's wife and implies that he will kill his daughter before leaving him for dead.\n\nThree years later, a down-and-out Machete roams [[Texas]], scraping by on yard work. Michael Booth ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a local businessman and [[spin doctor]], explains to Machete that corrupt [[Texas Senate|Texas State Senator]] John McLaughlin ([[Robert De Niro]]) is sending hundreds of illegal immigrants out of the country, which would reduce the number of laborers. In order to stop this, Booth offers Machete $150,000 to kill McLaughlin. Machete accepts the murder contract after Booth threatens to kill him if he does not.\n\nMachete trains a rifle on McLaughlin from a rooftop during a rally, but before he fires he sees one of Booth's henchmen aiming at him. The henchman shoots Machete in the shoulder, then shoots McLaughlin in the leg. It is revealed that Booth orchestrated the attempted assassination as part of a [[false flag]] operation to gain public support for McLaughlin's secure border campaign. By setting up Machete as the gunman, the conspirators make it appear that an outlaw illegal Mexican immigrant has tried to assassinate the senator, who is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration.\n\nAn injured Machete escapes capture by Booth and is taken to a hospital to be treated for wounds, escaping once again from Booth's henchmen at the hospital. Agent Sartana Rivera ([[Jessica Alba]]), a persistent [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agent, is sent by her superior to find and capture the injured Machete. Machete, with the help of Luz ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), aka Sh\u00e9, the leader of an illegal immigrant aid movement known as the Network, recruits Padre ([[Cheech Marin]]), his \"holy\" brother. To take revenge on Booth, Machete kidnaps Booth's wife June and his daughter April ([[Lindsay Lohan]]), after \"starring\" in an amateur adult film with them. He also collects evidence from Booth's house linking McLaughlin and Torrez in a major [[drug trafficking]] deal. After encountering Machete, Sartana begins to develop an interest in him. Elsewhere, Booth, who is revealed to be working for Torrez, hires a hitman, Osiris Amanpour ([[Tom Savini]]), to assist in the hunt for Machete. A group of border vigilantes, sponsored by McLaughlin and led by Von Jackson ([[Don Johnson]]), begin attacking anyone who may be harboring Machete and shoot Luz in the right eye.\n\nBooth and Osiris lead a raid on the church. Padre kills their henchmen before the two incapacitate him and kill him by nailing him to a cross, but do not find Booth's wife and daughter. Unbeknownst to Booth, the church has cameras. Through the [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] recordings, the news of McLaughlin's corruption and faked assassination is eventually aired on national television. Infuriated, McLaughlin kills Booth and heads back to join Torrez and Jackson to kill Machete. In order to eliminate the people who double-crossed him, Machete gathers the Mexican Network and leads them to the base of the border vigilantes. When McLaughlin arrives at the base, Jackson turns on him for being involved with the Mexican drug trade and attempts to execute him, but is interrupted when Machete and the illegals arrive.\n\nDuring this confrontation, the Mexican illegals triumph over the border vigilantes. Jackson tries to escape, but Luz, who survived and now sports an eye patch, shoots him in the back of the head. Machete fights Torrez and stabs him, who then scornfully kills himself through [[Seppuku]]. April shows up wearing a nun's habit after escaping from the church and shoots McLaughlin after figuring out that he has killed her father.\n\nMcLaughlin, injured, manages to escape, but he is later killed by the last remnants of his own border vigilante group, who mistake him for a Mexican. Machete meets with Sartana, who gives him a green card, but he rejects it, saying he's already a legend. They kiss and ride off into the night. The closing credits announce further adventures for Machete.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as [[Machete (character)|Machete Cortez]], \"a legendary ex-Federale with a deadly attitude and the skills to match\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/>\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Luz/Sh\u00e9, \"a taco-truck lady with a revolutionary heart\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/>\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Senator John McLaughlin, a politician campaigning to incite hatred against illegal immigrants.<ref name=\"AutoMR-6\"/>\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Sartana Rivera, \"a beautiful Immigrations officer torn between enforcing the law and doing what is popular in the eyes of her familia.\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/> Alba also portrays Sartana's twin sister in deleted scenes only.\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as Rogelio Torrez, a drug lord, as well as Machete's former partner with the Federales<ref name=\"AutoMR-8\"/>\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as Michael Booth, \"a ruthless businessman with an endless payroll of killers\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/>\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Padre Benicio Del Toro, Machete's brother, \"a priest who's good with [[blessing]]s, but better with guns\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/>\n* [[Don Johnson]] as Von Jackson, \"a twisted border [[vigilante]] leading a small army.\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/> The character was originally known as \"Lt.

He says, \"When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] or [[Charles Bronson]], putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete'. So I decided to do that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature\".<ref name=\"AutoMR-11\"/> Rodriguez stated, \"There weren't any action movies that with a Latin flavor that could play to a broad audience. When I watched [director] [[John Woo]]'s movies, they made me want to be Asian. Woo and [actor] [[Chow Yun-Fat]]'s ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' and ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'' really inspired me to make films that would create that feeling in the Latin arena\".<ref name=\"blogs1\"/>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in ''Desperado''. \"So I wrote him this idea of a [[Federales|federale]] from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes [[FBI]] or [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts'. But I never got around to making it.\"<ref name=\"AutoMR-12\"/>\n\nInstead, during the filming of Rodriguez and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', Rodriguez shot [[lobby card]]s and sequences from parts of the original script in 2006 for a fake trailer featuring Danny Trejo, [[Cheech Marin]], and [[Jeff Fahey]]. At [[South by Southwest]] in March 2007, Rodriguez announced that he would be expanding his trailer for ''Machete'' into a feature-length film.<ref name=\"Sciretta\"/> He announced that it would be a bonus feature on the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' DVD, but the film ended up being produced as a theatrical release.<ref name=\"Sciretta1\">{{cite news |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |title=Rodriguez to film Machete Movie during ''Sin City 2'' |publisher=/film |date=March 26, 2007 |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/26/rodriguez-to-film-machete-movie-during-sin-city-2 |accessdate=2007-03-27 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713202359/http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/26/rodriguez%2Dto%2Dfilm%2Dmachete%2Dmovie%2Dduring%2Dsin%2Dcity%2D2 |archive-date=July 13, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"AutoMR-13\"/>\n\nDuring [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con International 2008]], he took the time to speak about ''Machete'', including such topics as the film's status, possible [[sequel]]s, and production priorities.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/> It was also revealed that he has regularly pulled sequences from it for his other productions including ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]''.\n\n=== Direction ===\nRodriguez had always planned on being the head-director of the film, since he usually uses his \"[[Rebel Without a Crew|one-man crew]]\" technique. In April 2009, it was announced that Ethan Maniquis, who is a long-time editor of Rodriguez's films, would be co-directing the film with Rodriguez.<ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-16\"/> At the Comic-Con 2010 event in San Diego, Trejo commented on Rodriguez: \"He's a genius. He's an absolute genius. He makes movie-making fun. You know, he makes you wanna go to work. A lot of people wake up saying 'I woke up before my alarm went off' just 'cause you're excited to work with him. You wonder 'what is he going to come up with today?', because every day, he's like inventing something new. So it's awesome to work with somebody like that\".<ref name=\"about1\"/> \"Robert has an incredible vision and is very precise, and [working on his films] you feel like you're in the middle of something both big and experiential. And that anything is possible\", states Jeff Fahey, who has collaborated with Rodriguez on ''Machete'' and ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''.\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe film's lead role had always been intended for [[Danny Trejo]], as Rodriguez mentioned. The two had met during the filming of Rodriguez's film, ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]''. \"Nobody really knew about ''Desperado'', yet the local townspeople would flock to see Danny, thinking he was the star of the movie, even though his part was very small\", Rodriguez remembers. \"He has incredible presence, and I knew I had found Machete. So, I handed him a knife, and told him to start practicing\".<ref name=\"blogs1\"/>\n\nTrejo, [[Cheech Marin]], and [[Jeff Fahey]] were announced to be reprising their characters in the trailer for the film. [[Tito Larriva]] did not reprise his primary role as the sniper who shoots Machete and was replaced by [[Shea Whigham]]. [[Michelle Rodriguez]] was the first actress to be cast in the film who wasn't in the original trailer. [[Chris Cooper]] was approached for the role of Senator McLaughlin. After Cooper turned down the role, [[Robert De Niro]] was cast instead. \"From the moment you get Robert De Niro in your movie, all the other actors come running\", says Robert Rodriguez on De Niro's involvement in the film.<ref name=\"blogs2\"/>\n\n\"What I liked about the character was that it was a fun thing to do in a sense of irony and it's not taken seriously. He's not taken seriously on one level so that frees you to have fun without being weighted down by some requirements\", says De Niro on playing his character.<ref name=\"AutoMR-17\"/> [[Lindsay Lohan]] was revealed to be cast in the film in July 2009. \"Lindsay's cool\", Rodriguez said of Lohan. \"There's actually a cool part in the movie for her if she takes it\".<ref name=\"AutoMR-18\"/> Lohan portrays April Booth, the socialite daughter of Booth, the man who double-crosses Machete. \"April was born into a life of privilege and takes everything she has for granted\", says Lohan. \"But she undergoes a big change. As an actress, I like pushing the envelope\".<ref name=\"blogs2\"/> Lohan recolored her hair from auburn red to platinum blonde.<ref name=\"AutoMR-19\"/>\n\n[[Jonah Hill]] was originally cast as Julio,<ref name=\"AutoMR-20\"/> but was replaced by [[Daryl Sabara]], who had worked with Rodriguez, Marin, and Trejo on the set of the [[Spy Kids (franchise)|''Spy Kids'' franchise]]. [[Jessica Alba]] said of her role of Agent Sartana, \"My character is an Immigrations Officer and she hunts him (Machete) down, but finds out that he was double-crossed himself. She wrestles with her own [[right-wing]] kind of mentality because she's all about enforcing the law and doing what the system tells you\".<ref name=\"AutoMR-21\"/>\n\n\"The cast may have sounded bizarre to some people when first announced. But when you watch ''Machete'', you see that the actors fit their roles very well. The eclectic mix really works. Danny's worked in hundreds of movies and probably worked with everyone in ''Machete'' at some point. Everyone just loves Danny and appreciated the fact he was finally getting to be the star of his own film. I remember Robert De Niro, who worked with Danny in ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' telling him that, '[Machete] is going to be really good for you'.\"<ref name=\"blogs2\"/>\n\nRegarding the nudity that was present in the film, Rodriguez mentioned that he deliberately set the first scene with a nude woman (actress [[Mayra Leal]]) to make the audience think that subsequent scenes show more than they actually do.<ref name=\"AutoMR-22\"/> Jessica Alba mentioned that for her shower scene, \"I had undies on, and I had other stuff on, and they just sort of etched it out in post [production]. That's not really me. I'm better covered up\".<ref name=\"AutoMR-23\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming for the fake trailer for ''Grindhouse'' began in the summer of 2006, while Rodriguez was also filming ''[[Planet Terror]]''. The scenes that Rodriguez shot only consisted of scenes involving [[Danny Trejo]], [[Cheech Marin]], [[Jeff Fahey]], and [[Tito Larriva]]. Some of the scenes filmed for the trailer were left intact in the film, while others have been re-shot.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on July 29, 2009 in and around the city of [[Austin, Texas]]. Lindsay Lohan filmed her role in three days, two in August and one in September.<ref name=\"AutoMR-24\"/> Principal photography of the film ended on September 24, 2009.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe first trailer was released and attached to ''Planet Terror'' in 2007. On July 28, 2010, it was confirmed that ''Machete'' would headline the [[Venice Film Festival]] held on September 1, 2010, at a special midnight screening, followed by the general theatrical release on September 3.<ref name=\"AutoMR-25\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-26\"/>\n\nThe film was released in the U.S. on September 3, 2010,<ref name=\"AutoMR-27\"/> by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-28\"/> The film appeared on 3,400 screens at 2,670 locations.<ref name=\"AutoMR-29\"/>\n\nThe film was released in Australia on November 11 and in Mexico on November 12, 2010.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nA fake trailer for the film was released on May 5, 2010, through ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]''. The trailer opened with Danny Trejo saying, \"This is Machete with a special [[Cinco de Mayo]] message to [[Arizona]]\", followed by scenes of gunfire, bloodshed, and highlights of the cast.<ref name=\"dailyfinance\"/> The fake trailer combined elements of the ''Machete'' trailer that appeared in ''Grindhouse'' with footage from the actual film,<ref name=\"AICN\"/> and implied that the film would be about Machete leading a revolt against anti-immigration politicians and border vigilantes.<ref name=\"AICN\"/> According to [[Fox News]], critics of illegal immigration were offended by the contents of the movie trailer.<ref name=\"AutoMR-30\"/> Production of the film predates the legislation, however.<ref name=dailyfinance/>\n\nSeveral film websites, including [[Internet Movie Database]], reported that it was the official teaser for the film.<ref name=\"AICN\"/> However, Rodriguez later revealed the trailer to be a joke, explaining \"it was Cinco de Mayo and I had too much [[tequila]]\". The official theatrical trailer was released on July 8, 2010.<ref name=\"AICN\"/> It was then attached with ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]'', which Rodriguez produced, and later shown before ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]''.<ref name=\"AICN2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.collider.com/2010/07/08/new-machete-trailer|title = New Machete Trailer|publisher=Collider.com}}</ref> A [[red band]] trailer featuring more gruesome scenes from the film was released on July 23, 2010.<ref name=\"AutoMR-31\"/>\n\n=== Box office performance ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Film\n!| Release date\n! colspan=\"3\" | Box office revenue\n! colspan=2 text=\"wrap\" | Box office ranking\n! rowspan=2 style=\"text-align: center\" | Budget\n! rowspan=2 style=\"text-align: center\" | Reference\n|-\n!

The DVD sold 691,317 copies in its first week of release.<ref name=\"AutoMR-42\"/>\n\nIn the Blu-ray deleted scenes, [[Rose McGowan]] is featured as one of Osiris's henchmen named Boots McCoy; one scene shows her confronting Luz and shooting her through a cat she is holding, hitting her in the eye and seemingly killing her. However, in the film, this action was given to Von Jackson, and it is later revealed Luz is merely blinded. In other deleted scenes Jessica Alba also plays the role of Sis, Sartana's twin sister. McCoy later shows up and slits her throat with a razor blade, thinking she is actually Sartana.\n\n==Sequels==\n{{Main|Machete Kills}}\nBefore the credits roll, a screen [[Superimposition|super]] reads that Machete will return in ''[[Machete Kills]]'' and ''Machete Kills Again''.\n\nAccording to Trejo, Rodriguez had scripts for the first of two ''Machete'' [[sequel]]s, titled ''[[Machete Kills]]'' and ''Machete Kills Again''.<ref name=\"AutoMR-43\"/> Both these titles appear in the end credits of the film's theatrical release.

Based on the [[Machete (character)|eponymous character]] from the [[Spy Kids (franchise)|''Spy Kids'' franchise]], the film is an expansion of a fake trailer of the same name published as a part of the promotion of Rodriguez's and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 2007 ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' double-feature. ''Machete'' continues the [[B movie]] and exploitation style of ''Grindhouse'', and includes some of the footage from the original.<ref name=\"AutoMR-4\"/>\n\nThe film stars [[Danny Trejo]] reprising the title role from the ''Spy Kids'' series and the fake trailer, and co-stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Steven Seagal]], [[Lindsay Lohan]], [[Cheech Marin]] and [[Jeff Fahey]]. This was Trejo's first lead role as the character, and Seagal's first theatrically released film since 2002's ''[[Half Past Dead]]''. ''Machete'' was released in the United States by [[20th Century Fox]] and Rodriguez's company, [[Troublemaker Studios]], on September 3, 2010.<ref name=\"AutoMR-5\"/> A sequel, ''[[Machete Kills]]'', directed by Rodriguez alone, was released on October 11, 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn Mexico, [[Machete (character)|Machete Cortez]] ([[Danny Trejo]]), a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] ''[[Federales|Federal]]'' and his younger partner are on a mission to rescue a kidnapped girl. During the operation, his partner is killed, the kidnapped girl stabs him in the leg before being killed herself, and Machete is betrayed by his corrupt Chief to the powerful drug lord and former Federal, Rogelio Torrez ([[Steven Seagal]]), who kills Machete's wife and implies that he will kill his daughter before leaving him for dead.\n\nThree years later, a down-and-out Machete roams [[Texas]], scraping by on yard work. Michael Booth ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a local businessman and [[spin doctor]], explains to Machete that corrupt [[Texas Senate|Texas State Senator]] John McLaughlin ([[Robert De Niro]]) is sending hundreds of illegal immigrants out of the country, which would reduce the number of laborers. In order to stop this, Booth offers Machete $150,000 to kill McLaughlin. Machete accepts the murder contract after Booth threatens to kill him if he does not.\n\nMachete trains a rifle on McLaughlin from a rooftop during a rally, but before he fires he sees one of Booth's henchmen aiming at him. The henchman shoots Machete in the shoulder, then shoots McLaughlin in the leg. It is revealed that Booth orchestrated the attempted assassination as part of a [[false flag]] operation to gain public support for McLaughlin's secure border campaign. By setting up Machete as the gunman, the conspirators make it appear that an outlaw illegal Mexican immigrant has tried to assassinate the senator, who is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration.\n\nAn injured Machete escapes capture by Booth and is taken to a hospital to be treated for wounds, escaping once again from Booth's henchmen at the hospital. Agent Sartana Rivera ([[Jessica Alba]]), a persistent [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agent, is sent by her superior to find and capture the injured Machete. Machete, with the help of Luz ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), aka Sh\u00e9, the leader of an illegal immigrant aid movement known as the Network, recruits Padre ([[Cheech Marin]]), his \"holy\" brother. To take revenge on Booth, Machete kidnaps Booth's wife June and his daughter April ([[Lindsay Lohan]]), after \"starring\" in an amateur adult film with them. He also collects evidence from Booth's house linking McLaughlin and Torrez in a major [[drug trafficking]] deal. After encountering Machete, Sartana begins to develop an interest in him. Elsewhere, Booth, who is revealed to be working for Torrez, hires a hitman, Osiris Amanpour ([[Tom Savini]]), to assist in the hunt for Machete. A group of border vigilantes, sponsored by McLaughlin and led by Von Jackson ([[Don Johnson]]), begin attacking anyone who may be harboring Machete and shoot Luz in the right eye.\n\nBooth and Osiris lead a raid on the church. Padre kills their henchmen before the two incapacitate him and kill him by nailing him to a cross, but do not find Booth's wife and daughter. Unbeknownst to Booth, the church has cameras. Through the [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] recordings, the news of McLaughlin's corruption and faked assassination is eventually aired on national television. Infuriated, McLaughlin kills Booth and heads back to join Torrez and Jackson to kill Machete. In order to eliminate the people who double-crossed him, Machete gathers the Mexican Network and leads them to the base of the border vigilantes. When McLaughlin arrives at the base, Jackson turns on him for being involved with the Mexican drug trade and attempts to execute him, but is interrupted when Machete and the illegals arrive.\n\nDuring this confrontation, the Mexican illegals triumph over the border vigilantes. Jackson tries to escape, but Luz, who survived and now sports an eye patch, shoots him in the back of the head. Machete fights Torrez and stabs him, who then scornfully kills himself through [[Seppuku]]. April shows up wearing a nun's habit after escaping from the church and shoots McLaughlin after figuring out that he has killed her father.\n\nMcLaughlin, injured, manages to escape, but he is later killed by the last remnants of his own border vigilante group, who mistake him for a Mexican. Machete meets with Sartana, who gives him a green card, but he rejects it, saying he's already a legend. They kiss and ride off into the night. The closing credits announce further adventures for Machete.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as [[Machete (character)|Machete Cortez]], \"a legendary ex-Federale with a deadly attitude and the skills to match\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/>\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Luz/Sh\u00e9, \"a taco-truck lady with a revolutionary heart\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/>\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as Senator John McLaughlin, a politician campaigning to incite hatred against illegal immigrants.<ref name=\"AutoMR-6\"/>\n* [[Jessica Alba]] as Sartana Rivera, \"a beautiful Immigrations officer torn between enforcing the law and doing what is popular in the eyes of her familia.\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/> Alba also portrays Sartana's twin sister in deleted scenes only.\n* [[Steven Seagal]] as Rogelio Torrez, a drug lord, as well as Machete's former partner with the Federales<ref name=\"AutoMR-8\"/>\n* [[Jeff Fahey]] as Michael Booth, \"a ruthless businessman with an endless payroll of killers\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/>\n* [[Cheech Marin]] as Padre Benicio Del Toro, Machete's brother, \"a priest who's good with [[blessing]]s, but better with guns\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/>\n* [[Don Johnson]] as Von Jackson, \"a twisted border [[vigilante]] leading a small army.\"<ref name=\"vivamachete1\"/> The character was originally known as \"Lt.

He says, \"When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] or [[Charles Bronson]], putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete'. So I decided to do that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, I want to keep going and do a feature\".<ref name=\"AutoMR-11\"/> Rodriguez stated, \"There weren't any action movies that with a Latin flavor that could play to a broad audience. When I watched [director] [[John Woo]]'s movies, they made me want to be Asian. Woo and [actor] [[Chow Yun-Fat]]'s ''[[Hard Boiled]]'' and ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'' really inspired me to make films that would create that feeling in the Latin arena\".<ref name=\"blogs1\"/>\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in ''Desperado''. \"So I wrote him this idea of a [[Federales|federale]] from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes [[FBI]] or [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts'. But I never got around to making it.\"<ref name=\"AutoMR-12\"/>\n\nInstead, during the filming of Rodriguez and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'', Rodriguez shot [[lobby card]]s and sequences from parts of the original script in 2006 for a fake trailer featuring Danny Trejo, [[Cheech Marin]], and [[Jeff Fahey]]. At [[South by Southwest]] in March 2007, Rodriguez announced that he would be expanding his trailer for ''Machete'' into a feature-length film.<ref name=\"Sciretta\"/> He announced that it would be a bonus feature on the ''[[Planet Terror]]'' DVD, but the film ended up being produced as a theatrical release.<ref name=\"Sciretta1\">{{cite news |last=Sciretta |first=Peter |title=Rodriguez to film Machete Movie during ''Sin City 2'' |publisher=/film |date=March 26, 2007 |url=https://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/26/rodriguez-to-film-machete-movie-during-sin-city-2 |accessdate=2007-03-27 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090713202359/http://www.slashfilm.com/2007/03/26/rodriguez%2Dto%2Dfilm%2Dmachete%2Dmovie%2Dduring%2Dsin%2Dcity%2D2 |archive-date=July 13, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"AutoMR-13\"/>\n\nDuring [[Comic-Con International|Comic-Con International 2008]], he took the time to speak about ''Machete'', including such topics as the film's status, possible [[sequel]]s, and production priorities.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/> It was also revealed that he has regularly pulled sequences from it for his other productions including ''[[Once Upon a Time in Mexico]]''.\n\n=== Direction ===\nRodriguez had always planned on being the head-director of the film, since he usually uses his \"[[Rebel Without a Crew|one-man crew]]\" technique. In April 2009, it was announced that Ethan Maniquis, who is a long-time editor of Rodriguez's films, would be co-directing the film with Rodriguez.<ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-16\"/> At the Comic-Con 2010 event in San Diego, Trejo commented on Rodriguez: \"He's a genius. He's an absolute genius. He makes movie-making fun. You know, he makes you wanna go to work. A lot of people wake up saying 'I woke up before my alarm went off' just 'cause you're excited to work with him. You wonder 'what is he going to come up with today?', because every day, he's like inventing something new. So it's awesome to work with somebody like that\".<ref name=\"about1\"/> \"Robert has an incredible vision and is very precise, and [working on his films] you feel like you're in the middle of something both big and experiential. And that anything is possible\", states Jeff Fahey, who has collaborated with Rodriguez on ''Machete'' and ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''.\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe film's lead role had always been intended for [[Danny Trejo]], as Rodriguez mentioned. The two had met during the filming of Rodriguez's film, ''[[Desperado (film)|Desperado]]''. \"Nobody really knew about ''Desperado'', yet the local townspeople would flock to see Danny, thinking he was the star of the movie, even though his part was very small\", Rodriguez remembers. \"He has incredible presence, and I knew I had found Machete. So, I handed him a knife, and told him to start practicing\".<ref name=\"blogs1\"/>\n\nTrejo, [[Cheech Marin]], and [[Jeff Fahey]] were announced to be reprising their characters in the trailer for the film. [[Tito Larriva]] did not reprise his primary role as the sniper who shoots Machete and was replaced by [[Shea Whigham]]. [[Michelle Rodriguez]] was the first actress to be cast in the film who wasn't in the original trailer. [[Chris Cooper]] was approached for the role of Senator McLaughlin. After Cooper turned down the role, [[Robert De Niro]] was cast instead. \"From the moment you get Robert De Niro in your movie, all the other actors come running\", says Robert Rodriguez on De Niro's involvement in the film.<ref name=\"blogs2\"/>\n\n\"What I liked about the character was that it was a fun thing to do in a sense of irony and it's not taken seriously. He's not taken seriously on one level so that frees you to have fun without being weighted down by some requirements\", says De Niro on playing his character.<ref name=\"AutoMR-17\"/> [[Lindsay Lohan]] was revealed to be cast in the film in July 2009. \"Lindsay's cool\", Rodriguez said of Lohan. \"There's actually a cool part in the movie for her if she takes it\".<ref name=\"AutoMR-18\"/> Lohan portrays April Booth, the socialite daughter of Booth, the man who double-crosses Machete. \"April was born into a life of privilege and takes everything she has for granted\", says Lohan. \"But she undergoes a big change. As an actress, I like pushing the envelope\".<ref name=\"blogs2\"/> Lohan recolored her hair from auburn red to platinum blonde.<ref name=\"AutoMR-19\"/>\n\n[[Jonah Hill]] was originally cast as Julio,<ref name=\"AutoMR-20\"/> but was replaced by [[Daryl Sabara]], who had worked with Rodriguez, Marin, and Trejo on the set of the [[Spy Kids (franchise)|''Spy Kids'' franchise]]. [[Jessica Alba]] said of her role of Agent Sartana, \"My character is an Immigrations Officer and she hunts him (Machete) down, but finds out that he was double-crossed himself. She wrestles with her own [[right-wing]] kind of mentality because she's all about enforcing the law and doing what the system tells you\".<ref name=\"AutoMR-21\"/>\n\n\"The cast may have sounded bizarre to some people when first announced. But when you watch ''Machete'', you see that the actors fit their roles very well. The eclectic mix really works. Danny's worked in hundreds of movies and probably worked with everyone in ''Machete'' at some point. Everyone just loves Danny and appreciated the fact he was finally getting to be the star of his own film. I remember Robert De Niro, who worked with Danny in ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' telling him that, '[Machete] is going to be really good for you'.\"<ref name=\"blogs2\"/>\n\nRegarding the nudity that was present in the film, Rodriguez mentioned that he deliberately set the first scene with a nude woman (actress [[Mayra Leal]]) to make the audience think that subsequent scenes show more than they actually do.<ref name=\"AutoMR-22\"/> Jessica Alba mentioned that for her shower scene, \"I had undies on, and I had other stuff on, and they just sort of etched it out in post [production]. That's not really me. I'm better covered up\".<ref name=\"AutoMR-23\"/>\n\n=== Filming ===\nFilming for the fake trailer for ''Grindhouse'' began in the summer of 2006, while Rodriguez was also filming ''[[Planet Terror]]''. The scenes that Rodriguez shot only consisted of scenes involving [[Danny Trejo]], [[Cheech Marin]], [[Jeff Fahey]], and [[Tito Larriva]]. Some of the scenes filmed for the trailer were left intact in the film, while others have been re-shot.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began on July 29, 2009 in and around the city of [[Austin, Texas]]. Lindsay Lohan filmed her role in three days, two in August and one in September.<ref name=\"AutoMR-24\"/> Principal photography of the film ended on September 24, 2009.\n\n== Release ==\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe first trailer was released and attached to ''Planet Terror'' in 2007. On July 28, 2010, it was confirmed that ''Machete'' would headline the [[Venice Film Festival]] held on September 1, 2010, at a special midnight screening, followed by the general theatrical release on September 3.<ref name=\"AutoMR-25\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-26\"/>\n\nThe film was released in the U.S. on September 3, 2010,<ref name=\"AutoMR-27\"/> by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-28\"/> The film appeared on 3,400 screens at 2,670 locations.<ref name=\"AutoMR-29\"/>\n\nThe film was released in Australia on November 11 and in Mexico on November 12, 2010.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nA fake trailer for the film was released on May 5, 2010, through ''[[Ain't It Cool News]]''. The trailer opened with Danny Trejo saying, \"This is Machete with a special [[Cinco de Mayo]] message to [[Arizona]]\", followed by scenes of gunfire, bloodshed, and highlights of the cast.<ref name=\"dailyfinance\"/> The fake trailer combined elements of the ''Machete'' trailer that appeared in ''Grindhouse'' with footage from the actual film,<ref name=\"AICN\"/> and implied that the film would be about Machete leading a revolt against anti-immigration politicians and border vigilantes.<ref name=\"AICN\"/> According to [[Fox News]], critics of illegal immigration were offended by the contents of the movie trailer.<ref name=\"AutoMR-30\"/> Production of the film predates the legislation, however.<ref name=dailyfinance/>\n\nSeveral film websites, including [[Internet Movie Database]], reported that it was the official teaser for the film.<ref name=\"AICN\"/> However, Rodriguez later revealed the trailer to be a joke, explaining \"it was Cinco de Mayo and I had too much [[tequila]]\". The official theatrical trailer was released on July 8, 2010.<ref name=\"AICN\"/> It was then attached with ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]'', which Rodriguez produced, and later shown before ''[[The Expendables (2010 film)|The Expendables]]''.<ref name=\"AICN2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.collider.com/2010/07/08/new-machete-trailer|title = New Machete Trailer|publisher=Collider.com}}</ref> A [[red band]] trailer featuring more gruesome scenes from the film was released on July 23, 2010.<ref name=\"AutoMR-31\"/>\n\n=== Box office performance ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Film\n!| Release date\n! colspan=\"3\" | Box office revenue\n! colspan=2 text=\"wrap\" | Box office ranking\n! rowspan=2 style=\"text-align: center\" | Budget\n! rowspan=2 style=\"text-align: center\" | Reference\n|-\n!

However, in the film, this action was given to Von Jackson, and it is later revealed Luz is merely blinded. In other deleted scenes Jessica Alba also plays the role of Sis, Sartana's twin sister. McCoy later shows up and slits her throat with a razor blade, thinking she is actually Sartana.\n\n==Sequels==\n{{Main|Machete Kills}}\nBefore the credits roll, a screen [[Superimposition|super]] reads that Machete will return in ''[[Machete Kills]]'' and ''Machete Kills Again''.\n\nAccording to Trejo, Rodriguez had scripts for the first of two ''Machete'' [[sequel]]s, titled ''[[Machete Kills]]'' and ''Machete Kills Again''.<ref name=\"AutoMR-43\"/> Both these titles appear in the end credits of the film's theatrical release.

Initial claims by the Iraqi government (that ''Stark'' was inside the Iran\u2013Iraq War zone) were shown to be false. The motives and orders of the pilot remain unanswered.

Initial claims by the Iraqi government (that ''Stark'' was inside the Iran\u2013Iraq War zone) were shown to be false. The motives and orders of the pilot remain unanswered.

The thin shell is depressed. It is deep crimson colored, with a crescent of white bordering the [[Columella (gastropod)|columella]]. The [[Sculpture (mollusc)|sculpture]] consists of rather narrow, spaced, acute spiral cords, of which there are two larger ones on the upper surface (one at the shoulder). The spaces between are occupied by intervening smaller spirals and very close, fine, microscopic spiral striae, decussated by finer radiating striae of increment. The upper whorls show low, radiating, scarcely visible folds. The base is nearly smooth, having only fine separated spiral threads with flat interspaces. All sculpture becomes obsolete in the white crescent except the fine, very oblique growth lines. The principal spirals of the upper surface are more or less distinctly beaded. The [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorl]]s of the [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] show only two spiral carinae. The short spire is acute and contains 4\u00bd whorls. The last are rapidly enlarging, descending toward the aperture. The oval [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] is extremely oblique, reddish, and scarcely iridescent.\n\nThis species may be known by the bright coral red color, or white with longitudinal stripes, usually broken into distinct squarish spots. The principal spirals above are granose. There is an astonishing amount of variation in degree of depression. The nacreous layer is excessively thin, especially in the typical form.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/manualconch12tryorich H.A.
