During its deliberations, the Council made the [[Vulgate]] the official example of the Biblical canon and commissioned the creation of a standard version, although this was not achieved until the 1590s.<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> In 1565, a year after the Council finished its work, Pius IV issued the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)|Tridentine Creed]] (after ''Tridentum'', Trent's Latin name) and his successor [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]] then issued the [[Roman Catechism]] and revisions of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Breviary]] and [[Roman Missal|Missal]] in, respectively, 1566, 1568 and 1570. These, in turn, led to the codification of the [[Tridentine Mass]], which remained the Church's primary form of the Mass for the next four hundred years.\n\nMore than three hundred years passed until the next ecumenical council, the [[First Vatican Council]], was convened in 1869.\n\n== Background information ==\n\n=== Obstacles and events before the Council's problem area ===\n[[File:Tizian 083b.jpg|thumb|Pope Paul III, convener of the Council of Trent.]]\nOn 15 March 1517, the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] closed its activities with a number of reform proposals (on the selection of bishops, taxation, censorship and preaching) but not on the major problems that confronted the Church in Germany and other parts of Europe. A few months later, on 31 October 1517, [[Martin Luther]] issued his [[95 Theses]] in [[Wittenberg]].\n\n=== A general, free council in Germany ===\nLuther's position on ecumenical councils shifted over time,<ref>{{citation | first = Hubert | last = Jedin | title = Konziliengeschichte | publisher = Herder | year = 1959 | page = 80}}</ref> but in 1520 he appealed to the German princes to oppose the papal Church, if necessary with a council in Germany,<ref>{{citation | title = An den Adel deutscher Nation | year = 1520 | language = German}}</ref> open and free of the Papacy. After the Pope condemned in ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' fifty-two of Luther's theses as [[heresy]], German opinion considered a council the best method to reconcile existing differences. German Catholics, diminished in number, hoped for a council to clarify matters.<ref name=\"Jedin 81\">Jedin 81</ref>\n\nIt took a generation for the council to materialise, partly because of papal reluctance, given that a Lutheran demand was the exclusion of the papacy from the Council, and partly because of ongoing political rivalries between France and Germany and the Turkish dangers in the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Jedin 81\" /> Under [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523\u201334), troops of the Catholic [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Papal Rome]] in 1527, \"raping, killing, burning, stealing, the like had not been seen since the [[Vandals]]\". [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] and the [[Sistine Chapel]] were used for horses.<ref>Hans K\u00fchner Papstgeschichte, Fischer, Frankfurt 1960, 118</ref> This, together with the Pontiff's ambivalence between France and Germany, led to his hesitation.\n\nCharles V strongly favoured a council, but needed the support of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] of France, who attacked him militarily. Francis I generally opposed a general council due to partial support of the Protestant cause within France. In 1532 he agreed to the [[Schmalkaldic League#Nuremberg Religious Peace|Nuremberg Religious Peace]] granting religious liberty to the Protestants, and in 1533 he further complicated matters when suggesting a general council to include both Catholic and Protestant rulers of Europe that would devise a compromise between the two theological systems. This proposal met the opposition of the Pope for it gave recognition to Protestants and also elevated the secular Princes of Europe above the clergy on church matters. Faced with a Turkish attack, Charles held the support of the Protestant German rulers, all of whom delayed the opening of the Council of Trent.<ref>Jedin 79\u201382</ref>\n\n== Occasion, sessions, and attendance ==\n[[File:Council of Trent by Pasquale Cati.jpg|thumb|The Council, depicted by [[Pasquale Cati]] (Cati da Iesi)]]\nIn reply to the [[Papal bull]] ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' of [[Pope Leo X]] (1520), [[Martin Luther]] burned the document and appealed for a general council. In 1522 German [[diet (assembly)|diets]] joined in the appeal, with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] seconding and pressing for a council as a means of reunifying the Church and settling the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] controversies. [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534) was vehemently against the idea of a council, agreeing with [[Francis I of France]], after [[Pope Pius II]], in his bull ''[[Execrabilis]]'' (1460) and his reply to the University of Cologne (1463), set aside the theory of the supremacy of general councils laid down by the [[Council of Constance]].<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\n[[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549), seeing that the [[Protestant Reformation]] was no longer confined to a few preachers, but had won over various princes, particularly in Germany, to its ideas, desired a council. Yet when he proposed the idea to his [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], it was almost unanimously opposed. Nonetheless, he sent [[nuncio]]s throughout Europe to propose the idea. Paul III issued a decree for a general council to be held in Mantua, Italy, to begin on 23 May 1537.<ref>Joseph Francis Kelly, ''The Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church: A History'', 133.</ref> Martin Luther wrote the [[Smalcald Articles]] in preparation for the general council. The Smalcald Articles were designed to sharply define where the Lutherans could and could not compromise. The council was ordered by the Emperor and Pope Paul III to convene in [[Mantua]] on 23 May 1537. It failed to convene after another war broke out between France and Charles V, resulting in a non-attendance of French [[prelate]]s. Protestants refused to attend as well. Financial difficulties in Mantua led the Pope in the autumn of 1537 to move the council to [[Vicenza]], where participation was poor. The Council was postponed indefinitely on 21 May 1539. Pope Paul III then initiated several internal Church reforms while Emperor Charles V convened with Protestants and Cardinal [[Gasparo Contarini]] at the [[Diet of Regensburg (1541)|Diet of Regensburg]], to reconcile differences. Mediating and conciliatory formulations were developed on certain topics. In particular, a two-part doctrine of justification was formulated that would later be rejected at Trent.<ref>[https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/catholic-or-protestant-the-story-of-contarini-and-the-reformation/ Catholic OR Protestant? The Story of Contarini and the Reformation, footnote seven]</ref> Unity failed between Catholic and Protestant representatives \"because of different concepts of ''Church'' and ''[[Justification (theology)|justification]]''\".<ref>Jedin 85</ref>\n\nHowever, the council was delayed until 1545 and, as it happened, convened right before Luther's death. Unable, however, to resist the urging of Charles V, the pope, after proposing Mantua as the place of meeting, convened the council at Trent (at that time ruled by a prince-bishop under the [[Holy Roman Empire]]),<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> on 13 December 1545; the Pope's decision to transfer it to [[Bologna]] in March 1547 on the pretext of avoiding a plague<ref name=\"ODCC\"/> failed to take effect and the Council was indefinitely prorogued on 17 September 1549. None of the three popes reigning over the duration of the council ever attended, which had been a condition of Charles V. [[Papal legate]]s were appointed to represent the Papacy.<ref>O'Malley, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nReopened at Trent on 1 May 1551 by convocation of [[Pope Julius III]] (1550\u20131555), it was broken up by the sudden victory of [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony]] over the Emperor Charles V and his march into surrounding state of [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] on 28 April 1552.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc12/htm/ii.ii.htm |title=Council of Trent|author=Trenkle, Franz Sales|date=3 March 2003|accessdate=22 January 2008}}</ref> There was no hope of reassembling the council while the very [[Anti-Protestantism|anti-Protestant]] [[Paul IV]] was Pope.<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> The council was reconvened by [[Pope Pius IV]] (1559\u20131565) for the last time, meeting from 18 January 1562 at [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Trento|Santa Maria Maggiore]], and continued until its final adjournment on 4 December 1563. It closed with a series of ritual acclamations honouring the reigning Pope, the Popes who had convoked the Council, the emperor and the kings who had supported it, the papal legates, the cardinals, the ambassadors present, and the bishops, followed by acclamations of acceptance of the faith of the Council and its decrees, and of anathema for all heretics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html|title=CT25|website=history.hanover.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe history of the council is thus divided into three distinct periods: 1545\u20131549, 1551\u20131552 and 1562\u20131563. During the second period, the Protestants present asked for renewed discussion on points already defined and for bishops to be released from their oaths of allegiance to the Pope. When the last period began, all intentions of conciliating the Protestants was gone and the [[Jesuits]] had become a strong force.<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> This last period was begun especially as an attempt to prevent the formation of a [[Francis II of France#Conciliation policy|general council including Protestant]]s, as had  been demanded by some in France.\n\nThe number of attending members in the three periods varied considerably.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> The council was small to begin with, opening with only about 30 bishops.<ref name=\"O'Malley, 29\">O'Malley, 29</ref> It increased toward the close, but never reached the number of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (which had 318 members)<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> nor of the [[First Vatican Council]] (which numbered 744). The decrees were signed in 1563 by 255 members, the highest attendance of the whole council,<ref name=\"O'Malley, 29\"/> including four papal legates, two cardinals, three patriarchs, twenty-five archbishops, and 168 bishops, two-thirds of whom were Italians. The Italian and Spanish prelates were vastly preponderant in power and numbers. At the passage of the most important decrees, not more than sixty prelates were present.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> Although most Protestants did not attend, ambassadors and theologians of Brandenburg, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Strasbourg attended having been granted an improved [[safe conduct]]<ref>[http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=t&word=TRENT.COUNCILOF Trent, Council of] from the Christian Cyclopedia, Edited by: Erwin L.

Concordia Publishing House: 2000</ref>\n\nThe French monarchy boycotted the entire council until the last minute when a delegation led by [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine]] finally arrived in November 1562. The first outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion#The \"first\" war (1562\u201363)|French Wars of Religion]] had occurred earlier in the year and the French Church, facing a significant and powerful Protestant minority in France, experienced [[iconoclasm]] violence regarding the use of sacred images.  Such concerns were not primary in the Italian and Spanish Churches. {{clarify|date=November 2017}} The last minute inclusion of a decree on sacred images was a French initiative, and the text, never discussed on the floor of the council or referred to council theologians, was based on a French draft.<ref>O'Malley, 32\u201336</ref>\n\n== Objectives and overall results ==\n{{canon law}}\n\nThe main objectives of the council were twofold, although there were other issues that were also discussed:\n\n#To condemn the principles and doctrines of [[Protestantism]] and to clarify the doctrines of the Catholic Church on all disputed points. This had not been done formally since the 1530 ''[[Confutatio Augustana]]''. It is true that the emperor intended it to be a strictly general or truly ecumenical council, at which the Protestants should have a fair hearing. He secured, during the council's second period, 1551\u20131553, an invitation, twice given, to the Protestants to be present and the council issued a letter of safe conduct (thirteenth session) and offered them the right of discussion, but denied them a vote. [[Melanchthon]] and [[Johannes Brenz]], with some other German Lutherans, actually started in 1552 on the journey to Trent. Brenz offered a confession and Melanchthon, who got no farther than [[Nuremberg]], took with him the ''Confessio Saxonica''. But the refusal to give the Protestants the vote and the consternation produced by the success of Maurice in his campaign against Charles V in 1552 effectually put an end to Protestant cooperation.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n#To effect a reformation in [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|discipline or administration]]. This object had been one of the causes calling forth the reformatory councils and had been lightly touched upon by the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] under [[Pope Julius II]]. The obvious corruption in the administration of the Church was one of the numerous causes of the Reformation. Twenty-five public sessions were held, but nearly half of them were spent in solemn formalities. The chief work was done in committees or congregations. The entire management was in the hands of the papal legate. The liberal elements lost out in the debates and voting. The council abolished some of the most notorious abuses and introduced or recommended disciplinary reforms affecting the sale of [[indulgence]]s, the morals of convents, the education of the clergy, the non-residence of bishops (also bishops having plurality of [[benefice]]s, which was fairly common), and the careless [[wikt:fulmination|fulmination]] of [[censure]]s, and forbade duelling. Although evangelical sentiments were uttered by some of the members in favour of the supreme authority of the Scriptures and justification by faith, no concession whatsoever was made to Protestantism.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n#The Church is the ultimate interpreter of Scripture.<ref name=\"CCC 85\">Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraph 85</ref> Also, the Bible and Church Tradition (the tradition that composed part of the Catholic faith) were equally and independently authoritative.\n#The relationship of faith and [[Good works|works]] in salvation was defined, following controversy over [[Martin Luther]]'s doctrine of \"[[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]]\".\n#Other Catholic practices that drew the ire of reformers within the Church, such as [[indulgences]], pilgrimages, the veneration of [[saint]]s and [[relics]], and the veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]] were strongly reaffirmed, though abuses of them were forbidden. Decrees concerning [[Counter-Reformation#Church music|sacred music]] and religious art, [[Catholic Church art#Council of Trent|though inexplicit, were subsequently amplified]] by theologians and writers to condemn many types of Renaissance and medieval styles and [[iconography|iconographies]], impacting heavily on the development of these art forms.\n\nThe doctrinal decisions of the council are set forth in  decrees (''decreta''), which are divided into chapters (''capita''), which contain the positive statement of the conciliar [[dogma]]s, and into short canons (''canones''), which condemn the dissenting Protestant views with the concluding ''anathema sit'' (\"let him be anathema\").<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\n== Decrees ==\n\nThe '''doctrinal''' acts are as follows: after reaffirming the [[Nicene Creed|Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]] (third session), the [[Canon of Trent|decree]] was passed (fourth session) confirming that the [[deuterocanonical books]] were on a par with the other books of the [[biblical canon|canon]] (against Luther's placement of these books in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] of [[Luther Bible|his edition]]) and coordinating church tradition with the Scriptures as a rule of faith. The [[Vulgate]] translation was affirmed to be authoritative for the text of Scripture.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\n[[Justification (theology)|Justification]] (sixth session) was declared to be offered upon the basis of human cooperation with divine grace<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of [[Irresistible grace|passive reception of grace]]. Understanding the Protestant \"[[Sola fide|faith alone]]\" doctrine to be one of simple human confidence in divine mercy, the Council rejected the \"[[Preservation of the saints|vain confidence]]\" of the Protestants, stating that no one can know who has received the grace of God.  Furthermore, the Council affirmed\u2014against some Protestants\u2014that the grace of God can be forfeited through [[mortal sin]].\n\nThe greatest weight in the Council's decrees is given to the [[sacrament]]s. The seven sacraments were reaffirmed and the [[Eucharist]] pronounced to be a true propitiatory sacrifice as well as a sacrament, in which the bread and wine were [[consecration|consecrated]] into the Eucharist (thirteenth and twenty-second sessions). The term [[transubstantiation]] was used by the Council, but the specific [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] explanation given by [[Scholasticism]] was not cited as dogmatic. Instead, the decree states that [[Jesus|Christ]] is \"really, truly, substantially present\" in the consecrated forms. The sacrifice of the [[Roman Mass|Mass]] was to be offered for dead and living alike and in giving to the apostles the command \"do this in remembrance of me,\" Christ conferred upon them a [[sacerdotal]] power. The practice of withholding the cup from the laity was confirmed (twenty-first session) as one which the [[Church Fathers]] had commanded for good and sufficient reasons; yet in certain cases the Pope was made the supreme arbiter as to whether the rule should be strictly maintained.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> On the language of the Mass, \"contrary to what is often said\", the council condemned the belief that only vernacular languages should be used, while insisting on the use of Latin.<ref name=\"O'Malley, 31\">O'Malley, 31</ref>\n\n[[Holy Orders|Ordination]] (twenty-third session) was defined to imprint an [[sacramental character|indelible character]] on the soul. The priesthood of the New Testament takes the place of the Levitical priesthood. To the performance of its functions, the consent of the people is not necessary.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nIn the decrees on marriage (twenty-fourth session) the excellence of the [[celibacy|celibate]] state was reaffirmed, concubinage condemned and the validity of marriage made dependent upon the wedding taking place before a priest and two witnesses, although the lack of a requirement for parental consent ended a debate that had proceeded from the 12th century. In the case of a [[divorce]], the right of the innocent party to marry again was denied so long as the other party was alive,<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> even if the other party had committed adultery. However the council \"refused \u2026 to assert the necessity or usefulness of [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]\".<ref name=\"O'Malley, 31\"/>{{dubious|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the twenty-fifth and last session,<ref>Council of Trent: Decree ''De invocatione, veneratione et reliquiis sanctorum, et de sacris imaginibus'', 3 December 1563, Sessio 25.</ref> the doctrines of [[purgatory]], the invocation of [[saint]]s and the veneration of [[relic]]s were reaffirmed, as was also the efficacy of indulgences as dispensed by the Church according to the power given her, but with some cautionary recommendations,<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> and a ban on the sale of indulgences. Short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, were to have [[The Reformation and art#Council of Trent|great impact]] on the development of [[Catholic Church art]]. Much more than the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787) the Council fathers of Trent stressed the pedagogical purpose of Christian images.<ref>B\u00fchren 2008, p. 635f.; about the historical context of the decree on sacred images cf. Jedin 1935.</ref>\n\nThe council appointed, in 1562 (eighteenth session), a commission to prepare a list of forbidden books (''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''), but it later left the matter to the Pope. The preparation of a [[Roman Catechism|catechism]] and the revision of the [[Roman Breviary|Breviary]] and [[Missal]] were also left to the pope.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> The catechism embodied the council's far-reaching results, including reforms and definitions of the sacraments, the Scriptures, church dogma, and duties of the clergy.<ref name=\"World History\" />\n\n===Ratification and promulgation===\nOn adjourning, the Council asked the supreme pontiff to ratify all its decrees and definitions. This petition was complied with by [[Pope Pius IV]], on 26 January 1564, in the [[papal bull]], ''[[Benedictus Deus (Pius IV)|Benedictus Deus]]'', which enjoins strict obedience upon all Catholics and forbids, under pain of [[excommunication]], all unauthorised interpretation, reserving this to the Pope alone and threatens the disobedient with \"the indignation of Almighty God and of his blessed apostles, Peter and Paul.\" Pope Pius appointed a commission of cardinals to assist him in interpreting and enforcing the decrees.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThe ''[[Index librorum prohibitorum]]'' was announced in 1564 and the following books were issued with the papal [[imprimatur]]: the Profession of the Tridentine Faith and the [[Roman Catechism|Tridentine Catechism]] (1566), the Breviary (1568), the Missal (1570) and the [[Vulgate]] (1590 and then 1592).<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThe decrees of the council were acknowledged in Italy, Portugal, Poland and by the Catholic princes of Germany at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1566. [[Philip II of Spain]] accepted them for Spain, the Netherlands and Sicily inasmuch as they did not infringe the royal prerogative. In France they were officially recognised by the king only in their doctrinal parts. Although the disciplinary or moral reformatory decrees were never published by the throne, they received official recognition at provincial synods and were enforced by the bishops. Holy Roman Emperors [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] never recognized the existence of any of the decrees.<ref name=\"Meyer\">{{cite book |last=Meyer |first=Herbert T. |date=1962 |title=The Story of the Council of Trent|location=St. Louis |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |page=19-20}}</ref> No attempt was made to introduce it into England. Pius IV sent the decrees to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], with a letter dated 13 June 1564, requesting her to publish them in Scotland, but she dared not do it in the face of [[John Knox]] and the Reformation.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThese decrees were later supplemented by the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1870.\n\n== Publication of documents ==\nServite prelate Paolo Sarpi's 1619 ''Istoria del Concilio Tridentino'' (''[[Paolo Sarpi#History of the Council of Trent|History of the Council of Trent]]'') was the first history of the Council of Trent.

During its deliberations, the Council made the [[Vulgate]] the official example of the Biblical canon and commissioned the creation of a standard version, although this was not achieved until the 1590s.<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> In 1565, a year after the Council finished its work, Pius IV issued the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)|Tridentine Creed]] (after ''Tridentum'', Trent's Latin name) and his successor [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]] then issued the [[Roman Catechism]] and revisions of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Breviary]] and [[Roman Missal|Missal]] in, respectively, 1566, 1568 and 1570. These, in turn, led to the codification of the [[Tridentine Mass]], which remained the Church's primary form of the Mass for the next four hundred years.\n\nMore than three hundred years passed until the next ecumenical council, the [[First Vatican Council]], was convened in 1869.\n\n== Background information ==\n\n=== Obstacles and events before the Council's problem area ===\n[[File:Tizian 083b.jpg|thumb|Pope Paul III, convener of the Council of Trent.]]\nOn 15 March 1517, the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] closed its activities with a number of reform proposals (on the selection of bishops, taxation, censorship and preaching) but not on the major problems that confronted the Church in Germany and other parts of Europe. A few months later, on 31 October 1517, [[Martin Luther]] issued his [[95 Theses]] in [[Wittenberg]].\n\n=== A general, free council in Germany ===\nLuther's position on ecumenical councils shifted over time,<ref>{{citation | first = Hubert | last = Jedin | title = Konziliengeschichte | publisher = Herder | year = 1959 | page = 80}}</ref> but in 1520 he appealed to the German princes to oppose the papal Church, if necessary with a council in Germany,<ref>{{citation | title = An den Adel deutscher Nation | year = 1520 | language = German}}</ref> open and free of the Papacy. After the Pope condemned in ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' fifty-two of Luther's theses as [[heresy]], German opinion considered a council the best method to reconcile existing differences. German Catholics, diminished in number, hoped for a council to clarify matters.<ref name=\"Jedin 81\">Jedin 81</ref>\n\nIt took a generation for the council to materialise, partly because of papal reluctance, given that a Lutheran demand was the exclusion of the papacy from the Council, and partly because of ongoing political rivalries between France and Germany and the Turkish dangers in the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Jedin 81\" /> Under [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523\u201334), troops of the Catholic [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked Papal Rome]] in 1527, \"raping, killing, burning, stealing, the like had not been seen since the [[Vandals]]\". [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] and the [[Sistine Chapel]] were used for horses.<ref>Hans K\u00fchner Papstgeschichte, Fischer, Frankfurt 1960, 118</ref> This, together with the Pontiff's ambivalence between France and Germany, led to his hesitation.\n\nCharles V strongly favoured a council, but needed the support of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] of France, who attacked him militarily. Francis I generally opposed a general council due to partial support of the Protestant cause within France. In 1532 he agreed to the [[Schmalkaldic League#Nuremberg Religious Peace|Nuremberg Religious Peace]] granting religious liberty to the Protestants, and in 1533 he further complicated matters when suggesting a general council to include both Catholic and Protestant rulers of Europe that would devise a compromise between the two theological systems. This proposal met the opposition of the Pope for it gave recognition to Protestants and also elevated the secular Princes of Europe above the clergy on church matters. Faced with a Turkish attack, Charles held the support of the Protestant German rulers, all of whom delayed the opening of the Council of Trent.<ref>Jedin 79\u201382</ref>\n\n== Occasion, sessions, and attendance ==\n[[File:Council of Trent by Pasquale Cati.jpg|thumb|The Council, depicted by [[Pasquale Cati]] (Cati da Iesi)]]\nIn reply to the [[Papal bull]] ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' of [[Pope Leo X]] (1520), [[Martin Luther]] burned the document and appealed for a general council. In 1522 German [[diet (assembly)|diets]] joined in the appeal, with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] seconding and pressing for a council as a means of reunifying the Church and settling the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] controversies. [[Pope Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534) was vehemently against the idea of a council, agreeing with [[Francis I of France]], after [[Pope Pius II]], in his bull ''[[Execrabilis]]'' (1460) and his reply to the University of Cologne (1463), set aside the theory of the supremacy of general councils laid down by the [[Council of Constance]].<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\n[[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549), seeing that the [[Protestant Reformation]] was no longer confined to a few preachers, but had won over various princes, particularly in Germany, to its ideas, desired a council. Yet when he proposed the idea to his [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], it was almost unanimously opposed. Nonetheless, he sent [[nuncio]]s throughout Europe to propose the idea. Paul III issued a decree for a general council to be held in Mantua, Italy, to begin on 23 May 1537.<ref>Joseph Francis Kelly, ''The Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church: A History'', 133.</ref> Martin Luther wrote the [[Smalcald Articles]] in preparation for the general council. The Smalcald Articles were designed to sharply define where the Lutherans could and could not compromise. The council was ordered by the Emperor and Pope Paul III to convene in [[Mantua]] on 23 May 1537. It failed to convene after another war broke out between France and Charles V, resulting in a non-attendance of French [[prelate]]s. Protestants refused to attend as well. Financial difficulties in Mantua led the Pope in the autumn of 1537 to move the council to [[Vicenza]], where participation was poor. The Council was postponed indefinitely on 21 May 1539. Pope Paul III then initiated several internal Church reforms while Emperor Charles V convened with Protestants and Cardinal [[Gasparo Contarini]] at the [[Diet of Regensburg (1541)|Diet of Regensburg]], to reconcile differences. Mediating and conciliatory formulations were developed on certain topics. In particular, a two-part doctrine of justification was formulated that would later be rejected at Trent.<ref>[https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/catholic-or-protestant-the-story-of-contarini-and-the-reformation/ Catholic OR Protestant? The Story of Contarini and the Reformation, footnote seven]</ref> Unity failed between Catholic and Protestant representatives \"because of different concepts of ''Church'' and ''[[Justification (theology)|justification]]''\".<ref>Jedin 85</ref>\n\nHowever, the council was delayed until 1545 and, as it happened, convened right before Luther's death. Unable, however, to resist the urging of Charles V, the pope, after proposing Mantua as the place of meeting, convened the council at Trent (at that time ruled by a prince-bishop under the [[Holy Roman Empire]]),<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> on 13 December 1545; the Pope's decision to transfer it to [[Bologna]] in March 1547 on the pretext of avoiding a plague<ref name=\"ODCC\"/> failed to take effect and the Council was indefinitely prorogued on 17 September 1549. None of the three popes reigning over the duration of the council ever attended, which had been a condition of Charles V. [[Papal legate]]s were appointed to represent the Papacy.<ref>O'Malley, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nReopened at Trent on 1 May 1551 by convocation of [[Pope Julius III]] (1550\u20131555), it was broken up by the sudden victory of [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony]] over the Emperor Charles V and his march into surrounding state of [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] on 28 April 1552.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ccel.org/s/schaff/encyc/encyc12/htm/ii.ii.htm |title=Council of Trent|author=Trenkle, Franz Sales|date=3 March 2003|accessdate=22 January 2008}}</ref> There was no hope of reassembling the council while the very [[Anti-Protestantism|anti-Protestant]] [[Paul IV]] was Pope.<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> The council was reconvened by [[Pope Pius IV]] (1559\u20131565) for the last time, meeting from 18 January 1562 at [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Trento|Santa Maria Maggiore]], and continued until its final adjournment on 4 December 1563. It closed with a series of ritual acclamations honouring the reigning Pope, the Popes who had convoked the Council, the emperor and the kings who had supported it, the papal legates, the cardinals, the ambassadors present, and the bishops, followed by acclamations of acceptance of the faith of the Council and its decrees, and of anathema for all heretics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html|title=CT25|website=history.hanover.edu}}</ref>\n\nThe history of the council is thus divided into three distinct periods: 1545\u20131549, 1551\u20131552 and 1562\u20131563. During the second period, the Protestants present asked for renewed discussion on points already defined and for bishops to be released from their oaths of allegiance to the Pope. When the last period began, all intentions of conciliating the Protestants was gone and the [[Jesuits]] had become a strong force.<ref name=\"ODCC\" /> This last period was begun especially as an attempt to prevent the formation of a [[Francis II of France#Conciliation policy|general council including Protestant]]s, as had  been demanded by some in France.\n\nThe number of attending members in the three periods varied considerably.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> The council was small to begin with, opening with only about 30 bishops.<ref name=\"O'Malley, 29\">O'Malley, 29</ref> It increased toward the close, but never reached the number of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] (which had 318 members)<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> nor of the [[First Vatican Council]] (which numbered 744). The decrees were signed in 1563 by 255 members, the highest attendance of the whole council,<ref name=\"O'Malley, 29\"/> including four papal legates, two cardinals, three patriarchs, twenty-five archbishops, and 168 bishops, two-thirds of whom were Italians. The Italian and Spanish prelates were vastly preponderant in power and numbers. At the passage of the most important decrees, not more than sixty prelates were present.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> Although most Protestants did not attend, ambassadors and theologians of Brandenburg, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Strasbourg attended having been granted an improved [[safe conduct]]<ref>[http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=t&word=TRENT.COUNCILOF Trent, Council of] from the Christian Cyclopedia, Edited by: Erwin L.

Concordia Publishing House: 2000</ref>\n\nThe French monarchy boycotted the entire council until the last minute when a delegation led by [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine]] finally arrived in November 1562. The first outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion#The \"first\" war (1562\u201363)|French Wars of Religion]] had occurred earlier in the year and the French Church, facing a significant and powerful Protestant minority in France, experienced [[iconoclasm]] violence regarding the use of sacred images.  Such concerns were not primary in the Italian and Spanish Churches. {{clarify|date=November 2017}} The last minute inclusion of a decree on sacred images was a French initiative, and the text, never discussed on the floor of the council or referred to council theologians, was based on a French draft.<ref>O'Malley, 32\u201336</ref>\n\n== Objectives and overall results ==\n{{canon law}}\n\nThe main objectives of the council were twofold, although there were other issues that were also discussed:\n\n#To condemn the principles and doctrines of [[Protestantism]] and to clarify the doctrines of the Catholic Church on all disputed points. This had not been done formally since the 1530 ''[[Confutatio Augustana]]''. It is true that the emperor intended it to be a strictly general or truly ecumenical council, at which the Protestants should have a fair hearing. He secured, during the council's second period, 1551\u20131553, an invitation, twice given, to the Protestants to be present and the council issued a letter of safe conduct (thirteenth session) and offered them the right of discussion, but denied them a vote. [[Melanchthon]] and [[Johannes Brenz]], with some other German Lutherans, actually started in 1552 on the journey to Trent. Brenz offered a confession and Melanchthon, who got no farther than [[Nuremberg]], took with him the ''Confessio Saxonica''. But the refusal to give the Protestants the vote and the consternation produced by the success of Maurice in his campaign against Charles V in 1552 effectually put an end to Protestant cooperation.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n#To effect a reformation in [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|discipline or administration]]. This object had been one of the causes calling forth the reformatory councils and had been lightly touched upon by the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]] under [[Pope Julius II]]. The obvious corruption in the administration of the Church was one of the numerous causes of the Reformation. Twenty-five public sessions were held, but nearly half of them were spent in solemn formalities. The chief work was done in committees or congregations. The entire management was in the hands of the papal legate. The liberal elements lost out in the debates and voting. The council abolished some of the most notorious abuses and introduced or recommended disciplinary reforms affecting the sale of [[indulgence]]s, the morals of convents, the education of the clergy, the non-residence of bishops (also bishops having plurality of [[benefice]]s, which was fairly common), and the careless [[wikt:fulmination|fulmination]] of [[censure]]s, and forbade duelling. Although evangelical sentiments were uttered by some of the members in favour of the supreme authority of the Scriptures and justification by faith, no concession whatsoever was made to Protestantism.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n#The Church is the ultimate interpreter of Scripture.<ref name=\"CCC 85\">Catechism of the Catholic Church Paragraph 85</ref> Also, the Bible and Church Tradition (the tradition that composed part of the Catholic faith) were equally and independently authoritative.\n#The relationship of faith and [[Good works|works]] in salvation was defined, following controversy over [[Martin Luther]]'s doctrine of \"[[Sola fide|justification by faith alone]]\".\n#Other Catholic practices that drew the ire of reformers within the Church, such as [[indulgences]], pilgrimages, the veneration of [[saint]]s and [[relics]], and the veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]] were strongly reaffirmed, though abuses of them were forbidden. Decrees concerning [[Counter-Reformation#Church music|sacred music]] and religious art, [[Catholic Church art#Council of Trent|though inexplicit, were subsequently amplified]] by theologians and writers to condemn many types of Renaissance and medieval styles and [[iconography|iconographies]], impacting heavily on the development of these art forms.\n\nThe doctrinal decisions of the council are set forth in  decrees (''decreta''), which are divided into chapters (''capita''), which contain the positive statement of the conciliar [[dogma]]s, and into short canons (''canones''), which condemn the dissenting Protestant views with the concluding ''anathema sit'' (\"let him be anathema\").<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\n== Decrees ==\n\nThe '''doctrinal''' acts are as follows: after reaffirming the [[Nicene Creed|Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed]] (third session), the [[Canon of Trent|decree]] was passed (fourth session) confirming that the [[deuterocanonical books]] were on a par with the other books of the [[biblical canon|canon]] (against Luther's placement of these books in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] of [[Luther Bible|his edition]]) and coordinating church tradition with the Scriptures as a rule of faith. The [[Vulgate]] translation was affirmed to be authoritative for the text of Scripture.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\n[[Justification (theology)|Justification]] (sixth session) was declared to be offered upon the basis of human cooperation with divine grace<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of [[Irresistible grace|passive reception of grace]]. Understanding the Protestant \"[[Sola fide|faith alone]]\" doctrine to be one of simple human confidence in divine mercy, the Council rejected the \"[[Preservation of the saints|vain confidence]]\" of the Protestants, stating that no one can know who has received the grace of God.  Furthermore, the Council affirmed\u2014against some Protestants\u2014that the grace of God can be forfeited through [[mortal sin]].\n\nThe greatest weight in the Council's decrees is given to the [[sacrament]]s. The seven sacraments were reaffirmed and the [[Eucharist]] pronounced to be a true propitiatory sacrifice as well as a sacrament, in which the bread and wine were [[consecration|consecrated]] into the Eucharist (thirteenth and twenty-second sessions). The term [[transubstantiation]] was used by the Council, but the specific [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] explanation given by [[Scholasticism]] was not cited as dogmatic. Instead, the decree states that [[Jesus|Christ]] is \"really, truly, substantially present\" in the consecrated forms. The sacrifice of the [[Roman Mass|Mass]] was to be offered for dead and living alike and in giving to the apostles the command \"do this in remembrance of me,\" Christ conferred upon them a [[sacerdotal]] power. The practice of withholding the cup from the laity was confirmed (twenty-first session) as one which the [[Church Fathers]] had commanded for good and sufficient reasons; yet in certain cases the Pope was made the supreme arbiter as to whether the rule should be strictly maintained.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> On the language of the Mass, \"contrary to what is often said\", the council condemned the belief that only vernacular languages should be used, while insisting on the use of Latin.<ref name=\"O'Malley, 31\">O'Malley, 31</ref>\n\n[[Holy Orders|Ordination]] (twenty-third session) was defined to imprint an [[sacramental character|indelible character]] on the soul. The priesthood of the New Testament takes the place of the Levitical priesthood. To the performance of its functions, the consent of the people is not necessary.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nIn the decrees on marriage (twenty-fourth session) the excellence of the [[celibacy|celibate]] state was reaffirmed, concubinage condemned and the validity of marriage made dependent upon the wedding taking place before a priest and two witnesses, although the lack of a requirement for parental consent ended a debate that had proceeded from the 12th century. In the case of a [[divorce]], the right of the innocent party to marry again was denied so long as the other party was alive,<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> even if the other party had committed adultery. However the council \"refused \u2026 to assert the necessity or usefulness of [[Clerical celibacy (Catholic Church)|clerical celibacy]]\".<ref name=\"O'Malley, 31\"/>{{dubious|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn the twenty-fifth and last session,<ref>Council of Trent: Decree ''De invocatione, veneratione et reliquiis sanctorum, et de sacris imaginibus'', 3 December 1563, Sessio 25.</ref> the doctrines of [[purgatory]], the invocation of [[saint]]s and the veneration of [[relic]]s were reaffirmed, as was also the efficacy of indulgences as dispensed by the Church according to the power given her, but with some cautionary recommendations,<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> and a ban on the sale of indulgences. Short and rather inexplicit passages concerning religious images, were to have [[The Reformation and art#Council of Trent|great impact]] on the development of [[Catholic Church art]]. Much more than the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787) the Council fathers of Trent stressed the pedagogical purpose of Christian images.<ref>B\u00fchren 2008, p. 635f.; about the historical context of the decree on sacred images cf. Jedin 1935.</ref>\n\nThe council appointed, in 1562 (eighteenth session), a commission to prepare a list of forbidden books (''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''), but it later left the matter to the Pope. The preparation of a [[Roman Catechism|catechism]] and the revision of the [[Roman Breviary|Breviary]] and [[Missal]] were also left to the pope.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/> The catechism embodied the council's far-reaching results, including reforms and definitions of the sacraments, the Scriptures, church dogma, and duties of the clergy.<ref name=\"World History\" />\n\n===Ratification and promulgation===\nOn adjourning, the Council asked the supreme pontiff to ratify all its decrees and definitions. This petition was complied with by [[Pope Pius IV]], on 26 January 1564, in the [[papal bull]], ''[[Benedictus Deus (Pius IV)|Benedictus Deus]]'', which enjoins strict obedience upon all Catholics and forbids, under pain of [[excommunication]], all unauthorised interpretation, reserving this to the Pope alone and threatens the disobedient with \"the indignation of Almighty God and of his blessed apostles, Peter and Paul.\" Pope Pius appointed a commission of cardinals to assist him in interpreting and enforcing the decrees.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThe ''[[Index librorum prohibitorum]]'' was announced in 1564 and the following books were issued with the papal [[imprimatur]]: the Profession of the Tridentine Faith and the [[Roman Catechism|Tridentine Catechism]] (1566), the Breviary (1568), the Missal (1570) and the [[Vulgate]] (1590 and then 1592).<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThe decrees of the council were acknowledged in Italy, Portugal, Poland and by the Catholic princes of Germany at the [[Diet of Augsburg]] in 1566. [[Philip II of Spain]] accepted them for Spain, the Netherlands and Sicily inasmuch as they did not infringe the royal prerogative. In France they were officially recognised by the king only in their doctrinal parts. Although the disciplinary or moral reformatory decrees were never published by the throne, they received official recognition at provincial synods and were enforced by the bishops. Holy Roman Emperors [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] never recognized the existence of any of the decrees.<ref name=\"Meyer\">{{cite book |last=Meyer |first=Herbert T. |date=1962 |title=The Story of the Council of Trent|location=St. Louis |publisher=Concordia Publishing House |page=19-20}}</ref> No attempt was made to introduce it into England. Pius IV sent the decrees to [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], with a letter dated 13 June 1564, requesting her to publish them in Scotland, but she dared not do it in the face of [[John Knox]] and the Reformation.<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThese decrees were later supplemented by the [[First Vatican Council]] of 1870.\n\n== Publication of documents ==\nServite prelate Paolo Sarpi's 1619 ''Istoria del Concilio Tridentino'' (''[[Paolo Sarpi#History of the Council of Trent|History of the Council of Trent]]'') was the first history of the Council of Trent. Sarpi was critical of the curia, having the opinion that the council was \"an Iliad of woes\"<ref name = Meyer/> and was designed for future conflict.<ref>[[John Hale (historian)|John Hale]] (1993) ''The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance''. Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0684803526}}. p. 138.</ref> His history was translated into English and widely read by Protestants; [[John Milton]] called him the \"great unmasker\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]]|title=The great unmasker: Paolo Sarpi, 1551\u20131613|journal= History Today|volume=15 |year=1965|pages=430|url=http://www.historytoday.com/peter-burke/great-unmasker-paolo-sarpi-1552-1623}}</ref>\n\nThe most comprehensive history is still [[Hubert Jedin]]'s ''The History of the Council of Trent (Geschichte des Konzils von Trient)'' with about 2500 pages in four volumes: ''The History of the Council of Trent: The fight for a Council'' (Vol I, 1951); ''The History of the Council of Trent: The first Sessions in Trent (1545\u20131547)'' (Vol II, 1957); ''The History of the Council of Trent: Sessions in Bologna 1547\u20131548 and Trento 1551\u20131552'' (Vol III, 1970, 1998); ''The History of the Council of Trent: Third Period and Conclusion'' (Vol IV, 1976).\n\nThe canons and decrees of the council have been published very often and in many languages (for a large list consult ''British Museum Catalogue'', under \"Trent, Council of\"). The first issue was by [[Paulus Manutius]] (Rome, 1564). The best Latin editions are by Judocus Le Plat (Antwerp, 1779) and by [[Johann Friedrich von Schulte]] and [[Aemilius Ludwig Richter]] (Leipzig, 1853). Other good editions are in vol. vii. of the ''Acta et decreta conciliorum recentiorum. Collectio Lacensis'' (7 vols., Freiburg, 1870\u201390), reissued as independent volume (1892); ''Concilium Tridentinum: Diariorum, actorum, epistularum, \u2026 collectio'', ed. Sebastianus Merkle (4 vols., Freiburg, 1901 sqq.); not to overlook [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi|Mansi]], ''Concilia'', xxxv. 345 sqq. Note also [[Carl Mirbt]], ''Quellen'', 2d ed, pp.&nbsp;202\u2013255. The best English edition is by [[James Waterworth]] (London, 1848; ''With Essays on the External and Internal History of the Council'').<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nThe original acts and debates of the council, as prepared by its general secretary, Bishop [[Angelo Massarelli]], in six large folio volumes, are deposited in the [[Vatican Library]] and remained there unpublished for more than 300 years and were brought to light, though only in part, by [[Augustin Theiner]], priest of the oratory (d. 1874), in ''Acta genuina sancti et oecumenici Concilii Tridentini nunc primum integre edita'' (2 vols., Leipzig, 1874).<ref name=Schaff-Herzog/>\n\nMost of the official documents and private reports, however, which bear upon the council, were made known in the 16th century and since. The most complete collection of them is that of J. Le Plat, ''Monumentorum ad historicam Concilii Tridentini collectio'' (7 vols., Leuven, 1781\u201387).

Groups are contained within braces ({}), with the opening brace and closing brace indicating the start of the group and end of the group respectively. Groups are used to indicate what type of attributes to apply to certain text.  The backslash (\\) indicates that a control word is going to be used.  Control words are specifically programmed commands for RTF.  They can have certain states in which they're active. Their state is represented by a number.  For example,\n\n;{{code|\\b0}}   :   indicates that the Bold text is off\n;{{code|\\b1}}   :   indicates that the Bold text is on\n\nA delimiter is one of three things:\n\n# A space\n# A digit or hyphen (i.e. -23, 23, 275)\n# A character other than a digit or letter i.e.(\\, /, }) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblioscape.com/rtf15_spec.htm|title=Rich Text Format (RTF) Version 1.5 Specification|website=www.biblioscape.com}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, the following RTF code:\n<source lang=\"tex\">\n {\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fswiss Helvetica;}\\f0\\pard\n This is some {\\b bold} text.\\par\n }\n</source>\nis a document which would be rendered like this when read by a program that supports RTF:\n\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">\nThis is some '''bold''' text.</blockquote>\n\n==Character encoding==\nA standard RTF file can consist of only 7-bit [[ASCII]] characters, but can encode characters beyond ASCII by [[escape sequence]]s.<ref name=\"Microsoft RTF Syntax\">{{citation |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140284(office.10).aspx |title=Microsoft RTF Syntax}}</ref> The character escapes are of two types: [[code page]] escapes and, starting with RTF 1.5, [[Unicode]] escapes. In a code page escape, two [[hexadecimal]] digits following a backslash and [['|typewriter apostrophe]] are used for denoting a character taken from a Windows code page. For example, if the code page is set to [[Windows-1256]]<!-- this does not require control codes, it may be a system or application default -->, the sequence <code>\\'c8</code> will encode the Arabic letter [[bet (letter)|b\u0101\u02bc]] (\u0628).\n\nFor a Unicode escape the control word <code>\\u</code> is used, followed by a 16-bit signed [[decimal]] integer giving the Unicode UTF-16 code unit number. For the benefit of programs without Unicode support, this must be followed by the nearest representation of this character in the specified code page. For example, <code>\\u1576?</code> would give the Arabic letter ''b\u0101\u02bc'' \u0628, specifying that older programs which do not have Unicode support should render it as a question mark instead.\n\nThe control word <code>\\uc0</code> can be used to indicate that subsequent Unicode escape sequences within the current group do not specify the substitution character.\n\nUntil RTF specification version 1.5 release in 1997, RTF has only handled 7-bit characters directly and 8-bit characters encoded as hexadecimal (using <code>\\'xx</code>). RTF control words (since RTF 1.5) generally accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments. Unicode values greater than 32767 must be expressed as negative numbers.<ref name=\"rtf15\" /> If a Unicode character is [[Unicode plane|outside BMP]], it is encoded with a surrogate pair. Support for Unicode was made due to text handling changes in Microsoft Word \u2013 Microsoft Word 97 is a partially Unicode-enabled application and it handles text using the [[UTF-16|16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme]].<ref name=\"rtf15\" /> Microsoft Word 2000 and later versions are Unicode-enabled applications that handle text using the 16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme.<ref name=\"rtf16\" />\n\nRTF files are usually 7-bit ASCII plain text. RTF consists of control words, control symbols, and groups. RTF files can be easily transmitted between PC based operating systems because they are encoded as a [[text file]] with 7-bit [[graphic character|graphic]] ASCII characters. Converters that communicate with Microsoft Word for MS Windows or Macintosh should expect data transfer as 8-bit characters and binary data can contain any 8-bit values.<ref name=\"rtf191\" />\n\n==Human readability==\nRTF is a data format for saving and sharing documents, not a [[markup language]]; it is not intended for intuitive and easy typing by a human.<ref name=\"rtf-pocket-guide\" /><ref name=\"rtf-pocket-scribd\">{{citation |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/15490806/RTF-Pocket-Guide-by-OReilly-Media |title=RTF Pocket Guide by O'Reilly Media  |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> Nonetheless, unlike many word processing formats, RTF code can be [[human-readable]]: when an RTF file containing mostly latin characters without [[diacritic]]s is viewed as a plain [[text file]], the underlying ASCII text is readable, provided that the author has kept formatting concise&nbsp;\u2013 otherwise, the formatting code can impede readability.\n\nWhen RTF was released, most word processors used binary file formats ([[Microsoft Word]] used the [[Doc (computing)|.doc]] file format); RTF was unique in its simple formatting control which allows for a non-RTF aware program (e.g. [[Microsoft Notepad|Notepad]]) to open and provide a readable file. Today, the majority of these programs have changed to a XML-based file format (Word has switched to the [[.docx]] file format). Regardless, these files contain large amounts of formatting code. As such, they are ten or more times larger than the corresponding [[plain text]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://interglacial.com/rtf/ |title=Rich Text Format&nbsp;\u2013 MSWord generates some scary RTF |date=2008-07-12 |author=Sean M. Burke |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref><ref name=\"rtf-pocket-guide\" />  \n\nTo be standard-compliant RTF, non-ASCII characters must be [[#Character encoding|escaped]]. Thus, even with concise formatting, text that uses certain [[dash]]es and [[quotation mark glyphs|quotation marks]] is less legible. Latin languages that make heavy use of characters with [[diacritic]]s, such as \\'f1 for [[\u00f1]] and \\'e9 for [[\u00e9]] are particularly difficult to read in RTF.  Non-[[Latin script|Latin]] [[writing system|scripts]], consisting of characters such as \\u21563 for [[CJK characters|\u543b]], are illegible in RTF.  In addition, from its beginnings, RTF has supported Microsoft [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] embedded objects and Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects, which are not human-readable.\n\n==Common uses and interoperability==\nMost word processing software supports RTF format importing and exporting (following some version of RTF specification), and/or direct editing, often making it a \"common\" format between otherwise incompatible word processing software and operating systems.  These factors contribute to its [[interoperability]], but it will depend on what version of RTF is being used.<ref name=\"e-gov-uk\" /> There are several consciously designed or accidentally born RTF dialects.<ref name=\"ted-rtf\">{{cite web |url=http://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/editors/ted/TedDocument-en_US.html |title=Ted, an easy rich text processor |author=Mark de Does |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> Most applications that read RTF files silently ignore unknown RTF control words.<ref name=\"ted-rtf\" />\n\nRTF is the internal markup language used by Microsoft Word.<ref name=\"rtf-pocket-guide\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/product-description/0596004753/ref=dp_proddesc_0/277-8520360-9056562?ie=UTF8&n=266239&s=books |title=RTF Pocket Guide |author=Sean M.

(But there are incompatibilities, e.g. between RTF 1.0 1987 and later specifications, or between RTF 1.0-1.4 and RTF 1.5+ in use of Unicode characters.)<ref name=\"wordperfect-dos\">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/wordtowpdos.html |title=How to Import Microsoft Word Files into WordPerfect for DOS |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abiword.org/help/en-US/info/infoformats.html |title=Abiword Help&nbsp;\u2013 File Formats |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?techtalk/v30/30ts79.htm~mainFrame |title=Opening Rich Text Format (RTF) files  |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref>  This makes it a useful format for basic formatted text documents such as instruction manuals, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, letters, and modest information documents.  These documents at minimum support bold, italic, and underline text formatting.  Also typically supported are left-, center-, and right-aligned text, font specification and document margins.\n\nFont and margin defaults, as well as style presets and other functions vary according to program defaults.  There may also be subtle differences perhaps between different versions of the RTF specification implemented in differing programs and program versions.  Nevertheless, the RTF format is consistent enough from computer to computer to be considered highly portable and acceptable for [[cross-platform]] use. The format supports [[metadata]] such as title, author, etc. but not all implementations support this.\n\n===Objects===\nUse of Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects or Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects limits the interoperability, because these objects are not widely supported in programs for viewing or editing RTF files (e.g. embedding of other files inside the RTF, such as tables or charts from spreadsheet application).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/47307 |title=FOSS word processors compared: OOo Writer, AbiWord, and KWord |author=Bruce Byfield |date=2005-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-06 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/46599 |title=Sharing files between OpenOffice.org and Microsoft Office |date=2005-07-28 |accessdate=2010-04-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204134005/http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/46599 |archivedate=2010-02-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/153229 |title=SoftMaker Office 2008 focuses on compatibility with Microsoft Office |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ithub.ga/2020/04/softmaker-office-2006.html |title=SoftMaker Office 2006 beta: Not a killer app |date=2020-04-07 |accessdate=2020-04-07 }}{{ bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://pacsec.jp/psj06/psj06lagadec-e.pdf |format=PDF |title=OpenOffice / OpenDocument and Microsoft Office 2007 / Open XML security |author=Philippe Lagadec |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref> If a software that understands an OLE object is not available, the object is usually replaced by a picture (bitmap representation of the object) or not displayed at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keyongtech.com/2560234-ole-object-bitmap-representation |title=OLE object&nbsp;\u2013 bitmap representation? |accessdate=2010-04-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724111954/http://www.keyongtech.com/2560234-ole-object-bitmap-representation |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/edit/COleRichEditCtrl.aspx |title=A Rich Edit Control That Displays Bitmaps and Other OLE Objects |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Pictures===\nRTF supports inclusion of JPEG, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Enhanced Metafile (EMF), [[Windows Metafile]] (WMF), Apple PICT, Windows Device-dependent bitmap, Windows Device Independent bitmap and OS/2 Metafile picture types in hexadecimal (the default) or binary format in a RTF file. Not all of these picture types are supported in all RTF readers. When a RTF document is opened in software that does not support the picture type of an inserted picture, such picture is not displayed at all.\n\nRTF writers usually convert inserted pictures from an unsupported picture types (e.g. BMP, TIFF, GIF, etc.) to one of supported picture types (PNG, WMF) or they do not include pictures at all.\n\nFor better compatibility with Microsoft products, some RTF writers include the same picture in two different picture types in one RTF file:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224663/en-us |title=Document file size increases with EMF, PNG, GIF, or JPEG graphics in Word |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>\n* one of the supported picture types (e.g. JPG or PNG)&nbsp;\u2013 it uses either the original format of the inserted graphics file (if this graphics file uses one of RTF-supported formats&nbsp;\u2013 such as PNG, JPG) or a RTF-supported picture type created by RTF writer in conversion from RTF-unsupported graphics file (e.g. conversion from BMP or GIF to PNG)\n* a [[Windows Metafile]] (WMF) copy of the original picture&nbsp;\u2013 for better compatibility with some Microsoft applications (e.g. Wordpad). The Windows Metafile copy is included without any compression.\n\nThis method increases the RTF file size rapidly. The RTF specification does not require this method and there are various implementations that include pictures without the WMF copy (e.g. Abiword or Ted).\n\nFor Microsoft Word it is also possible to set a specific registry value (\"ExportPictureWithMetafile=0\") in order to prevent Word from saving the WMF copy (see link \"Document file size increases with EMF, PNG, GIF, or JPEG graphics in Word\" at the beginning).\n\n===Fonts===\nRTF supports [[font embedding|embedding]] of [[Computer font|fonts]] used in the document, but this feature is not widely supported in software implementations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/275953 |title=Embedded fonts are not displayed as expected in the documents that are saved as RTF in Word |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://list.unm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0504d&L=rtf-l&T=0&F=&S=&P=60 |title=Embedding fonts in RTF file |date=2005-04-23 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=20370 |title=OpenOffice.org Issue&nbsp;\u2013 MS Interoperability: embedd fonts into the document |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\n\nRTF also supports generic font family names used for [[font substitution]]: ''roman'' ([[serif]]), ''swiss'' ([[sans-serif]]), ''modern'' ([[monospaced font|monospace]]), ''script'', ''decorative'', ''technical''.<ref name=\"rtf10-txt\" /> This feature is not widely supported for font substitution, e.g. in OpenOffice.org or Abiword.\n\n===Annotations===\nRTF specification supports [[annotation]]s (comments in documents) since version 1.0.<ref name=\"rtf10-txt\" /> RTF 1.7 specification defined some new features for annotations: date stamp (there was previously only \"time stamp\") and parents of annotations.<ref name=\"rtf17\" /> When a RTF document with annotations is opened in an application that does not support RTF annotations, they are not displayed at all. Similarly, when a document with annotations is saved as RTF in an application that does not support RTF annotations, annotations are not preserved in the RTF file. Some implementations may hide annotations by default or require some user action to display them&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. in Abiword since version 2.8 or in IBM Lotus Symphony (up to version 1.3).\n\nMicrosoft products do not support comments within footers, footnotes or headers. Inserting a comment within headers, footers, or footnotes may result in a corrupted RTF document.<ref name=\"rtf191\" />\n\nThe RTF specification also supports footnotes (not to be confused with annotations), which are widely supported in RTF implementations (e.g. in OpenOffice.org, Abiword, KWord, Ted, but not in Wordpad). Endnotes are implemented as a variation on footnotes such that applications that support footnotes and not endnotes will render endnotes in an RTF document as footnotes. Similar to annotations, due to Microsoft products not supporting footnotes in headers, footers, or comments, including footnotes within those contexts in an RTF document may result in a corrupted document.<ref name=\"rtf191\" />\n\n===Drawing objects===\nRTF 1.2 specification defined use of drawing objects such as rectangles, ellipses, lines, arrows, polygons and various other shapes. RTF 1.5 specification introduced many new control words for drawing objects. RTF drawing objects are also called \"shapes\" since RTF 1.5.<ref name=\"rtf15\" />\n\nHowever, RTF drawing objects are not supported in many RTF implementations, such as [[Apache OpenOffice]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://issues.apache.org/ooo/show_bug.cgi?id=3790 |title=Issue 3790&nbsp;\u2013 RTF: Import Word 97-2000 RTF for Drawing Objects (Shapes) |work=Apache OpenOffice (AOO) Bugzilla|publisher=Apache Software Foundation|accessdate=2014-10-27}}</ref> (though they are supported in [[LibreOffice]] 4.0 on<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/4.0|title=LibreOffice 4.0 Release Notes|publisher=The Document Foundation|accessdate=2014-10-27}}</ref>) or Abiword.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-user/2006/Mar/0048.html |title=Re: Drawing inside Abiword |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}</ref> When an RTF document with drawing objects is opened in an application that does not support RTF drawing objects, they are not displayed at all.

For this reason, RTF was often recommended over those formats when the spread of [[computer virus]]es through macros was a concern. However, having the .RTF extension does not guarantee that a file is safe, since Microsoft Word will open standard DOC files renamed with an RTF extension and run any contained macros as usual. Manual examination of a file in a plain text editor such as [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]], or use of the [[file (command)|<code>file</code> command]] in [[UNIX]]-like systems, is required to determine whether or not a suspect file is really RTF.<ref name=\"seniortechcenter\"/><ref name=\"SANSavoidmacro\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sans.org/security-resources/macro.php |title=Avoiding Macro Viruses |publisher=SANS Institute (via archive.org) |accessdate=2015-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610065538/http://www.sans.org/security-resources/macro.php |archivedate=June 10, 2011 }}</ref> Enabling Word's \"Confirm file format conversion on open\" option (not enabled by default in any version of Word) can also assist by warning a document being opened is in a format that does not match the format implied by the file's extension, and giving the option to abort opening that file.\n\nRTF files can carry malware; sometimes malicious files in RTF format are renamed with the .DOC extension.

RTF is also the data format for \"rich text controls\" in MS Windows APIs.<ref name=\"rtf-pocket-guide\" />\n\nThe default text editor for [[Mac OS X]], [[TextEdit]], can also view, edit and save RTF files as well as [[Rich Text Format Directory|RTFD]] files.  TextEdit currently (as of July 2009) has limited ability to edit RTF document margins.  Much older Mac word processing application programs such as [[MacWrite]] and [[WriteNow]] were able to view, edit, and save RTF files as well.\n\nThe [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open-source]] word processors [[AbiWord]], [[Apache OpenOffice]], [[Bean (word processor)|Bean]], [[Calligra]], [[KWord]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[NeoOffice]] can view, edit and save RTF files.

Microsoft did not initially make the RTF specification publicly available, making it difficult for competitors to develop document conversion features in their applications. Because Microsoft's developers had access to the specification, Microsoft's applications had better compatibility with the format. Also, every time Microsoft changed the RTF specification, Microsoft's own applications had a lead in time-to-market, because competitors had to redevelop their applications after studying the newer version of the format.\n\n[[Novell]] alleged that Microsoft's practices were anticompetitive in its 2004 antitrust complaint against Microsoft.<ref>{{citation

All subsequent releases of Microsoft Word for the Macintosh and all versions for Windows can read and write files in RTF format.\n\nMicrosoft maintains the format. The final version was 1.9.1 in 2008, implementing features of [[Office 2007]]. Microsoft has discontinued enhancements to the RTF specification.

Groups are contained within braces ({}), with the opening brace and closing brace indicating the start of the group and end of the group respectively. Groups are used to indicate what type of attributes to apply to certain text.  The backslash (\\) indicates that a control word is going to be used.  Control words are specifically programmed commands for RTF.  They can have certain states in which they're active. Their state is represented by a number.  For example,\n\n;{{code|\\b0}}   :   indicates that the Bold text is off\n;{{code|\\b1}}   :   indicates that the Bold text is on\n\nA delimiter is one of three things:\n\n# A space\n# A digit or hyphen (i.e. -23, 23, 275)\n# A character other than a digit or letter i.e.(\\, /, }) <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblioscape.com/rtf15_spec.htm|title=Rich Text Format (RTF) Version 1.5 Specification|website=www.biblioscape.com}}</ref>\n\nAs an example, the following RTF code:\n<source lang=\"tex\">\n {\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fswiss Helvetica;}\\f0\\pard\n This is some {\\b bold} text.\\par\n }\n</source>\nis a document which would be rendered like this when read by a program that supports RTF:\n\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">\nThis is some '''bold''' text.</blockquote>\n\n==Character encoding==\nA standard RTF file can consist of only 7-bit [[ASCII]] characters, but can encode characters beyond ASCII by [[escape sequence]]s.<ref name=\"Microsoft RTF Syntax\">{{citation |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140284(office.10).aspx |title=Microsoft RTF Syntax}}</ref> The character escapes are of two types: [[code page]] escapes and, starting with RTF 1.5, [[Unicode]] escapes. In a code page escape, two [[hexadecimal]] digits following a backslash and [['|typewriter apostrophe]] are used for denoting a character taken from a Windows code page. For example, if the code page is set to [[Windows-1256]]<!-- this does not require control codes, it may be a system or application default -->, the sequence <code>\\'c8</code> will encode the Arabic letter [[bet (letter)|b\u0101\u02bc]] (\u0628).\n\nFor a Unicode escape the control word <code>\\u</code> is used, followed by a 16-bit signed [[decimal]] integer giving the Unicode UTF-16 code unit number. For the benefit of programs without Unicode support, this must be followed by the nearest representation of this character in the specified code page. For example, <code>\\u1576?</code> would give the Arabic letter ''b\u0101\u02bc'' \u0628, specifying that older programs which do not have Unicode support should render it as a question mark instead.\n\nThe control word <code>\\uc0</code> can be used to indicate that subsequent Unicode escape sequences within the current group do not specify the substitution character.\n\nUntil RTF specification version 1.5 release in 1997, RTF has only handled 7-bit characters directly and 8-bit characters encoded as hexadecimal (using <code>\\'xx</code>). RTF control words (since RTF 1.5) generally accept signed 16-bit numbers as arguments. Unicode values greater than 32767 must be expressed as negative numbers.<ref name=\"rtf15\" /> If a Unicode character is [[Unicode plane|outside BMP]], it is encoded with a surrogate pair. Support for Unicode was made due to text handling changes in Microsoft Word \u2013 Microsoft Word 97 is a partially Unicode-enabled application and it handles text using the [[UTF-16|16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme]].<ref name=\"rtf15\" /> Microsoft Word 2000 and later versions are Unicode-enabled applications that handle text using the 16-bit Unicode character encoding scheme.<ref name=\"rtf16\" />\n\nRTF files are usually 7-bit ASCII plain text. RTF consists of control words, control symbols, and groups. RTF files can be easily transmitted between PC based operating systems because they are encoded as a [[text file]] with 7-bit [[graphic character|graphic]] ASCII characters. Converters that communicate with Microsoft Word for MS Windows or Macintosh should expect data transfer as 8-bit characters and binary data can contain any 8-bit values.<ref name=\"rtf191\" />\n\n==Human readability==\nRTF is a data format for saving and sharing documents, not a [[markup language]]; it is not intended for intuitive and easy typing by a human.<ref name=\"rtf-pocket-guide\" /><ref name=\"rtf-pocket-scribd\">{{citation |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/15490806/RTF-Pocket-Guide-by-OReilly-Media |title=RTF Pocket Guide by O'Reilly Media  |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> Nonetheless, unlike many word processing formats, RTF code can be [[human-readable]]: when an RTF file containing mostly latin characters without [[diacritic]]s is viewed as a plain [[text file]], the underlying ASCII text is readable, provided that the author has kept formatting concise&nbsp;\u2013 otherwise, the formatting code can impede readability.\n\nWhen RTF was released, most word processors used binary file formats ([[Microsoft Word]] used the [[Doc (computing)|.doc]] file format); RTF was unique in its simple formatting control which allows for a non-RTF aware program (e.g. [[Microsoft Notepad|Notepad]]) to open and provide a readable file. Today, the majority of these programs have changed to a XML-based file format (Word has switched to the [[.docx]] file format). Regardless, these files contain large amounts of formatting code. As such, they are ten or more times larger than the corresponding [[plain text]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://interglacial.com/rtf/ |title=Rich Text Format&nbsp;\u2013 MSWord generates some scary RTF |date=2008-07-12 |author=Sean M. Burke |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref><ref name=\"rtf-pocket-guide\" />  \n\nTo be standard-compliant RTF, non-ASCII characters must be [[#Character encoding|escaped]]. Thus, even with concise formatting, text that uses certain [[dash]]es and [[quotation mark glyphs|quotation marks]] is less legible. Latin languages that make heavy use of characters with [[diacritic]]s, such as \\'f1 for [[\u00f1]] and \\'e9 for [[\u00e9]] are particularly difficult to read in RTF.  Non-[[Latin script|Latin]] [[writing system|scripts]], consisting of characters such as \\u21563 for [[CJK characters|\u543b]], are illegible in RTF.  In addition, from its beginnings, RTF has supported Microsoft [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] embedded objects and Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects, which are not human-readable.\n\n==Common uses and interoperability==\nMost word processing software supports RTF format importing and exporting (following some version of RTF specification), and/or direct editing, often making it a \"common\" format between otherwise incompatible word processing software and operating systems.  These factors contribute to its [[interoperability]], but it will depend on what version of RTF is being used.<ref name=\"e-gov-uk\" /> There are several consciously designed or accidentally born RTF dialects.<ref name=\"ted-rtf\">{{cite web |url=http://ftp.nluug.nl/pub/editors/ted/TedDocument-en_US.html |title=Ted, an easy rich text processor |author=Mark de Does |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref> Most applications that read RTF files silently ignore unknown RTF control words.<ref name=\"ted-rtf\" />\n\nRTF is the internal markup language used by Microsoft Word.<ref name=\"rtf-pocket-guide\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/product-description/0596004753/ref=dp_proddesc_0/277-8520360-9056562?ie=UTF8&n=266239&s=books |title=RTF Pocket Guide |author=Sean M.

(But there are incompatibilities, e.g. between RTF 1.0 1987 and later specifications, or between RTF 1.0-1.4 and RTF 1.5+ in use of Unicode characters.)<ref name=\"wordperfect-dos\">{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/wordtowpdos.html |title=How to Import Microsoft Word Files into WordPerfect for DOS |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abiword.org/help/en-US/info/infoformats.html |title=Abiword Help&nbsp;\u2013 File Formats |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mackichan.com/index.html?techtalk/v30/30ts79.htm~mainFrame |title=Opening Rich Text Format (RTF) files  |accessdate=2010-03-13}}</ref>  This makes it a useful format for basic formatted text documents such as instruction manuals, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, letters, and modest information documents.  These documents at minimum support bold, italic, and underline text formatting.  Also typically supported are left-, center-, and right-aligned text, font specification and document margins.\n\nFont and margin defaults, as well as style presets and other functions vary according to program defaults.  There may also be subtle differences perhaps between different versions of the RTF specification implemented in differing programs and program versions.  Nevertheless, the RTF format is consistent enough from computer to computer to be considered highly portable and acceptable for [[cross-platform]] use. The format supports [[metadata]] such as title, author, etc. but not all implementations support this.\n\n===Objects===\nUse of Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) objects or Macintosh Edition Manager subscriber objects limits the interoperability, because these objects are not widely supported in programs for viewing or editing RTF files (e.g. embedding of other files inside the RTF, such as tables or charts from spreadsheet application).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/47307 |title=FOSS word processors compared: OOo Writer, AbiWord, and KWord |author=Bruce Byfield |date=2005-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-06 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/46599 |title=Sharing files between OpenOffice.org and Microsoft Office |date=2005-07-28 |accessdate=2010-04-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204134005/http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/46599 |archivedate=2010-02-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/153229 |title=SoftMaker Office 2008 focuses on compatibility with Microsoft Office |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/58330 |title=SoftMaker Office 2006 beta: Not a killer app |date=2006-11-21 |accessdate=2010-04-06 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://pacsec.jp/psj06/psj06lagadec-e.pdf |format=PDF |title=OpenOffice / OpenDocument and Microsoft Office 2007 / Open XML security |author=Philippe Lagadec |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref> If a software that understands an OLE object is not available, the object is usually replaced by a picture (bitmap representation of the object) or not displayed at all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keyongtech.com/2560234-ole-object-bitmap-representation |title=OLE object&nbsp;\u2013 bitmap representation? |accessdate=2010-04-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724111954/http://www.keyongtech.com/2560234-ole-object-bitmap-representation |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/edit/COleRichEditCtrl.aspx |title=A Rich Edit Control That Displays Bitmaps and Other OLE Objects |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\n===Pictures===\nRTF supports inclusion of JPEG, Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Enhanced Metafile (EMF), [[Windows Metafile]] (WMF), Apple PICT, Windows Device-dependent bitmap, Windows Device Independent bitmap and OS/2 Metafile picture types in hexadecimal (the default) or binary format in a RTF file. Not all of these picture types are supported in all RTF readers. When a RTF document is opened in software that does not support the picture type of an inserted picture, such picture is not displayed at all.\n\nRTF writers usually convert inserted pictures from an unsupported picture types (e.g. BMP, TIFF, GIF, etc.) to one of supported picture types (PNG, WMF) or they do not include pictures at all.\n\nFor better compatibility with Microsoft products, some RTF writers include the same picture in two different picture types in one RTF file:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/224663/en-us |title=Document file size increases with EMF, PNG, GIF, or JPEG graphics in Word |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>\n* one of the supported picture types (e.g. JPG or PNG)&nbsp;\u2013 it uses either the original format of the inserted graphics file (if this graphics file uses one of RTF-supported formats&nbsp;\u2013 such as PNG, JPG) or a RTF-supported picture type created by RTF writer in conversion from RTF-unsupported graphics file (e.g. conversion from BMP or GIF to PNG)\n* a [[Windows Metafile]] (WMF) copy of the original picture&nbsp;\u2013 for better compatibility with some Microsoft applications (e.g. Wordpad). The Windows Metafile copy is included without any compression.\n\nThis method increases the RTF file size rapidly. The RTF specification does not require this method and there are various implementations that include pictures without the WMF copy (e.g. Abiword or Ted).\n\nFor Microsoft Word it is also possible to set a specific registry value (\"ExportPictureWithMetafile=0\") in order to prevent Word from saving the WMF copy (see link \"Document file size increases with EMF, PNG, GIF, or JPEG graphics in Word\" at the beginning).\n\n===Fonts===\nRTF supports [[font embedding|embedding]] of [[Computer font|fonts]] used in the document, but this feature is not widely supported in software implementations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/275953 |title=Embedded fonts are not displayed as expected in the documents that are saved as RTF in Word |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://list.unm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0504d&L=rtf-l&T=0&F=&S=&P=60 |title=Embedding fonts in RTF file |date=2005-04-23 |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=20370 |title=OpenOffice.org Issue&nbsp;\u2013 MS Interoperability: embedd fonts into the document |accessdate=2010-03-17}}</ref>\n\nRTF also supports generic font family names used for [[font substitution]]: ''roman'' ([[serif]]), ''swiss'' ([[sans-serif]]), ''modern'' ([[monospaced font|monospace]]), ''script'', ''decorative'', ''technical''.<ref name=\"rtf10-txt\" /> This feature is not widely supported for font substitution, e.g. in OpenOffice.org or Abiword.\n\n===Annotations===\nRTF specification supports [[annotation]]s (comments in documents) since version 1.0.<ref name=\"rtf10-txt\" /> RTF 1.7 specification defined some new features for annotations: date stamp (there was previously only \"time stamp\") and parents of annotations.<ref name=\"rtf17\" /> When a RTF document with annotations is opened in an application that does not support RTF annotations, they are not displayed at all. Similarly, when a document with annotations is saved as RTF in an application that does not support RTF annotations, annotations are not preserved in the RTF file. Some implementations may hide annotations by default or require some user action to display them&nbsp;\u2013 e.g. in Abiword since version 2.8 or in IBM Lotus Symphony (up to version 1.3).\n\nMicrosoft products do not support comments within footers, footnotes or headers. Inserting a comment within headers, footers, or footnotes may result in a corrupted RTF document.<ref name=\"rtf191\" />\n\nThe RTF specification also supports footnotes (not to be confused with annotations), which are widely supported in RTF implementations (e.g. in OpenOffice.org, Abiword, KWord, Ted, but not in Wordpad). Endnotes are implemented as a variation on footnotes such that applications that support footnotes and not endnotes will render endnotes in an RTF document as footnotes. Similar to annotations, due to Microsoft products not supporting footnotes in headers, footers, or comments, including footnotes within those contexts in an RTF document may result in a corrupted document.<ref name=\"rtf191\" />\n\n===Drawing objects===\nRTF 1.2 specification defined use of drawing objects such as rectangles, ellipses, lines, arrows, polygons and various other shapes.
