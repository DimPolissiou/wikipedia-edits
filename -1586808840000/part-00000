In February 1676 he came to Moscow, but military officials turned him down. The [[Posolsky Prikaz]] listed him as a visiting foreigner. Le Fort settled in the so-called [[Nemetskaya sloboda]] in Moscow, where he would gain respect among other distinguished foreigners. In July 1678 he once again applied for service in the [[tsarist]] army. Accepted with the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]], Le Fort then went to one of the fronts during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1676\u20131681)|Russo-Turkish War of 1676-1681]]. In early 1679 he was ordered to join the [[Kiev]] garrison under the command of [[Prince]] [[House of Golitsyn|Vasily Golitsyn]] and [[General]] [[Patrick Gordon]]. Upon his return to Moscow from a short trip to Geneva in 1683, Le Fort carried out various [[diplomat]]ic assignments until the fall of 1685.\n\nLe Fort's house gradually turned into a main attraction of the Nemetskaya sloboda, attended not only by locals, but by Russian noblemen, such as the [[Golitsyn family | Golitsyns]]. It appears that Le Fort utilized his connections with the latter and received rapid promotion.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Franz Lefort.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fran\u00e7ois Le Fort]]\nIn 1687 and 1689 he took part in two unsuccessful [[Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689|Crimean campaigns]]. Peter the Great became a frequent guest in Le Fort's house from 1690. Le Fort was one of the principal organizers and participators in [[Toy army of Peter I|Peter's military games]], which would pave the way for his career advancement. In 1690 Le Fort was promoted to the rank of [[major general]]. He then became [[lieutenant general]] (1691) and [[general]] (1693). In 1692 [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] funded the construction of a large reception hall for 1,500 people, which formed an extension to Le Fort's house. This hall hosted administrative meetings and Peter's parties.\n\nIn 1691 Le Fort was put in charge of a [[regiment]] and assigned a training ground on the left bank of the [[Yauza River]]. Peter ordered the construction of a [[sloboda]] for this purpose, which would later be called Lefortovskaya sloboda (the Lefort quarter, present-day [[Lefortovo District|Lefortovo]] in Moscow's [[South-Eastern Administrative Okrug]]). In 1693-1694 Lefort accompanied Peter on his trip to [[Arkhangelsk]]. In 1694 he participated in Peter's \"play\" {{ill|Kozhukhov campaign|ru|\u041a\u043e\u0436\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434}} (a military game in the village of Kozhukhovo, between Moscow and [[Kolomenskoye]]).\n\nDuring the [[Azov campaigns (1695\u201396) | Azov campaigns]] of 1695-1696 Le Fort was in charge of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. His return from the war was marked with a solemn parade through Moscow to his \"native\" Nemetskaya sloboda and subsequent festivities. Lefort was awarded a title of [[governor]] (''\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a'', or [[namestnik]]) of [[Novgorod]] and [[estate (land)|estates]] in two [[uyezd]]s.\n\nIn 1696 Le Fort together with [[Fyodor Alexeyevich Golovin|Fedor Golovin]] and {{ill|Prokopy Voznitsyn|ru|\u0412\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b\u043d, \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} took official charge of Peter's [[Grand Embassy]], a Russian [[diplomatic mission]] to [[Western Europe]]. Upon his return to Moscow in 1698 he took part in the trial of the [[Streltsy Uprising | Streltsy rebels]]. That same year he moved to a custom-built palace, later known as the {{ill|Lefortovsky Palace|ru|\u041b\u0435\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446}}, on the Yauza River. The palace would soon become a center of Russian political and royal life in 1698-1699. Peter the Great used to hold all his important meetings and numerous celebrations in Le Fort's palace. \n\nFran\u00e7ois Le Fort died in [[Moscow]] in early March 1699. Upon hearing the news of his death, Tsar Peter lamented \"Now I am alone without one trusty man. He alone was faithful to me. Whom can I confide in now?\" On March 21 Peter held Lefort's state funeral, a ceremony second only to the funerals of Tsars or Patriarchs.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last1= Massie|first1= Robert K.\n|authorlink1= Robert K.

In February 1676 he came to Moscow, but military officials turned him down. The [[Posolsky Prikaz]] listed him as a visiting foreigner. Le Fort settled in the so-called [[Nemetskaya sloboda]] in Moscow, where he would gain respect among other distinguished foreigners. In July 1678 he once again applied for service in the [[tsarist]] army. Accepted with the rank of [[Captain (land and air)|captain]], Le Fort then went to one of the fronts during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1676\u20131681)|Russo-Turkish War of 1676-1681]]. In early 1679 he was ordered to join the [[Kiev]] garrison under the command of [[Prince]] [[House of Golitsyn|Vasily Golitsyn]] and [[General]] [[Patrick Gordon]]. Upon his return to Moscow from a short trip to Geneva in 1683, Le Fort carried out various [[diplomat]]ic assignments until the fall of 1685.\n\nLe Fort's house gradually turned into a main attraction of the Nemetskaya sloboda, attended not only by locals, but by Russian noblemen, such as the [[Golitsyn family | Golitsyns]]. It appears that Le Fort utilized his connections with the latter and received rapid promotion.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n[[File:Franz Lefort.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Franz Lefort]]\nIn 1687 and 1689 he took part in two unsuccessful [[Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689|Crimean campaigns]]. Peter the Great became a frequent guest in Le Fort's house from 1690. Le Fort was one of the principal organizers and participators in [[Toy army of Peter I|Peter's military games]], which would pave the way for his career advancement. In 1690 Le Fort was promoted to the rank of [[major general]]. He then became [[lieutenant general]] (1691) and [[general]] (1693). In 1692 [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] funded the construction of a large reception hall for 1,500 people, which formed an extension to Le Fort's house. This hall hosted administrative meetings and Peter's parties.\n\nIn 1691 Le Fort was put in charge of a [[regiment]] and assigned a training ground on the left bank of the [[Yauza River]]. Peter ordered the construction of a [[sloboda]] for this purpose, which would later be called Lefortovskaya sloboda (the Lefort quarter, present-day [[Lefortovo District|Lefortovo]] in Moscow's [[South-Eastern Administrative Okrug]]). In 1693-1694 Lefort accompanied Peter on his trip to [[Arkhangelsk]]. In 1694 he participated in Peter's \"play\" {{ill|Kozhukhov campaign|ru|\u041a\u043e\u0436\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434}} (a military game in the village of Kozhukhovo, between Moscow and [[Kolomenskoye]]).\n\nDuring the [[Azov campaigns (1695\u201396) | Azov campaigns]] of 1695-1696 Le Fort was in charge of the [[Imperial Russian Navy]]. His return from the war was marked with a solemn parade through Moscow to his \"native\" Nemetskaya sloboda and subsequent festivities. Lefort was awarded a title of [[governor]] (''\u043d\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a'', or [[namestnik]]) of [[Novgorod]] and [[estate (land)|estates]] in two [[uyezd]]s.\n\nIn 1696 Le Fort together with [[Fyodor Alexeyevich Golovin|Fedor Golovin]] and {{ill|Prokopy Voznitsyn|ru|\u0412\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b\u043d, \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0444\u0438\u0439 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} took official charge of Peter's [[Grand Embassy]], a Russian [[diplomatic mission]] to [[Western Europe]]. Upon his return to Moscow in 1698 he took part in the trial of the [[Streltsy Uprising | Streltsy rebels]]. That same year he moved to a custom-built palace, later known as the {{ill|Lefortovsky Palace|ru|\u041b\u0435\u0444\u043e\u0440\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446}}, on the Yauza River. The palace would soon become a center of Russian political and royal life in 1698-1699. Peter the Great used to hold all his important meetings and numerous celebrations in Le Fort's palace. \n\nFran\u00e7ois Le Fort died in [[Moscow]] in early March 1699. Upon hearing the news of his death, Tsar Peter lamented \"Now I am alone without one trusty man. He alone was faithful to me. Whom can I confide in now?\" On March 21 Peter held Lefort's state funeral, a ceremony second only to the funerals of Tsars or Patriarchs.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|last1= Massie|first1= Robert K.\n|authorlink1= Robert K.
