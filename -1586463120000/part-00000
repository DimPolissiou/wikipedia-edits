The trial ends with them adopting the surname of \"Weatherly\" from all the trials they have weathered, and the story ends with details about how well the new family is doing.\n\n==Production notes==\nInspired by actual events, the film is based on a story featured in ''[[Reader's Digest]]'',<ref name = \"Digest\" >{{Cite journal | last = LeBlanc | first = Rena Dictor | title = RD on TV: Gracie's Choice | journal = Reader's Digest Online | date = September 2006 | url = http://www.rd.com/true-stories/inspiring/rd-on-tv-gracies-choice/ | accessdate = 2012-03-21}}</ref> and is described as being \"sure to touch your heart\".<ref name=\"Lifetime\">{{cite web|title=Gracie's Choice |work=Lifetime Movie Network |url=http://www.mylifetime.com/movies/gracies-choice |accessdate=2012-03-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327221914/http://www.mylifetime.com/movies/gracies-choice |archivedate=2012-03-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''Gracie's Choice'' received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the acting, story, characters, emotional weight, and both Bell and Heche's performances.

Its works were located on the south side of Ontario Street between William and Gore streets on Kingston's waterfront.\n\n==Early beginnings and bankruptcies==\nThe CLC had its beginnings with a number of predecessor businesses. It began business as the ''Ontario Foundry'' in 1848, but after commencing construction of locomotives it became known as the ''Kingston Locomotive Works''. The first [[steam locomotive]] was turned out on Wednesday, December 20, 1854. This was the first of four locomotives for the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] of Canada, which was being built at that time. A further order of five locomotives for the GTR followed in October and November 1856. However, less than three dozen locomotives were built before the business went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] in 1860.\n\nThe ''Canadian Engine & Machinery Company'' was a [[shareholder]]-owned successor [[company (law)|company]] founded in 1865. It too ran into financial troubles during the [[Long Depression|depression]] of 1878-1879 and also went bankrupt. It was re-organized in February 1878 as the ''Canadian Locomotive and Engine Company Ltd.'' (CL&EC). After yet another re-organization in April 1881, the plant was updated and expanded. The [[syndicate]] of [[investors]] who owned the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] also owned a large portion of the CL&EC, and when funds were needed to further work on the CPR, their shares were sold to the respected locomotive builder [[D\u00fcbs and Company]], of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], which eventually gained control effective January 1, 1888. CL&EC became a major supplier to the CPR, delivering nearly one-third of their locomotives over many decades. These \"D\u00fcbs-boilered\" locomotives were regarded as durable and long-lasting.\n\n==CLC is formed and finds modest success==\nIn January 1900, following the decision of both the CPR and the GTR to build their own locomotives, the CL&EC once again became insolvent, and the plant was closed. It was bought by new investors and incorporated in February 1901 as the ''Canadian Locomotive Company Ltd.''  Improvements followed which allowed production of one locomotive per week. Reorganization once again took place under new management in June 1911 although the name remained the same.\n\nCLC contributed to the [[war effort]] in two [[world wars]] by manufacturing [[armaments]] and [[munitions]], as did the competing shops of the [[Montreal Locomotive Works]], the CPR, and others. Large numbers of locomotives were also built for the war effort and for reconstruction afterwards.\n\nBy the end of [[World War II]] steam technology was at its peak, but production was declining except for [[export]]s to [[France]], [[Belgium]] and [[India]]. Its final group of steam locomotives was 120 [[streamliner|streamlined]] [[4-6-2]] types for passenger service in India, in 1955<ref>''What'll You Have - Steam or Diesel?'', ''[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]'' magazine, September 1955</ref>. CLC felt its future lay with [[diesel locomotive]]s, but lacking expertise it sought out opportunities with existing builders in the [[United States]].\n\n==Representing American manufacturers==\n[[File:Toronto Railway Museum Shunter Whitcomb.jpg|thumbnail|left|50-ton Whitcomb switcher manufactured by the Canadian Locomotive Company in 1950, now used at the [[Toronto Railway Museum]]]]\nIn 1948 CLC became the Canadian representative for [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] which also owned [[Whitcomb Locomotive Works]]. However, the result of this collaboration was less than outstanding &mdash; the Whitcomb locomotives built for the [[Canadian National Railway]] with Sterling diesel engines proved problematic, and orders for Baldwin-designed locomotives were modest. CLC then turned to [[Fairbanks-Morse]], a manufacturer of [[opposed piston]] diesel engines primarily used in [[Shipping|maritime]] applications that was itself attempting to break into the railway locomotive market.  Baldwin's shares in CLC were acquired in 1950 by the newly formed Canadian Fairbanks Morse.  Orders were more extensive and longer-lasting, especially for the [[FM H-24-66|Train Master]] and [[FM Consolidated line|Consolidated line]] designs.  However, the Fairbanks-Morse designs proved to be no match in the marketplace for the [[Alco|ALCO]]-designed locomotives offered by the Montreal Locomotive Works or to the [[Electro-Motive Diesel|Electro-Motive Division]]-designs constructed by [[General Motors Diesel]].  By 1957, orders had fallen off and Fairbanks-Morse eventually left the locomotive business in both Canada and the United States.  Following the departure of Baldwin and MLW, the Canadian market was left to just two companies, [[GE Transportation Systems|General Electric]] and General Motors Diesel.\n\nBefore this however, CLC also sought more opportunities in the export market with the involvement of [[government agency|government agencies]], exporting small [[industry|industrial]] locomotives of [[Davenport Locomotive Works|Davenport-Besler]] design. In 1955 CLC bought the Davenport-Besler Corp. Inc., including its inventory of [[H. K. Porter, Inc|Porter]] locomotives. A Canadian-only DTC (Diesel Torque Converter) was built for the CPR featuring a diesel-[[hydraulic]] design rather than the conventional [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]].\n\nOn July 26, 1965 CLC became ''Fairbanks-Morse (Canada) Ltd.'' and was no longer an independent Canadian company. Locomotive construction dwindled even further as the company branched out into industrial machinery such as marine engines and weigh scales. None of this could save the company.\n\n==End of CLC==\nDeclining business and a [[labour union|union]] [[Strike action|strike]] in April 1969 closed the plant that June. It was demolished in August 1971 after having constructed over 3000 locomotives from its earliest beginnings, making it at the time, Canada's second largest commercial builder after Montreal Locomotive Works.\n\nThe site of the old plant (known as \"Block D\") sat vacant for 35 years while several proposed developments failed to materialize or obtain municipal approval. It would be the last vacated portion of Ontario Street's formerly industrial waterfront to be developed. After work to negate the effects of a century of industrial pollutants in the soil, it has recently been redeveloped with three high-rise apartment/condominium buildings (Locomotive Apartments, Carruthers Wharf, and Royal George), a high-rise hotel (Marriott Residences Inn), and a small municipal park (Battery Park).\n\n==Clients==\n\n* [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]\n* [[Canadian National Railway]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | title = Constructed in Kingston: A History of the Canadian Locomotive Companies 1854 to 1968 | author = Mc.Queen, Donald R.| year = 2000 | publisher = Canadian Railroad Historical Association, Kingston Division | isbn = 0-9698285-1-9 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Canadian Locomotive Company locomotives}}\n* [http://trainweb.org/oldtimetrains/CLC/history.htm Canadian Locomotive Company]\n* [http://members.shaw.ca/cprclc/ Canadian Pacific Railway CLC Locomotives]\n{{CLC diesels}}\n{{NA Loco builders}}\n\n[[Category:Locomotive manufacturers of Canada]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Kingston, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Transport in Kingston, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of Canada]]\n[[Category:Rolling stock manufacturers of Canada]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1901]]\n[[Category:1901 establishments in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1969]]\n[[Category:1969 disestablishments in Ontario]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=February 2016}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name        = Canadian Locomotive Company\n| logo        = \n| image       = Canadian Pacific Railway -8010.jpg\n| image_size  = \n| image_alt   = \n| image_caption = A Canadian Locomotive Company [[Baldwin DRS-4-4-1000]] in [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] livery.\n| type        = \n| industry    = rail transport\n| fate        = dissolved\n| predecessors = {{plainlist|\n* Ontario Foundry\n* Kingston Locomotive Works\n* Canadian Engine & Machinery Company\n* Canadian Locomotive and Engine Company Ltd.\n}}\n| successor   = <!-- or: | successors = -->\n| founded     = February 1878<!-- if known: {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD}} in [[city]], [[state]], [[country]] -->\n| founder     = <!-- or: | founders = -->\n| defunct     = April 1969<!-- {{End date|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n| hq_location_city = [[Kingston, Ontario]]\n| hq_location_country = [[Canada]]\n| area_served = North America<!-- or: | areas_served = -->\n| key_people  = \n| products    = [[locomotive]]s\n| owner       = <!-- or: | owners = -->\n| num_employees = \n| num_employees_year = <!-- Year of num_employees data (if known) -->\n| parent      = \n}}\nThe '''Canadian Locomotive Company''', commonly referred to as '''CLC''', was a [[Canada|Canadian]] manufacturer of [[railway]] [[locomotive]]s located in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]].

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

His father was a painter<ref>Giancarlo Francesconi, by E. Tadini, Milano, Salone Annunciata, 1959</ref> who edited Il Corriere dei piccoli and conceived Il Corriere dei ragazzi,<ref>Sergio Badino, Conversazione con Carlo Chendi. Da Pepito alla Disney e oltre: cinquant'anni di fumetto vissuti da protagonista, Tenu\u00e9 2006</ref> while his mother, an advertiser, created a number of famous advertising campaigns. Francesconi spent his early years in QT8, a working class quarter in Milan that rose up alongside a huge pile of post-war rubble which would later become Monte Stella. At the age of five, won over by a concert by Svjatoslav Richter, he began to learn the piano. Although he was accepted into the junior high school section of the city's conservatory six years later, he instinctively pulled out, thinking that it was too academic and conventional. Instead,  even though he had in the meantime moved with his family to a more central quarter of Milan, Francesconi opted to attend the junior high school in QT8. In this way from a very early age his relationship with music and life in general took on a course of responsibility and constant choice, of research and direct experimentation.\n\n== Education ==\n''We need to profoundly rethink and filter in a determined way the enormously rich potential that has been elaborated in the past and to use it for expressive purposes.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA.  La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, edited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\nFrancesconi returned to the Conservatory of Milan in 1974, while he was still attending the Berchet Classical Languages High School, and explored the length and breadth of the musical landscape, taking an interest in every possible dimension of sound.<ref name=\"auto1\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - Appendix VII (2007)</ref> He played in jazz and rock groups as well as in classical concerts, he worked as a session man in recording studios, and he composed music for theatre, cinema, advertising, and television. These were all rewarding experiences, not least from an economic point of view, but they were not enough. He realised that a truly living language, while looking at the present, draws its lifeblood from its roots. The time had come for him to dig into the tradition of music to which he belonged. The Milan Conservatory was opening more and more space to contemporary music so Francesconi enrolled in the composition course conducted by Azio Corghi. \"From him I learnt the trade, the fundamentals, counterpoint and those things, professional seriousness and open-mindedness.\"<ref>Ricciarda Belgiojoso, \"Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi\", Postmedia Books, 2013</ref> In the meantime he continued to explore electronic music and in 1977 took time out to immerse himself in jazz at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\n=== A student of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]===\n''The mountain is in front of us and it is necessary to pass over it, with enormous force and patience. It's not enough just to contemplate it nor to sneak by it via secondary paths much less go backwards claiming that the mountain is not there.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA. La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, \u00e9dited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\n[[Donnerstag aus Licht]] went on stage at the [[Teatro alla Scala]] in Milan in 1981. Stockhausen is a historical reference point: Francesconi admired him for his extraordinary organisational consistency, for his tireless search for a linguistic unity. He was also deeply struck by the visionary quality of this initial opera. He wanted to observe the composer at work so he enrolled in the intensive course that Stockhausen held in Rome that same year. \"From him I learnt rigor, at first imbibing it by osmosis, and then demythologising it.\"<ref>Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia Books, 2013</ref>[7]\n\n=== Meeting and collaboration with [[Luciano Berio]] ===\n''Luciano didn't talk much about the more 'technical' and delicate aspects of his work as a composer. I remember that when he least expected it, I would fire questions at him point blank, hoping to pick up some tips. His replies were like enigmas. They had something sacral about them and they required divining rituals to decode them.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Per Luciano, Centro studi Luciano Berio, www.lucianoberio.org</ref>\nWith Berio Francesconi studied above all in the field, just like the workshop artisans of old, acting as his assistant from 1981 to 1984. He worked directly on the score of ''La vera storia'' and participated in the production as rehearsal pianist and second conductor/substitute maestro. In 1984 he collaborated with the composer in the rewriting of Monteverdi's ''Orfeo''. He was also present with Berio at Tanglewood where he attended one of his famous summer courses.\n\n== Activities, works, research ==\n\nIn 1984 three of Francesconi's pieces, including ''Passacaglia'', for large orchestra (1982), were selected for the [[Gaudeamus International Composers Award]] in Amsterdam. This first important recognition on the international scene created a useful tie with the Dutch music scene and laid the foundation for further commissions. Meanwhile, in Italy, thanks to a commission from the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari, Francesconi had the opportunity to seriously put into practice for the first time his idea of a \"polyphony of languages\": ''Suite 1984''. The polyphony that I have in mind hasn't got anything to do with the \"postmodern\" or collage, the exotic pastiche, the provincial chinoiserie of our grandparents (but also of Stockhausen and certain pop groups). Instead, it is a free fusion of ideas in a compact and linguistically very solid body that reveals its profound energies in its inner profundity and not in an exterior heterogeneity. Energies that come from the earth, from popular culture, from ancient African and Oriental cultures.<ref name=\"auto5\">Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in AA.VV.

Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\"In 1984 the Teatro Lirico in Cagliari presented a quartet made up of the pianist and composer [[Franco D'Andrea]] together with the group Africa Djol\u00e9 led by the master percussionist Fode Youla from Guinea. The idea was then conceived that the music of this group be recreated in symphonic form (''Suite 1984'') by the 28 year-old Luca Francesconi for a performance by the theatre's orchestra under the direction of Francesconi himself, a recent product of rigorous musical studies, assistant to Luciano Berio and 'jazz student of D'Andrea', as he used to like to define himself. The concert attracted experts from all over the place anxious to hear novelties and promising syncretisms of various musical civilisations, and it was a triumph.\"<ref name=\"auto7\">Franco Fayenz, Si chiude la ribalta della Scala per Quartett, antologia di soluzioni geniali, Il Sole 24 ore, May 8th 2011</ref> \"Orchestra, African percussionists and jazz quintet: the choice of instrumental make-up itself contained in an explicit manner the generative nucleus of one of the principal aesthetic motors of the music of Luca Francesconi: the tendency to place alongside one another, following the rules of contrast and fusion, sounds and languages of highly diverse origins.\"<ref>Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani- VII Appendix (2007)</ref>\n\n=== 1984-1990 ===\n\nFrancesconi's first record, an LP recorded in the United States, contained ''Viaggiatore insonne'', on a text by [[Sandro Penna]]. \"Francesconi's attitude as a composer is in fact similar to that of a tireless traveller, who explores linguistic spaces in search of their ever shifting confines, and who conducts an etiological study to determine the confines between noise and sound, between instinct and reason.\"<ref name=\"auto3\">Robert Coheur, A fuoco, 4\u00b0 studio sulla memoria, www.modernmusix.com</ref>\nThe new piece ''Vertige'', for string orchestra, was performed in Strasbourg. Francesconi composed various works for ensemble which were performed in Cagliari (''Onda sonante'', for eight instruments, commissioned by the Nieuw Ensemble; conductor: Ed Spanjaard (1985)), Paris (''Tracce'', for flute (1986)), Citt\u00e0 di Castello (''Da cap''o, for nine instruments (1988)), Middelburg (Finta-di-nulla, for soprano and nineteen instruments on a text by Umberto Fiori; Xenakis Ensemble; conductor: Diego Masson; and soprano: Marie Duisit (1991)), and Brussels (''Encore/Da capo'', for 9 instruments; Ictus Ensemble, conducted by the composer (1995)).\nIn 1984 [[Casa Ricordi]] became Francesconi's publisher and since then has published all his works.\nIn 1985 he was invited to the Festival Musica \u2018900 in Trent for a series of public conversations with [[Franco Donatoni]]. This meeting proved extremely important; talking with the great Verona composer, both in their public conversations and during train trips together, Francesconi felt that he reached a solution for a number of unresolved problems. ''Plot in fiction'', dedicated to Franco Donatoni, was in many ways the happy outcome of this experience.\n\n=== Plot in Fiction ===\n\n''The really difficult thing is to write works with a rich and articulated complex of meanings and events: works, that is, that are capable of assuming a linguistic structure, of being a world (Mahler!), but whose complexity is transparent.''<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''Plot in Fiction'', for oboe and cor anglais or clarinet and chamber group (1986), constructs its sonoric line around key notes within a rigorous formal framework.<ref name=\"auto\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia italiana Treccani, VII Appendix, 2007</ref> \"The point here is to find the \"plot\" in the \"fiction\", the narrative line that twists and turns through the complexity and intricacy of a \"mass of everyday symbols\".<ref>Christopher Thomas, Metier, msvcd 92018, www.divineartrecords.com</ref> What's involved is an architecture that guides the listener within the composition: the search for a compositional transparency (without, however, ever slipping into simplicity; the means employed leave unaltered the quality of the composer's thought), based on pure energy, directly perceptible, without any need to exhibit the mechanisms underlying it.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The piece was performed for the first time at the Festival Musica '900 in Trent by Ensemble Musique Oblique under the direction of Sandro Gorli; the soloist was Diego Dini Ciacci.\n\n=== Mambo ===\n\nAt this point I would say that it is no longer possible to talk of a language devoid of code or morphogenesis, i.e. of a language that comes into being while the aesthetic event is being produced. It's necessary to also come to terms with a substratum, with what I call semantic pressure, that is with history.<ref name=\"auto4\">Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia books, 2013</ref>\n\nMambo, for solo piano, is Francesconi's most jazz-like piece, and it reveals clearly his search for an ever uneasy equilibrium between sonoric materials, gathered in their primitive state, and the evocative power of history, from which the composer cannot remove himself. In the piece there is an overlap of a rhythmic ostinato in a low register, a series of ascending-descending diatonic lines, and, finally, a sequence of pounding 4-note chords. In this continual 'friction of contraries' resides the aesthetic motor of Francesconi's music as well as the powerful charge of sonoric seduction that his works carry.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Francesconi exploits as a precious resource the capacity for intense analysis developed in Western culture. He takes a shared musical reference and dissects it remorselessly until he lays bare further possibilities of development, of transformation. Wielding its 'semantic pressure' as though it were a picklock, he presses further and further inwards, towards the energy-bearing roots of sound.\n\n=== AGON, centre for music research and experimentation ===\n\nIt's important for composers to confront the use of computers face-on; even empirically, at a basic level. To search for, study, and promote new means through which to communicate with them, new interfaces. It's important for them to help to lead mankind back to the centre of his machines.<ref>Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, Milano 1994</ref>\n\nIn 1990 Francesconi founded AGON with two great utopian visions in mind. The first was that it is still possible and desperately important to work together, cooperatively, imagining projects to realise together with others, to exchange experiences, ideas. AGON came into being as an organism with a public identity: \"it is not my or your studio\"; it aspires to be a place where it's possible to talk, meet, and not just pursue one's own interest. The second utopian idea was to start from below and not from high-tech; to depart from the musical needs of composers with a view to stimulating a different relationship, simpler, \"less terroristic\", between real musicians and machines.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Handling electronics also serves, according to Francesconi, to recuperate a physical, auditive approach to musical composition, which, if limited to paper and pencil, runs the risk of becoming too speculative, weakening the direct relationship with the sonoric material.<ref name=\"auto8\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - VII Appendice (2007)</ref> AGON has for many years been one of the most active centres in Italy for music research and production.<ref name=\"auto8\"/>\n\n=== Riti neurali ===\n\n''Complexity is always a question of quality, not quantity. What really matters is transparency in an overall density. This means that I should only make use of a particularly articulated syntax if I really need to, or, in other words, only if I've got particularly articulated things to say.''<ref name=\"auto2\">Luca Francesconi, Complessit\u00e0, Milan 1989</ref>\n\nComposed in 1991, for violin and eight instruments, ''Riti neurali'' is Francesconi's third study on memory. Like many of his works, it develops the material on multiple levels, pursuing labyrinthine paths. Nonetheless, its clearly delineated textures offer the listener unmistakable points of reference.<ref>Beth E. Levy, Furious Craft, 8 December 2008, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Forum, Music program, San Francisco Contemporary Music Players</ref> The soloist establishes a vast array of relations with the small orchestra (guiding it, allowing himself to be guided, contradicting it, ignoring it, etc.), at the same time assuming various positions himself ... The complexity of the counterpoint arises out of the simultaneity of the various positions.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> \"There are things that evoke other things, or that acquire meaning in relation to other things. We are subjected, in a certain sense, to a historically determined perceptive destiny. Whether we want to be or not. The illusion of the tabula rasa, of pure transparency, is not enough. Probably it's better to take account of this perceptive problem right from the start and to consider it one of the compositional parameters.\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/> The work was commissioned by Radio France and the world premiere took place in Paris on 14 January 1992: [[Asko Ensemble]]; conductor: Denis Cohen, and soloist: Irvine Arditti.\nWhile a series of performances followed on from one another in Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, and Antwerp, an extensive portrait at the Venice Biennale, in 1993, definitively consolidated Francescon's reputation in Italy as well: the Nieuw Ensemble Amsterdam, Arditti and Ensemble Modern (with the newly commissioned Plot II) joined forces in a single concert dedicated to the composer's music at the Teatro La Fenice.\n\n=== Etymo ===\n\n''The great challenge is to maintain in the composer the two levels, the compositional and the emotive, and to ensure that these continually charge each other with responsibility for the form of the work up until in the end they arrive at a balanced result.''<ref>Massimiliano Viel, Incontro con Luca Francesconi: Il calcolo e l'intuizione. L'elettronica come sfida, in Sonus, Materiali per la musica contemporanea, issue n.11, December 1993</ref>\n\nBetween 1993 and 1994 Francesconi worked and taught in Paris in the hyper-technological workshop [[Ircam]], where \"you model sound with your hands\". On commission from Ircam, he carried out computer analysis on sounds and their behaviour right down to their roots, their etymon, to realise \"one of the most convincing and at the same time impetuous musical equivalents of the writing of Baudelaire, striving with clarity of mind to achieve a secure control over the insidious relationship between words and music.\"<ref>David Osmonde Smith, 'Un no man's land fertile: Francesconi et le th\u00e9\u00e2tre musical', in Musica program for Luca Francesconi, Ballata, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, Brussels, October 2002.</ref>\nThe piece is based almost entirely on [[Baudelaire]]'s poem ''Le Voyage'', of which at two points we hear the soprano declaim two key fragments: \"Dites, qu'avez-vous vu?\" (Speak, what have you seen?). The computer analysis of this question constitutes the DNA that structures the entire piece, from the microstructure to the macroform.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The result is a multi-levelled organism that in 25 minutes lays out its basic material (phonemes, instrumental particles, electronic transformation) and then proceeds to join it all together in increasingly complex structures. Everything begins with a question on the origin of meaning (in Greek: \"etymon\"). What is there before the word, and what models language? And finally, what allows us to transcend language? In the beginning there is pre-language, its premises. Etymo, a work furnished with huge white wings, starts out with the primordial mumblings of language, in phonemes. Nothing is intelligible, alliterations that roll off and slip away (or fluctuate) and an orchestra that appears suspended, as if it were waiting. These phonetic and musical particles aggregate in a contrapuntal overlapping which in the end explodes in an ocean of profundity from which the first words arise.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> An important example of how Francesconi employs electronics in a masterly way to broaden the expressive range and colour of instruments. The physicality of the performance remains at the centre of the work, but the electronics helps it to reach an extreme expressive intensity.<ref>Hubert Culot, Music Web International, Review of Etymo, Da capo, A fuoco, Animus, Kairos</ref>\n''A fuoco ''(1995) is Francesconi's fourth study on memory; ''Animus'', for trombone and computer (1996), was performed in Paris, while the London Sinfonietta took ''Plot in fiction'' to Santa Cecilia in Rome (1996).\n\n=== Wanderer ===\n\n''The effort to formalise creative thought and thought as a whole is extremely important for composers as well, but by the same token the \"analogical\" and qualitative approach of the artist helps to play down their relationship with technological instruments and above all to reaffirm the impossibility of discretising, quantifying human experience; the impossibility of converting into binary code and sending via fibre optic cable the sum total of existence, the totality of aesthetic experience, of the body, of affection, of the world.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, MIlan 1994</ref>\n\nOn 17 January 2000 [[Riccardo Muti]] conducted ''Wanderer'' at the Scala in Milan. \"This voyager is man who, after conducting an inventory of the generations that have preceded him, takes with him only the bare essentials to set out on a path towards the immensity of possible spaces. At the dawn of the new millennium Luca Francesconi frees himself from the crushing weight of tradition, especially that generated by serialism and its worshipers. After extensive research into tempo, into tempi, one might say, into sonoric texture, the composer here explores a type of language that favours narration.<ref name=\"auto6\">Wanderer - Cobalt, Scarlet : two colours of dawn, http://www.lamediatheque.be/travers_sons/0103ag01.html</ref>\n\n=== Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colours of Dawn ===\n\n''Music is closer than any other form of expression to that nucleus of \"existential energy\" that lives deep within us.''<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n2000 was also the year of Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colors of Dawn. \"A single movement of twenty three minutes for large orchestra divided into parallel - at times counterpoised \u2013 groups begins with a pianissimo of metallic gleams that emanate alternately from the two sides of the stage. Then, other percussion instruments, wind instruments and brass instruments, join in<!--not a mistake--> in a subdued manner, developing, transforming planes of volume and colour. But it is an unexpected metallic accent exploding like a burst of profundity that fills the auditorium not so much with clamour as with presence, rapture.\"<ref>Chris Pasles, Old works and new shine equally bright, Los Angeles Times, November 22nd 2003</ref> \"With this composition Luca Francesconi reached a turning point in his career, enriching his exploration into the heart of sonoric material with greater sensibility and emotivity. In this way his music acceded to a broader artistic dimension, that of a harmonious encounter of technique and psychology in the broadest sense of the term.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n== Music theatre ==\n\nFrom 1985 to the present Luca Francesconi has composed eight works of a theatrical stamp, from ''Scene'', on a text by Umberto Fiori, to the chamber opera In ''Ostaggio'', from ''Lips, Eyes Bang'', for actress/singer, twelve instruments and live audio/video, to the video-opera Striaz. ''Ballata'',  commissioned by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de La Monnaie in Brussels/di Bruxelles and with stage direction by Achim Freyer, was staged in 2002.\n\n=== Ballata ===\n''My idea was to turn over a new leaf, to free myself so to speak from the 20th century. I wanted to use all the expressive densities that that century conceded to me, and for me it was a kind of synthesis of the musical experiences that had struck me most.''<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nIn 1994 Luca Francesconi had realised an opera for radio (and eventual winner of the Prix Italia), ''Ballata del rovescio del mondo'', on a text by Umberto Fiori; in 1996 his continuing, close collaboration with the Milan poet resulted in his third work for music theatre, ''Ballata'', drawn from [[Samuel Coleridge]]'s  [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]. Divided into two acts, ''Ballata'' makes use of a large orchestra with an enlarged percussion section; on the right of the stage is an instrumental ensemble inspired by Gypsy orchestras, while four female choirs distributed at the four angles of the auditorium \"function as walls that open and close towards the irrational, memory, towards flashbacks\". Electronic sounds elaborated at Ircam<ref>Anne Genette, Ballata, www.lamediatheque.</ref> contribute to the spatial disorientation. Originally, for the role of the ancient mariner, Francesconi had thought of Sting, with whom he had recorded the first song of the opera ''Day After Day''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> In the end, however, the collaboration did not eventuate for reasons of language (Sting did not feel up to singing and acting in Italian), but the idea remained of a present-day narrator who, like the ancient mariner, is condemned to wander around the globe in search of someone to whom to recount his incredible adventures, from shipwreck to the glaciers of the South Pole, from the scorching sun of the equator to the appearance of monsters and a phantomatic sailing ship. The temporal plane is split: on stage the ancient mariner tells his story and at the same time he appears as a young man in the midst of a storm. Various compositional techniques follow on from one another, from early expressionism onwards, integrated with other traditions, like folk music. \"Luca Francesconi develops an orchestral writing that is inventive, sensual and seductive all at the same time, deftly integrating electronic resources elaborated by Ircam. But, much more, he makes masterful use of an armoury of ardent vocality that is seasoned but anything but worn-out \u2013 from Brecht's spoken song to Monteverdi's madrigal, passing from the songs of English Baroque opera to all the immortals of Italian lyric opera, from Verdi to Berio, of whom he was a student.\"<ref>Marie-Aude Roux, Ballata, drame syncretique de Francesconi, Le Monde, November 14th, 2002</ref>\n\n=== Buffa opera ===\n\n''Who said that music today necessarily has to create angst? It's enough to think that Albanese used to come running onto the stage pursued by a cigarette two and half metres tall.''<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\n''Buffa opera'', a piece inspired by [[opera buffa]] on a text by [[Stefano Benni]], went on stage at the Piccolo Teatro di Milano in 2002. It featured [[Antonio Albanese]] on stage for the whole opera as actor/singer alongside the chorus and the Buffa orchestra, a fully-fledged character, conducted by the composer himself. In it, the world was seen from the perspective of insects and spiders; Benni's libretto used surrealistic metaphors. Francesconi, who had been known for more dramatic or tragic work, composed music that employed a wide variety of styles, including jazz, avant-garde, and canzonetta, in a parodic manner. ''Buffa opera'' was later revived at the Teatro Morlacchi in Perugia.<ref>Anna Bandettini, L'umanit\u00e0 salvata da uno scarafaggio, Repubblica, May 11th  2002</ref><ref>Enrico Girardi, Musica buffa per insetti, Corriere della sera, May 22nd 2002</ref>\n\nCommissioned by the Holland Festival, ''Gesualdo Considered as a Murderer'', on a libretto by Vittorio Sermonti, was performed for the first time in Amsterdam in June 2004.

An adaptation of a text by [[Heiner M\u00fcller]] drawn in its turn from [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]'s [[Les liaisons dangereuses]], it was jointly commissioned by Teatro alla Scala, Wiener Festwochen and Ircam. The libretto, by the composer, is in English, a language whose syncretism Francesconi felt aligned with his taste in musical syncretism.<ref name=\"auto7\"/> The composer and reviewers described it as a cynical and violent work, whose only two characters are a man and a woman, with some sort of past together, in a room.<ref>Quartett - interview to Luca Francesconi, Teatro alla Scala, Season 2010/2011</ref><ref>[[Tom Service]], Luca Francesconi: do you dare go to his opera?, The Guardian, 19 June 2014</ref>\n\nThe opera has a single act, thirteen scenes, and lasts a total of an hour and twenty minutes. Only two characters on stage, a small orchestra in the orchestra pit, a large orchestra and choir off-stage (available as a recording effected at the Scala in Milan), and electronics (Studio Ircam, Serge Lemouton: live and pre-recorded sounds).\nThe stage direction at the Scala was entrusted to Alex Olle of [[La Fura dels Baus]], who concentrated the action in a huge box suspended twelve metres above the stage, projecting onto the full breadth of the backdrop videos representing the outside world. Allison Cook, mezzo-soprano, interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil, alternating with Sinead Mulhern; Robin Adams, baritone, was Vicomte de Valmont. The conductor was Susanna M\u00e4lkki. This production was revived in 2012 in Vienna (Wiener FestWochen: conductor: Peter Rundel), in 2013 at the Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam (the opening of the Holland Festival; conductor: Susanna M\u00e4lkki) and at the Opera di Lille (Ensemble Ictus: conductor: Georges-Elie Octors), and in 2014 in Lisbon (Gulbenkian Foundation: conductor: Susanna M\u00e4lkki).\n\n''Quartett'' was performed in concert form at the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris by Ensemble Intercontemporain (March 2013). A first new production was staged in Porto and Strasburg, once again with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, and with Remix Ensemble under the direction of Brad Lubman. The stage direction, scenery and costumes were by Nuno Carinhas and the lighting by Nuno Meira (Casa da Musica in Porto on 24 September 2013 and Festival Musica in Strasburg on 28 September 2013).\n\nThe opera was produced again in London by the Royal Opera House in a coproduction with the Op\u00e9ra di Rouen and the London Sinfonietta, from 18 to 28 June 2014, with stage direction by John Fulljames. Two casts alternated for the ten performances (Leigh Melrose and Kristin Ch\u00e1vez; and Mark Stone and Angelica Voje) on the metallic structures of a post-atomic bunker realised by Soutra Gilmour, with lighting by Bruno Poet and videos by Ravi Deepres projected onto tattered screens dropped from above in the restrained atmosphere of the Linbury Studio. Under the structures warm and dim lights lit up the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Andrew Gourlay.\n\nIn 2015 the Malm\u00f6 Opera presented a fourth production. It was directed by Stefan Johansson, with scenery by Jan Lundberg. Kirstin Chavez interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil and Christian Miedl Vicomte de Valmont; the conductor was Ralf Kircher.\n\nThe La Fura  del Baus production was performed again in Buenos Aires, [[Col\u00f3n Theater]], in June 2015, with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, director Alex Olle, conductor Brad Lubman. \"The press wasn't indifferent at all: \"La Fura dels Baus strikes in America as well\" (El Pa\u00eds); \"An high voltage opera\" (Clar\u00edn); \"To the limits of the opera\" (La Naci\u00f3n); \"Portrait of a crippled bourgeoisie\" (P\u00e1gina 12). \"Quartett: a wonderful and yet very demanding opera\" (\u00c1mbito Financiero).<ref>Alexander Destuet, Quartett de Luca Francesconi: la Fura dels Baus ataca otra vez, La Vanguardia  July 3rd 2015</ref>\n\n== The Venice Biennale ==\nToday's semantic dictionary can put us in contact with other cultures, embolden us to recuperate magmatic sonorities.

His imprint was immediately recognisable in the themes of the four festivals (\"Roots/Future\", \"The body of sound\", \"Don Giovanni and the man of stone\" and \"Mutants\") and it broadened out further in the conception of the festival as the ideal place \"to seek new and different forms of perception and attention.\"<ref>Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 30th 2010</ref> Beyond the confines of concert halls and theatres, listeners freely chose how to approach the music, which was disseminated through the city as though on a stage in movement, accessible and without limits. This was the basic idea behind Exit, the celebratory evening/night that brought each of the four festivals to a close, transforming the Teatro alle Tese into a distended human body (Exit 02), \"an experience with variable geometry, a new way of living space, sound and time from sunset to dawn\",<ref>Giacomo Botteri, La ricerca dei valori e delle idealit\u00e0 perdute, domenica 19 ottobre 2008, www.nonsolocinema.it</ref> or inviting the public to take a boat towards the Island of San Michele to pay homage to Stravinsky in the form of three clarinet pieces at his tomb and to then participate in a banquet that evoked the finale of Don Giovanni. Don Giovanni was also at the heart of one of the most famous experiments in this four-year period: \"Palazzo Pisani, home of the B. Marcello Conservatory, is the site chosen for the staging of Don Giovanni a Venezia, conceived by Francesconi himself. For this initiative, which has been defined as an opera-labyrinth, the public is asked not just to exercise its sensibility but also its intelligence, so as to try to create a kind of gap between space and time in which music can be inserted. After scrapping the old structure of the concert, Francesconi borrows three key scenes from Mozart's original \u2013 the duel between Don Giovanni and the Commendatore, the seduction of Zerlina and the death of Don Giovanni \u2013 and puts them on stage cyclically, in three different locations within the ancient Venetian palace, inserting in the loggie, palace rooms and courtyards another eight original pieces commissioned from contemporary composers. The spectator, as if he were to enter into a huge gallery and to decide autonomously how and what to look at, will have before his eyes a plurality of musical, scenic, theatrical and visual events to combine, putting aside the perceptive habits of space and time.\"<ref>Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 16th 2010</ref>\n\n== Teaching ==\n\nLuca Francesconi has taught for twenty five years in Italy's conservatories and at the University of Ohio, in Rotterdam and in Strasburg. He has held master classes throughout Europe and the world, from Japan to the United States, from China to Canada. Until 2019 he has taught composition at the [[Malm\u00f6 Academy of Music]] (part of [[Lund University]]), where he directed the composition department.\n\n== Other collaborations ==\n\n2000 marked two other important experiences.

Performed in Stockholm in February 2014, in Turin in May 2014 and in June 2015 for the BBC Proms. \u00abIt was well worth the wait. As the title suggests, Francesconi's concerto takes the idea of the Duende, the dark, demonic spirit of flamenco, as its starting point, but the music never seems simplistically pictorial or programmatic. Instead, with the violin as protagonist, the five movements (the last two merged seamlessly together) evoke a threatening world of extremes, of heightened emotions and dramatically contrasted colours and registers. The orchestra weaves febrile webs around solo writing whose cracked arpeggios and steep scales manage to be more or less traditionally virtuosic within musical contexts that are anything but conventional, especially in the ferocious cadenza at the heart of the final movement. Josefowicz's playing was immensely committed and astoundingly vivid, and it emerged in even sharper, more subtle focus in the Radio 3 recording, which also resolved many of the textures that had seemed rather blurred in the hall.\u00bb<ref>Andrew Clements, Prom 13: BBCSO/M\u00e4lkki/Josefowicz review \u2013 committed and astoundingly vivid, The Guardian, July 28th 2015</ref>\n\n''Duende'' was ranked number 6 in the Guardian's list of the top 10 classical concerts and operas of 2015<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/16/top-10-classical-concerts-opera-2015|title=The top 10 classical concerts and operas of 2015|first1=Andrew|last1=Clements|first2=Guardian|last2=music|date=December 16, 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Dentro non ha tempo ===\n\"Curious, that title, 'Dentro non ha tempo'.

On May 23 world premiere in Amsterdam, [[Concertgebouw]], Calefax Reed Quintet: Oliver Boekhoorn (oboe), Ivar Berix (clarinet), Raaf Hekkema (saxophone), Jelte Althuis (bass clarinet) and Alban Wesly (bassoon). Radio Filharmonisch Orkest, conductor Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4. The 'vertical invader' to which the title refers is a metaphor for a connection that is true and profoundly desired - as opposed to the false relationships presented by mass media - a synchronicity that in music is as perennially elusive as it is in the world.<ref name=\"auto9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.umpgclassical.com/en-GB/News/2015/09/Francesconi.aspx|title=Pappano, Rundel and Storgards conduct Francesconi|website=www.umpgclassical.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Macchine in echo ===\n\nOn October 2, the WDR Sinfonieorchester Cologne performed the world premiere of Luca Francesconi's ''Macchine in Echo'' at the Philharmonie in Cologne under the direction of Peter Rundel in collaboration with the piano duo GrauSchumacher. The piece was commissioned by the WDR, the Strasbourg MUSICA festival, and Wiener Konzerthaus. (The Strasbourg MUSICA festival presented the French premiere on 3 October at the closing concert of the festival's 33rd edition.)<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\n\"When two pianos are involved, we can imagine them as two, frighteningly powerful, fiendish machines. With this piece, in addition to the two pianos, there's also a symphonic orchestra: I love the play of mirrors and the spell-binding multiplications of two pianos in unison with an orchestra. It's an infinite source of meanings: meanings that I need to find, in spite of the destructuration of reality all around us. In a small gesture towards this powerful resistance, I have incorporated a brief homage to Luciano Berio's Concerto for Two Pianos, one of the pieces that have left a profound mark on my life.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ricordi.com/it-IT/|title=Ricordi|website=www.ricordi.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Bread, water and salt ===\n\nOn October 3 at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome, Sir Antonio Pappano together with the soprano Pumeza Matshikiza and the Orchestra and Choir of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, performed the world premiere of ''Bread, Water and Salt'' on texts by [[Nelson Mandela]]. This piece by Francesconi has been chosen to inaugurate the Orchestra di Santa Cecilia's 2015-16 concert season and will be dedicated by the orchestra to Ludwig van Beethoven.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\nFrancesconi says: \"This piece was planned together with the 9th Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven, in order to create a link between the brotherhood idea of Beethoven and Schiller and what it may mean today. We've chosen Mandela because of his simple adherence to the spirituality of the body, of the bread, of the sofference that can be defeated. Of the goodness, that may seem a worn out common place to us, but for the people who have nothing left, not even dignity, it is the part of the human being that may save them, that may save us. It may defeat the cold  cynicism that perverts our relationships. So here comes the brotherhood: all these words, despised in politics and in the media, may really lead us to happiness\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicalnews.com/articolo.php?codice=31642&sz=6 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054737/http://www.musicalnews.com/articolo.php?codice=31642&sz=6 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Works, editions and recordings==\n* ''I Quartetto'' for strings, 1977\n* ''Passacaglia'' for great orchestra, 1982\n* ''Concertante '' for guitar and ensemble, Tanglewood 1982\n* ''Viaggiatore insonne'' for soprano and 5 instruments (text by [[Sandro Penna]]), 1983\n* ''Notte'' for mezzo-soprano and 19 instruments (text by Sandro Penna), 1983\u20131984\n* ''Suite 1984'' forr orchestra, African percussionists and jazz quintet with the Orchestra of the Ente Lirico di Cagliari, the Franco D'Andrea's band and Africa Djol\u00e9 from Ivory Coast, directed by the composer, 1984\n* ''Finta-di-nulla'' for soprano and 19 instruments (text by [[Umberto Fiori]]), 1985\n* ''Onda sonante'' for 8 instruments, 1985\n* ''Vertige'' for string orchestra, 1985\n* ''Da capo'' for 9 instruments, 1985\u20131986\n* ''Encore/Da capo'' for 9 instruments, 1985\u20131995\n* ''Impulse II'' for clarinet, violin and piano, 1985, 1995\n* ''Al di l\u00e0 dell'oceano famoso'' for 8 solo mixed voices, Netherland Radio Chamber Choir, 1985\n* ''Secondo quartetto'' (Mondriaan Quartet)\n* ''Tracce'' for flute, 1985-1987\n* ''Plot in fiction'' for bassoon, English horn and 11 instruments, 1986\n* ''Respiro'' for trombone solo, 1987\n* ''Trama'' for saxophone and orchestra, 1987\n* ''Mambo'', for piano solo, 1987\n* ''Attesa'' for reed quartet, 1988\n* ''La voce'', folk song for soprano and 13 instruments (text by [[Umberto Fiori]]), 1988\n* ''Aeuia'' for baritone and 11 instruments (based on a text by di [[Jacopone da Todi]]), 1989\n* ''Les barricades myst\u00e9rieuses'' for flute and orchestra, 1989\n* ''Piccola trama'' for saxophone and 8 instruments, 1989\n* ''Richiami II - 1st study on memory'', 1989\u20131992\n* ''Memoria'' for orchestra, 1990\n* ''Secondo Concerto'' for oboe and chamber orchestra, 1991\n* ''Mittel'' for five moving bands, 1991\n* ''Riti neurali, 3rd study on memory'' for violin and 8 instruments, 1991\n* ''Islands concerto'' for piano and chamber orchestra, 1992\n* ''Miniature'' for 16 instruments, 1992\n* ''Voci'' for soprano, violin and magnetic tape (text by [[Umberto Fiori]]), 1992\n* ''Aria'' for wind octet, 1993\n* ''Plot II'' for saxophone and 15 instruments, 1993\n* ''Risonanze d'Orfeo'', suite for wind orchestra from ''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'' di [[Claudio Monteverdi]], 1993\n* ''Trama II'' for clarinet, orchestra and live electronics, 1993\n* ''Terzo quartetto \"Mirrors\" ''for strings, Arditti Quartet, De Singel Antwerpen, 1994\n* ''Ballata del rovescio del mondo'', radio-opera on texts by [[Umberto Fiori]], 1994\n* ''Etymo'' for soprano, chamber orchestra and live electronics, from [[Charles Baudelaire]], commission by IRCAM for soprano, Ensemble InterContemporain, conductor [[Pascal Roph\u00e9]], soprano Luisa Castellani, Klangregie by the composer,1994\n* ''A fuoco - 4th study on memory'' for guitar and ensemble, 1995\n* ''Animus'' for trombone and live electronics, 1995\u20131996\n* ''Inquieta limina.

His father was a painter<ref>Giancarlo Francesconi, by E. Tadini, Milano, Salone Annunciata, 1959</ref> who edited Il Corriere dei piccoli and conceived Il Corriere dei ragazzi,<ref>Sergio Badino, Conversazione con Carlo Chendi. Da Pepito alla Disney e oltre: cinquant'anni di fumetto vissuti da protagonista, Tenu\u00e9 2006</ref> while his mother, an advertiser, created a number of famous advertising campaigns. Francesconi spent his early years in QT8, a working class quarter in Milan that rose up alongside a huge pile of post-war rubble which would later become Monte Stella. At the age of five, won over by a concert by Svjatoslav Richter, he began to learn the piano. Although he was accepted into the junior high school section of the city's conservatory six years later, he instinctively pulled out, thinking that it was too academic and conventional. Instead,  even though he had in the meantime moved with his family to a more central quarter of Milan, Francesconi opted to attend the junior high school in QT8. In this way from a very early age his relationship with music and life in general took on a course of responsibility and constant choice, of research and direct experimentation.\n\n== Education ==\n''We need to profoundly rethink and filter in a determined way the enormously rich potential that has been elaborated in the past and to use it for expressive purposes.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA.  La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, edited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\nFrancesconi returned to the Conservatory of Milan in 1974, while he was still attending the Berchet Classical Languages High School, and explored the length and breadth of the musical landscape, taking an interest in every possible dimension of sound.<ref name=\"auto1\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - Appendix VII (2007)</ref> He played in jazz and rock groups as well as in classical concerts, he worked as a session man in recording studios, and he composed music for theatre, cinema, advertising, and television. These were all rewarding experiences, not least from an economic point of view, but they were not enough. He realised that a truly living language, while looking at the present, draws its lifeblood from its roots. The time had come for him to dig into the tradition of music to which he belonged. The Milan Conservatory was opening more and more space to contemporary music so Francesconi enrolled in the composition course conducted by Azio Corghi. \"From him I learnt the trade, the fundamentals, counterpoint and those things, professional seriousness and open-mindedness.\"<ref>Ricciarda Belgiojoso, \"Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi\", Postmedia Books, 2013</ref> In the meantime he continued to explore electronic music and in 1977 took time out to immerse himself in jazz at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.\n\n=== A student of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]===\n''The mountain is in front of us and it is necessary to pass over it, with enormous force and patience. It's not enough just to contemplate it nor to sneak by it via secondary paths much less go backwards claiming that the mountain is not there.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in VV. AA. La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, \u00e9dited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\n[[Donnerstag aus Licht]] went on stage at the [[Teatro alla Scala]] in Milan in 1981. Stockhausen is a historical reference point: Francesconi admired him for his extraordinary organisational consistency, for his tireless search for a linguistic unity. He was also deeply struck by the visionary quality of this initial opera. He wanted to observe the composer at work so he enrolled in the intensive course that Stockhausen held in Rome that same year. \"From him I learnt rigor, at first imbibing it by osmosis, and then demythologising it.\"<ref>Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia Books, 2013</ref>[7]\n\n=== Meeting and collaboration with [[Luciano Berio]] ===\n''Luciano didn't talk much about the more 'technical' and delicate aspects of his work as a composer. I remember that when he least expected it, I would fire questions at him point blank, hoping to pick up some tips. His replies were like enigmas. They had something sacral about them and they required divining rituals to decode them.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Per Luciano, Centro studi Luciano Berio, www.lucianoberio.org</ref>\nWith Berio Francesconi studied above all in the field, just like the workshop artisans of old, acting as his assistant from 1981 to 1984. He worked directly on the score of ''La vera storia'' and participated in the production as rehearsal pianist and second conductor/substitute maestro. In 1984 he collaborated with the composer in the rewriting of Monteverdi's ''Orfeo''. He was also present with Berio at Tanglewood where he attended one of his famous summer courses.\n\n== Activities, works, research ==\n\nIn 1984 three of Francesconi's pieces, including ''Passacaglia'', for large orchestra (1982), were selected for the [[Gaudeamus International Composers Award]] in Amsterdam. This first important recognition on the international scene created a useful tie with the Dutch music scene and laid the foundation for further commissions. Meanwhile, in Italy, thanks to a commission from the Teatro Lirico di Cagliari, Francesconi had the opportunity to seriously put into practice for the first time his idea of a \"polyphony of languages\": ''Suite 1984''. The polyphony that I have in mind hasn't got anything to do with the \"postmodern\" or collage, the exotic pastiche, the provincial chinoiserie of our grandparents (but also of Stockhausen and certain pop groups). Instead, it is a free fusion of ideas in a compact and linguistically very solid body that reveals its profound energies in its inner profundity and not in an exterior heterogeneity. Energies that come from the earth, from popular culture, from ancient African and Oriental cultures.<ref name=\"auto5\">Luca Francesconi, Les Esprits libres, in AA.VV. La loi musicale \u2013 Ce que la lecture de l'histoire nous (d\u00e9s)apprend, edited by D. Cohen Levinas, Paris, L'Harmattan, 2000</ref>\n\"In 1984 the Teatro Lirico in Cagliari presented a quartet made up of the pianist and composer [[Franco D'Andrea]] together with the group Africa Djol\u00e9 led by the master percussionist Fode Youla from Guinea. The idea was then conceived that the music of this group be recreated in symphonic form (''Suite 1984'') by the 28 year-old Luca Francesconi for a performance by the theatre's orchestra under the direction of Francesconi himself, a recent product of rigorous musical studies, assistant to Luciano Berio and 'jazz student of D'Andrea', as he used to like to define himself. The concert attracted experts from all over the place anxious to hear novelties and promising syncretisms of various musical civilisations, and it was a triumph.\"<ref name=\"auto7\">Franco Fayenz, Si chiude la ribalta della Scala per Quartett, antologia di soluzioni geniali, Il Sole 24 ore, May 8th 2011</ref> \"Orchestra, African percussionists and jazz quintet: the choice of instrumental make-up itself contained in an explicit manner the generative nucleus of one of the principal aesthetic motors of the music of Luca Francesconi: the tendency to place alongside one another, following the rules of contrast and fusion, sounds and languages of highly diverse origins.\"<ref>Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani- VII Appendix (2007)</ref>\n\n=== 1984-1990 ===\n\nFrancesconi's first record, an LP recorded in the United States, contained ''Viaggiatore insonne'', on a text by [[Sandro Penna]]. \"Francesconi's attitude as a composer is in fact similar to that of a tireless traveller, who explores linguistic spaces in search of their ever shifting confines, and who conducts an etiological study to determine the confines between noise and sound, between instinct and reason.\"<ref name=\"auto3\">Robert Coheur, A fuoco, 4\u00b0 studio sulla memoria, www.modernmusix.com</ref>\nThe new piece ''Vertige'', for string orchestra, was performed in Strasbourg. Francesconi composed various works for ensemble which were performed in Cagliari (''Onda sonante'', for eight instruments, commissioned by the Nieuw Ensemble; conductor: Ed Spanjaard (1985)), Paris (''Tracce'', for flute (1986)), Citt\u00e0 di Castello (''Da cap''o, for nine instruments (1988)), Middelburg (Finta-di-nulla, for soprano and nineteen instruments on a text by Umberto Fiori; Xenakis Ensemble; conductor: Diego Masson; and soprano: Marie Duisit (1991)), and Brussels (''Encore/Da capo'', for 9 instruments; Ictus Ensemble, conducted by the composer (1995)).\nIn 1984 [[Casa Ricordi]] became Francesconi's publisher and since then has published all his works.\nIn 1985 he was invited to the Festival Musica \u2018900 in Trent for a series of public conversations with [[Franco Donatoni]]. This meeting proved extremely important; talking with the great Verona composer, both in their public conversations and during train trips together, Francesconi felt that he reached a solution for a number of unresolved problems. ''Plot in fiction'', dedicated to Franco Donatoni, was in many ways the happy outcome of this experience.\n\n=== Plot in Fiction ===\n\n''The really difficult thing is to write works with a rich and articulated complex of meanings and events: works, that is, that are capable of assuming a linguistic structure, of being a world (Mahler!), but whose complexity is transparent.''<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n''Plot in Fiction'', for oboe and cor anglais or clarinet and chamber group (1986), constructs its sonoric line around key notes within a rigorous formal framework.<ref name=\"auto\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia italiana Treccani, VII Appendix, 2007</ref> \"The point here is to find the \"plot\" in the \"fiction\", the narrative line that twists and turns through the complexity and intricacy of a \"mass of everyday symbols\".<ref>Christopher Thomas, Metier, msvcd 92018, www.divineartrecords.com</ref> What's involved is an architecture that guides the listener within the composition: the search for a compositional transparency (without, however, ever slipping into simplicity; the means employed leave unaltered the quality of the composer's thought), based on pure energy, directly perceptible, without any need to exhibit the mechanisms underlying it.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> The piece was performed for the first time at the Festival Musica '900 in Trent by Ensemble Musique Oblique under the direction of Sandro Gorli; the soloist was Diego Dini Ciacci.\n\n=== Mambo ===\n\nAt this point I would say that it is no longer possible to talk of a language devoid of code or morphogenesis, i.e. of a language that comes into being while the aesthetic event is being produced. It's necessary to also come to terms with a substratum, with what I call semantic pressure, that is with history.<ref name=\"auto4\">Ricciarda Belgiojoso, Note d'autore. A tu per tu con i compositori d'oggi, Postmedia books, 2013</ref>\n\nMambo, for solo piano, is Francesconi's most jazz-like piece, and it reveals clearly his search for an ever uneasy equilibrium between sonoric materials, gathered in their primitive state, and the evocative power of history, from which the composer cannot remove himself. In the piece there is an overlap of a rhythmic ostinato in a low register, a series of ascending-descending diatonic lines, and, finally, a sequence of pounding 4-note chords. In this continual 'friction of contraries' resides the aesthetic motor of Francesconi's music as well as the powerful charge of sonoric seduction that his works carry.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Francesconi exploits as a precious resource the capacity for intense analysis developed in Western culture. He takes a shared musical reference and dissects it remorselessly until he lays bare further possibilities of development, of transformation. Wielding its 'semantic pressure' as though it were a picklock, he presses further and further inwards, towards the energy-bearing roots of sound.\n\n=== AGON, centre for music research and experimentation ===\n\nIt's important for composers to confront the use of computers face-on; even empirically, at a basic level. To search for, study, and promote new means through which to communicate with them, new interfaces. It's important for them to help to lead mankind back to the centre of his machines.<ref>Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, Milano 1994</ref>\n\nIn 1990 Francesconi founded AGON with two great utopian visions in mind. The first was that it is still possible and desperately important to work together, cooperatively, imagining projects to realise together with others, to exchange experiences, ideas. AGON came into being as an organism with a public identity: \"it is not my or your studio\"; it aspires to be a place where it's possible to talk, meet, and not just pursue one's own interest. The second utopian idea was to start from below and not from high-tech; to depart from the musical needs of composers with a view to stimulating a different relationship, simpler, \"less terroristic\", between real musicians and machines.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Handling electronics also serves, according to Francesconi, to recuperate a physical, auditive approach to musical composition, which, if limited to paper and pencil, runs the risk of becoming too speculative, weakening the direct relationship with the sonoric material.<ref name=\"auto8\">Guido Barbieri, Francesconi, Luca, Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani - VII Appendice (2007)</ref> AGON has for many years been one of the most active centres in Italy for music research and production.<ref name=\"auto8\"/>\n\n=== Riti neurali ===\n\n''Complexity is always a question of quality, not quantity. What really matters is transparency in an overall density. This means that I should only make use of a particularly articulated syntax if I really need to, or, in other words, only if I've got particularly articulated things to say.''<ref name=\"auto2\">Luca Francesconi, Complessit\u00e0, Milan 1989</ref>\n\nComposed in 1991, for violin and eight instruments, ''Riti neurali'' is Francesconi's third study on memory. Like many of his works, it develops the material on multiple levels, pursuing labyrinthine paths. Nonetheless, its clearly delineated textures offer the listener unmistakable points of reference.<ref>Beth E. Levy, Furious Craft, 8 December 2008, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts Forum, Music program, San Francisco Contemporary Music Players</ref> The soloist establishes a vast array of relations with the small orchestra (guiding it, allowing himself to be guided, contradicting it, ignoring it, etc.), at the same time assuming various positions himself ... The complexity of the counterpoint arises out of the simultaneity of the various positions.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> \"There are things that evoke other things, or that acquire meaning in relation to other things. We are subjected, in a certain sense, to a historically determined perceptive destiny. Whether we want to be or not. The illusion of the tabula rasa, of pure transparency, is not enough. Probably it's better to take account of this perceptive problem right from the start and to consider it one of the compositional parameters.\"<ref name=\"auto2\"/> The work was commissioned by Radio France and the world premiere took place in Paris on 14 January 1992: [[Asko Ensemble]]; conductor: Denis Cohen, and soloist: Irvine Arditti.\nWhile a series of performances followed on from one another in Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, and Antwerp, an extensive portrait at the Venice Biennale, in 1993, definitively consolidated Francescon's reputation in Italy as well: the Nieuw Ensemble Amsterdam, Arditti and Ensemble Modern (with the newly commissioned Plot II) joined forces in a single concert dedicated to the composer's music at the Teatro La Fenice.\n\n=== Etymo ===\n\n''The great challenge is to maintain in the composer the two levels, the compositional and the emotive, and to ensure that these continually charge each other with responsibility for the form of the work up until in the end they arrive at a balanced result.''<ref>Massimiliano Viel, Incontro con Luca Francesconi: Il calcolo e l'intuizione. L'elettronica come sfida, in Sonus, Materiali per la musica contemporanea, issue n.11, December 1993</ref>\n\nBetween 1993 and 1994 Francesconi worked and taught in Paris in the hyper-technological workshop [[Ircam]], where \"you model sound with your hands\". On commission from Ircam, he carried out computer analysis on sounds and their behaviour right down to their roots, their etymon, to realise \"one of the most convincing and at the same time impetuous musical equivalents of the writing of Baudelaire, striving with clarity of mind to achieve a secure control over the insidious relationship between words and music.\"<ref>David Osmonde Smith, 'Un no man's land fertile: Francesconi et le th\u00e9\u00e2tre musical', in Musica program for Luca Francesconi, Ballata, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Monnaie, Brussels, October 2002.</ref>\nThe piece is based almost entirely on [[Baudelaire]]'s poem ''Le Voyage'', of which at two points we hear the soprano declaim two key fragments: \"Dites, qu'avez-vous vu?\" (Speak, what have you seen?). The computer analysis of this question constitutes the DNA that structures the entire piece, from the microstructure to the macroform.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> The result is a multi-levelled organism that in 25 minutes lays out its basic material (phonemes, instrumental particles, electronic transformation) and then proceeds to join it all together in increasingly complex structures. Everything begins with a question on the origin of meaning (in Greek: \"etymon\"). What is there before the word, and what models language? And finally, what allows us to transcend language? In the beginning there is pre-language, its premises. Etymo, a work furnished with huge white wings, starts out with the primordial mumblings of language, in phonemes. Nothing is intelligible, alliterations that roll off and slip away (or fluctuate) and an orchestra that appears suspended, as if it were waiting. These phonetic and musical particles aggregate in a contrapuntal overlapping which in the end explodes in an ocean of profundity from which the first words arise.<ref name=\"auto3\"/> An important example of how Francesconi employs electronics in a masterly way to broaden the expressive range and colour of instruments. The physicality of the performance remains at the centre of the work, but the electronics helps it to reach an extreme expressive intensity.<ref>Hubert Culot, Music Web International, Review of Etymo, Da capo, A fuoco, Animus, Kairos</ref>\n''A fuoco ''(1995) is Francesconi's fourth study on memory; ''Animus'', for trombone and computer (1996), was performed in Paris, while the London Sinfonietta took ''Plot in fiction'' to Santa Cecilia in Rome (1996).\n\n=== Wanderer ===\n\n''The effort to formalise creative thought and thought as a whole is extremely important for composers as well, but by the same token the \"analogical\" and qualitative approach of the artist helps to play down their relationship with technological instruments and above all to reaffirm the impossibility of discretising, quantifying human experience; the impossibility of converting into binary code and sending via fibre optic cable the sum total of existence, the totality of aesthetic experience, of the body, of affection, of the world.''<ref>Luca Francesconi, Cerca e ricerca, MIlan 1994</ref>\n\nOn 17 January 2000 [[Riccardo Muti]] conducted ''Wanderer'' at the Scala in Milan. \"This voyager is man who, after conducting an inventory of the generations that have preceded him, takes with him only the bare essentials to set out on a path towards the immensity of possible spaces. At the dawn of the new millennium Luca Francesconi frees himself from the crushing weight of tradition, especially that generated by serialism and its worshipers. After extensive research into tempo, into tempi, one might say, into sonoric texture, the composer here explores a type of language that favours narration.<ref name=\"auto6\">Wanderer - Cobalt, Scarlet : two colours of dawn, http://www.lamediatheque.be/travers_sons/0103ag01.html</ref>\n\n=== Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colours of Dawn ===\n\n''Music is closer than any other form of expression to that nucleus of \"existential energy\" that lives deep within us.''<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n2000 was also the year of Cobalt, Scarlet: Two Colors of Dawn. \"A single movement of twenty three minutes for large orchestra divided into parallel - at times counterpoised \u2013 groups begins with a pianissimo of metallic gleams that emanate alternately from the two sides of the stage. Then, other percussion instruments, wind instruments and brass instruments, join in<!--not a mistake--> in a subdued manner, developing, transforming planes of volume and colour. But it is an unexpected metallic accent exploding like a burst of profundity that fills the auditorium not so much with clamour as with presence, rapture.\"<ref>Chris Pasles, Old works and new shine equally bright, Los Angeles Times, November 22nd 2003</ref> \"With this composition Luca Francesconi reached a turning point in his career, enriching his exploration into the heart of sonoric material with greater sensibility and emotivity. In this way his music acceded to a broader artistic dimension, that of a harmonious encounter of technique and psychology in the broadest sense of the term.<ref name=\"auto6\"/>\n\n== Music theatre ==\n\nFrom 1985 to the present Luca Francesconi has composed eight works of a theatrical stamp, from ''Scene'', on a text by Umberto Fiori, to the chamber opera In ''Ostaggio'', from ''Lips, Eyes Bang'', for actress/singer, twelve instruments and live audio/video, to the video-opera Striaz. ''Ballata'',  commissioned by the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de La Monnaie in Brussels/di Bruxelles and with stage direction by Achim Freyer, was staged in 2002.\n\n=== Ballata ===\n''My idea was to turn over a new leaf, to free myself so to speak from the 20th century. I wanted to use all the expressive densities that that century conceded to me, and for me it was a kind of synthesis of the musical experiences that had struck me most.''<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\nIn 1994 Luca Francesconi had realised an opera for radio (and eventual winner of the Prix Italia), ''Ballata del rovescio del mondo'', on a text by Umberto Fiori; in 1996 his continuing, close collaboration with the Milan poet resulted in his third work for music theatre, ''Ballata'', drawn from [[Samuel Coleridge]]'s  [[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]. Divided into two acts, ''Ballata'' makes use of a large orchestra with an enlarged percussion section; on the right of the stage is an instrumental ensemble inspired by Gypsy orchestras, while four female choirs distributed at the four angles of the auditorium \"function as walls that open and close towards the irrational, memory, towards flashbacks\". Electronic sounds elaborated at Ircam<ref>Anne Genette, Ballata, www.lamediatheque.</ref> contribute to the spatial disorientation. Originally, for the role of the ancient mariner, Francesconi had thought of Sting, with whom he had recorded the first song of the opera ''Day After Day''.<ref name=\"auto4\"/> In the end, however, the collaboration did not eventuate for reasons of language (Sting did not feel up to singing and acting in Italian), but the idea remained of a present-day narrator who, like the ancient mariner, is condemned to wander around the globe in search of someone to whom to recount his incredible adventures, from shipwreck to the glaciers of the South Pole, from the scorching sun of the equator to the appearance of monsters and a phantomatic sailing ship. The temporal plane is split: on stage the ancient mariner tells his story and at the same time he appears as a young man in the midst of a storm. Various compositional techniques follow on from one another, from early expressionism onwards, integrated with other traditions, like folk music. \"Luca Francesconi develops an orchestral writing that is inventive, sensual and seductive all at the same time, deftly integrating electronic resources elaborated by Ircam. But, much more, he makes masterful use of an armoury of ardent vocality that is seasoned but anything but worn-out \u2013 from Brecht's spoken song to Monteverdi's madrigal, passing from the songs of English Baroque opera to all the immortals of Italian lyric opera, from Verdi to Berio, of whom he was a student.\"<ref>Marie-Aude Roux, Ballata, drame syncretique de Francesconi, Le Monde, November 14th, 2002</ref>\n\n=== Buffa opera ===\n\n''Who said that music today necessarily has to create angst? It's enough to think that Albanese used to come running onto the stage pursued by a cigarette two and half metres tall.''<ref name=\"auto4\"/>\n\n''Buffa opera'', a piece inspired by [[opera buffa]] on a text by [[Stefano Benni]], went on stage at the Piccolo Teatro di Milano in 2002. It featured [[Antonio Albanese]] on stage for the whole opera as actor/singer alongside the chorus and the Buffa orchestra, a fully-fledged character, conducted by the composer himself. In it, the world was seen from the perspective of insects and spiders; Benni's libretto used surrealistic metaphors. Francesconi, who had been known for more dramatic or tragic work, composed music that employed a wide variety of styles, including jazz, avant-garde, and canzonetta, in a parodic manner. ''Buffa opera'' was later revived at the Teatro Morlacchi in Perugia.<ref>Anna Bandettini, L'umanit\u00e0 salvata da uno scarafaggio, Repubblica, May 11th  2002</ref><ref>Enrico Girardi, Musica buffa per insetti, Corriere della sera, May 22nd 2002</ref>\n\nCommissioned by the Holland Festival, ''Gesualdo Considered as a Murderer'', on a libretto by Vittorio Sermonti, was performed for the first time in Amsterdam in June 2004. It was directed by Giorgio Barberio Corsetti, with Davide Damiani as Gesualdo, Eberhard Franscesco Lorenz as his [[Iago]]-like servant, and Alda Caiello as Gesualdo's wife's maid, and was well-received as a mature dramatic piece.<ref>Andrew Clements, Gesualdo Considered as a Murder, The Guardian, Friday 11 June 2004</ref>\n[[File:Quartett in Buenos Aires.jpg|thumb|Quartett in Buenos Aires, Col\u00f3n Theater, June 2015]]\n\n=== Quartett ===\n{{Advert|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 2011, Francesconi's eighth music theatre work, ''Quartett'', premiered at the Scala in Milan. An adaptation of a text by [[Heiner M\u00fcller]] drawn in its turn from [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]'s [[Les liaisons dangereuses]], it was jointly commissioned by Teatro alla Scala, Wiener Festwochen and Ircam. The libretto, by the composer, is in English, a language whose syncretism Francesconi felt aligned with his taste in musical syncretism.<ref name=\"auto7\"/> The composer and reviewers described it as a cynical and violent work, whose only two characters are a man and a woman, with some sort of past together, in a room.<ref>Quartett - interview to Luca Francesconi, Teatro alla Scala, Season 2010/2011</ref><ref>[[Tom Service]], Luca Francesconi: do you dare go to his opera?, The Guardian, 19 June 2014</ref>\n\nThe opera has a single act, thirteen scenes, and lasts a total of an hour and twenty minutes. Only two characters on stage, a small orchestra in the orchestra pit, a large orchestra and choir off-stage (available as a recording effected at the Scala in Milan), and electronics (Studio Ircam, Serge Lemouton: live and pre-recorded sounds).\nThe stage direction at the Scala was entrusted to Alex Olle of [[La Fura dels Baus]], who concentrated the action in a huge box suspended twelve metres above the stage, projecting onto the full breadth of the backdrop videos representing the outside world. Allison Cook, mezzo-soprano, interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil, alternating with Sinead Mulhern; Robin Adams, baritone, was Vicomte de Valmont. The conductor was Susanna M\u00e4lkki. This production was revived in 2012 in Vienna (Wiener FestWochen: conductor: Peter Rundel), in 2013 at the Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam (the opening of the Holland Festival; conductor: Susanna M\u00e4lkki) and at the Opera di Lille (Ensemble Ictus: conductor: Georges-Elie Octors), and in 2014 in Lisbon (Gulbenkian Foundation: conductor: Susanna M\u00e4lkki).\n\n''Quartett'' was performed in concert form at the Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris by Ensemble Intercontemporain (March 2013). A first new production was staged in Porto and Strasburg, once again with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, and with Remix Ensemble under the direction of Brad Lubman. The stage direction, scenery and costumes were by Nuno Carinhas and the lighting by Nuno Meira (Casa da Musica in Porto on 24 September 2013 and Festival Musica in Strasburg on 28 September 2013).\n\nThe opera was produced again in London by the Royal Opera House in a coproduction with the Op\u00e9ra di Rouen and the London Sinfonietta, from 18 to 28 June 2014, with stage direction by John Fulljames. Two casts alternated for the ten performances (Leigh Melrose and Kristin Ch\u00e1vez; and Mark Stone and Angelica Voje) on the metallic structures of a post-atomic bunker realised by Soutra Gilmour, with lighting by Bruno Poet and videos by Ravi Deepres projected onto tattered screens dropped from above in the restrained atmosphere of the Linbury Studio. Under the structures warm and dim lights lit up the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Andrew Gourlay.\n\nIn 2015 the Malm\u00f6 Opera presented a fourth production. It was directed by Stefan Johansson, with scenery by Jan Lundberg. Kirstin Chavez interpreted the Marquise de Merteuil and Christian Miedl Vicomte de Valmont; the conductor was Ralf Kircher.\n\nThe La Fura  del Baus production was performed again in Buenos Aires, [[Col\u00f3n Theater]], in June 2015, with Allison Cook and Robin Adams, director Alex Olle, conductor Brad Lubman. \"The press wasn't indifferent at all: \"La Fura dels Baus strikes in America as well\" (El Pa\u00eds); \"An high voltage opera\" (Clar\u00edn); \"To the limits of the opera\" (La Naci\u00f3n); \"Portrait of a crippled bourgeoisie\" (P\u00e1gina 12). \"Quartett: a wonderful and yet very demanding opera\" (\u00c1mbito Financiero).<ref>Alexander Destuet, Quartett de Luca Francesconi: la Fura dels Baus ataca otra vez, La Vanguardia  July 3rd 2015</ref>\n\n== The Venice Biennale ==\nToday's semantic dictionary can put us in contact with other cultures, embolden us to recuperate magmatic sonorities. The Tarantola del Salento, the songs of Sardinia, African polyphonies. Ethnic music can open deep landscapes of the soul, obscure regions, forgotten loci of consciousness. It's necessary to be courageous, and, like Tarkovsky's Stalker, venture to where ferocious energies lie, in their primitive state. Not \"stravaganti\" (strange) but \"extra vagans\" (wandering beyond) towards the incandescent core of origins<ref>Giuseppina Manin, La musica \u00e8 finita, Corriere della sera, September 16th 2008</ref>\n\nFrom 2008 to 2011 Francesconi was the artistic director of the Venice Music Biennale. His imprint was immediately recognisable in the themes of the four festivals (\"Roots/Future\", \"The body of sound\", \"Don Giovanni and the man of stone\" and \"Mutants\") and it broadened out further in the conception of the festival as the ideal place \"to seek new and different forms of perception and attention.\"<ref>Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 30th 2010</ref> Beyond the confines of concert halls and theatres, listeners freely chose how to approach the music, which was disseminated through the city as though on a stage in movement, accessible and without limits. This was the basic idea behind Exit, the celebratory evening/night that brought each of the four festivals to a close, transforming the Teatro alle Tese into a distended human body (Exit 02), \"an experience with variable geometry, a new way of living space, sound and time from sunset to dawn\",<ref>Giacomo Botteri, La ricerca dei valori e delle idealit\u00e0 perdute, domenica 19 ottobre 2008, www.nonsolocinema.it</ref> or inviting the public to take a boat towards the Island of San Michele to pay homage to Stravinsky in the form of three clarinet pieces at his tomb and to then participate in a banquet that evoked the finale of Don Giovanni. Don Giovanni was also at the heart of one of the most famous experiments in this four-year period: \"Palazzo Pisani, home of the B. Marcello Conservatory, is the site chosen for the staging of Don Giovanni a Venezia, conceived by Francesconi himself. For this initiative, which has been defined as an opera-labyrinth, the public is asked not just to exercise its sensibility but also its intelligence, so as to try to create a kind of gap between space and time in which music can be inserted. After scrapping the old structure of the concert, Francesconi borrows three key scenes from Mozart's original \u2013 the duel between Don Giovanni and the Commendatore, the seduction of Zerlina and the death of Don Giovanni \u2013 and puts them on stage cyclically, in three different locations within the ancient Venetian palace, inserting in the loggie, palace rooms and courtyards another eight original pieces commissioned from contemporary composers. The spectator, as if he were to enter into a huge gallery and to decide autonomously how and what to look at, will have before his eyes a plurality of musical, scenic, theatrical and visual events to combine, putting aside the perceptive habits of space and time.\"<ref>Silva Menetto, Alla Biennale protagonisti il Don Giovanni a Venezia e giovani ensemble da tutta Europa, Il Sole 24 ore, September 16th 2010</ref>\n\n== Teaching ==\n\nLuca Francesconi has taught for twenty five years in Italy's conservatories and at the University of Ohio, in Rotterdam and in Strasburg. He has held master classes throughout Europe and the world, from Japan to the United States, from China to Canada. Until 2019 he has taught composition at the [[Malm\u00f6 Academy of Music]] (part of [[Lund University]]), where he directed the composition department.\n\n== Other collaborations ==\n\n2000 marked two other important experiences. The Piccolo Teatro in Milan commissioned him to write the music for Calder\u00f3n de la Barca's pi\u00e8ce La vida es sue\u00f1o, with stage direction by Luca Ronconi, who in that very year took over the direction of the theatre from Giorgio Strehler.\nHe wrote the music for Paolo Rosa's film Il mnemonista, produced by Studio Azzurro.\n\n== 2014 ==\nTwo important international symphonic commissions mark the year.\n\n=== Duende. The Dark Notes ===\nA dangerous descent into the infernal depths of the dark notes, to rediscover a primordial force in perhaps the most history-laden instrument of the West.<ref>Attilio Piovano, \u2018Duende, the Dark Notes\u2018 di Luca Francesconi in prima a Torino, Il corriere musicale, May 3rd 2014</ref>\n\nWritten for the extraordinary soloist Leila Josefowicz, this concerto for violin and orchestra was jointly commissioned by SR Swedish Radio and the BBC Proms. Performed in Stockholm in February 2014, in Turin in May 2014 and in June 2015 for the BBC Proms. \u00abIt was well worth the wait. As the title suggests, Francesconi's concerto takes the idea of the Duende, the dark, demonic spirit of flamenco, as its starting point, but the music never seems simplistically pictorial or programmatic. Instead, with the violin as protagonist, the five movements (the last two merged seamlessly together) evoke a threatening world of extremes, of heightened emotions and dramatically contrasted colours and registers. The orchestra weaves febrile webs around solo writing whose cracked arpeggios and steep scales manage to be more or less traditionally virtuosic within musical contexts that are anything but conventional, especially in the ferocious cadenza at the heart of the final movement. Josefowicz's playing was immensely committed and astoundingly vivid, and it emerged in even sharper, more subtle focus in the Radio 3 recording, which also resolved many of the textures that had seemed rather blurred in the hall.\u00bb<ref>Andrew Clements, Prom 13: BBCSO/M\u00e4lkki/Josefowicz review \u2013 committed and astoundingly vivid, The Guardian, July 28th 2015</ref>\n\n''Duende'' was ranked number 6 in the Guardian's list of the top 10 classical concerts and operas of 2015<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/16/top-10-classical-concerts-opera-2015|title=The top 10 classical concerts and operas of 2015|first1=Andrew|last1=Clements|first2=Guardian|last2=music|date=December 16, 2015|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Dentro non ha tempo ===\n\"Curious, that title, 'Dentro non ha tempo'. It can be read in three ways: as the temporal suspension that someone who dies leaves in those that have loved him/her. As a reference to the great musical tradition from which Luciana came, the Abbado family: a homage to the past that has no time. Finally, an allusion to the form of the composition, based on three bars of Mozart's Don Giovanni dilated 29 times.

It's an infinite source of meanings: meanings that I need to find, in spite of the destructuration of reality all around us. In a small gesture towards this powerful resistance, I have incorporated a brief homage to Luciano Berio's Concerto for Two Pianos, one of the pieces that have left a profound mark on my life.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ricordi.com/it-IT/|title=Ricordi|website=www.ricordi.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Bread, water and salt ===\n\nOn October 3 at the Auditorium Parco della Musica in Rome, Sir Antonio Pappano together with the soprano Pumeza Matshikiza and the Orchestra and Choir of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia, performed the world premiere of ''Bread, Water and Salt'' on texts by [[Nelson Mandela]]. This piece by Francesconi has been chosen to inaugurate the Orchestra di Santa Cecilia's 2015-16 concert season and will be dedicated by the orchestra to Ludwig van Beethoven.<ref name=\"auto9\"/>\nFrancesconi says: \"This piece was planned together with the 9th Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven, in order to create a link between the brotherhood idea of Beethoven and Schiller and what it may mean today. We've chosen Mandela because of his simple adherence to the spirituality of the body, of the bread, of the sofference that can be defeated. Of the goodness, that may seem a worn out common place to us, but for the people who have nothing left, not even dignity, it is the part of the human being that may save them, that may save us. It may defeat the cold  cynicism that perverts our relationships. So here comes the brotherhood: all these words, despised in politics and in the media, may really lead us to happiness\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicalnews.com/articolo.php?codice=31642&sz=6 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054737/http://www.musicalnews.com/articolo.php?codice=31642&sz=6 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Works, editions and recordings==\n* ''I Quartetto'' for strings, 1977\n* ''Passacaglia'' for great orchestra, 1982\n* ''Concertante '' for guitar and ensemble, Tanglewood 1982\n* ''Viaggiatore insonne'' for soprano and 5 instruments (text by [[Sandro Penna]]), 1983\n* ''Notte'' for mezzo-soprano and 19 instruments (text by Sandro Penna), 1983\u20131984\n* ''Suite 1984'' forr orchestra, African percussionists and jazz quintet with the Orchestra of the Ente Lirico di Cagliari, the Franco D'Andrea's band and Africa Djol\u00e9 from Ivory Coast, directed by the composer, 1984\n* ''Finta-di-nulla'' for soprano and 19 instruments (text by [[Umberto Fiori]]), 1985\n* ''Onda sonante'' for 8 instruments, 1985\n* ''Vertige'' for string orchestra, 1985\n* ''Da capo'' for 9 instruments, 1985\u20131986\n* ''Encore/Da capo'' for 9 instruments, 1985\u20131995\n* ''Impulse II'' for clarinet, violin and piano, 1985, 1995\n* ''Al di l\u00e0 dell'oceano famoso'' for 8 solo mixed voices, Netherland Radio Chamber Choir, 1985\n* ''Secondo quartetto'' (Mondriaan Quartet)\n* ''Tracce'' for flute, 1985-1987\n* ''Plot in fiction'' for bassoon, English horn and 11 instruments, 1986\n* ''Respiro'' for trombone solo, 1987\n* ''Trama'' for saxophone and orchestra, 1987\n* ''Mambo'', for piano solo, 1987\n* ''Attesa'' for reed quartet, 1988\n* ''La voce'', folk song for soprano and 13 instruments (text by [[Umberto Fiori]]), 1988\n* ''Aeuia'' for baritone and 11 instruments (based on a text by di [[Jacopone da Todi]]), 1989\n* ''Les barricades myst\u00e9rieuses'' for flute and orchestra, 1989\n* ''Piccola trama'' for saxophone and 8 instruments, 1989\n* ''Richiami II - 1st study on memory'', 1989\u20131992\n* ''Memoria'' for orchestra, 1990\n* ''Secondo Concerto'' for oboe and chamber orchestra, 1991\n* ''Mittel'' for five moving bands, 1991\n* ''Riti neurali, 3rd study on memory'' for violin and 8 instruments, 1991\n* ''Islands concerto'' for piano and chamber orchestra, 1992\n* ''Miniature'' for 16 instruments, 1992\n* ''Voci'' for soprano, violin and magnetic tape (text by [[Umberto Fiori]]), 1992\n* ''Aria'' for wind octet, 1993\n* ''Plot II'' for saxophone and 15 instruments, 1993\n* ''Risonanze d'Orfeo'', suite for wind orchestra from'''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'' di [[Claudio Monteverdi]], 1993\n* ''Trama II'' for clarinet, orchestra and live electronics, 1993\n* ''Terzo quartetto \"Mirrors\" ''for strings, Arditti Quartet, De Singel Antwerpen, 1994\n* ''Ballata del rovescio del mondo'', radio-opera on texts by [[Umberto Fiori]], 1994\n* ''Etymo'' for soprano, chamber orchestra and live electronics, from [[Charles Baudelaire]], commission by IRCAM for soprano, Ensemble InterContemporain, conductor [[Pascal Roph\u00e9]], soprano Luisa Castellani, Klangregie by the composer,1994\n* ''A fuoco - 4th study on memory'' for guitar and ensemble, 1995\n* ''Animus'' for trombone and live electronics, 1995\u20131996\n* ''Inquieta limina.

During this transient period he met Jack Kerouac outside Seattle Washington and worked at a mob-owned restaurant in San Jose as a dishwasher. In 1965 he began work back in Minnesota as a letterpress and offset printer. Switching careers, he then worked for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources wildlife section in the 1970s and later as a wildlife technician at the Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge in South Dakota. He is now retired.\n\nIn 1972 he helped found the Minnesota Writers\u2019 Publishing House (MWPH), a publishing cooperative, backed by Robert and Carol Bly, established to highlight Midwestern literature. For many years, Hennen operated the MWPH press in his garage.<ref>Tom's son Matt</ref>\n\nHennen\u2019s poetry appears in [[Garrison Keillor]]\u2019s anthology ''Good Poems'', and he has been further honored by the presentation of ''Bachelor Farmer Lifetime Achievement Award in the Arts''.\n\nHennen belongs to a cohort of Minnesota poets strongly influenced by [[Robert Bly]], [[Louis Jenkins (poet)|Louis Jenkins]] and [[Bill Holm (poet)]]. He is a poet of the landscape\u2014in the words of Bly, his poems have an \u201cability to bring immense amounts of space, often uninhabited space, into his mind and so into the whole poem.\u201d<ref>Introduction to ''Love for Other Things: New and Selected Poems'', Dacotah Territory, Moorhead State University, 1993</ref> This yearning to describe the feeling of space has led to his extensive use of the prose poem, where he has found room to \u201cmove freely within the rectangular tract of the paragraph.\u201d<ref>Thomas R.
