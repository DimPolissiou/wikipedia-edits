It was used mainly for [[association football|football]] matches. The stadium, which was an all-seater, had a capacity of 38,652, though its original capacity exceeded 100,000. The stadium was closed in 2016 and demolished in 2017 to give place to the [[Pusk\u00e1s Ar\u00e9na]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion bej\u00e1rat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The entrance of the stadium]]\n[[File:N\u00e9pstadion makettje az 1952. \u00e1prilis 4 \u00fcnneps\u00e9gen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The plan of the stadium]]\n\nThe first plan of a national stadium were drafted as early as 1896 when there were chances that Budapest would host the first modern [[Olympic Games]].\n\nIn 1911 Budapest was one of the frontrunners to host the [[1920 Olympics]].  However, after [[Austria-Hungary]]'s defeat in [[World War I]], the Games were awarded to [[Antwerp]] instead.\n\nThe location of the first plan included [[Budapest XI. ker\u00fclete|Budapest XI. district]] and [[Budapest X. ker\u00fclete|Budapest X. district]].\n\nIn 1924 the government imposed a sport tax which was supposed to be use for the construction of a new national stadium, but finally this money was not used for the construction.\n\nThe stadium was built between 1948 and 1953 using a large number of volunteers, including soldiers. It opened in 1953 as ''N\u00e9pstadion''' (\"People's Stadium\").  Less than one year later, on 23 May 1954, the [[England national football team#Post-war|English football team]] suffered its worst ever defeat here (7\u20131).\n\nOn 14 August 2002 [[Zalaegerszegi TE]] moved their [[UEFA Champions League]] qualifying match first leg from their home ground to this stadium in order to host [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in order to accommodate a 40,000 crowd. They were rewarded with Zalaegerszeg scoring their most famous European victory, winning 1\u20130 with [[B\u00e9la Kopl\u00e1rovics]] becoming the hero with a 92nd-minute winner. Zalaegerszegi lost the return leg at [[Old Trafford]] 0\u20135 and went out of the competition 1\u20135 on aggregate.\n\nIn 2002, the stadium was renamed in honour of [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]], widely regarded as the best striker in the world in his time and Hungary's greatest footballer ever, who was the star of the national team during its glory years of the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{in

Zalaegerszegi lost the return leg at [[Old Trafford]] 0\u20135 and went out of the competition 1\u20135 on aggregate.\n\nIn 2002, the stadium was renamed in honour of [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]], widely regarded as the best striker in the world in his time and Hungary's greatest footballer ever, who was the star of the national team during its glory years of the late 1940s and early 1950s.<ref>{{in

He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and the god of war [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. He is also known in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Amor}}'' (\"Love\"). His [[interpretatio graeca|Greek counterpart]] is [[Eros]].<ref name=\"Lar\">''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.</ref>\nAlthough Eros is generally portrayed as a slender winged youth in [[Classical Greece|Classical]] [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]], during the [[Hellenisticharli damelioc period]], he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy. During this time, his iconography acquired the [[bow and arrow]] that represent his source of power: a person, or even a deity, who is shot by Cupid's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire. In myths, Cupid is a minor character who serves mostly to set the plot in motion. He is a main character only in the tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]], when wounded by his own weapons, he experiences the ordeal of love. Although other extended stories are not told about him, his tradition is rich in poetic themes and visual scenarios, such as \"Love conquers all\" and the retaliatory punishment or torture of Cupid.\nHis powers are similar, though not identical, to [[Kamadeva]] the [[Hindu]] god of human love.\n\nIn art, Cupid often appears in multiples as the '''Amores''', or ''{{lang|it|amorini}}'' in the later terminology of [[art history]], the equivalent of the Greek [[Erotes (mythology)|erotes]]. Cupids are a frequent motif of both [[ancient Roman art|Roman art]] and later [[Western art]] of the [[classical tradition]]. In the 15th century, the iconography of Cupid starts to become indistinguishable from the [[putto]].\n\nCupid continued to be a popular figure in the [[Middle Ages]], when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love. In the [[Renaissance]], a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex [[allegory|allegorical]] meanings. In contemporary popular culture, Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love, often as an icon of [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>This introduction is based on the entry on \"Cupid\" in ''The Classical Tradition,'' edited by Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, and Salvatore Settis (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 244\u2013246.</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Cup\u012bd\u014d'' ('passionate desire') is a derivation of [[Latin]] ''cupi\u014d'', ''cupiere'' ('to desire'), stemming from [[Proto-Italic language|Proto-Italic]] ''*kupi'', ''*kupei'' ('to desire'), ultimately from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*kup(e)i'' ('to tremble, desire').{{Sfn|de Vaan|2008|p=155}}\n\n==Origins and birth==\n[[File:Ascoli Satriano Painter - Red-Figure Plate with Eros - Walters 482765.jpg|thumb|A [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] plate with Eros as a youth making an offering (c. 340\u2013320 BC). [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]\n\nThe Romans [[interpretatio graeca|reinterpreted]] myths and concepts pertaining to the Greek Eros for Cupid in their own literature and art, and medieval and Renaissance mythographers [[conflation|conflate]] the two freely. In the Greek tradition, Eros had a dual, contradictory genealogy. He was among the [[Greek primordial gods|primordial gods]] who came into existence asexually; after his generation, deities were begotten through male-female unions.<ref>Leonard Muellner, ''The Anger of Achilles: ''M\u1ec5nis'' in Greek Epic'' (Cornell University Press, 1996), pp. 57\u201358; [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]], \"One ... Two ... Three: Er\u014ds,\" in ''Before Sexuality: The Construction of Erotic Experience in the Ancient Greek World'' (Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 467.</ref> In [[Hesiod]]'s ''Theogony'', only [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth) are older. Before the existence of gender dichotomy, Eros functioned by causing entities to separate from themselves that which they already contained.<ref>Vernant, \"One ... Two ... Three: Er\u014ds,\" p. 465ff.</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the Eros who was pictured as a boy or slim youth was regarded as the child of a divine couple, the identity of whom varied by source. The influential Renaissance mythographer [[Natale Conti]] began his chapter on Cupid/Eros by declaring that the Greeks themselves were unsure about his parentage: Heaven and Earth,<ref>[[Sappho]], fragment 31.</ref> [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]],<ref>[[Simonides]], fragment 54.</ref> [[Nyx|Night]] and [[Aether (mythology)|Ether]],<ref>[[Acusilaus]], ''[[FGrH]]'' 1A 3 frg. 6C.</ref> or [[Eris (mythology)|Strife]] and [[Zephyros|Zephyr]].<ref>[[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], fragment 13.

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] says that [[Volcanus|Vulcan]], as the husband of Venus, is the father of Cupid.<ref>Seneca, ''Octavia'' 560.</ref> [[Cicero]], however, says that there were three Cupids, as well as three Venuses: the first Cupid was the son of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the second of Mercury and the second Venus, and the third of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the third Venus. This last Cupid was the equivalent of [[Anteros]], \"Counter-Love,\" one of the [[Erotes (mythology)|Erotes]], the gods who embody aspects of love.<ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]] 3.59\u201360.</ref> The multiple Cupids frolicking in art are the decorative manifestation of these proliferating loves and desires. During the [[English Renaissance]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] wrote of \"ten thousand Cupids\"; in [[Ben Jonson]]'s wedding [[masque]] ''[[Hymenaei]]'', \"a thousand several-coloured loves ... hop about the nuptial room\".<ref>M.T. Jones-Davies and Ton Hoenselaars, introduction to ''Masque of Cupids'', edited and annotated by John Jowett, in ''Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 1031.</ref>\n\nIn the later [[classical tradition]], Cupid is most often regarded as the son of Venus and Mars, whose love affair represented an [[allegory]] of Love and War.<ref name=\"Cupid-p244\">\"Cupid,\" ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 244.</ref> The duality between the primordial and the sexually conceived Eros accommodated philosophical concepts of Heavenly and Earthly Love even in the Christian era.<ref>Entry on \"Cupid,\" ''The Classical Tradition'', p. 244.</ref>\n\n==Attributes and themes==\n[[File:Piero della Francesca - Cupid Blindfolded - WGA17587.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A blindfolded, armed Cupid (1452/66) by [[Piero della Francesca]]]]\n[[File:Edme Bouchardon, Cupid, 1744, NGA 41708.jpg|thumb|left|[[Edme Bouchardon]], Cupid, 1744, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n\nCupid is winged, allegedly because lovers are flighty and likely to change their minds, and boyish because love is irrational.

A person wounded by the golden arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire, but the one struck by the lead feels aversion and desires only to flee. The use of these arrows is described by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Latin poet]] [[Ovid]] in the first book of his ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. When [[Apollo]] taunts Cupid as the lesser archer, Cupid shoots him with the golden arrow, but strikes the object of his desire, the nymph [[Daphne (mythology)|Daphne]], with the lead. Trapped by Apollo's unwanted advances, Daphne prays to her father, the river god [[Peneus]], who turns her into a laurel, the tree sacred to Apollo. It is the first of several unsuccessful or tragic love affairs for Apollo.<ref>Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 1.463\u2013473.</ref>\n\nA variation is found in ''[[The Kingis Quair]]'', a 15th-century poem attributed to [[James I of Scotland]], in which Cupid has three arrows: gold, for a gentle \"smiting\" that is easily cured; the more compelling silver; and steel, for a love-wound that never heals.<ref>''[[The Kingis Quair]]'', lines 92\u201399; [[Walter W.

He is often depicted with his mother (in graphic arts, this is nearly always Venus), playing a horn. In other images, his mother is depicted scolding or even spanking him due to his mischievous nature. He is also shown wearing a helmet and carrying a buckler, perhaps in reference to [[Virgil]]'s ''Omnia vincit amor'' or as [[political satire]] on wars for love, or love as war.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Cupid\">\nFile:Lucas Cranach the Elder - Venus with Cupid Stealing Honey - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] \u2013 ''Venus with Cupid Stealing Honey''\nFile:M\u00e5lning.

He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and the god of war [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]. He is also known in Latin as ''{{lang|la|Amor}}'' (\"Love\"). His [[interpretatio graeca|Greek counterpart]] is [[Eros]].<ref name=\"Lar\">''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.</ref>\nAlthough Eros is generally portrayed as a slender winged youth in [[Classical Greece|Classical]] [[ancient Greek art|Greek art]], during the [[Hellenistic period]], he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy. During this time, his iconography acquired the [[bow and arrow]] that represent his source of power: a person, or even a deity, who is shot by Cupid's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire. In myths, Cupid is a minor character who serves mostly to set the plot in motion. He is a main character only in the tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]], when wounded by his own weapons, he experiences the ordeal of love. Although other extended stories are not told about him, his tradition is rich in poetic themes and visual scenarios, such as \"Love conquers all\" and the retaliatory punishment or torture of Cupid.\nHis powers are similar, though not identical, to [[Kamadeva]] the [[Hindu]] god of human love.\n\nIn art, Cupid often appears in multiples as the '''Amores''', or ''{{lang|it|amorini}}'' in the later terminology of [[art history]], the equivalent of the Greek [[Erotes (mythology)|erotes]]. Cupids are a frequent motif of both [[ancient Roman art|Roman art]] and later [[Western art]] of the [[classical tradition]]. In the 15th century, the iconography of Cupid starts to become indistinguishable from the [[putto]].\n\nCupid continued to be a popular figure in the [[Middle Ages]], when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love. In the [[Renaissance]], a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex [[allegory|allegorical]] meanings. In contemporary popular culture, Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love, often as an icon of [[Valentine's Day]].<ref>This introduction is based on the entry on \"Cupid\" in ''The Classical Tradition,'' edited by Anthony Grafton, Glenn W.

[[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]\n\nThe Romans [[interpretatio graeca|reinterpreted]] myths and concepts pertaining to the Greek Eros for Cupid in their own literature and art, and medieval and Renaissance mythographers [[conflation|conflate]] the two freely. In the Greek tradition, Eros had a dual, contradictory genealogy. He was among the [[Greek primordial gods|primordial gods]] who came into existence asexually; after his generation, deities were begotten through male-female unions.<ref>Leonard Muellner, ''The Anger of Achilles: ''M\u1ec5nis'' in Greek Epic'' (Cornell University Press, 1996), pp. 57\u201358; [[Jean-Pierre Vernant]], \"One ...

Three: Er\u014ds,\" in ''Before Sexuality: The Construction of Erotic Experience in the Ancient Greek World'' (Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 467.</ref> In [[Hesiod]]'s ''Theogony'', only [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth) are older. Before the existence of gender dichotomy, Eros functioned by causing entities to separate from themselves that which they already contained.<ref>Vernant, \"One ... Two ... Three: Er\u014ds,\" p. 465ff.</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the Eros who was pictured as a boy or slim youth was regarded as the child of a divine couple, the identity of whom varied by source. The influential Renaissance mythographer [[Natale Conti]] began his chapter on Cupid/Eros by declaring that the Greeks themselves were unsure about his parentage: Heaven and Earth,<ref>[[Sappho]], fragment 31.</ref> [[Ares]] and [[Aphrodite]],<ref>[[Simonides]], fragment 54.</ref> [[Nyx|Night]] and [[Aether (mythology)|Ether]],<ref>[[Acusilaus]], ''[[FGrH]]'' 1A 3 frg. 6C.</ref> or [[Eris (mythology)|Strife]] and [[Zephyros|Zephyr]].<ref>[[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]], fragment 13.

[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] says that [[Volcanus|Vulcan]], as the husband of Venus, is the father of Cupid.<ref>Seneca, ''Octavia'' 560.</ref> [[Cicero]], however, says that there were three Cupids, as well as three Venuses: the first Cupid was the son of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], the second of Mercury and the second Venus, and the third of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the third Venus. This last Cupid was the equivalent of [[Anteros]], \"Counter-Love,\" one of the [[Erotes (mythology)|Erotes]], the gods who embody aspects of love.<ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]] 3.59\u201360.</ref> The multiple Cupids frolicking in art are the decorative manifestation of these proliferating loves and desires.

His symbols are the arrow and torch, \"because love wounds and inflames the heart.\" These attributes and their interpretation were established by late antiquity, as summarized by [[Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636 AD) in his ''[[Etymologiae]]''.<ref>Isidore, ''Etymologies'' 8.11.80.</ref> Cupid is also sometimes depicted blindfolded and described as blind, not so much in the sense of sightless\u2014since the sight of the beloved can be a spur to love\u2014as blinkered and arbitrary.

From a 14th-century text of [[Roman de la Rose]].]]\nCupid carries two kinds of arrows, or darts, one with a sharp golden point, and the other with a blunt tip of lead. A person wounded by the golden arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire, but the one struck by the lead feels aversion and desires only to flee. The use of these arrows is described by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Latin poet]] [[Ovid]] in the first book of his ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. When [[Apollo]] taunts Cupid as the lesser archer, Cupid shoots him with the golden arrow, but strikes the object of his desire, the nymph [[Daphne (mythology)|Daphne]], with the lead. Trapped by Apollo's unwanted advances, Daphne prays to her father, the river god [[Peneus]], who turns her into a laurel, the tree sacred to Apollo. It is the first of several unsuccessful or tragic love affairs for Apollo.<ref>Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 1.463\u2013473.</ref>\n\nA variation is found in ''[[The Kingis Quair]]'', a 15th-century poem attributed to [[James I of Scotland]], in which Cupid has three arrows: gold, for a gentle \"smiting\" that is easily cured; the more compelling silver; and steel, for a love-wound that never heals.<ref>''[[The Kingis Quair]]'', lines 92\u201399; [[Walter W.

Venus laughs, and points out the poetic justice: he too is small, and yet delivers the sting of love.\n\nThe story was first told about Eros in the ''Idylls'' of [[Theocritus]] (3rd century BC).<ref>Theocritus, ''Idyll'' 19. It also appears in [[Anacreontea|Anacreontic poetry]].</ref> It was retold numerous times in both art and poetry during the Renaissance. The theme brought the ''[[Amoretti]]'' poetry cycle (1595) of [[Edmund Spenser]] to a conclusion,<ref>Jane Kingsley-Smith, ''Cupid in Early Modern Literature and Culture'' (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 12.</ref> and furnished subject matter for at least twenty works by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and his workshop.<ref>Charles Sterling ''et al.'', ''Fifteenth- to Eighteenth-Century European Paintings in the Robert Lehman Collection: France, Central Europe, The Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 43\u201344.</ref> The German poet and classicist [[Karl Philipp Conz]] (1762\u20131827) framed the tale as ''[[Schadenfreude]]'' (\"taking pleasure in someone else's pain\") in a poem by the same title.<ref>Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His M\u00f6rike Songs'', p. 119.</ref> In a version by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], a writer of the [[German Enlightenment]], the incident prompts Cupid to turn himself into a bee:\n<blockquote>Through this sting was Amor made wiser.<br>The untiring deceiver<br>concocted another battle-plan:<br>he lurked beneath the carnations and roses<br>and when a maiden came to pick them,<br>he flew out as a bee and stung her.<ref>Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, ''Die Biene''; Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His M\u00f6rike Songs'', p. 119.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe image of Cupid as a bee is part of a complex tradition of poetic imagery involving the flower of youth, the sting of love as a deflowering, and honey as a secretion of love.<ref>Youens, ''Hugo Wolf and His M\u00f6rike Songs'', pp. 117\u2013120.</ref>\n[[File:Herculaneum - Lyre and Cupids.jpg|thumb|upright|Cupids playing with a [[lyre]], [[Roman art|Roman fresco]] from [[Herculaneum]]]]\n\n===Cupid and dolphins===\n\nIn both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a [[dolphin]].

The dolphin, often elaborated fantastically, might be constructed as a spout for a fountain.<ref>Anthony King, \"Mammals: Evidence from Wall Paintings, Sculpture, Mosaics, Faunal Remains, and Ancient Literary Sources,\" in ''The Natural History of Pompeii'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002), pp. 419\u2013420.</ref> On a modern-era fountain in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]], [[Florence, Italy]], Cupid seems to be strangling a dolphin.<ref>\"Archaeological News,\" ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 11.2 (1896), p. 304.</ref>\n\nDolphins were often portrayed in antiquity as friendly to humans, and the dolphin itself could represent affection.

A [[madrigal]] by his literary rival [[Gaspare Murtola]] exhorted artists to paint the theme. A catalogue of works from antiquity collected by the [[House of Mattei|Mattei family]], patrons of [[Caravaggio]], included sketches of sleeping cupids based on sculpture from the [[Temple of Venus Erycina]] in Rome. Caravaggio, whose works Murtola is known for describing, took up the challenge with his 1608 ''[[Sleeping Cupid (Caravaggio)|Sleeping Cupid]]'', a disturbing depiction of an unhealthy, immobilized child with \"jaundiced skin, flushed cheeks, bluish lips and ears, the emaciated chest and swollen belly, the wasted muscles and inflamed joints.\" The model is thought to have suffered from [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref>John L.

It concerns the overcoming of obstacles to the love between Psyche (\"Soul\" or \"Breath of Life\") and Cupid, and their ultimate union in marriage.\n\nThe fame of Psyche's beauty threatens to eclipse that of Venus herself, and the love goddess sends Cupid to work her revenge. Cupid, however, becomes enamored of Psyche, and arranges for her to be taken to his palace. He visits her by night, warning her not to try to look upon him. Psyche's envious sisters convince her that her lover must be a hideous monster, and she finally introduces a lamp into their chamber to see him. Startled by his beauty, she drips hot oil from the lamp and wakes him. He abandons her. She wanders the earth looking for him, and finally submits to the service of Venus, who tortures her. The goddess then sends Psyche on a series of quests. Each time she despairs, and each time she is given divine aid. On her final task, she is to retrieve a dose of [[Proserpina]]'s beauty from the underworld. She succeeds, but on the way back can't resist opening the box in the hope of benefitting from it herself, whereupon she falls into a torpid sleep. Cupid finds her in this state, and revives her by returning the sleep to the box. Cupid grants her immortality so the couple can be wed as equals.\n\nThe story's [[Neoplatonic]] elements and allusions to [[mystery religions]] accommodate multiple interpretations,<ref>Stephen Harrison, entry on \"Cupid,\" ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 338.</ref> and it has been analyzed as an [[allegory]] and in light of [[folklore|folktale]], [[Fairy tale#Terminology|M\u00e4rchen]] or [[fairy tale]], and [[myth]].<ref>[[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], \"Cupid and Psyche,\" reprinted in ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), pp. 84\u201392.</ref> Often presented as an allegory of love overcoming death, the story was a frequent source of imagery for [[Roman sarcophagi]] and other extant art of antiquity. Since the rediscovery of Apuleius's novel in the [[Renaissance]], the [[reception theory|reception]] of ''Cupid and Psyche'' in the [[classical tradition]] has been extensive.

He is often depicted with his mother (in graphic arts, this is nearly always Venus), playing a horn. In other images, his mother is depicted scolding or even spanking him due to his mischievous nature. He is also shown wearing a helmet and carrying a buckler, perhaps in reference to [[Virgil]]'s ''Omnia vincit amor'' or as [[political satire]] on wars for love, or love as war.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Cupid\">\nFile:Lucas Cranach the Elder - Venus with Cupid Stealing Honey - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] \u2013 ''Venus with Cupid Stealing Honey''\nFile:M\u00e5lning.

As a starting point in establishing the link between elasticity and displacement, a number of simplifying assumptions are usually made about tissue behavior and structure. Most commonly, tissue is approximated as a linear elastic solid with isotropic mechanical properties. The assumption of linearity is commonly valid for the level of strain (typically <10%) applied in elastography.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kennedy | first1 = Brendan F. | last2 = Kennedy | first2 = Kelsey M. | last3 = Sampson | first3 = David D. | year = 2014 | title = A review of optical coherence elastography: fundamentals, techniques and prospects | url = | journal = IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 272\u2013288 }}</ref>\n\n==Selected application==\nOptical coherence elastography holds great promise for detecting and monitoring the altered mechanical properties that accompany many clinical conditions and pathologies, particularly in cancer, cardiovascular disease and eye disease.\n===Ophthalmology===\nIn ophthalmology, OCE could be utilized to characterize the mechanical properties of cornea in order to diagnose related ocular disease: especially to diagnose and assess the properties of keratoconus, which provides necessary information to establish adaptive biomechanical models of the cornea for the optimization of individual laser ablation procedure<ref>Edmund C.

The band was formed in 1993 by ex-[[Ceremonial Oath]] guitarist [[Oscar Dronjak]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early days (1993\u20131996) ===\nHammerFall was formed when rhythm guitarist [[Oscar Dronjak]] quit [[Ceremonial Oath]] and invited [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] (from [[Ceremonial Oath]] and [[In Flames]]) to join him as a drummer in a new musical project he had been contemplating for some time. Dronjak had already composed the song \"Steel Meets Steel,\" which was later included on HammerFall's debut album. Dronjak and Str\u00f6mblad were later joined by lead guitarist [[Niklas Sundin]], bassist [[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]], and vocalist [[Mikael Stanne]]. When Niklas Sundin and Johan Larsson left HammerFall the following year, [[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]] (then guitarist of [[In Flames]]) and Fredrik Larsson (bassist of the former Swedish [[death metal]] band [[Dispatched]]), replaced them.\n\n[[File:Masters of Rock 2007 - Hammerfall - Joacim Cans - 01.jpg|left|thumb|165px|Joacim Cans joined the band in 1996]]\nAll five members played in other bands at the time. Dronjak and Larsson played in ''Crystal Age''; Str\u00f6mblad and Ljungstr\u00f6m played in [[In Flames]] and Stanne sang for [[Dark Tranquillity]]. Both of these bands influenced Swedish [[melodic death metal]]. HammerFall was relegated to being a side project of them all for several years. Their concerts were limited mostly to a local music contest named ''Rockslaget''. The band had few songs of their own and played mostly covers from bands such as [[Pretty Maids]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Alice Cooper]].\n\nIn 1996, HammerFall reached the semi-finals of ''Rockslaget''. When Mikael Stanne could not perform with the band in the semi-finals, they found [[Joacim Cans]], who agreed to play with them for the night. The concert was a success although the judges disqualified HammerFall for the finals. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.\n\n===''Glory to the Brave'' and ''Legacy of Kings'' (1997\u20131999)===\nTo give more exposure to their work and try for a professional recording deal, a short live performance was recorded and sent to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] label, Vic Records.[http://www.vicrecords.com/] The musicians soon received a deal and spent the whole of the following year writing the album ''[[Glory to the Brave]]''. The album was initially released in the Netherlands and obtained positive feedback; it is also worthy of notice that the band's [[mascot]], the [[Paladin (character class)|paladin]] Hector, first appeared on the cover of this album.\n\nAs HammerFall grew in popularity, the time available for members of the band to dedicate to other projects became limited. Dronjak and Cans wanted to pursue the path of Hammerfall (Dronjak's Crystal Age had ceased to exist some time ago), but Str\u00f6mblad and Ljungstr\u00f6m were committed to In Flames and Larsson was committed to the [[thrash metal]] band ''None''. Thus, HammerFall's line-up soon underwent changes. [[Stefan Elmgren]] assumed the lead guitar and Patrik R\u00e4fling assumed the drums (they joined the band in the end of 1997 after the release of ''Glory to the Brave'' album) and Larsson decided to remain in the band until a suitable replacement for him was found. This happened in May 1997, when bassist [[Magnus Ros\u00e9n]] joined the band. Stefan Elmgren played some of the guitars on the ''Glory to the Brave'' album (such as the acoustic guitars on \"I Believe\") and Patrik R\u00e4fling actually played the drums on all songs in place of Jesper. However, at the time they were considered as guest performers, not members of the band.\n\n[[File:Jesper Stromblad, IN FLAMES, 2008.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Jesper Str\u00f6mblad left the band in 1997]]\nIn early 1997, German label [[Nuclear Blast]] approached HammerFall with a contract for a European release deal, which included four albums. The deal was accepted and the band proceeded to record their first two [[music video]]s &mdash; \"HammerFall\" and \"Glory to the Brave\". After the release of a promotional single, ''Glory to the Brave'' was released throughout Europe. The results were quite unexpected, even after the intense marketing campaign made by Nuclear Blast. The album reached position number 38 on the German Music Chart on the week of its release, something which had never before been achieved by a debut [[heavy metal music]] album.\n\nSiding with bands [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Jag Panzer]], [[Lake of Tears]] and [[Raven (band)|Raven]], several tours through the European continent ensued. The concert on [[Wacken Open Air]] was performed to a crowd of over ten thousand people.\n\nTowards the end of 1997, ''Glory to the Brave'' was released in Japan and the United States. Sales of the album reached one hundred thousand copies. HammerFall was also nominated for the Swedish [[Grammy]] award in the ''Best Hard Rock act'' category.\n\nIn February 1998 they did a small club tour (5 gigs) in Belgium and the Netherlands. Support was the Belgian band [[Double Diamond (band)|Double Diamond]], who later became [[Fireforce]]\n\nIn February 1998, the recording of ''[[Legacy of Kings]]'' began. This album was once more written by Joacim, Oscar, and Jesper, who despite having quit the band still took part in the process in order to keep the same general mood of their first release. The album was produced by [[Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m]] (from [[Dream Evil]]) and Oscar, with the help of Joacim. The band spent a total of one and a half months in the studio recording this album.\n\nHammerFall made some expressive concerts before the release of ''Legacy of Kings'', playing in festivals together with bands such as [[Alice Cooper]], [[Rammstein]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Dream Theater]], [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] and [[Stratovarius]].\n\nTheir first world tour took place in October 1998. During the shows in Sweden, Joacim Cans caught a serious throat infection which made it impossible for him to sing. Shortly afterwards, Magnus Ros\u00e9n was afflicted with the same disease, and after him the whole of HammerFall's support crew became sick. The members of the band played for as long as possible and then were forced to postpone or cancel a few dates. During their passage through South America, HammerFall took a short break to visit the [[Brazil]]ian beaches, but they soon resumed their tour.\n\nBy the end of that tour, drummer Patrik R\u00e4fling left the band, and [[Anders Johansson (drummer)|Anders Johansson]], a friend of Magnus Ros\u00e9n, joined as a touring musician. In the beginning of 1999 he was made a permanent member of the band. Anders had previously worked with guitarist [[Yngwie J. Malmsteen|Yngwie Malmsteen]] on [[Rising Force]] in the 80's and 90's and on a number of other projects; he is the brother of [[Jens Johansson]] from [[Stratovarius]]. He has been praised for his technical and polyrhythmical talent, in metal as well as other genres.{{Relevance inline|date=May 2014|reason=So what? Technical and polyrhythmical drumming aren't exactly what HammerFall is famous for. This belongs rather in his own article.}}\n\n===''Renegade'' and ''Crimson Thunder'' (2000\u20132003)===\nAfter a long series of concerts, the band returned to Sweden in order to spend time with their families and begin writing songs for their next album. HammerFall made arrangements for this album to be recorded by Michael Wagener,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelwagener.com/ |title=Michael Wagener.com |publisher=Michael Wagener.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> who had previously produced bands such as [[Accept (band)|Accept]], [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. The recording took eight weeks, and the album was entitled ''[[Renegade (HammerFall album)|Renegade]]''. The switch from producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m to Wagener was met with skepticism from the media in general. However, after the release, critics were mostly positive, even though there was a consensus that the band's sound was remarkably different. A music video by director Roger Johansson was created for the song \"Renegade\" and reached the top of the Swedish parade; the same soon happened with the album itself, which reached gold status with over forty thousand copies sold.\n[[File:Anders Johansson 4.jpg|thumb|Anders Johansson]]\nOscar stated on www.metalrules.com just prior to the release of 'Renegade' that they were going for a more \"commercial\" sound in order to attract a broader audience that otherwise would have been lost to them and that future albums wouldn't follow in this mold.\n\nThe band's second world tour began in January 2001. Concerts from this tour counted with a replica version of the album's cover on stage. It was set up as a [[castle]] in ruins from which the musicians entered the stage. In total, the tour included almost sixty shows.\n\nThe band then released a [[DVD]] entitled ''[[The Templar Renegade Crusades]]'', which included video footage from recording sessions, live concerts, tour backstages, and encounters with fans. The footage ranged from the recording sessions of ''Legacy of Kings'' to the gold album party which took place in November 2001.\n\nHammerFall then proceeded to record their fourth album &mdash; ''[[Crimson Thunder]]''. Arrangements were made for recording sessions to take place in both ''JM Studios'': from [[Charlie Bauerfeind]], in ''[[Wisseloord Studios]]'' &mdash; in the Netherlands, and studio ''Blind Guardian'' &mdash; in Germany, for the bass.\n\nBy the end of the recording sessions in 2002, a listening session for the press was held. Overall, the reactions were quite positive, and most seemed to perceive the album as a change for the better from ''Renegade''. A single for the song \"Hearts on Fire\" was released six weeks prior to the album's launch and remained for weeks on the number one spot on the parades of some European countries. The song also attracted a number of new fans to the band due to its [[refrain|chorus]]-driven melody and simple riffs coupled with fast guitar solos.\n\nThe shooting of the music video  \"Hearts on Fire\" by director Roger Johansson was scheduled for August of that year. The band's plans, however, had to be held back for a week due to an incident that occurred one night. While Joacim was drinking with his girlfriend in a rock club he had been frequenting for over a decade, he was attacked by an unidentified person who hit him in the head with a beer glass and hastily escaped. Joacim instantly lost consciousness and had to be taken to a hospital, in which he underwent [[plastic surgery]] and rested for a couple of days. As soon as it became medically possible, he joined the band to record the music video.\n\nIn order to promote the release of the band's album in North America, they toured with [[Dio (band)|Dio]] during November and December 2002. Subsequently, the manager of the band disappeared, taking the entirety of the tour's revenue with him. Despite this the tour was very successful, and proceeded to Europe. Changes were made to the band's stage setting, and many investments were made on [[fireworks]] and on the presence of the mascot Hector on stage. The scenery on the cover of the single ''Hearts on Fire'' was also reproduced and added to the performances. The tour progressed to Japan and then to South America. HammerFall was present on festivals in Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic, playing with bands such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Slayer]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[U.D.O.]] and [[Stratovarius]].\n\nHammerFall's tour was brought to a sudden end when Oscar Dronjak suffered a [[motorcycle]] accident, breaking his left arm and sustaining several minor injuries.\n\nThey were then left with no choice but to take a break. Stefan dedicated himself to getting a [[aviator|pilot]] license, Magnus and Anders continued working on their side projects and Joacim began work on his solo album and had his first child. Oscar simply focused on recovering. Together with a group of specialists, he was able to recover to his full capacities. He then joined Anders, Joacim, Stefan again, with bands [[Helloween]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] and [[Pretty Maids]], amongst others, and played in the celebration of the 20 years of the German rock club ''Rockfabrik''.\n\n===''Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken'' and ''Threshold'' (2005\u20132008)===\nThe live album and DVD ''One Crimson Night'' was released in February 2003. After two years of hiatus the band released ''[[Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken]]'', which was followed by a European and South American tour. A video for the song \"Bloodbound\" was made by director Roger Johansson.\n\nOn October 16 it was reported that HammerFall (along with the band [[Europe (band)|Europe]]) would be part of the Eurovision song contest.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6536 |title=Eurovision Song Contest - Dusseldorf 2011 &#124; News - Melodifestivalen going Heavy Metal? |publisher=Esctoday.com |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> This rumor was refuted by lead singer Joacim Cans only a couple weeks later.

The reason for his departure stated that he was unhappy in the band and wants to focus on other projects. On his own website (and therefore with his own official statement) it was announced that Magnus was tired of the simple bassplaying he was forced to play in HammerFall, and that he was unable to bring his own material to the band. He now wants to \"be more creative in his career\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magnusrosen.net/news/view.asp?id=50 |title=De beste bron van informatie over magnusrosen.

These are \"Last Man Standing\", \"Restless Soul\", and \"The Abyss\". They also rerecorded the Glory To The Brave track \"HammerFall\". \"[[Steel Meets Steel - Ten Years of Glory]]\" was released on 12 October 2007.\n\nOn April 2, 2008 [[Stefan Elmgren]] announced his decision to leave HammerFall in order to pursue a career as a commercial pilot.  His replacement is [[Pontus Norgren]] from [[The Poodles]]. On June 27, 2008, the band released the compilation album \"[[Masterpieces (HammerFall album)|Masterpieces]]\". The album has on it a collection of every song the band has covered, plus three new cover songs previously unreleased. This was [[Stefan Elmgren]]'s last release with the band.\n\n===''No Sacrifice, No Victory'' and ''Infected'' (2009\u20132012)===\n\nHammerFall's album ''[[No Sacrifice, No Victory]]'' was released in February 2009.

To kick off their new album, HammerFall toured all over the world with several support bands, such as fellow Swedish band [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]]. In the summer 2010 the band played a couple of high-profile festivals throughout Europe, including [[Sonisphere Festival]], [[High Voltage Festival]], [[Metalcamp]], [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and many more.

The DVD celebrated 15 years of the band's existence, and was titled \"Gates of Dalhalla\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/HammerFall/Gates_of_Dalhalla/352964|title=HammerFall - Gates of Dalhalla - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|author=|date=|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>\nIn 2013, HammerFall took a break and some time to spend with their families or side-works.

The vocals were recorded by James Michael. For the mix, Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m spent 3 weeks in his own Studio.\n\n[[(r)Evolution]] was released on August 29, 2014, and stormed the charts worldwide, debuting on #1 in Sweden and on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart, as well as reaching Top 5 in several other countries. The subsequent tour, dubbed the World Wide (r)Evolution 2014-15, will see HammerFall return to Latin America together with Edguy and Gotthard, followed by a full European assasult in the beginning of 2015. The band was somewhat distraught when drummer Anders Johansson left shortly after the release of (r)Evolution, but David Wallin (Pain) was brought in as a temporary replacement to ensure that the show would go on. Around the same time, it was also decided that Fredrik would be on parental leave from September 2014 through March 2015. Former guitar player Stefan Elmgren stepped in and will handle the 4-string duties during that period, making this line-up a unique experience. Currently, the band is in the midst of a wildly successful European tour, with 7 sold out shows already and more most likely coming.\n\nIn March 2016, the band announced that they had signed with Napalm Records. Their tenth studio album, ''[[Built to Last (Hammerfall album)|Built to Last]]'', was released on November 4, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/hammerfall-signs-with-napalm-records-new-album-due-in-november/|title=HAMMERFALL Signs With NAPALM RECORDS; New Album Due In November|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2016, David Wallin resigned from the band to focus on his family, and the same day the band introduced their new drummer Johan Koleberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/hammerfall-parts-ways-with-drummer-david-wallin-announces-replacement/|title=HAMMERFALL Parts Ways With Drummer DAVID WALLIN, Announces Replacement|author=|date=16 December 2016|website=blabbermouth.net|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn September 2, 2017, it was announced that David Wallin's family related issues had been resolved and that he was reinstated into the band.\n\nOn December 18, 2018, HammerFall announced their eleventh studio album ''[[Dominion (HammerFall album)|Dominion]]''.

The band was formed in 1993 by ex-[[Ceremonial Oath]] guitarist [[Oscar Dronjak]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early days (1993\u20131996) ===\nHammerFall was formed when rhythm guitarist [[Oscar Dronjak]] quit [[Ceremonial Oath]] and invited [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] (from [[Ceremonial Oath]] and [[In Flames]]) to join him as a drummer in a new musical project he had been contemplating for some time. Dronjak had already composed the song \"Steel Meets Steel,\" which was later included on HammerFall's debut album. Dronjak and Str\u00f6mblad were later joined by lead guitarist [[Niklas Sundin]], bassist [[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]], and vocalist [[Mikael Stanne]]. When Niklas Sundin and Johan Larsson left HammerFall the following year, [[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]] (then guitarist of [[In Flames]]) and Fredrik Larsson (bassist of the former Swedish [[death metal]] band [[Dispatched]]), replaced them.\n\n[[File:Masters of Rock 2007 - Hammerfall - Joacim Cans - 01.jpg|left|thumb|165px|Joacim Cans joined the band in 1996]]\nAll five members played in other bands at the time. Dronjak and Larsson played in ''Crystal Age''; Str\u00f6mblad and Ljungstr\u00f6m played in [[In Flames]] and Stanne sang for [[Dark Tranquillity]]. Both of these bands influenced Swedish [[melodic death metal]]. HammerFall was relegated to being a side project of them all for several years. Their concerts were limited mostly to a local music contest named ''Rockslaget''. The band had few songs of their own and played mostly covers from bands such as [[Pretty Maids]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Alice Cooper]].\n\nIn 1996, HammerFall reached the semi-finals of ''Rockslaget''. When Mikael Stanne could not perform with the band in the semi-finals, they found [[Joacim Cans]], who agreed to play with them for the night. The concert was a success although the judges disqualified HammerFall for the finals. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.\n\n===''Glory to the Brave'' and ''Legacy of Kings'' (1997\u20131999)===\nTo give more exposure to their work and try for a professional recording deal, a short live performance was recorded and sent to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] label, Vic Records.[http://www.vicrecords.com/] The musicians soon received a deal and spent the whole of the following year writing the album ''[[Glory to the Brave]]''. The album was initially released in the Netherlands and obtained positive feedback; it is also worthy of notice that the band's [[mascot]], the [[Paladin (character class)|paladin]] Hector, first appeared on the cover of this album.\n\nAs HammerFall grew in popularity, the time available for members of the band to dedicate to other projects became limited. Dronjak and Cans wanted to pursue the path of Hammerfall (Dronjak's Crystal Age had ceased to exist some time ago), but Str\u00f6mblad and Ljungstr\u00f6m were committed to In Flames and Larsson was committed to the [[thrash metal]] band ''None''. Thus, HammerFall's line-up soon underwent changes. [[Stefan Elmgren]] assumed the lead guitar and Patrik R\u00e4fling assumed the drums (they joined the band in the end of 1997 after the release of ''Glory to the Brave'' album) and Larsson decided to remain in the band until a suitable replacement for him was found. This happened in May 1997, when bassist [[Magnus Ros\u00e9n]] joined the band. Stefan Elmgren played some of the guitars on the ''Glory to the Brave'' album (such as the acoustic guitars on \"I Believe\") and Patrik R\u00e4fling actually played the drums on all songs in place of Jesper. However, at the time they were considered as guest performers, not members of the band.\n\n[[File:Jesper Stromblad, IN FLAMES, 2008.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Jesper Str\u00f6mblad left the band in 1997]]\nIn early 1997, German label [[Nuclear Blast]] approached HammerFall with a contract for a European release deal, which included four albums. The deal was accepted and the band proceeded to record their first two [[music video]]s &mdash; \"HammerFall\" and \"Glory to the Brave\". After the release of a promotional single, ''Glory to the Brave'' was released throughout Europe. The results were quite unexpected, even after the intense marketing campaign made by Nuclear Blast. The album reached position number 38 on the German Music Chart on the week of its release, something which had never before been achieved by a debut [[heavy metal music]] album.\n\nSiding with bands [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Jag Panzer]], [[Lake of Tears]] and [[Raven (band)|Raven]], several tours through the European continent ensued. The concert on [[Wacken Open Air]] was performed to a crowd of over ten thousand people.\n\nTowards the end of 1997, ''Glory to the Brave'' was released in Japan and the United States. Sales of the album reached one hundred thousand copies. HammerFall was also nominated for the Swedish [[Grammy]] award in the ''Best Hard Rock act'' category.\n\nIn February 1998 they did a small club tour (5 gigs) in Belgium and the Netherlands. Support was the Belgian band [[Double Diamond (band)|Double Diamond]], who later became [[Fireforce]]\n\nIn February 1998, the recording of ''[[Legacy of Kings]]'' began. This album was once more written by Joacim, Oscar, and Jesper, who despite having quit the band still took part in the process in order to keep the same general mood of their first release. The album was produced by [[Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m]] (from [[Dream Evil]]) and Oscar, with the help of Joacim. The band spent a total of one and a half months in the studio recording this album.\n\nHammerFall made some expressive concerts before the release of ''Legacy of Kings'', playing in festivals together with bands such as [[Alice Cooper]], [[Rammstein]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Dream Theater]], [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] and [[Stratovarius]].\n\nTheir first world tour took place in October 1998. During the shows in Sweden, Joacim Cans caught a serious throat infection which made it impossible for him to sing. Shortly afterwards, Magnus Ros\u00e9n was afflicted with the same disease, and after him the whole of HammerFall's support crew became sick. The members of the band played for as long as possible and then were forced to postpone or cancel a few dates. During their passage through South America, HammerFall took a short break to visit the [[Brazil]]ian beaches, but they soon resumed their tour.\n\nBy the end of that tour, drummer Patrik R\u00e4fling left the band, and [[Anders Johansson (drummer)|Anders Johansson]], a friend of Magnus Ros\u00e9n, joined as a touring musician. In the beginning of 1999 he was made a permanent member of the band. Anders had previously worked with guitarist [[Yngwie J. Malmsteen|Yngwie Malmsteen]] on [[Rising Force]] in the 80's and 90's and on a number of other projects; he is the brother of [[Jens Johansson]] from [[Stratovarius]]. He has been praised for his technical and polyrhythmical talent, in metal as well as other genres.{{Relevance inline|date=May 2014|reason=So what? Technical and polyrhythmical drumming aren't exactly what HammerFall is famous for. This belongs rather in his own article.}}\n\n===''Renegade'' and ''Crimson Thunder'' (2000\u20132003)===\nAfter a long series of concerts, the band returned to Sweden in order to spend time with their families and begin writing songs for their next album. HammerFall made arrangements for this album to be recorded by Michael Wagener,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelwagener.com/ |title=Michael Wagener.com |publisher=Michael Wagener.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> who had previously produced bands such as [[Accept (band)|Accept]], [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. The recording took eight weeks, and the album was entitled ''[[Renegade (HammerFall album)|Renegade]]''. The switch from producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m to Wagener was met with skepticism from the media in general. However, after the release, critics were mostly positive, even though there was a consensus that the band's sound was remarkably different. A music video by director Roger Johansson was created for the song \"Renegade\" and reached the top of the Swedish parade; the same soon happened with the album itself, which reached gold status with over forty thousand copies sold.\n[[File:Anders Johansson 4.jpg|thumb|Anders Johansson]]\nOscar stated on www.metalrules.com just prior to the release of 'Renegade' that they were going for a more \"commercial\" sound in order to attract a broader audience that otherwise would have been lost to them and that future albums wouldn't follow in this mold.\n\nThe band's second world tour began in January 2001. Concerts from this tour counted with a replica version of the album's cover on stage. It was set up as a [[castle]] in ruins from which the musicians entered the stage. In total, the tour included almost sixty shows.\n\nThe band then released a [[DVD]] entitled ''[[The Templar Renegade Crusades]]'', which included video footage from recording sessions, live concerts, tour backstages, and encounters with fans. The footage ranged from the recording sessions of ''Legacy of Kings'' to the gold album party which took place in November 2001.\n\nHammerFall then proceeded to record their fourth album &mdash; ''[[Crimson Thunder]]''. Arrangements were made for recording sessions to take place in both ''JM Studios'': from [[Charlie Bauerfeind]], in ''[[Wisseloord Studios]]'' &mdash; in the Netherlands, and studio ''Blind Guardian'' &mdash; in Germany, for the bass.\n\nBy the end of the recording sessions in 2002, a listening session for the press was held. Overall, the reactions were quite positive, and most seemed to perceive the album as a change for the better from ''Renegade''. A single for the song \"Hearts on Fire\" was released six weeks prior to the album's launch and remained for weeks on the number one spot on the parades of some European countries. The song also attracted a number of new fans to the band due to its [[refrain|chorus]]-driven melody and simple riffs coupled with fast guitar solos.\n\nThe shooting of the music video  \"Hearts on Fire\" by director Roger Johansson was scheduled for August of that year. The band's plans, however, had to be held back for a week due to an incident that occurred one night. While Joacim was drinking with his girlfriend in a rock club he had been frequenting for over a decade, he was attacked by an unidentified person who hit him in the head with a beer glass and hastily escaped. Joacim instantly lost consciousness and had to be taken to a hospital, in which he underwent [[plastic surgery]] and rested for a couple of days. As soon as it became medically possible, he joined the band to record the music video.\n\nIn order to promote the release of the band's album in North America, they toured with [[Dio (band)|Dio]] during November and December 2002. Subsequently, the manager of the band disappeared, taking the entirety of the tour's revenue with him. Despite this the tour was very successful, and proceeded to Europe. Changes were made to the band's stage setting, and many investments were made on [[fireworks]] and on the presence of the mascot Hector on stage. The scenery on the cover of the single ''Hearts on Fire'' was also reproduced and added to the performances. The tour progressed to Japan and then to South America. HammerFall was present on festivals in Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic, playing with bands such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Slayer]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[U.D.O.]] and [[Stratovarius]].\n\nHammerFall's tour was brought to a sudden end when Oscar Dronjak suffered a [[motorcycle]] accident, breaking his left arm and sustaining several minor injuries.\n\nThey were then left with no choice but to take a break. Stefan dedicated himself to getting a [[aviator|pilot]] license, Magnus and Anders continued working on their side projects and Joacim began work on his solo album and had his first child. Oscar simply focused on recovering. Together with a group of specialists, he was able to recover to his full capacities. He then joined Anders, Joacim, Stefan again, with bands [[Helloween]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] and [[Pretty Maids]], amongst others, and played in the celebration of the 20 years of the German rock club ''Rockfabrik''.\n\n===''Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken'' and ''Threshold'' (2005\u20132008)===\nThe live album and DVD ''One Crimson Night'' was released in February 2003. After two years of hiatus the band released ''[[Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken]]'', which was followed by a European and South American tour. A video for the song \"Bloodbound\" was made by director Roger Johansson.\n\nOn October 16 it was reported that HammerFall (along with the band [[Europe (band)|Europe]]) would be part of the Eurovision song contest.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6536 |title=Eurovision Song Contest - Dusseldorf 2011 &#124; News - Melodifestivalen going Heavy Metal? |publisher=Esctoday.com |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> This rumor was refuted by lead singer Joacim Cans only a couple weeks later.

The reason for his departure stated that he was unhappy in the band and wants to focus on other projects. On his own website (and therefore with his own official statement) it was announced that Magnus was tired of the simple bassplaying he was forced to play in HammerFall, and that he was unable to bring his own material to the band. He now wants to \"be more creative in his career\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magnusrosen.net/news/view.asp?id=50 |title=De beste bron van informatie over magnusrosen.

These are \"Last Man Standing\", \"Restless Soul\", and \"The Abyss\". They also rerecorded the Glory To The Brave track \"HammerFall\". \"[[Steel Meets Steel - Ten Years of Glory]]\" was released on 12 October 2007.\n\nOn April 2, 2008 [[Stefan Elmgren]] announced his decision to leave HammerFall in order to pursue a career as a commercial pilot.  His replacement is [[Pontus Norgren]] from [[The Poodles]]. On June 27, 2008, the band released the compilation album \"[[Masterpieces (HammerFall album)|Masterpieces]]\". The album has on it a collection of every song the band has covered, plus three new cover songs previously unreleased. This was [[Stefan Elmgren]]'s last release with the band.\n\n===''No Sacrifice, No Victory'' and ''Infected'' (2009\u20132012)===\n\nHammerFall's album ''[[No Sacrifice, No Victory]]'' was released in February 2009. This album features a cover song [[My Sharona]]. The Album peaked at No.&nbsp;38 on the Billboard heatseakers charts.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=hammerfall|chart=all}} No Sacrifice, No Victory - HammerFall (2009)]</ref>\nA music video for the song \"Any Means Necessary\" was released some time before the actual release of the album.  To kick off their new album, HammerFall toured all over the world with several support bands, such as fellow Swedish band [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]]. In the summer 2010 the band played a couple of high-profile festivals throughout Europe, including [[Sonisphere Festival]], [[High Voltage Festival]], [[Metalcamp]], [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and many more. The summer tour was named \"Any Festival Necessary\".\n\nHammerFall's 8th album was released on May 18, 2011 (Sweden), May 20 (Europe), and June 7 (North America),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hammerfall.net/releases/albums/infected/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519005628/http://www.hammerfall.net/releases/albums/infected/ |archivedate=2011-05-19 }}</ref> under the name ''[[Infected (Hammerfall album)|Infected]]''. After several months of recordings in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden and Nashville, TN, the new studio album was finally finished in February. The European tour followed, under the name \"European Outbreak\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hammerfall.net/news/european-outbreak-2011/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203030327/http://www.hammerfall.net/news/european-outbreak-2011/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}</ref> ''Infected'' is also the first HammerFall album not to feature the mascot, the knight Hector, on the cover.\n\nIn 2012, Hammerfall recorded a live DVD while performing a show in Dalhalla, Sweden, that featured some former band members as well as other special guests. The DVD celebrated 15 years of the band's existence, and was titled \"Gates of Dalhalla\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/HammerFall/Gates_of_Dalhalla/352964|title=HammerFall - Gates of Dalhalla - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|author=|date=|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>\nIn 2013, HammerFall took a break and some time to spend with their families or side-works. Oscar wrote a book about HammerFall, ''Legenden om HammerFall'' (Swedish: \"The Legend of HammerFall),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hammerfall.net/news/legenden-om-hammerfall-is-coming-on-october-24/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231821/http://www.hammerfall.net/news/legenden-om-hammerfall-is-coming-on-october-24/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 }}</ref> that was released on 24 October and tells of the band's events during the past 16 years, but it still exists only in Swedish.\n\n===''(r)Evolution'', ''Built to Last'' and ''Dominion'' (2014\u2013present)===\nHammerFall once again reunited with producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m. The vocals were recorded by James Michael. For the mix, Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m spent 3 weeks in his own Studio.\n\n[[(r)Evolution]] was released on August 29, 2014, and stormed the charts worldwide, debuting on #1 in Sweden and on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart, as well as reaching Top 5 in several other countries. The subsequent tour, dubbed the World Wide (r)Evolution 2014-15, will see HammerFall return to Latin America together with Edguy and Gotthard, followed by a full European assasult in the beginning of 2015. The band was somewhat distraught when drummer Anders Johansson left shortly after the release of (r)Evolution, but David Wallin (Pain) was brought in as a temporary replacement to ensure that the show would go on. Around the same time, it was also decided that Fredrik would be on parental leave from September 2014 through March 2015. Former guitar player Stefan Elmgren stepped in and will handle the 4-string duties during that period, making this line-up a unique experience.
