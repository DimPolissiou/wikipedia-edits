The film stars [[Peter O'Toole]] in the title role with [[Alec Guinness]] playing [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. The screenplay was written by [[Robert Bolt]] and [[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]].\n\nThe film, a British and American co-production,<ref name=\"britannica.com\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lawrence-of-Arabia-film-by-Lean \"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327091459/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lawrence-of-Arabia-film-by-Lean |date=27 March 2019 }}, ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]''.</ref><ref name=\"bfi.org.uk\">[https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aea50ea \"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180920123034/https://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6aea50ea |date=20 September 2018 }}, ''[[British Film Institute]]''.</ref><ref name=\"dfi.dk\">[https://www.dfi.dk/en/viden-om-film/filmdatabasen/film/lawrence-arabia \"Lawrence of Arabia (1962)\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326202246/https://www.dfi.dk/en/viden-om-film/filmdatabasen/film/lawrence-arabia |date=26 March 2019 }}, ''[[Danish Film Institute]]''.</ref> depicts Lawrence's experiences in the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s provinces of [[Hejaz Vilayet|Hejaz]] and [[Syria (region)|Greater Syria]] during [[World War I]], in particular his attacks on [[Aqaba]] and [[Damascus]] and his involvement in the [[Arab National Council]]. Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his own identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army, and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes. The film also stars [[Jack Hawkins]], [[Anthony Quinn]], [[Omar Sharif]], [[Anthony Quayle]], [[Claude Rains]] and [[Arthur Kennedy]].\n\n''Lawrence of Arabia'' was nominated for ten [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] at the [[35th Academy Awards]] in 1963; it won seven, including Best Picture and Best Director. It also won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]] and the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] for Best Film and Outstanding British Film. In the years since, it has been recognised as one of the greatest and most influential films in the history of cinema. The dramatic score by [[Maurice Jarre]] and the [[Super Panavision 70]] cinematography by [[Freddie Young]] are also highly acclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emovieposter.com/gallery/inc/archive_image.php?id=5108958 |title=eMoviePoster.com Image For: 2g105 Lawrence of Arabia pre-Awards British quad '62 David Lean classic, Peter O'Toole, best art! |work=emovieposter.com |accessdate=8 March 2016|url-access=registration|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304064726/http://www.emovieposter.com/gallery/inc/archive_image.php?id=5108958|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1991, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected for preservation in the US Library of Congress [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Andrews |first=Robert M. |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-26/entertainment/ca-4030_1_national-film-registry |title=Cinema: 'Lawrence of Arabia' is among those selected for preservation by Library of Congress |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=26 September 1991 |accessdate=4 September 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915010517/http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-26/entertainment/ca-4030_1_national-film-registry | archive-date=15 September 2015 | url-status=live}}</ref> In 1998, the [[American Film Institute]] placed it 5th on their [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies]] list of the greatest American films, and it ranked 7th on their 2007 updated list. In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named the film the [[BFI Top 100 British films|third-greatest British film of all time]]. In 2004, it was voted the [[List of films considered the best|best British film of all time]] in a ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' poll of Britain's leading filmmakers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is presented in two parts, divided by an [[Intermission#Films|intermission]].\n\n=== Part I ===\nThe film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a [[motorcycle accident]]. At his memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him.\n\nThe story then moves back to the [[World War I|First World War]], where Lawrence is a misfit [[British Army]] [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]], notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]], [[Mr. Dryden]] of the [[Arab Bureau]] sends him to assess the prospects of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]] in [[Arab Revolt|his revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. On the journey, his [[Bedouin people|Bedouin]] guide, Tafas, is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.\n\nBrighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring [[Battle of Aqaba|surprise attack on Aqaba]]; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical<!-- This is not an error; sceptical is the correct British spelling --> Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the [[Nefud Desert]], considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim\u2014and Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.\n\nLawrence persuades [[Auda abu Tayi]], the leader of the powerful local [[Howeitat]] tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a [[blood feud]]. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the very man he risked his own life to save in the desert, but he shoots him anyway.\n\nThe next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish [[garrison]]. Lawrence heads to [[Cairo]] to inform Dryden and the new commander, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]], of his victory. While crossing the [[Sinai Desert]], Daud dies when he stumbles into [[Dry quicksand|quicksand]]. Lawrence is promoted to [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and given arms and money for the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement|British have designs on Arabia]]. When pressed, the general states that they do not.\n\n=== Part II ===\nLawrence launches a [[guerrilla war]], blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. [[United States|American]] [[war correspondent]] Jackson Bentley publicises Lawrence's exploits, making him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence shoots him dead before fleeing.\n\nWhen Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of [[Daraa|Deraa]] with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish [[Bey]]. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. Then, for striking out at the Bey, he is severely [[Flogging|flogged]] before being thrown into the street. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.\n\nA short time later in [[Jerusalem]], General Allenby urges him to support the \"big push\" on [[Damascus]]. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.\n\nLawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just [[Tafas massacre|massacred the residents of Tafas]]. One of Lawrence's men is from [[Tafas]]; he demands, \"No prisoners!\" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates. Afterwards, he regrets his actions.\n\nLawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the desert tribesmen prove ill-suited for such a task. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly. Unable to maintain the [[Public utility|public utilities]], the Arabs soon abandon most of the city to the British.\n\nLawrence is promoted to [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[T. E. Lawrence]]. [[Albert Finney]] was a virtual unknown at the time, but he was Lean's first choice to play Lawrence. Finney was cast and began principal photography but was fired after two days for reasons that are still unclear.  [[Marlon Brando]] was also offered the part, and [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] were briefly considered before O'Toole was cast.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=41\u201345}}</ref> [[Alec Guinness]] had previously played Lawrence in the play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' and was briefly considered for the part, but David Lean and Sam Spiegel thought him too old. Lean had seen O'Toole in ''[[The Day They Robbed the Bank of England]]'' and was bowled over by his screen test, proclaiming \"This ''is'' Lawrence!\" Spiegel disliked Montgomery Clift, having worked with him on ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]].'' Spiegel eventually acceded to Lean's choice, though he disliked O'Toole after seeing him in an unsuccessful screen test for ''Suddenly, Last Summer.''<ref>{{Cite book |title=David Lean: Interviews |last=Lean |first=David |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-60473-234-4 |location= |page=125}}</ref> Pictures of Lawrence suggest also that O'Toole bore some resemblance to him,<ref name=\"Woolf\">{{cite website |last=Woolf |first=Christopher |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction |title=Is Peter O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia fact or fiction? |website=[[Public Radio International|PRI]] |date=16 December 2013 | access-date=10 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155438/https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction | archive-date=11 February 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> in spite of their considerable height difference. O'Toole's looks prompted a different reaction from [[No\u00ebl Coward]], who quipped after seeing the premi\u00e8re of the film, \"If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=Anthony |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane |title=Master and Commander |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=31 March 2008 | access-date=26 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606142628/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane | archive-date=6 June 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. Faisal was originally to be portrayed by [[Laurence Olivier]]. Guinness performed in other David Lean films, and he got the part when Olivier dropped out. Guinness was made up to look as much like the real Faisal as possible; he recorded in his diaries that, while shooting in Jordan, he met several people who had known Faisal who actually mistook him for the late prince. Guinness said in interviews that he developed his Arab accent from a conversation that he had with Omar Sharif.\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Auda ibu Tayi|Auda abu Tayi]]. Quinn got very much into his role; he spent hours applying his own makeup, using a photograph of the real Auda to make himself look as much like him as he could. One anecdote has Quinn arriving on-set for the first time in full costume, whereupon Lean mistook him for a native and asked his assistant to ring Quinn and notify him that they were replacing him with the new arrival.\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]. Sam Spiegel pushed Lean to cast [[Cary Grant]] or [[Laurence Olivier]] (who was engaged at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] and declined). Lean convinced him to choose Hawkins because of his work for them on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''. Hawkins shaved his head for the role and reportedly clashed with Lean several times during filming.  Guinness recounted that Hawkins was reprimanded by Lean for celebrating the end of a day's filming with an impromptu dance. Hawkins became close friends with O'Toole during filming, and the two often improvised dialogue during takes to Lean's dismay.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sherif Ali. The role was offered to many actors before Sharif was cast. [[Horst Buchholz]] was the first choice, but had already signed on for the film ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. [[Alain Delon]] had a successful screen test but ultimately declined because of the brown contact lenses he would have had to wear. [[Maurice Ronet]] and [[Dilip Kumar]] were also considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=45\u201349}}</ref> Sharif, who was already a major star in the Middle East, was originally cast as Lawrence's guide Tafas, but when the aforementioned actors proved unsuitable, Sharif was shifted to the part of Ali.\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as the Turkish Bey. Ferrer was initially unsatisfied with the small size of his part and accepted the role only on the condition of being paid $25,000 (more than O'Toole and Sharif combined) plus a [[Porsche]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=49}}</ref> However, he afterwards considered this his best film performance, saying in an interview: \"If I was to be judged by any one film performance, it would be my five minutes in ''Lawrence''.\" Peter O'Toole once said that he learned more about screen acting from Ferrer than he could in any acting class.\nTinyTinkle - Gay lover of Lawrence (no gag reflex)\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as Colonel [[Harry Brighton]]. Quayle, a veteran of military roles, was cast after Jack Hawkins, the original choice, was shifted to the part of Allenby. Quayle and Lean argued over how to portray the character, with Lean feeling Brighton to be an honourable character, while Quayle thought him an idiot.\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Mr. Dryden]]\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as [[Jackson Bentley]]. In the early days of the production, when the Bentley character had a more prominent role in the film, [[Kirk Douglas]] was considered for the part; Douglas expressed interest but demanded a star salary and the highest billing after O'Toole and thus was turned down by Spiegel. Later, [[Edmond O'Brien]] was cast in the part.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=51}}</ref> O'Brien filmed the Jerusalem scene, and (according to Omar Sharif) Bentley's political discussion with Ali, but he suffered a heart attack on location and had to be replaced at the last moment by Kennedy, who was recommended to Lean by Anthony Quinn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=137\u201338}}</ref>\n* [[Donald Wolfit]] as [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* [[I. S. Johar]] as Gasim. Johar was a well-known [[India]]n actor who occasionally appeared in international productions.\n* [[Gamil Ratib]] as Majid. Ratib was a veteran Egyptian actor. His English was not considered good enough, so he was dubbed by [[Robert Rietti]] (uncredited){{citation needed|date=November 2018}} in the final film.\n* [[Michel de Carvalho|Michel Ray]] as Farraj. At the time, Ray was an up-and-coming Anglo-Brazilian actor who had previously appeared in several films, including [[Irving Rapper]]'s ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' and [[Anthony Mann]]'s ''[[The Tin Star]]''.\n* John Dimech as Daud\n* [[Zia Mohyeddin]] as Tafas. Mohyeddin was one of Pakistan's best-known actors.\n* [[Howard Marion-Crawford]] as the medical officer. He was cast at the last possible minute during the filming of the Damascus scenes in Seville.\n* [[Jack Gwillim]] as the club secretary. Gwillim was recommended to Lean for the film by close friend Quayle.\n* [[Hugh Miller (actor)|Hugh Miller]] as the [[RAMC]] colonel.

E. Lawrence]]\n* [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]\n* [[Auda Abu Tayi]]\n* [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]\n* [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* Farraj and Daud, Lawrence's servants\n* Gasim, the man whom Lawrence rescues from the desert\n* Talal, who charges the Turkish column at Tafas\n\n; Fictional characters\n* Sherif Ali: A combination of numerous Arab leaders, particularly Sharif Nassir\u2014Faisal's cousin\u2014who led the Harith forces involved in the attack on [[Aqaba]]. The character was created largely because Lawrence did not serve with any one Arab leader (aside from Auda) throughout the majority of the war; most such leaders were amalgamated in Ali's character.\n* Mr Dryden: The cynical [[Arab Bureau]] official was based loosely on numerous figures, including [[Ronald Storrs|Sir Ronald Storrs]], who was head of the Arab Bureau and later the governor of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. It was largely Storrs' doing that Lawrence first met Faisal and became involved with the Revolt. This character is also partially based upon Lawrence's archaeologist friend [[D. G. Hogarth]], as well as [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]], who historically fulfilled Dryden's role as a political liaison. He was created by the screenwriters to \"represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives.\"\n* Colonel Brighton: In essence a composite of all of the British officers who served in the Middle East with Lawrence, most notably Lt. Col. [[S.F. Newcombe]]. Newcombe played much the same role as Brighton does in the film, being Lawrence's predecessor as liaison to the Arab Revolt; he and many of his men were captured by the Turks in 1916, but he later escaped. Also, like Brighton, Newcombe was not well liked by the Arabs, though he remained friends with Lawrence. (In Michael Wilson's original script, he ''was'' Colonel Newcombe; the character's name was changed by Robert Bolt.) Brighton was apparently created to represent how ordinary British soldiers would feel about a man like Lawrence: impressed by his accomplishments but repulsed by his affected manner. (Lean argued that Brighton was \"the only honourable character\" in the film, whereas [[Anthony Quayle]] referred to his character as an \"idiot\".)\n* Turkish Bey: The Turkish Bey who captures Lawrence in [[Deraa]] was\u2014according to Lawrence himself\u2014General Hajim Bey (in Turkish, ''Hacim Muhiddin Bey''), though he is not named in the film. The incident was mentioned in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Some biographers ([[Jeremy Wilson]], [[John E. Mack|John Mack]]) argue that Lawrence's account is to be believed; others ([[Michael Asher (explorer)|Michael Asher]], [[Lawrence James]]) argue that contemporary evidence suggests that Lawrence never went to Deraa at this time and that the story is invented.\n* Jackson Bentley: Based on famed American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], who helped make Lawrence famous with accounts of his bravery. However, Thomas was a young man at the time who spent only a few days (or weeks at most) with Lawrence in the field\u2014unlike Bentley, who is depicted as a cynical middle-aged Chicago newspaperman who is present during the whole of Lawrence's later campaigns. Bentley was the narrator in Wilson's original script, but Bolt reduced his role significantly for the final script. Thomas did not start reporting on Lawrence until after the end of World War I, and held Lawrence in high regard, unlike Bentley, who seems to view Lawrence in terms of a story that he can write about.\n* Tafas: Lawrence's guide to Faisal is based on his actual guide Sheikh Obeid el-Rashid of the Hazimi branch of the Beni Salem, whom Lawrence referred to as Tafas several times in ''Seven Pillars''.\n* Medical officer: This unnamed officer who confronts Lawrence in Damascus is based on an officer mentioned in an incident in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Lawrence's meeting the officer again while in British uniform was an invention of Wilson or Bolt.\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\nMost of the film's characters are based on actual people to varying degrees. Some scenes were heavily fictionalised, such as the [[Battle of Aqaba|attack on Aqaba]], while those dealing with the Arab Council were inaccurate, inasmuch as the council remained more or less in power in [[Syria]] until France deposed Faisal in 1920. Little background is provided on the history of the region, the First World War, and the Arab Revolt, probably because of Bolt's increased focus on Lawrence (while Wilson's draft script had a broader, more politicised version of events). The second half of the film portrayed a completely fictional depiction of Lawrence's Arab army deserting almost to a man as he moved farther north. The film's timeline is frequently questionable on the [[Arab Revolt]] and [[World War I]], as well as the geography of the [[Hejaz]] region. For instance, Bentley interviews Faisal in late 1917, after the fall of Aqaba, saying that the United States has not yet entered the war, yet the US had been in the war for several months by that time. Further, Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt prior to the attack on Aqaba is completely excised, such as his involvement in the seizures of [[Yenbo]] and [[Wejh]]. The rescue and execution of Gasim are based on two separate incidents, which were conflated for dramatic reasons.\n\nThe film shows Lawrence representing the Allied cause in the Hejaz almost alone, with Colonel Brighton ([[Anthony Quayle]]) the only British officer there to assist him. In fact, there were numerous British officers such as colonels Cyril Wilson, Stewart Francis Newcombe, and Pierce C. Joyce, all of whom arrived before Lawrence began serving in Arabia.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 17</ref> In addition, there was a French military mission led by Colonel Edouard Br\u00e9mond serving in the Hejaz, of which no mention is made in the film.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 18</ref> The film shows Lawrence as the sole originator of the attacks on the Hejaz railroad. The first attacks on this began in early January 1917 led by officers such as Newcombe.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 39</ref> The first successful attack on the Hejaz railroad with a locomotive-destroying \"Garland mine\" was led by Major [[Herbert Garland]] in February 1917, a month before Lawrence's first attack.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\nThe film shows the [[Hashemite]] forces as consisting of Bedouin guerrillas, whereas the core of the Hashemite forces was the regular Arab Army recruited from Ottoman Arab prisoners of war, who wore British-style uniforms with [[keffiyeh]]s and fought in conventional battles.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 24</ref> The film makes no mention of the [[Sharifian Army]], and leaves the viewer with the impression that the Hashemite forces were composed exclusively of Bedouin irregulars.\n\n=== Representation of Lawrence ===\n[[File:Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia.png|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Peter O'Toole]] as T. E. Lawrence]]\nMany complaints about the film's accuracy concern the characterisation of Lawrence. The perceived problems with the portrayal begin with the differences in his physical appearance; the {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|adj=on}} [[Peter O'Toole]] was almost {{convert|9|in|cm}} taller than the {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|adj=on}} Lawrence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orlans |first=Harold |title=T. E. Lawrence: Biography of a Broken Hero |publisher=McFarland |page=111 |date=2002 |isbn=0-7864-1307-7}}</ref> His behaviour, however, has caused much more debate.\n\nThe screenwriters depict Lawrence as an egotist. It is not clear to what degree Lawrence sought or shunned attention, as evident in his use of various assumed names after the war. Even during the war, [[Lowell Thomas]] wrote in ''With Lawrence in Arabia'' that he could take pictures of him only by tricking him, although Lawrence did later agree to pose for several photos for Thomas's stage show. Thomas's famous comment that Lawrence \"had a genius for backing into the limelight\" can be taken to suggest that his extraordinary actions prevented him from being as private as he would have liked, or it can be taken to suggest that Lawrence made a pretence of avoiding the limelight while subtly placing himself at centre stage. Others point to Lawrence's own writings to support the argument that he was egotistical.\n\nLawrence's sexual orientation remains a controversial topic among historians. Bolt's primary source was ostensibly ''Seven Pillars'', but the film's portrayal seems informed by [[Richard Aldington]]'s ''Biographical Inquiry'' (1955) which posited Lawrence as a \"pathological liar and exhibitionist\", as well as a homosexual. This is opposed to his portrayal in ''Ross'' as \"physically and spiritually recluse\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Weintraub |first=Stanley |year=1964 |title=Lawrence of Arabia |jstor=1210914 |journal=Film Quarterly |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=51\u201354 |doi=10.2307/1210914}}</ref> Historians such as [[Basil Liddell Hart]] disputed the film's depiction of Lawrence as an active participant in the attack and slaughter of the retreating Turkish columns who had committed the [[Tafas massacre]], but most current biographers accept the film's portrayal as reasonably accurate.\n\nThe film does show that Lawrence could speak and read Arabic, could quote the [[Quran]], and was reasonably knowledgeable about the region. It barely mentions his archaeological travels from 1911 to 1914 in Syria and Arabia and ignores his espionage work, including a pre-war topographical survey of the Sinai Peninsula and his attempts to negotiate the release of British prisoners at [[Siege of Kut|Kut]] in [[Mesopotamia]] in 1916. Furthermore, Lawrence is made aware of the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] very late in the story and is shown to be appalled by it, whereas he actually knew about it much earlier while fighting alongside the Arabs.<ref>cf. Jeremy Wilson, ''Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence'' (1990), pp. 409\u201310</ref>\n\nLawrence's biographers have a mixed reaction towards the film. Authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson noted that the film has \"undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of some subsequent biographers\", such as the depiction of the film's Ali being real rather than a composite character, and also highlighting the Deraa incident.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.telstudies.org/discussion/film_tv_radio/lofa_or_sid_1.shtml |title=Lawrence of Arabia or Smith in the Desert? |publisher=T.

At the time, Liddell Hart publicly criticised the film, engaging Bolt in a lengthy correspondence over its portrayal of Lawrence.<ref>L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin. ''Lawrence of Arabia: The 30th Anniversary Pictorial History.'' pp. 149\u201356</ref>\n\n=== Representation of other characters ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe film portrays General Allenby as cynical and manipulative, with a superior attitude to Lawrence, but there is much evidence that Allenby and Lawrence liked and respected one another. Lawrence once said that Allenby was \"an admiration of mine\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |title=''The Seven Pillars'' Portraits |publisher=castlehillpress.com |access-date=21 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313204945/http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |archive-date=13 March 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> and later that he was \"physically large and confident and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |title=General Allenby (biography) |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125103413/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |archive-date=25 November 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The fictional Allenby's words at Lawrence's funeral in the film stand in contrast to the real Allenby's remarks upon Lawrence's death: \"I have lost a good friend and a valued comrade. Lawrence was under my command, but, after acquainting him with my strategical plan, I gave him a free hand. His co-operation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |title=General Allenby (radio interview) |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314231750/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |archive-date=14 March 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Allenby also spoke highly of him numerous times and, much to Lawrence's delight, publicly endorsed the accuracy of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Allenby did manipulate Lawrence during the war, but their relationship lasted for years after its end, indicating that in real life they were friendly, if not close. The Allenby family was particularly upset by the Damascus scenes, where Allenby coldly allows the town to fall into chaos as the Arab Council collapses.<ref>Steven C. Caton, ''Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology'', p. 59</ref>\n\nSimilarly, General Murray was initially sceptical of the Arab Revolt's potential, but he thought highly of Lawrence's abilities as an intelligence officer; indeed, it was largely through Lawrence's persuasion that Murray came to support the revolt. The intense dislike shown toward Lawrence in the film is in fact the opposite of Murray's real feelings, although for his part Lawrence seemed not to hold Murray in any high regard.\n\nThe depiction of Auda abu Tayi as a man interested only in loot and money is also at odds with the historical record. Auda did at first join the revolt for monetary reasons, but he quickly became a steadfast supporter of Arab independence, notably after Aqaba's capture. He refused repeated bribery attempts by the Turks (though he happily pocketed their money) and remained loyal to the revolt, going so far as to knock out his false teeth, which were Turkish made. He was present with Lawrence from the beginning of the Aqaba expedition and in fact helped plan it along with Lawrence and Prince Faisal.\n\nFaisal was far from being the middle-aged man depicted and was in his early 30s at the time of the revolt. Faisal and Lawrence respected each other's capabilities and intelligence. They worked well together.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |title=Prince Feisal |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919145955/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |archive-date=19 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe reactions of those who knew Lawrence and the other characters say much about the film's veracity.  The most vehement critic of its accuracy was Professor [[A. W. Lawrence|A. W. (Arnold) Lawrence]], the protagonist's younger brother and literary executor, who had sold the rights to ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' to Spiegel for \u00a325,000. Arnold Lawrence went on a campaign in the United States and Britain denouncing the film, famously saying, \"I should not have recognised my own brother\". In one pointed talk show appearance, he remarked that he had found the film \"pretentious and false\". He went on to say that his brother was \"one of the nicest, kindest and most exhilarating people I've known. He often appeared cheerful when he was unhappy.\" Later, Arnold said to the ''[[New York Times]]'', \"[The film is] a psychological recipe. Take an ounce of narcissism, a pound of exhibitionism, a pint of sadism, a gallon of blood-lust and a sprinkle of other aberrations and stir well.\" Lowell Thomas was also critical of the portrayal of Lawrence and most of the film's characters, believing that the train attack scenes were the only reasonably accurate aspect of the film.\n\nThe criticisms were not restricted to Lawrence. The Allenby family lodged a formal complaint against Columbia about the portrayal of him. Descendants of Auda abu Tayi and the real Sherif Ali, Sharif Nassir, went further, suing Columbia despite the fact that the film's Ali was a fictional composite character. The Auda case went on for almost 10 years before it was dropped.<ref>Adrian Turner, ''Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives'', 201\u201306</ref>\n\nThe film has its defenders. Biographer [[Michael Korda]], author of ''Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia'', offers a different opinion. The film is neither \"the full story of Lawrence's life or a completely accurate account of the two years he spent fighting with the Arabs,\" yet Korda argues that criticising its inaccuracy \"misses the point\": \"The object was to produce, not a faithful docudrama that would educate the audience, but a hit picture.\"<ref>Korda, pp. 693\u201394</ref> Stephen E. Tabachnick goes further than Korda, arguing that the film's portrayal of Lawrence is \"appropriate and true to the text of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''\".<ref>''Lawrence of Arabia: An Encyclopedia.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, Press, 2004. p. 24</ref> British historian of the Arab Revolt David Murphy wrote that although the film was flawed due to various inaccuracies and omissions, \"it was a truly epic movie and is rightly seen as a classic\".<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt'', Osprey: London, 2008 pp. 88\u201389</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nPrevious films about T. E. Lawrence had been planned but had not been made. In the 1940s, [[Alexander Korda]] was interested in filming ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' with [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], or [[Robert Donat]] as Lawrence, but had to pull out owing to financial difficulties. David Lean had been approached to direct a 1952 version for the [[Rank Organisation]], but the project fell through.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life & Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=258 |quote= |via=}}</ref> At the same time as pre-production of the film, [[Terence Rattigan]] was developing his play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' which centred primarily on Lawrence's alleged [[homosexuality]]. ''Ross'' had begun as a screenplay, but was re-written for the stage when the film project fell through. Sam Spiegel grew furious and attempted to have the play suppressed, which helped to gain publicity for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=410\u201311}}</ref> [[Dirk Bogarde]] had accepted the role in ''Ross''; he described the cancellation of the project as \"my bitterest disappointment\". Alec Guinness played the role on stage.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Peter O'Toole: The Definitive Biography |last=Sellers |first=Robert |publisher=Pan Macmillan |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-283-07216-1 |location=London |pages= |quote=my bitterest disappointment}}</ref>\n\nLean and Sam Spiegel had worked together on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and decided to collaborate again. For a time, Lean was interested in a biopic of [[Gandhi]], with Alec Guinness to play the title role and [[Emeric Pressburger]] writing the screenplay. He eventually lost interest in the project, despite extensive pre-production work, including location scouting in India and a meeting with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=393\u2013401}}</ref> Lean then returned his attention to T. E. Lawrence. [[Columbia Pictures]] had an interest in a Lawrence project dating back to the early '50s, and the project got underway when Spiegel convinced a reluctant [[A. W. Lawrence]] to sell the rights to ''[[The Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'' for \u00a322,500.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=271 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] wrote the original draft of the screenplay. Lean was dissatisfied with Wilson's work, primarily because his treatment focused on the historical and political aspects of the Arab Revolt. Lean hired [[Robert Bolt]] to re-write the script to make it a character study of Lawrence. Many of the characters and scenes are Wilson's invention, but virtually all of the dialogue in the finished film was written by Bolt.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |pages=270\u201382 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nLean reportedly watched [[John Ford]]'s film ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956) to help him develop ideas as to how to shoot the film. Several scenes directly recall Ford's film, most notably Ali's entrance at the well and the composition of many of the desert scenes and the dramatic exit from [[Wadi Rum]]. Lean biographer [[Kevin Brownlow]] notes a physical similarity between Wadi Rum and Ford's [[Monument Valley]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|page=443}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe film was made by [[Horizon Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]. Principal photography began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 21 September 1962.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |pages=291, 303 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nThe desert scenes were shot in [[Jordan]] and [[Morocco]], as well as [[Almer\u00eda (province)|Almer\u00eda]] and [[Do\u00f1ana National Park|Do\u00f1ana]] in Spain. It was originally to be filmed entirely in Jordan; the government of [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] was extremely helpful in providing logistical assistance, location scouting, transportation, and extras. Hussein himself visited the set several times during production and maintained cordial relationships with cast and crew. The only tension occurred when Jordanian officials learned that English actor [[Henry Oscar]] did not speak Arabic but would be filmed reciting the [[Qur'an]]. Permission was granted only on condition that an imam be present to ensure that there were no misquotations.\n\n[[File:Pabellon Mudejar.JPG|thumb|The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] pavilion of the [[Parque de Mar\u00eda Luisa]] in Seville appeared as Damascus.]]\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Seville BW 2015-10-23 15-35-15.jpg|thumb|The [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Seville]] appeared as Britain's Egyptian Expeditionary Force Headquarters in Cairo, which included the officers' club.]]\nLean planned to film in Aqaba and the archaeological site at [[Petra]], which Lawrence had been fond of as a place of study. However, the production had to be moved to Spain due to cost and outbreaks of illness among the cast and crew before these scenes could be shot. The attack on Aqaba was reconstructed in a dried river bed in Playa del Algarrobico, southern Spain (at {{nowrap|{{coord|37|1|25|N|1|52|53|W|region:ES_type:landmark|display=inline}}}}); it consisted of more than 300 buildings and was meticulously based on the town's appearance in 1917. The execution of Gasim, the train attacks, and Deraa exteriors were filmed in the [[Almer\u00eda]] region, with some of the filming being delayed because of a flash flood. The [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains filled in for Azrak, Lawrence's winter quarters. The city of [[Seville]] was used to represent [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Damascus]], with the appearance of [[Casa de Pilatos]], the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], and the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (Seville)|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]. All of the interiors were shot in Spain, including Lawrence's first meeting with Faisal and the scene in Auda's tent. The Tafas massacre was filmed in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, with Moroccan army troops substituting for the Turkish army; however, Lean could not film as much as he wanted because the soldiers were uncooperative and impatient.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=466\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe film's production was frequently delayed because shooting commenced without a finished script. Wilson quit early in the production, and playwright [[Beverley Cross]] worked on the script in the interim before Bolt took over, although none of Cross's material made it to the final film. A further mishap occurred when Bolt was arrested for taking part in an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration, and Spiegel had to persuade him to sign a recognizance of good behaviour to be released from jail and continue working on the script.\n\nO'Toole was not used to riding camels and found the saddle to be uncomfortable. During a break in filming, he bought a piece of foam rubber at a market and added it to his saddle. Many of the extras copied the idea and sheets of the foam can be seen on many of the horse and camel saddles. The Bedouin nicknamed O'Toole {{\"'}}Ab al-'Isfanjah\" ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629}}), meaning \"Father of the Sponge\".<ref>[[Peter O'Toole]], interview on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 11 May 1995.</ref> During the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel, but it fortunately stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him. Coincidentally, a very similar mishap befell the real Lawrence at the [[Battle of Aqaba|Battle of Abu El Lissal]] in 1917.\n\nJordan banned the film for what was felt to be a disrespectful portrayal of Arab culture.<ref name=\"Woolf\" /> Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success through the endorsement of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], who appreciated the film's depiction of [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalism]].\n\n[[Super Panavision 70|Super Panavision]] technology was used to shoot the film, meaning that spherical lenses were used instead of anamorphic ones, and the image was exposed on a 65&nbsp;mm negative, then printed onto a 70&nbsp;mm positive to leave room for the soundtracks. Rapid cutting was more disturbing on the wide screen, so filmmakers had to apply longer and more fluid takes. Shooting such a wide ratio produced some unwanted effects during projection, such as a peculiar \"flutter\" effect, a blurring of certain parts of the image. To avoid the problem, the director often had to modify blocking, giving the actor a more diagonal movement, where the flutter was less likely to occur.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology |last=Caton |first=Steven Charles |publisher=University of California Press |year=1950 |isbn=0-520-21082-4 |location=Los Angeles |pages=70, 71 |quote= |via=}}</ref> David Lean was asked whether he could handle [[CinemaScope]]: \"If one had an eye for composition, there would be no problem.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Epic Films of David Lean |last=Santas |first=Constantine |publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc. |year=2012 |isbn= |location=Plymouth UK |page=xxvi |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nO'Toole did not share Lawrence's love of the desert and stated in an interview: \"I loathe it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM |title=Peter O'Toole talks about 'Lawrence of Arabia' in rare 1963 interview |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=4 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724211714/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Maurice Jarre]], little known at the time and selected only after both [[William Walton]] and [[Malcolm Arnold]] had proved unavailable.

A remastered edition appeared on [[Castle Music]], a division of the [[Sanctuary Records]] Group, on 28 August 2006.\n\n[[Kenneth J. Alford|Kenneth Alford]]'s march ''[[The Voice of the Guns]]'' (1917) is prominently featured on the soundtrack. One of Alford's other pieces, the ''[[Colonel Bogey March]]'', was the musical theme for Lean's previous film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''.\n\nA complete recording of the score was not heard until 2010 when Tadlow Music produced a CD of the music, with Nic Raine conducting the [[City of Prague Philharmonic]] from scores reconstructed by [[Leigh Phillips]].\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nThe film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on 10 December 1962 (Royal Premiere) and was released in the United States on 16 December 1962.\n\nThe original release ran for about 222&nbsp;minutes (plus overture, intermission, and exit music). A post-premiere memo (13 December 1962) noted that the film was 24,987.5&nbsp;ft (70&nbsp;mm) and 19,990&nbsp;ft (35&nbsp;mm). With 90&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film projected every minute, this corresponds to exactly 222.11 minutes. Richard May, VP Film Preservation at Warner Bros., sent an email to Robert Morris, co-author of a book on ''Lawrence of Arabia'', in which he noted that ''Gone With the Wind'' was never edited after its premiere and is 19,884&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film (without leaders, overture, intermission, entr'acte, or walkout music), corresponding to 220.93 min. Thus, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' is slightly more than 1 minute longer than ''Gone With the Wind'' and is, therefore, the longest movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nIn January 1963, ''Lawrence'' was released in a version edited by 20 minutes; when it was re-released in 1971, an even shorter cut of 187&nbsp;minutes was presented. The first round of cuts was made at the direction and even insistence of David Lean, to assuage criticisms of the film's length and increase the number of showings per day; however, during the 1989 restoration, he passed blame for the cuts onto deceased producer Sam Spiegel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=484, 705, 709}}</ref> In addition, a 1966 print was used for initial television and video releases which accidentally altered a few scenes by reversing the image.<ref>Caton, S.C.

Harris]] and Jim Painten under the supervision of director David Lean. It was released in 1989 with a 216-minute length (plus overture, intermission, and exit music).\n\nMost of the cut scenes were dialogue sequences, particularly those involving General Allenby and his staff. Two whole scenes were completely excised\u2014Brighton's briefing of Allenby in Jerusalem before the Deraa scene and the British staff meeting in the field tent\u2014and the Allenby-briefing scene has still not been entirely restored. Much of the missing dialogue involves Lawrence's writing of poetry and verse, alluded to by Allenby in particular, saying \"the last poetry general we had was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]\". The opening of Act II existed in only fragmented form, where Faisal is interviewed by Bentley, as well as the later scene in Jerusalem where Allenby convinces Lawrence not to resign. Both scenes were restored to the 1989 re-release. Some of the more graphic shots of the Tafas massacre scene were also restored, such as the lengthy panning shot of the corpses in Tafas, and Lawrence shooting a surrendering Turkish soldier. Most of the still-missing footage is of minimal import, supplementing existing scenes. One scene is an extended version of the Deraa torture sequence, which makes Lawrence's punishment more overt in that scene. Other scripted scenes exist, including a conversation between Auda and Lawrence immediately after the fall of [[Aqaba]], a brief scene of Turkish officers noting the extent of Lawrence's campaign, and the battle of [[Petra]] (later reworked into the first train attack), but these scenes were probably not filmed. The actors still living at the time of the re-release dubbed their own dialogue, though [[Jack Hawkins]]'s dialogue had to be dubbed by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], who had already provided Hawkins' voice for several films after Hawkins developed throat cancer in the late 1960s.

Its themes include Lawrence's emotional struggles with the personal violence inherent in war, his own identity, and his divided allegiance between his native Britain and its army, and his new-found comrades within the Arabian desert tribes.

In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named the film the [[BFI Top 100 British films|third-greatest British film of all time]]. In 2004, it was voted the [[List of films considered the best|best British film of all time]] in a ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' poll of Britain's leading filmmakers.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is presented in two parts, divided by an [[Intermission#Films|intermission]].\n\n=== Part I ===\nThe film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a [[motorcycle accident]]. At his memorial service at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him.\n\nThe story then moves back to the [[World War I|First World War]], where Lawrence is a misfit [[British Army]] [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]], notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]], [[Mr. Dryden]] of the [[Arab Bureau]] sends him to assess the prospects of [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]] in [[Arab Revolt|his revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. On the journey, his [[Bedouin people|Bedouin]] guide, Tafas, is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.\n\nBrighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring [[Battle of Aqaba|surprise attack on Aqaba]]; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical<!-- This is not an error; sceptical is the correct British spelling --> Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the [[Nefud Desert]], considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim\u2014and Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.\n\nLawrence persuades [[Auda abu Tayi]], the leader of the powerful local [[Howeitat]] tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a [[blood feud]]. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the very man he risked his own life to save in the desert, but he shoots him anyway.\n\nThe next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish [[garrison]]. Lawrence heads to [[Cairo]] to inform Dryden and the new commander, [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]], of his victory. While crossing the [[Sinai Desert]], Daud dies when he stumbles into [[Dry quicksand|quicksand]]. Lawrence is promoted to [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and given arms and money for the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement|British have designs on Arabia]]. When pressed, the general states that they do not.\n\n=== Part II ===\nLawrence launches a [[guerrilla war]], blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. [[United States|American]] [[war correspondent]] Jackson Bentley publicises Lawrence's exploits, making him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence shoots him dead before fleeing.\n\nWhen Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of [[Daraa|Deraa]] with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish [[Bey]]. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. Then, for striking out at the Bey, he is severely [[Flogging|flogged]] before being thrown into the street. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.\n\nA short time later in [[Jerusalem]], General Allenby urges him to support the \"big push\" on [[Damascus]]. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.\n\nLawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just [[Tafas massacre|massacred the residents of Tafas]]. One of Lawrence's men is from [[Tafas]]; he demands, \"No prisoners!\" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates. Afterwards, he regrets his actions.\n\nLawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the desert tribesmen prove ill-suited for such a task. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly. Unable to maintain the [[Public utility|public utilities]], the Arabs soon abandon most of the city to the British.\n\nLawrence is promoted to [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[T. E. Lawrence]]. [[Albert Finney]] was a virtual unknown at the time, but he was Lean's first choice to play Lawrence. Finney was cast and began principal photography but was fired after two days for reasons that are still unclear.  [[Marlon Brando]] was also offered the part, and [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] were briefly considered before O'Toole was cast.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=41\u201345}}</ref> [[Alec Guinness]] had previously played Lawrence in the play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' and was briefly considered for the part, but David Lean and Sam Spiegel thought him too old. Lean had seen O'Toole in ''[[The Day They Robbed the Bank of England]]'' and was bowled over by his screen test, proclaiming \"This ''is'' Lawrence!\" Spiegel disliked Montgomery Clift, having worked with him on ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]].'' Spiegel eventually acceded to Lean's choice, though he disliked O'Toole after seeing him in an unsuccessful screen test for ''Suddenly, Last Summer.''<ref>{{Cite book |title=David Lean: Interviews |last=Lean |first=David |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-60473-234-4 |location= |page=125}}</ref> Pictures of Lawrence suggest also that O'Toole bore some resemblance to him,<ref name=\"Woolf\">{{cite website |last=Woolf |first=Christopher |url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction |title=Is Peter O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia fact or fiction? |website=[[Public Radio International|PRI]] |date=16 December 2013 | access-date=10 February 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211155438/https://www.pri.org/stories/2013-12-16/peter-otooles-lawrence-arabia-fact-or-fiction | archive-date=11 February 2017 | url-status=live}}</ref> in spite of their considerable height difference. O'Toole's looks prompted a different reaction from [[No\u00ebl Coward]], who quipped after seeing the premi\u00e8re of the film, \"If you had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia\".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lane |first=Anthony |url=https://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane |title=Master and Commander |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |date=31 March 2008 | access-date=26 February 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606142628/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/atlarge/2008/03/31/080331crat_atlarge_lane | archive-date=6 June 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Alec Guinness]] as [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]. Faisal was originally to be portrayed by [[Laurence Olivier]]. Guinness performed in other David Lean films, and he got the part when Olivier dropped out. Guinness was made up to look as much like the real Faisal as possible; he recorded in his diaries that, while shooting in Jordan, he met several people who had known Faisal who actually mistook him for the late prince. Guinness said in interviews that he developed his Arab accent from a conversation that he had with Omar Sharif.\n* [[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Auda ibu Tayi|Auda abu Tayi]]. Quinn got very much into his role; he spent hours applying his own makeup, using a photograph of the real Auda to make himself look as much like him as he could. One anecdote has Quinn arriving on-set for the first time in full costume, whereupon Lean mistook him for a native and asked his assistant to ring Quinn and notify him that they were replacing him with the new arrival.\n* [[Jack Hawkins]] as [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]. Sam Spiegel pushed Lean to cast [[Cary Grant]] or [[Laurence Olivier]] (who was engaged at the [[Chichester Festival Theatre]] and declined). Lean convinced him to choose Hawkins because of his work for them on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''. Hawkins shaved his head for the role and reportedly clashed with Lean several times during filming.  Guinness recounted that Hawkins was reprimanded by Lean for celebrating the end of a day's filming with an impromptu dance. Hawkins became close friends with O'Toole during filming, and the two often improvised dialogue during takes to Lean's dismay.\n* [[Omar Sharif]] as Sherif Ali. The role was offered to many actors before Sharif was cast. [[Horst Buchholz]] was the first choice, but had already signed on for the film ''[[One, Two, Three]]''. [[Alain Delon]] had a successful screen test but ultimately declined because of the brown contact lenses he would have had to wear. [[Maurice Ronet]] and [[Dilip Kumar]] were also considered.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=45\u201349}}</ref> Sharif, who was already a major star in the Middle East, was originally cast as Lawrence's guide Tafas, but when the aforementioned actors proved unsuitable, Sharif was shifted to the part of Ali.\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Ferrer]] as the Turkish Bey. Ferrer was initially unsatisfied with the small size of his part and accepted the role only on the condition of being paid $25,000 (more than O'Toole and Sharif combined) plus a [[Porsche]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=49}}</ref> However, he afterwards considered this his best film performance, saying in an interview: \"If I was to be judged by any one film performance, it would be my five minutes in ''Lawrence''.\" Peter O'Toole once said that he learned more about screen acting from Ferrer than he could in any acting class.\n* [[Anthony Quayle]] as Colonel [[Harry Brighton]]. Quayle, a veteran of military roles, was cast after Jack Hawkins, the original choice, was shifted to the part of Allenby. Quayle and Lean argued over how to portray the character, with Lean feeling Brighton to be an honourable character, while Quayle thought him an idiot.\n* [[Claude Rains]] as [[Mr. Dryden]]\n* [[Arthur Kennedy]] as [[Jackson Bentley]]. In the early days of the production, when the Bentley character had a more prominent role in the film, [[Kirk Douglas]] was considered for the part; Douglas expressed interest but demanded a star salary and the highest billing after O'Toole and thus was turned down by Spiegel. Later, [[Edmond O'Brien]] was cast in the part.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|p=51}}</ref> O'Brien filmed the Jerusalem scene, and (according to Omar Sharif) Bentley's political discussion with Ali, but he suffered a heart attack on location and had to be replaced at the last moment by Kennedy, who was recommended to Lean by Anthony Quinn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1994|pages=137\u201338}}</ref>\n* [[Donald Wolfit]] as [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* [[I. S. Johar]] as Gasim. Johar was a well-known [[India]]n actor who occasionally appeared in international productions.\n* [[Gamil Ratib]] as Majid. Ratib was a veteran Egyptian actor. His English was not considered good enough, so he was dubbed by [[Robert Rietti]] (uncredited){{citation needed|date=November 2018}} in the final film.\n* [[Michel de Carvalho|Michel Ray]] as Farraj. At the time, Ray was an up-and-coming Anglo-Brazilian actor who had previously appeared in several films, including [[Irving Rapper]]'s ''[[The Brave One (1956 film)|The Brave One]]'' and [[Anthony Mann]]'s ''[[The Tin Star]]''.\n* John Dimech as Daud\n* [[Zia Mohyeddin]] as Tafas. Mohyeddin was one of Pakistan's best-known actors.\n* [[Howard Marion-Crawford]] as the medical officer.

E. Lawrence]]\n* [[Faisal I of Iraq|Prince Faisal]]\n* [[Auda Abu Tayi]]\n* [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|General Allenby]]\n* [[Archibald Murray|General Murray]]\n* Farraj and Daud, Lawrence's servants\n* Gasim, the man whom Lawrence rescues from the desert\n* Talal, who charges the Turkish column at Tafas\n\n; Fictional characters\n* Sherif Ali: A combination of numerous Arab leaders, particularly Sharif Nassir\u2014Faisal's cousin\u2014who led the Harith forces involved in the attack on [[Aqaba]]. The character was created largely because Lawrence did not serve with any one Arab leader (aside from Auda) throughout the majority of the war; most such leaders were amalgamated in Ali's character.\n* Mr Dryden: The cynical [[Arab Bureau]] official was based loosely on numerous figures, including [[Ronald Storrs|Sir Ronald Storrs]], who was head of the Arab Bureau and later the governor of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. It was largely Storrs' doing that Lawrence first met Faisal and became involved with the Revolt. This character is also partially based upon Lawrence's archaeologist friend [[D. G. Hogarth]], as well as [[Henry McMahon (diplomat)|Henry McMahon]], who historically fulfilled Dryden's role as a political liaison. He was created by the screenwriters to \"represent the civilian and political wing of British interests, to balance Allenby's military objectives.\"\n* Colonel Brighton: In essence a composite of all of the British officers who served in the Middle East with Lawrence, most notably Lt. Col. [[S.F. Newcombe]]. Newcombe played much the same role as Brighton does in the film, being Lawrence's predecessor as liaison to the Arab Revolt; he and many of his men were captured by the Turks in 1916, but he later escaped. Also, like Brighton, Newcombe was not well liked by the Arabs, though he remained friends with Lawrence. (In Michael Wilson's original script, he ''was'' Colonel Newcombe; the character's name was changed by Robert Bolt.) Brighton was apparently created to represent how ordinary British soldiers would feel about a man like Lawrence: impressed by his accomplishments but repulsed by his affected manner. (Lean argued that Brighton was \"the only honourable character\" in the film, whereas [[Anthony Quayle]] referred to his character as an \"idiot\".)\n* Turkish Bey: The Turkish Bey who captures Lawrence in [[Deraa]] was\u2014according to Lawrence himself\u2014General Hajim Bey (in Turkish, ''Hacim Muhiddin Bey''), though he is not named in the film. The incident was mentioned in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Some biographers ([[Jeremy Wilson]], [[John E. Mack|John Mack]]) argue that Lawrence's account is to be believed; others ([[Michael Asher (explorer)|Michael Asher]], [[Lawrence James]]) argue that contemporary evidence suggests that Lawrence never went to Deraa at this time and that the story is invented.\n* Jackson Bentley: Based on famed American journalist [[Lowell Thomas]], who helped make Lawrence famous with accounts of his bravery. However, Thomas was a young man at the time who spent only a few days (or weeks at most) with Lawrence in the field\u2014unlike Bentley, who is depicted as a cynical middle-aged Chicago newspaperman who is present during the whole of Lawrence's later campaigns. Bentley was the narrator in Wilson's original script, but Bolt reduced his role significantly for the final script. Thomas did not start reporting on Lawrence until after the end of World War I, and held Lawrence in high regard, unlike Bentley, who seems to view Lawrence in terms of a story that he can write about.\n* Tafas: Lawrence's guide to Faisal is based on his actual guide Sheikh Obeid el-Rashid of the Hazimi branch of the Beni Salem, whom Lawrence referred to as Tafas several times in ''Seven Pillars''.\n* Medical officer: This unnamed officer who confronts Lawrence in Damascus is based on an officer mentioned in an incident in ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Lawrence's meeting the officer again while in British uniform was an invention of Wilson or Bolt.\n\n== Historical accuracy ==\nMost of the film's characters are based on actual people to varying degrees. Some scenes were heavily fictionalised, such as the [[Battle of Aqaba|attack on Aqaba]], while those dealing with the Arab Council were inaccurate, inasmuch as the council remained more or less in power in [[Syria]] until France deposed Faisal in 1920. Little background is provided on the history of the region, the First World War, and the Arab Revolt, probably because of Bolt's increased focus on Lawrence (while Wilson's draft script had a broader, more politicised version of events). The second half of the film portrayed a completely fictional depiction of Lawrence's Arab army deserting almost to a man as he moved farther north. The film's timeline is frequently questionable on the [[Arab Revolt]] and [[World War I]], as well as the geography of the [[Hejaz]] region. For instance, Bentley interviews Faisal in late 1917, after the fall of Aqaba, saying that the United States has not yet entered the war, yet the US had been in the war for several months by that time. Further, Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt prior to the attack on Aqaba is completely excised, such as his involvement in the seizures of [[Yenbo]] and [[Wejh]]. The rescue and execution of Gasim are based on two separate incidents, which were conflated for dramatic reasons.\n\nThe film shows Lawrence representing the Allied cause in the Hejaz almost alone, with Colonel Brighton ([[Anthony Quayle]]) the only British officer there to assist him. In fact, there were numerous British officers such as colonels Cyril Wilson, Stewart Francis Newcombe, and Pierce C. Joyce, all of whom arrived before Lawrence began serving in Arabia.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 17</ref> In addition, there was a French military mission led by Colonel Edouard Br\u00e9mond serving in the Hejaz, of which no mention is made in the film.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 18</ref> The film shows Lawrence as the sole originator of the attacks on the Hejaz railroad. The first attacks on this began in early January 1917 led by officers such as Newcombe.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. p. 39</ref> The first successful attack on the Hejaz railroad with a locomotive-destroying \"Garland mine\" was led by Major [[Herbert Garland]] in February 1917, a month before Lawrence's first attack.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008. pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\nThe film shows the [[Hashemite]] forces as consisting of Bedouin guerrillas, whereas the core of the Hashemite forces was the regular Arab Army recruited from Ottoman Arab prisoners of war, who wore British-style uniforms with [[keffiyeh]]s and fought in conventional battles.<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt 1916\u20131918'', London: Osprey, 2008 p. 24</ref> The film makes no mention of the [[Sharifian Army]], and leaves the viewer with the impression that the Hashemite forces were composed exclusively of Bedouin irregulars.\n\n=== Representation of Lawrence ===\n[[File:Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia.png|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Peter O'Toole]] as T. E. Lawrence]]\nMany complaints about the film's accuracy concern the characterisation of Lawrence. The perceived problems with the portrayal begin with the differences in his physical appearance; the {{convert|6|ft|2|in|m|adj=on}} [[Peter O'Toole]] was almost {{convert|9|in|cm}} taller than the {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|adj=on}} Lawrence.<ref>{{cite book |last=Orlans |first=Harold |title=T. E. Lawrence: Biography of a Broken Hero |publisher=McFarland |page=111 |date=2002 |isbn=0-7864-1307-7}}</ref> His behaviour, however, has caused much more debate.\n\nThe screenwriters depict Lawrence as an egotist. It is not clear to what degree Lawrence sought or shunned attention, as evident in his use of various assumed names after the war. Even during the war, [[Lowell Thomas]] wrote in ''With Lawrence in Arabia'' that he could take pictures of him only by tricking him, although Lawrence did later agree to pose for several photos for Thomas's stage show. Thomas's famous comment that Lawrence \"had a genius for backing into the limelight\" can be taken to suggest that his extraordinary actions prevented him from being as private as he would have liked, or it can be taken to suggest that Lawrence made a pretence of avoiding the limelight while subtly placing himself at centre stage. Others point to Lawrence's own writings to support the argument that he was egotistical.\n\nLawrence's sexual orientation remains a controversial topic among historians. Bolt's primary source was ostensibly ''Seven Pillars'', but the film's portrayal seems informed by [[Richard Aldington]]'s ''Biographical Inquiry'' (1955) which posited Lawrence as a \"pathological liar and exhibitionist\", as well as a homosexual. This is opposed to his portrayal in ''Ross'' as \"physically and spiritually recluse\".<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Weintraub |first=Stanley |year=1964 |title=Lawrence of Arabia |jstor=1210914 |journal=Film Quarterly |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=51\u201354 |doi=10.2307/1210914}}</ref> Historians such as [[Basil Liddell Hart]] disputed the film's depiction of Lawrence as an active participant in the attack and slaughter of the retreating Turkish columns who had committed the [[Tafas massacre]], but most current biographers accept the film's portrayal as reasonably accurate.\n\nThe film does show that Lawrence could speak and read Arabic, could quote the [[Quran]], and was reasonably knowledgeable about the region. It barely mentions his archaeological travels from 1911 to 1914 in Syria and Arabia and ignores his espionage work, including a pre-war topographical survey of the Sinai Peninsula and his attempts to negotiate the release of British prisoners at [[Siege of Kut|Kut]] in [[Mesopotamia]] in 1916. Furthermore, Lawrence is made aware of the [[Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement]] very late in the story and is shown to be appalled by it, whereas he actually knew about it much earlier while fighting alongside the Arabs.<ref>cf. Jeremy Wilson, ''Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E. Lawrence'' (1990), pp. 409\u201310</ref>\n\nLawrence's biographers have a mixed reaction towards the film. Authorised biographer Jeremy Wilson noted that the film has \"undoubtedly influenced the perceptions of some subsequent biographers\", such as the depiction of the film's Ali being real rather than a composite character, and also highlighting the Deraa incident.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.telstudies.org/discussion/film_tv_radio/lofa_or_sid_1.shtml |title=Lawrence of Arabia or Smith in the Desert? |publisher=T.

At the time, Liddell Hart publicly criticised the film, engaging Bolt in a lengthy correspondence over its portrayal of Lawrence.<ref>L. Robert Morris and Lawrence Raskin. ''Lawrence of Arabia: The 30th Anniversary Pictorial History.'' pp. 149\u201356</ref>\n\n=== Representation of other characters ===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nThe film portrays General Allenby as cynical and manipulative, with a superior attitude to Lawrence, but there is much evidence that Allenby and Lawrence liked and respected one another. Lawrence once said that Allenby was \"an admiration of mine\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |title=''The Seven Pillars'' Portraits |publisher=castlehillpress.com |access-date=21 January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060313204945/http://www.castlehillpress.com/plates/pl01.htm |archive-date=13 March 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> and later that he was \"physically large and confident and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |title=General Allenby (biography) |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171125103413/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby.html |archive-date=25 November 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The fictional Allenby's words at Lawrence's funeral in the film stand in contrast to the real Allenby's remarks upon Lawrence's death: \"I have lost a good friend and a valued comrade. Lawrence was under my command, but, after acquainting him with my strategical plan, I gave him a free hand. His co-operation was marked by the utmost loyalty, and I never had anything but praise for his work, which, indeed, was invaluable throughout the campaign.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |title=General Allenby (radio interview) |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314231750/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/allenby2.html |archive-date=14 March 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> Allenby also spoke highly of him numerous times and, much to Lawrence's delight, publicly endorsed the accuracy of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''. Allenby did manipulate Lawrence during the war, but their relationship lasted for years after its end, indicating that in real life they were friendly, if not close. The Allenby family was particularly upset by the Damascus scenes, where Allenby coldly allows the town to fall into chaos as the Arab Council collapses.<ref>Steven C. Caton, ''Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology'', p. 59</ref>\n\nSimilarly, General Murray was initially sceptical of the Arab Revolt's potential, but he thought highly of Lawrence's abilities as an intelligence officer; indeed, it was largely through Lawrence's persuasion that Murray came to support the revolt. The intense dislike shown toward Lawrence in the film is in fact the opposite of Murray's real feelings, although for his part Lawrence seemed not to hold Murray in any high regard.\n\nThe depiction of Auda abu Tayi as a man interested only in loot and money is also at odds with the historical record. Auda did at first join the revolt for monetary reasons, but he quickly became a steadfast supporter of Arab independence, notably after Aqaba's capture. He refused repeated bribery attempts by the Turks (though he happily pocketed their money) and remained loyal to the revolt, going so far as to knock out his false teeth, which were Turkish made. He was present with Lawrence from the beginning of the Aqaba expedition and in fact helped plan it along with Lawrence and Prince Faisal.\n\nFaisal was far from being the middle-aged man depicted and was in his early 30s at the time of the revolt. Faisal and Lawrence respected each other's capabilities and intelligence. They worked well together.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |title=Prince Feisal |publisher=pbs.org |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919145955/http://www.pbs.org/lawrenceofarabia/players/feisal.html |archive-date=19 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe reactions of those who knew Lawrence and the other characters say much about the film's veracity.  The most vehement critic of its accuracy was Professor [[A. W. Lawrence|A. W. (Arnold) Lawrence]], the protagonist's younger brother and literary executor, who had sold the rights to ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' to Spiegel for \u00a325,000. Arnold Lawrence went on a campaign in the United States and Britain denouncing the film, famously saying, \"I should not have recognised my own brother\". In one pointed talk show appearance, he remarked that he had found the film \"pretentious and false\". He went on to say that his brother was \"one of the nicest, kindest and most exhilarating people I've known. He often appeared cheerful when he was unhappy.\" Later, Arnold said to the ''[[New York Times]]'', \"[The film is] a psychological recipe. Take an ounce of narcissism, a pound of exhibitionism, a pint of sadism, a gallon of blood-lust and a sprinkle of other aberrations and stir well.\" Lowell Thomas was also critical of the portrayal of Lawrence and most of the film's characters, believing that the train attack scenes were the only reasonably accurate aspect of the film.\n\nThe criticisms were not restricted to Lawrence. The Allenby family lodged a formal complaint against Columbia about the portrayal of him. Descendants of Auda abu Tayi and the real Sherif Ali, Sharif Nassir, went further, suing Columbia despite the fact that the film's Ali was a fictional composite character. The Auda case went on for almost 10 years before it was dropped.<ref>Adrian Turner, ''Robert Bolt: Scenes From Two Lives'', 201\u201306</ref>\n\nThe film has its defenders. Biographer [[Michael Korda]], author of ''Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia'', offers a different opinion. The film is neither \"the full story of Lawrence's life or a completely accurate account of the two years he spent fighting with the Arabs,\" yet Korda argues that criticising its inaccuracy \"misses the point\": \"The object was to produce, not a faithful docudrama that would educate the audience, but a hit picture.\"<ref>Korda, pp. 693\u201394</ref> Stephen E. Tabachnick goes further than Korda, arguing that the film's portrayal of Lawrence is \"appropriate and true to the text of ''Seven Pillars of Wisdom''\".<ref>''Lawrence of Arabia: An Encyclopedia.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood, Press, 2004. p. 24</ref> British historian of the Arab Revolt David Murphy wrote that although the film was flawed due to various inaccuracies and omissions, \"it was a truly epic movie and is rightly seen as a classic\".<ref>Murphy, David ''The Arab Revolt'', Osprey: London, 2008 pp. 88\u201389</ref>\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nPrevious films about T. E. Lawrence had been planned but had not been made. In the 1940s, [[Alexander Korda]] was interested in filming ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' with [[Laurence Olivier]], [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], or [[Robert Donat]] as Lawrence, but had to pull out owing to financial difficulties. David Lean had been approached to direct a 1952 version for the [[Rank Organisation]], but the project fell through.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life & Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=258 |quote= |via=}}</ref> At the same time as pre-production of the film, [[Terence Rattigan]] was developing his play ''[[Ross (play)|Ross]]'' which centred primarily on Lawrence's alleged [[homosexuality]]. ''Ross'' had begun as a screenplay, but was re-written for the stage when the film project fell through. Sam Spiegel grew furious and attempted to have the play suppressed, which helped to gain publicity for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=410\u201311}}</ref> [[Dirk Bogarde]] had accepted the role in ''Ross''; he described the cancellation of the project as \"my bitterest disappointment\". Alec Guinness played the role on stage.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Peter O'Toole: The Definitive Biography |last=Sellers |first=Robert |publisher=Pan Macmillan |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-283-07216-1 |location=London |pages= |quote=my bitterest disappointment}}</ref>\n\nLean and Sam Spiegel had worked together on ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' and decided to collaborate again. For a time, Lean was interested in a biopic of [[Gandhi]], with Alec Guinness to play the title role and [[Emeric Pressburger]] writing the screenplay. He eventually lost interest in the project, despite extensive pre-production work, including location scouting in India and a meeting with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=393\u2013401}}</ref> Lean then returned his attention to T. E. Lawrence. [[Columbia Pictures]] had an interest in a Lawrence project dating back to the early '50s, and the project got underway when Spiegel convinced a reluctant [[A. W. Lawrence]] to sell the rights to ''[[The Seven Pillars of Wisdom]]'' for \u00a322,500.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |page=271 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Wilson (writer)|Michael Wilson]] wrote the original draft of the screenplay. Lean was dissatisfied with Wilson's work, primarily because his treatment focused on the historical and political aspects of the Arab Revolt. Lean hired [[Robert Bolt]] to re-write the script to make it a character study of Lawrence. Many of the characters and scenes are Wilson's invention, but virtually all of the dialogue in the finished film was written by Bolt.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |pages=270\u201382 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nLean reportedly watched [[John Ford]]'s film ''[[The Searchers]]'' (1956) to help him develop ideas as to how to shoot the film. Several scenes directly recall Ford's film, most notably Ali's entrance at the well and the composition of many of the desert scenes and the dramatic exit from [[Wadi Rum]]. Lean biographer [[Kevin Brownlow]] notes a physical similarity between Wadi Rum and Ford's [[Monument Valley]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|page=443}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe film was made by [[Horizon Pictures]] and [[Columbia Pictures]]. Principal photography began on 15 May 1961 and ended on 21 September 1962.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Beyond the Epic: The Life and Films of David Lean |last=Phillips |first=Gene D. |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-8131-2415-5 |location=Lexington |pages=291, 303 |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nThe desert scenes were shot in [[Jordan]] and [[Morocco]], as well as [[Almer\u00eda (province)|Almer\u00eda]] and [[Do\u00f1ana National Park|Do\u00f1ana]] in Spain. It was originally to be filmed entirely in Jordan; the government of [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] was extremely helpful in providing logistical assistance, location scouting, transportation, and extras. Hussein himself visited the set several times during production and maintained cordial relationships with cast and crew. The only tension occurred when Jordanian officials learned that English actor [[Henry Oscar]] did not speak Arabic but would be filmed reciting the [[Qur'an]]. Permission was granted only on condition that an imam be present to ensure that there were no misquotations.\n\n[[File:Pabellon Mudejar.JPG|thumb|The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] pavilion of the [[Parque de Mar\u00eda Luisa]] in Seville appeared as Damascus.]]\n[[File:Spain Andalusia Seville BW 2015-10-23 15-35-15.jpg|thumb|The [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Seville]] appeared as Britain's Egyptian Expeditionary Force Headquarters in Cairo, which included the officers' club.]]\nLean planned to film in Aqaba and the archaeological site at [[Petra]], which Lawrence had been fond of as a place of study. However, the production had to be moved to Spain due to cost and outbreaks of illness among the cast and crew before these scenes could be shot. The attack on Aqaba was reconstructed in a dried river bed in Playa del Algarrobico, southern Spain (at {{nowrap|{{coord|37|1|25|N|1|52|53|W|region:ES_type:landmark|display=inline}}}}); it consisted of more than 300 buildings and was meticulously based on the town's appearance in 1917. The execution of Gasim, the train attacks, and Deraa exteriors were filmed in the [[Almer\u00eda]] region, with some of the filming being delayed because of a flash flood. The [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains filled in for Azrak, Lawrence's winter quarters. The city of [[Seville]] was used to represent [[Cairo]], [[Jerusalem]], and [[Damascus]], with the appearance of [[Casa de Pilatos]], the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], and the [[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (Seville)|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]. All of the interiors were shot in Spain, including Lawrence's first meeting with Faisal and the scene in Auda's tent. The Tafas massacre was filmed in [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco, with Moroccan army troops substituting for the Turkish army; however, Lean could not film as much as he wanted because the soldiers were uncooperative and impatient.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=466\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe film's production was frequently delayed because shooting commenced without a finished script. Wilson quit early in the production, and playwright [[Beverley Cross]] worked on the script in the interim before Bolt took over, although none of Cross's material made it to the final film. A further mishap occurred when Bolt was arrested for taking part in an anti-nuclear weapons demonstration, and Spiegel had to persuade him to sign a recognizance of good behaviour to be released from jail and continue working on the script.\n\nO'Toole was not used to riding camels and found the saddle to be uncomfortable. During a break in filming, he bought a piece of foam rubber at a market and added it to his saddle. Many of the extras copied the idea and sheets of the foam can be seen on many of the horse and camel saddles. The Bedouin nicknamed O'Toole {{\"'}}Ab al-'Isfanjah\" ({{lang|ar|\u0623\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0641\u0646\u062c\u0629}}), meaning \"Father of the Sponge\".<ref>[[Peter O'Toole]], interview on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 11 May 1995.</ref> During the filming of the Aqaba scene, O'Toole was nearly killed when he fell from his camel, but it fortunately stood over him, preventing the horses of the extras from trampling him. Coincidentally, a very similar mishap befell the real Lawrence at the [[Battle of Aqaba|Battle of Abu El Lissal]] in 1917.\n\nJordan banned the film for what was felt to be a disrespectful portrayal of Arab culture.<ref name=\"Woolf\" /> Egypt, Omar Sharif's home country, was the only Arab nation to give the film a wide release, where it became a success through the endorsement of President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], who appreciated the film's depiction of [[Pan-Arabism|Arab nationalism]].\n\n[[Super Panavision 70|Super Panavision]] technology was used to shoot the film, meaning that spherical lenses were used instead of anamorphic ones, and the image was exposed on a 65&nbsp;mm negative, then printed onto a 70&nbsp;mm positive to leave room for the soundtracks. Rapid cutting was more disturbing on the wide screen, so filmmakers had to apply longer and more fluid takes. Shooting such a wide ratio produced some unwanted effects during projection, such as a peculiar \"flutter\" effect, a blurring of certain parts of the image. To avoid the problem, the director often had to modify blocking, giving the actor a more diagonal movement, where the flutter was less likely to occur.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Lawrence of Arabia: A Film's Anthropology |last=Caton |first=Steven Charles |publisher=University of California Press |year=1950 |isbn=0-520-21082-4 |location=Los Angeles |pages=70, 71 |quote= |via=}}</ref> David Lean was asked whether he could handle [[CinemaScope]]: \"If one had an eye for composition, there would be no problem.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Epic Films of David Lean |last=Santas |first=Constantine |publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc. |year=2012 |isbn= |location=Plymouth UK |page=xxvi |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\nO'Toole did not share Lawrence's love of the desert and stated in an interview: \"I loathe it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM |title=Peter O'Toole talks about 'Lawrence of Arabia' in rare 1963 interview |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=4 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724211714/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUyixfiE_oM|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[Maurice Jarre]], little known at the time and selected only after both [[William Walton]] and [[Malcolm Arnold]] had proved unavailable.

It was intended for Soviet composer [[Aram Khachaturian]] to create one half and British composer [[Benjamin Britten]] to write the other.<ref>BFI Film Classics \u2013 Lawrence Of Arabia Kevin Jackson pp90 2007</ref>\n\nThe original soundtrack recording was originally released on [[Colpix Records]], the records division of Columbia Pictures, in 1962. A remastered edition appeared on [[Castle Music]], a division of the [[Sanctuary Records]] Group, on 28 August 2006.\n\n[[Kenneth J. Alford|Kenneth Alford]]'s march ''[[The Voice of the Guns]]'' (1917) is prominently featured on the soundtrack. One of Alford's other pieces, the ''[[Colonel Bogey March]]'', was the musical theme for Lean's previous film ''[[The Bridge on the River Kwai]]''.\n\nA complete recording of the score was not heard until 2010 when Tadlow Music produced a CD of the music, with Nic Raine conducting the [[City of Prague Philharmonic]] from scores reconstructed by [[Leigh Phillips]].\n\n== Release ==\n=== Theatrical run ===\nThe film premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London on 10 December 1962 (Royal Premiere) and was released in the United States on 16 December 1962.\n\nThe original release ran for about 222&nbsp;minutes (plus overture, intermission, and exit music). A post-premiere memo (13 December 1962) noted that the film was 24,987.5&nbsp;ft (70&nbsp;mm) and 19,990&nbsp;ft (35&nbsp;mm). With 90&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film projected every minute, this corresponds to exactly 222.11 minutes. Richard May, VP Film Preservation at Warner Bros., sent an email to Robert Morris, co-author of a book on ''Lawrence of Arabia'', in which he noted that ''Gone With the Wind'' was never edited after its premiere and is 19,884&nbsp;ft of 35&nbsp;mm film (without leaders, overture, intermission, entr'acte, or walkout music), corresponding to 220.93 min. Thus, ''Lawrence of Arabia'' is slightly more than 1 minute longer than ''Gone With the Wind'' and is, therefore, the longest movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.\n\nIn January 1963, ''Lawrence'' was released in a version edited by 20 minutes; when it was re-released in 1971, an even shorter cut of 187&nbsp;minutes was presented. The first round of cuts was made at the direction and even insistence of David Lean, to assuage criticisms of the film's length and increase the number of showings per day; however, during the 1989 restoration, he passed blame for the cuts onto deceased producer Sam Spiegel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brownlow|1996|pages=484, 705, 709}}</ref> In addition, a 1966 print was used for initial television and video releases which accidentally altered a few scenes by reversing the image.<ref>Caton, S.C.

Harris]] and Jim Painten under the supervision of director David Lean. It was released in 1989 with a 216-minute length (plus overture, intermission, and exit music).\n\nMost of the cut scenes were dialogue sequences, particularly those involving General Allenby and his staff. Two whole scenes were completely excised\u2014Brighton's briefing of Allenby in Jerusalem before the Deraa scene and the British staff meeting in the field tent\u2014and the Allenby-briefing scene has still not been entirely restored. Much of the missing dialogue involves Lawrence's writing of poetry and verse, alluded to by Allenby in particular, saying \"the last poetry general we had was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]\". The opening of Act II existed in only fragmented form, where Faisal is interviewed by Bentley, as well as the later scene in Jerusalem where Allenby convinces Lawrence not to resign. Both scenes were restored to the 1989 re-release. Some of the more graphic shots of the Tafas massacre scene were also restored, such as the lengthy panning shot of the corpses in Tafas, and Lawrence shooting a surrendering Turkish soldier. Most of the still-missing footage is of minimal import, supplementing existing scenes. One scene is an extended version of the Deraa torture sequence, which makes Lawrence's punishment more overt in that scene. Other scripted scenes exist, including a conversation between Auda and Lawrence immediately after the fall of [[Aqaba]], a brief scene of Turkish officers noting the extent of Lawrence's campaign, and the battle of [[Petra]] (later reworked into the first train attack), but these scenes were probably not filmed. The actors still living at the time of the re-release dubbed their own dialogue, though [[Jack Hawkins]]'s dialogue had to be dubbed by [[Charles Gray (actor)|Charles Gray]], who had already provided Hawkins' voice for several films after Hawkins developed throat cancer in the late 1960s.

The [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], with their larger fleets and surrounding position, largely succeeded in their [[blockade of Germany]] and the other [[Central Powers]], whilst the efforts of the Central Powers to break that blockade, or to establish an effective counterblockade with [[submarine]]s and [[German commerce raiders in World War I|commerce raider]]s, were eventually unsuccessful. Major [[fleet action]]s were less decisive.\n\n==Prelude==\nJesuscrhist men\n===Naval arms race===\n{{Main|Anglo-German naval arms race}}\nMahan's thesis was highly influential and led to an explosion of new naval construction worldwide. The US Congress immediately ordered the building of three battleships (with a fourth {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}}, to be built two years later). Japan, whose British trained navy wiped out the Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], helped to reinforce the concept of naval power as the dominant factor in conflict. However, the book made the most impact in Germany.  The German Kaiser [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] had been much impressed by the [[Royal Navy]], when he visited his grandmother, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].  His mother said \"Wilhelm\u2019s one idea is to have a Navy which shall be larger and stronger than the British navy\". In 1898 came the first German [[Fleet Acts|Fleet Act]], two years later a second doubled the number of ships to be built, to 19 battleships and 23 cruisers in the next 20 years. In another decade, Germany would go from a naval ranking lower than Austria to having the second largest battle fleet in the world. For the first time since [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], Britain had an aggressive and truly dangerous rival to worry about.\n\nMahan wrote in his book that not only world peace or the empire, but Britain's very survival depended on the Royal Navy ruling the waves. Indeed, the Cambridge 1895 Latin essay prize was called \"Britannici maris\", or \"British Sea Power\". So when the great naval review of June 1897 for the Queen's diamond Jubilee took place, it was in an atmosphere of unease and uncertainty. The question everyone wanted to know the answer to was how Britain was going to stay ahead. But Mahan couldn't give any answers. The man who thought he could was [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]], then Commander in Chief, Mediterranean Fleet. He believed there were \"Five strategic keys to the empire and world economic system: Gibraltar, Alexandria and Suez, Singapore, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Straits of Dover.\" His job was to keep hold of all of them.\n\n===Fisher's reforms===\n[[File:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|Design of the revolutionary battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}.]]\nWhen he became [[First Sea Lord]], Fisher began drawing up plans for a naval war against Germany. \"Germany keeps her whole fleet always concentrated within a few hours of England,\" he wrote to the [[George V|Prince of Wales]] in 1906. \"We must therefore keep a fleet twice as powerful within a few hours of Germany.\"<ref>Marder, Arthur. ''From the Dreadnought to Scapa Flow: Volume I: The Road to War 1904-1914''. Seaforth Publishing, Jun 19, 2014, p. 74.</ref> He therefore concentrated the bulk of the fleet in home waters, with a secondary concentration in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]]. He also had dozens of obsolete warships scrapped or reduced to harbor duties. The resources thus saved were directed to new designs of [[submarine]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[light cruisers]], [[battlecruiser]]s and (most notably) dreadnoughts. Fisher proclaimed, \u201cWe shall have ten Dreadnoughts at sea before a single foreign Dreadnought is launched, and we have thirty percent more cruisers than Germany and France put together!\u201d.\n\n===German response===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-23, Linienschiff \"SMS Rheinland\".jpg|thumb|left|{{SMS|Rheinland}}, a {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|2}}, Germany's first response to ''Dreadnought''.]]\n\nAdmiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Alfred Tirpitz]] had also often visited Portsmouth as a naval cadet and admired and envied the Royal Navy. Like the Kaiser, Tirpitz believed Germany's future dominant role in the world depended on a navy powerful enough to challenge it. He demanded large numbers of battleships. Even when ''Dreadnought'' was launched making his previously constructed 15 battleships obsolete, he believed that eventually Germany's technological and industrial might would allow Germany to out-build Britain ship for ship. Using the threat of his own resignation he forced the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] to build three dreadnoughts and a battle cruiser. He also put aside money for a future submarine branch. At the rate that Tirpitz insisted upon, Germany would have thirteen in 1912, to Britain's 16.\n\nWhen this was leaked out to the British public in spring 1909, there was public outcry. The public demanded eight new battleships instead of the four the government had planned for that year. As [[Winston Churchill]] put it, \u201cThe Admiralty had demanded six ships; the economists offered four; and we finally compromised on eight\u201d.<ref name=\"chur\">[http://www.historicgreenslopes.com/documents/Booklet_The%20Great%20War%20@%206%20Sep.pdf]</ref> Tirpitz had no option but to consider Britain's new dreadnought building program as a direct threat to Germany. He had to respond, raising the stakes further. However, the commitment of funds to out-build the Germans meant Britain was abandoning any notion of a [[two-power standard]] for naval superiority.  No amount of money would allow Britain to compete with Germany and Russia or the US, or even Italy. Thus a new policy, of dominance over the world's second leading sea power by a 60% margin went into effect. Fisher's staff had been getting increasingly annoyed by the way he refused to tolerate any difference in opinion, and the eight dreadnought demand had been the last straw. Thus on January 25, 1910, Fisher left the admiralty. Shortly after Fisher's resignation, Churchill became First Lord of the Admiralty.<ref name=\"chur\" /> Under him, the race would continue; indeed Lloyd George nearly resigned when Churchill presented him with the naval budget of 1914 of 50 million pounds.\n\nBy the start of the war Germany had an impressive fleet both of capital ships and submarines. Other nations had smaller fleets, generally with a lower proportion of battleships and a larger proportion of smaller ships like destroyers and submarines. [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Japan]], and the [[United States]] all had modern fleets with at least some dreadnoughts and submarines.\n<!-- having trouble finding a reliable chart of naval power...sources vary-->\n\n==Naval technology==\nNaval technology in World War I was dominated by the dreadnought battleship. Battleships were built along the dreadnought model, with several large turrets of equally sized big guns. In general terms, British ships had larger guns and were equipped and manned for quicker fire than their German counterparts. In contrast, the German ships had better optical equipment and rangefinding and were much better compartmentalized and able to deal with damage. The Germans also generally had better propellant handling procedures, a point that was to have disastrous consequences for the British battlecruisers at [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]].\n\nMany of the individual parts of ships had recently improved dramatically. The introduction of the [[turbine]] led to much higher performance, as well as taking up less room and thereby allowing for improved layout. Whereas [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s were generally limited to about {{convert|12|-|17|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, modern ships were capable of at least {{convert|20|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, and in the latest British classes, {{convert|24|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. The introduction of the gyroscope and centralized fire control, the \"director\" in British terms, led to dramatic improvements in gunnery. Ships built before 1900 had effective ranges of perhaps {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, whereas the first \"new\" ships were good to at least {{convert|8000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and modern designs to over {{convert|10000|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nOne class of ship that appeared just before the war was the battlecruiser. There were two schools of thought on battlecruiser design: British and German. The British designs were armed like their heavier dreadnought cousins, but deliberately lacked armor to save weight in order to improve speed. The concept was that these ships would be able to outgun anything smaller than themselves, and run away from anything larger. The German designs opted to trade slightly smaller main armament (11 or 12&nbsp;inch guns compared to 12 or 13.5&nbsp;inch guns in their British rivals) for speed, while keeping relatively heavy armor. They could operate independently in the open ocean where their speed gave them room to maneuver, or alternately as a fast scouting force in front of a larger fleet action.\n\nThe [[torpedo boat]] caused considerable worry for many naval planners. In theory a large number of these inexpensive ships could attack in masses and overwhelm a dreadnought force. This led to the introduction of ships dedicated to keeping them away from the fleets, the torpedo boat destroyers, or simply destroyers. Although the mass raid continued to be a possibility, another solution was found in the form of the submarine, increasingly in use. The submarine could approach underwater, safe from the guns of both the capital ships and the destroyers (although not for long), and fire a salvo as deadly as a torpedo boat's. Limited range and speed, especially underwater, made these weapons difficult to use tactically. Submarines were generally more effective in attacking poorly defended merchant ships than in fighting surface warships, though several small to medium British warships were lost to torpedoes launched from German [[U-boat]]s.\n\nOil was just being introduced to replace coal, containing as much as 40% more energy per volume, extending range and further improving internal layout. Another advantage was that oil gave off considerably less smoke, making visual detection more difficult. This was generally mitigated by the small number of ships so equipped, generally operating in concert with coal-fired ships.\n\n[[Radio]] was in early use, with naval ships commonly equipped with radio telegraph, merchant ships less so. [[Sonar]] was in its infancy by the end of the war.\n\n[[Naval aviation|Aviation]] was primarily focused on reconnaissance, with the [[aircraft carrier]] being developed over the course of the war, and [[bomber]] aircraft capable of lifting only relatively light loads.\n\n[[Naval mines]] were also increasingly well developed. Defensive mines along coasts made it much more difficult for capital ships to get close enough to conduct coastal bombardment or support attacks. The first battleship sinking in the war \u2014 that of {{HMS|Audacious|1912|6}} \u2014 was the result of her striking a naval mine on 27 October 1914. Suitably placed mines also served to restrict the freedom of movement of submarines.\n\n==Theaters==\n\n===North Sea===\n{{Campaignbox North Sea 1914\u20131918}}\n\nThe North Sea was the main theater of the war for surface action. The [[British Grand Fleet]] took position against the German [[High Seas Fleet]]. Britain's larger fleet could maintain a blockade of Germany, cutting it off from overseas trade and resources. Germany's fleet remained mostly in harbor behind their screen of mines, occasionally attempting to lure the British fleet into battle (one of such attempts was the [[bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft]]) in the hopes of weakening them enough to break the blockade or allow the High Seas Fleet to attack British shipping and trade. Britain strove to maintain the blockade and, if possible, to damage the German fleet enough to remove the threat to the islands and free the Grand Fleet for use elsewhere.  In 1918 the U.S. Navy with British help laid the  [[North Sea Mine Barrage]] designed to keep u-boats from slipping into the Atlantic.\n\nMajor battles included those at [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Heligoland Bight]] ([[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight|two]] of them), [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]], and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]]. Though British tactical success remains a subject of historical debate, Britain accomplished its strategic objective of maintaining the blockade and keeping the main body of the High Seas Fleet in port for the vast majority of the war. The High Seas Fleet remained a threat as a [[fleet in being]] that forced Britain to retain a majority of its capital ships in the North Sea.\n\nThe set-piece battles and maneuvering have drawn historians' attention; however, it was the naval blockade of food and raw material imports into Germany which ultimately starved the German people and industries and contributed to Germany seeking the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice of 1918]].\n\n===English Channel===\nAlthough the English Channel was of vital importance to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) fighting in France, there were no big warships of the British Royal Navy in the Channel. The primary threat to the British forces in the Channel was the German High Seas Fleet based near Heligoland; the German fleet, if let out into the North Sea, could have destroyed any ship in the Channel. The German High Seas Fleet could muster at least 13 dreadnoughts and many armoured cruisers along with dozens of destroyers to attack the Channel.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_sea_gallery_01.shtml</ref> The High Seas Fleet would be fighting against only six armoured cruisers that were laid down in 1898\u20131899, far too old to accompany the big, fast dreadnoughts of the Grand Fleet based in Scapa Flow.<ref>''[[Castles of Steel]]'' by [[Robert K. Massie]] pg. 129</ref>\n\nThe U-boat threat in the Channel, although real, was not a significant worry to the Admiralty because they regarded submarines as useless.<ref>''Castles of Steel'' by Robert K. Massie pg. 122</ref> Even the German high command regarded the U-boat as, \"experimental vessels.\"<ref>''Castles of Steel'' by Robert K. Massie pg. 126</ref> Although the Channel was a major artery of the BEF, the Channel was never attacked directly by the High Seas Fleet.\n\n===Atlantic===\n{{Campaignbox Atlantic 1914\u20131918}}\n[[File:St\u00f6wer U-Boot Truppentransporter.jpg|thumb|right|U-boat sinking a [[troopship]], painting by [[Willy St\u00f6wer]]]]\n{{main|U-boat Campaign (World War I)}}\n\nWhile Germany was strangled by Britain's blockade, Britain, as an island nation, was heavily dependent on resources imported by sea. German submarines ([[U-boats]]) were of limited effectiveness against surface warships on their guard, but were greatly effective against merchant ships.\n\nIn 1915, Germany declared a naval blockade of Britain, to be enforced by its U-boats. The U-boats sank hundreds of Allied merchant ships. However, submarines normally attack by stealth. This made it difficult to give warning before attacking a merchant ship or to rescue survivors. This resulted in many civilian deaths, especially when passenger ships were sunk. It also violated the [[Prize Rules|Prize Rules of the Hague Convention]]. Furthermore, the U-boats also sank neutral ships in the blockade area, either intentionally or because identification was difficult from underwater.\n\nThis turned neutral opinion against the Central Powers, as countries like the U.S. and [[Brazil]] suffered casualties and losses to their trade.\n\nIn early 1917, Germany declared unrestricted submarine warfare, including attacks without warning against all ships in the \"war zone\", including neutrals. This was a major cause of U.S. declaration of war on Germany.\n\nThe U-boat campaign ultimately sank much of British merchant shipping and caused shortages of food and other necessities. The U-boats were eventually defeated by grouping merchant ships into [[Convoys in World War I|defended convoys]]. This was also assisted by U.S. entry into the war and the increasing use of primitive sonar and aerial patrolling to detect and track submarines.\n\n===Mediterranean===\n{{main|Mediterranean naval engagements during World War I}}\n{{Campaignbox Mediterranean Sea 1914\u20131918}}\nSome limited sea combat took place between the navies of Austria-Hungary and Germany and the Allied navies of France, Britain, Italy and Japan. The navy of the [[Ottoman Empire]] only sortied out of the Dardanelles once late in the war during the [[Battle of Imbros (1918)|Battle of Imbros]], preferring to focus its operations in the [[Black Sea]].\n\nThe main fleet action was the Triple Entente attempt to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war by an attack on [[Constantinople]] in 1915. This attempt turned into the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] which resulted in a Triple Entente defeat.\n\nFor the rest of the war, naval action consisted almost entirely in submarine combat by the Austrians and Germans and blockade duty by the triple entente.\n\n===Black Sea===\n{{Campaignbox Black Sea naval campaign of World War I}}\n\nThe Black Sea was mainly the domain of the Russians and the Ottoman Empire. The large Russian fleet was based in [[Sevastopol]] and it was led by two diligent commanders: Admiral [[Andrei Eberhardt]] (1914\u20131916) and Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]] (1916\u20131917). The Ottoman fleet on the other hand was in a period of transition with many obsolete ships. It had been expecting to receive two powerful dreadnoughts fitting out in Britain, but the UK seized the completed {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Re\u015fadiye||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Sult\u00e2n Osm\u00e2n-\u0131 Evvel||2}} with the outbreak of war with Germany and incorporated them into the Royal Navy.\n\nThe war in the Black Sea started when the Ottoman Fleet [[Black Sea Raid|bombarded several Russian cities]] in October 1914. The most advanced ships in the Ottoman fleet consisted of two ships of the German Mediterranean Fleet: the powerful battlecruiser {{SMS|Goeben||6}} and the speedy light cruiser {{SMS|Breslau||6}}, both under the command of the skilled German Admiral [[Wilhelm Souchon]]. ''Goeben'' was a modern design, and with her well-drilled crew, could easily outfight or outrun any single ship in the Russian fleet. However, even though the opposing Russian battleships were slower, they were often able to amass in superior numbers to outgun ''Goeben'', forcing her to flee.\n\nA continual series of cat and mouse operations ensued for the first two years with both sides' admirals trying to capitalize on their particular tactical strengths in a surprise ambush. Numerous battles between the fleets were fought in the initial years, and ''Goeben'' and Russian units were damaged on several occasions.\n\nThe Russian Black Sea fleet was mainly used to support General [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich|Nikolai Yudenich]] in his [[Caucasus Campaign]]. However, the appearance of ''Goeben'' could dramatically change the situation, so all activities, even shore bombardment, had to be conducted by almost the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet, since a smaller force could fall victim to ''Goeben''{{'}}s speed and guns.\n\nHowever, by 1916, this situation had swung in the Russians favour \u2013 ''Goeben'' had been in constant service for the past two years. Due to a lack of facilities, the ship was not able to enter refit and began to suffer chronic engine breakdowns. Meanwhile, the Russian Navy had received the modern dreadnought {{ship|Russian battleship|Imperatritsa Mariya||2}} which although slower, would be able to stand up to and outfight ''Goeben''. Although the two ships [[Action of 8 January 1916|skirmished briefly]], neither managed to capitalize on their tactical advantage and the battle ended with ''Goeben'' fleeing and ''Imperatritsa Mariya'' gamely trying to pursue. However, the Russian ship's arrival severely curtailed ''Goeben''{{'}}s activities and so by this time, the Russian fleet had nearly complete control of the sea, exacerbated by the addition of another dreadnought, {{ship|Russian battleship|Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya||2}}. German and Turkish light forces would however continue to raid and harass Russian shipping until the end of the war in the east.\n\nAfter Admiral Kolchak took command in August 1916, he planned to invigorate the Russian Black Seas Fleet with a series of aggressive actions. The Russian fleet mined the exit from the [[Bosporus]], preventing nearly all Ottoman ships from entering the Black Sea. Later that year, the naval approaches to [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]] were also mined. The greatest loss suffered by the Russian Black Sea fleet was the destruction of ''Imperatritsa Mariya'', which blew up in port on October 20 (October 7 o.s.) 1916, just one year after being commissioned. The subsequent investigation determined that the explosion was probably accidental, though sabotage could not be completely ruled out. The event shook Russian public opinion. The Russians continued work on two additional dreadnoughts under construction, and the balance of power remained in Russian hands until the collapse of Russian resistance in November 1917.\n\nTo support the Anglo-French attack on the Dardanelles, British, French and Australian submarines were sent into the Black Sea in the Spring of 1915. A number of Turkish supply ships and warships were sunk but several submarines were lost. The boats were withdrawn at the evacuation of the Dardanelles in January 1916.\n\nThe small Romanian Black Sea Fleet defended the port of [[Sulina]] throughout the second half of 1916, causing the sinking of one German submarine. Its minelayer also defended the Danube Delta from inland, leading to the sinking of one Austro-Hungarian Danube monitor. (See also [[Romanian Black Sea Fleet during World War I]])\n\nWhen Bulgaria entered World War I in 1915, its navy consisted mainly of a French-built torpedo gunboat called ''Nadezhda'' and six torpedo boats. It mainly engaged in mine warfare actions in the Black Sea against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and allowed the Germans to station two U-boats at Varna, one of which came under Bulgarian control in 1916 as ''[[SM UB-8#Bulgarian career|Podvodnik No. 18]]''. Russian mines sank one Bulgarian torpedo boat and damaged one more during the war.<ref>Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, ''Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 1'', p. 240</ref>\n\n===Baltic Sea===\n{{Campaignbox Baltic Sea 1914\u20131918}}\n\nIn the [[Baltic Sea]], Germany and Russia were the main combatants, with [[British submarine flotilla in the Baltic|a number of British submarines]] sailing through the [[Kattegat]] to assist the Russians. With the German fleet larger and more modern (many High Seas Fleet ships could easily be deployed to the Baltic when the North Sea was quiet), the Russians played a mainly defensive role, at most attacking convoys between Germany and Sweden.\n\nA major coup for the Allied forces occurred on August 26, 1914 when as part of a reconnaissance squadron, the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Magdeburg||6}} ran aground in heavy fog in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. The other German ships tried to refloat her, but decided to scuttle her instead when they became aware of an approaching Russian intercept force. Russian Navy divers scoured the wreck and successfully recovered the German naval [[codebook]] which was later passed on to their British Allies and contributed immeasurably to Allied success in the North Sea.\n\nWith heavy defensive and offensive mining on both sides, fleets played a limited role in the Eastern Front. The Germans mounted major naval attacks on the [[Gulf of Riga]], [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga|unsuccessfully in August 1915]] and [[Operation Albion|successfully in October 1917]], when they occupied the islands in the Gulf and damaged Russian ships departing from the city of [[Riga]], recently captured by Germany. This second operation culminated in the one major Baltic action, the [[battle of Moon Sound]] at which the Russian battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Slava||2}} was sunk.\n\nBy March 1918, the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] and the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] made the Baltic a German lake, and German fleets transferred troops to support the [[White Guard (Finland)|White side]] in the [[Finnish Civil War]] and to occupy much of Russia, halting only when defeated in the West.\n\n===Other Oceans===\n{{Campaignbox Command of the Oceans 1914\u20131917}}\nA number of German ships stationed overseas at the start of the war engaged in raiding operations in poorly defended seas, such as {{SMS|Emden|1908|6}}, which raided into the [[Indian Ocean]], sinking or capturing thirty Allied merchant ships and warships, bombarding [[Madras]] and [[Penang]], and destroying a radio relay on the [[Cocos Islands]] before being sunk there by {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}}. Better known was the [[German East Asia Squadron]], commanded by Admiral Graf [[Maximilian von Spee]], who sailed across the Pacific, [[Bombardment of Papeete|raiding Papeete]] and winning the [[Battle of Coronel]] before being defeated and mostly destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. The last remnants of Spee's squadron were interned at Chilean ports and destroyed at the [[Battle of Mas a Tierra]].\n\nAllied naval forces captured many of the isolated German colonies, with [[Samoa]], [[Micronesia]], [[Qingdao]], [[German New Guinea]], [[Togo]], and [[Cameroon]] falling in the first year of the war. As Austria-Hungary refused to withdraw its cruiser {{SMS|Kaiserin Elisabeth}} from the German naval base of Qingdao, Japan declared war in 1914 not only on Germany, but also on Austria-Hungary. The cruiser participated in the [[Siege of Tsingtao|defense of Qingdao]] where it was sunk in November 1914.<ref>''A Brief History of the Austrian Navy'' by Wilhelm Donko pg. 79</ref> Despite the loss of the last German cruiser in the Indian Ocean, {{SMS|K\u00f6nigsberg|1905|6}}, off the coast of [[German East Africa]] in July 1915, German East Africa held out in a long guerilla land [[East African Campaign (World War I)|campaign]]. [[HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou|British naval units]] despatched through Africa under Lieutenant-Commander [[Geoffrey Spicer-Simson]] had won strategic control of [[Lake Tanganyika]] in a [[Battle for Lake Tanganyika|series of engagements]] by February 1916, though fighting on land in German East Africa continued until 1918.\n\n==Fleets overview==\n\n===Allied Powers===\n{{WWI British ships}}\n{{WWIFrenchShips}}\n{{WWI Italian ships}}\n{{WWIJapaneseShips}}\n{{WWIRussianShips}}\n{{WWI US ships}}\n\n===Central Powers===\n{{Austro-Hungarian Navy classes}}\n{{WWIGermanShips}}\n{{WWI Ottoman ships}}\n\n===Neutral Powers===\n{{1890-1920DutchShips}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Benbow, Tim.

The [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], with their larger fleets and surrounding position, largely succeeded in their [[blockade of Germany]] and the other [[Central Powers]], whilst the efforts of the Central Powers to break that blockade, or to establish an effective counterblockade with [[submarine]]s and [[German commerce raiders in World War I|commerce raider]]s, were eventually unsuccessful. Major [[fleet action]]s were less decisive.\n\n==Prelude==\nThe naval arms race between Britain and [[Germany]] to build [[dreadnought]] [[battleship]]s in the early 20th century is the subject of a number of books. Germany's attempt to build a battleship fleet to match that of the United Kingdom, the dominant naval power of the 20th-century and an island country that depended on seaborne trade for survival, is often listed as a major reason for the enmity between those two countries that led the UK to enter [[World War I]]. German leaders desired a navy in proportion to their military and economic strength that could free their overseas trade and colonial empire from dependence on Britain's good will, but such a fleet would inevitably threaten Britain's own trade and empire.\n\nEver since the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] (over the colonial status of [[Morocco]], between March 1905 and May 1906), there had been an arms race, over their respective navies. However, events led up to this. Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] was an American naval officer, extremely interested in British naval history. In 1887, he published ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]''. The theme of this book was naval supremacy as the key to the modern world. His argument was that every nation that had ruled the waves, from Rome to Great Britain, had prospered and thrived, while those that lacked naval supremacy, such as Hannibal's Carthage or Napoleon's France, had not. He hypothesized that what Britain had done in building a navy to control the world's sea lanes, others could also do \u2014 indeed must do if they were to keep up with the race for wealth and empire in the future.\n\n===Naval arms race===\n{{Main|Anglo-German naval arms race}}\nMahan's thesis was highly influential and led to an explosion of new naval construction worldwide. The US Congress immediately ordered the building of three battleships (with a fourth {{USS|Iowa|BB-4|6}}, to be built two years later). Japan, whose British trained navy wiped out the Russian fleet at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], helped to reinforce the concept of naval power as the dominant factor in conflict. However, the book made the most impact in Germany.  The German Kaiser [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] had been much impressed by the [[Royal Navy]], when he visited his grandmother, [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].  His mother said \"Wilhelm\u2019s one idea is to have a Navy which shall be larger and stronger than the British navy\". In 1898 came the first German [[Fleet Acts|Fleet Act]], two years later a second doubled the number of ships to be built, to 19 battleships and 23 cruisers in the next 20 years. In another decade, Germany would go from a naval ranking lower than Austria to having the second largest battle fleet in the world. For the first time since [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], Britain had an aggressive and truly dangerous rival to worry about.\n\nMahan wrote in his book that not only world peace or the empire, but Britain's very survival depended on the Royal Navy ruling the waves. Indeed, the Cambridge 1895 Latin essay prize was called \"Britannici maris\", or \"British Sea Power\". So when the great naval review of June 1897 for the Queen's diamond Jubilee took place, it was in an atmosphere of unease and uncertainty. The question everyone wanted to know the answer to was how Britain was going to stay ahead. But Mahan couldn't give any answers. The man who thought he could was [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]], then Commander in Chief, Mediterranean Fleet. He believed there were \"Five strategic keys to the empire and world economic system: Gibraltar, Alexandria and Suez, Singapore, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Straits of Dover.\" His job was to keep hold of all of them.\n\n===Fisher's reforms===\n[[File:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|Design of the revolutionary battleship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}.]]\nWhen he became [[First Sea Lord]], Fisher began drawing up plans for a naval war against Germany. \"Germany keeps her whole fleet always concentrated within a few hours of England,\" he wrote to the [[George V|Prince of Wales]] in 1906. \"We must therefore keep a fleet twice as powerful within a few hours of Germany.\"<ref>Marder, Arthur. ''From the Dreadnought to Scapa Flow: Volume I: The Road to War 1904-1914''. Seaforth Publishing, Jun 19, 2014, p. 74.</ref> He therefore concentrated the bulk of the fleet in home waters, with a secondary concentration in the [[Mediterranean Fleet]]. He also had dozens of obsolete warships scrapped or reduced to harbor duties. The resources thus saved were directed to new designs of [[submarine]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[light cruisers]], [[battlecruiser]]s and (most notably) dreadnoughts. Fisher proclaimed, \u201cWe shall have ten Dreadnoughts at sea before a single foreign Dreadnought is launched, and we have thirty percent more cruisers than Germany and France put together!\u201d.\n\n===German response===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-23, Linienschiff \"SMS Rheinland\".jpg|thumb|left|{{SMS|Rheinland}}, a {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|2}}, Germany's first response to ''Dreadnought''.]]\n\nAdmiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Alfred Tirpitz]] had also often visited Portsmouth as a naval cadet and admired and envied the Royal Navy. Like the Kaiser, Tirpitz believed Germany's future dominant role in the world depended on a navy powerful enough to challenge it. He demanded large numbers of battleships. Even when ''Dreadnought'' was launched making his previously constructed 15 battleships obsolete, he believed that eventually Germany's technological and industrial might would allow Germany to out-build Britain ship for ship. Using the threat of his own resignation he forced the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] to build three dreadnoughts and a battle cruiser. He also put aside money for a future submarine branch. At the rate that Tirpitz insisted upon, Germany would have thirteen in 1912, to Britain's 16.\n\nWhen this was leaked out to the British public in spring 1909, there was public outcry. The public demanded eight new battleships instead of the four the government had planned for that year. As [[Winston Churchill]] put it, \u201cThe Admiralty had demanded six ships; the economists offered four; and we finally compromised on eight\u201d.<ref name=\"chur\">[http://www.historicgreenslopes.com/documents/Booklet_The%20Great%20War%20@%206%20Sep.pdf]</ref> Tirpitz had no option but to consider Britain's new dreadnought building program as a direct threat to Germany. He had to respond, raising the stakes further. However, the commitment of funds to out-build the Germans meant Britain was abandoning any notion of a [[two-power standard]] for naval superiority.  No amount of money would allow Britain to compete with Germany and Russia or the US, or even Italy. Thus a new policy, of dominance over the world's second leading sea power by a 60% margin went into effect. Fisher's staff had been getting increasingly annoyed by the way he refused to tolerate any difference in opinion, and the eight dreadnought demand had been the last straw. Thus on January 25, 1910, Fisher left the admiralty. Shortly after Fisher's resignation, Churchill became First Lord of the Admiralty.<ref name=\"chur\" /> Under him, the race would continue; indeed Lloyd George nearly resigned when Churchill presented him with the naval budget of 1914 of 50 million pounds.\n\nBy the start of the war Germany had an impressive fleet both of capital ships and submarines. Other nations had smaller fleets, generally with a lower proportion of battleships and a larger proportion of smaller ships like destroyers and submarines. [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Russia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Japan]], and the [[United States]] all had modern fleets with at least some dreadnoughts and submarines.\n<!-- having trouble finding a reliable chart of naval power...sources vary-->\n\n==Naval technology==\nNaval technology in World War I was dominated by the dreadnought battleship. Battleships were built along the dreadnought model, with several large turrets of equally sized big guns. In general terms, British ships had larger guns and were equipped and manned for quicker fire than their German counterparts. In contrast, the German ships had better optical equipment and rangefinding and were much better compartmentalized and able to deal with damage. The Germans also generally had better propellant handling procedures, a point that was to have disastrous consequences for the British battlecruisers at [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]].\n\nMany of the individual parts of ships had recently improved dramatically. The introduction of the [[turbine]] led to much higher performance, as well as taking up less room and thereby allowing for improved layout. Whereas [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s were generally limited to about {{convert|12|-|17|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, modern ships were capable of at least {{convert|20|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}, and in the latest British classes, {{convert|24|kn|mph km/h|abbr=on}}. The introduction of the gyroscope and centralized fire control, the \"director\" in British terms, led to dramatic improvements in gunnery. Ships built before 1900 had effective ranges of perhaps {{convert|2000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, whereas the first \"new\" ships were good to at least {{convert|8000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and modern designs to over {{convert|10000|yd|m|abbr=on}}.\n\nOne class of ship that appeared just before the war was the battlecruiser. There were two schools of thought on battlecruiser design: British and German. The British designs were armed like their heavier dreadnought cousins, but deliberately lacked armor to save weight in order to improve speed. The concept was that these ships would be able to outgun anything smaller than themselves, and run away from anything larger. The German designs opted to trade slightly smaller main armament (11 or 12&nbsp;inch guns compared to 12 or 13.5&nbsp;inch guns in their British rivals) for speed, while keeping relatively heavy armor. They could operate independently in the open ocean where their speed gave them room to maneuver, or alternately as a fast scouting force in front of a larger fleet action.\n\nThe [[torpedo boat]] caused considerable worry for many naval planners. In theory a large number of these inexpensive ships could attack in masses and overwhelm a dreadnought force. This led to the introduction of ships dedicated to keeping them away from the fleets, the torpedo boat destroyers, or simply destroyers. Although the mass raid continued to be a possibility, another solution was found in the form of the submarine, increasingly in use. The submarine could approach underwater, safe from the guns of both the capital ships and the destroyers (although not for long), and fire a salvo as deadly as a torpedo boat's. Limited range and speed, especially underwater, made these weapons difficult to use tactically. Submarines were generally more effective in attacking poorly defended merchant ships than in fighting surface warships, though several small to medium British warships were lost to torpedoes launched from German [[U-boat]]s.\n\nOil was just being introduced to replace coal, containing as much as 40% more energy per volume, extending range and further improving internal layout. Another advantage was that oil gave off considerably less smoke, making visual detection more difficult. This was generally mitigated by the small number of ships so equipped, generally operating in concert with coal-fired ships.\n\n[[Radio]] was in early use, with naval ships commonly equipped with radio telegraph, merchant ships less so. [[Sonar]] was in its infancy by the end of the war.\n\n[[Naval aviation|Aviation]] was primarily focused on reconnaissance, with the [[aircraft carrier]] being developed over the course of the war, and [[bomber]] aircraft capable of lifting only relatively light loads.\n\n[[Naval mines]] were also increasingly well developed. Defensive mines along coasts made it much more difficult for capital ships to get close enough to conduct coastal bombardment or support attacks. The first battleship sinking in the war \u2014 that of {{HMS|Audacious|1912|6}} \u2014 was the result of her striking a naval mine on 27 October 1914. Suitably placed mines also served to restrict the freedom of movement of submarines.\n\n==Theaters==\n\n===North Sea===\n{{Campaignbox North Sea 1914\u20131918}}\n\nThe North Sea was the main theater of the war for surface action. The [[British Grand Fleet]] took position against the German [[High Seas Fleet]]. Britain's larger fleet could maintain a blockade of Germany, cutting it off from overseas trade and resources. Germany's fleet remained mostly in harbor behind their screen of mines, occasionally attempting to lure the British fleet into battle (one of such attempts was the [[bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft]]) in the hopes of weakening them enough to break the blockade or allow the High Seas Fleet to attack British shipping and trade. Britain strove to maintain the blockade and, if possible, to damage the German fleet enough to remove the threat to the islands and free the Grand Fleet for use elsewhere.  In 1918 the U.S. Navy with British help laid the  [[North Sea Mine Barrage]] designed to keep u-boats from slipping into the Atlantic.\n\nMajor battles included those at [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Heligoland Bight]] ([[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight|two]] of them), [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Dogger Bank]], and [[Battle of Jutland|Jutland]]. Though British tactical success remains a subject of historical debate, Britain accomplished its strategic objective of maintaining the blockade and keeping the main body of the High Seas Fleet in port for the vast majority of the war. The High Seas Fleet remained a threat as a [[fleet in being]] that forced Britain to retain a majority of its capital ships in the North Sea.\n\nThe set-piece battles and maneuvering have drawn historians' attention; however, it was the naval blockade of food and raw material imports into Germany which ultimately starved the German people and industries and contributed to Germany seeking the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice of 1918]].\n\n===English Channel===\nAlthough the English Channel was of vital importance to the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) fighting in France, there were no big warships of the British Royal Navy in the Channel. The primary threat to the British forces in the Channel was the German High Seas Fleet based near Heligoland; the German fleet, if let out into the North Sea, could have destroyed any ship in the Channel. The German High Seas Fleet could muster at least 13 dreadnoughts and many armoured cruisers along with dozens of destroyers to attack the Channel.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_sea_gallery_01.shtml</ref> The High Seas Fleet would be fighting against only six armoured cruisers that were laid down in 1898\u20131899, far too old to accompany the big, fast dreadnoughts of the Grand Fleet based in Scapa Flow.<ref>''[[Castles of Steel]]'' by [[Robert K. Massie]] pg. 129</ref>\n\nThe U-boat threat in the Channel, although real, was not a significant worry to the Admiralty because they regarded submarines as useless.<ref>''Castles of Steel'' by Robert K. Massie pg. 122</ref> Even the German high command regarded the U-boat as, \"experimental vessels.\"<ref>''Castles of Steel'' by Robert K. Massie pg. 126</ref> Although the Channel was a major artery of the BEF, the Channel was never attacked directly by the High Seas Fleet.\n\n===Atlantic===\n{{Campaignbox Atlantic 1914\u20131918}}\n[[File:St\u00f6wer U-Boot Truppentransporter.jpg|thumb|right|U-boat sinking a [[troopship]], painting by [[Willy St\u00f6wer]]]]\n{{main|U-boat Campaign (World War I)}}\n\nWhile Germany was strangled by Britain's blockade, Britain, as an island nation, was heavily dependent on resources imported by sea. German submarines ([[U-boats]]) were of limited effectiveness against surface warships on their guard, but were greatly effective against merchant ships.\n\nIn 1915, Germany declared a naval blockade of Britain, to be enforced by its U-boats. The U-boats sank hundreds of Allied merchant ships. However, submarines normally attack by stealth. This made it difficult to give warning before attacking a merchant ship or to rescue survivors. This resulted in many civilian deaths, especially when passenger ships were sunk. It also violated the [[Prize Rules|Prize Rules of the Hague Convention]]. Furthermore, the U-boats also sank neutral ships in the blockade area, either intentionally or because identification was difficult from underwater.\n\nThis turned neutral opinion against the Central Powers, as countries like the U.S. and [[Brazil]] suffered casualties and losses to their trade.\n\nIn early 1917, Germany declared unrestricted submarine warfare, including attacks without warning against all ships in the \"war zone\", including neutrals. This was a major cause of U.S. declaration of war on Germany.\n\nThe U-boat campaign ultimately sank much of British merchant shipping and caused shortages of food and other necessities. The U-boats were eventually defeated by grouping merchant ships into [[Convoys in World War I|defended convoys]]. This was also assisted by U.S. entry into the war and the increasing use of primitive sonar and aerial patrolling to detect and track submarines.\n\n===Mediterranean===\n{{main|Mediterranean naval engagements during World War I}}\n{{Campaignbox Mediterranean Sea 1914\u20131918}}\nSome limited sea combat took place between the navies of Austria-Hungary and Germany and the Allied navies of France, Britain, Italy and Japan. The navy of the [[Ottoman Empire]] only sortied out of the Dardanelles once late in the war during the [[Battle of Imbros (1918)|Battle of Imbros]], preferring to focus its operations in the [[Black Sea]].\n\nThe main fleet action was the Triple Entente attempt to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war by an attack on [[Constantinople]] in 1915. This attempt turned into the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] which resulted in a Triple Entente defeat.\n\nFor the rest of the war, naval action consisted almost entirely in submarine combat by the Austrians and Germans and blockade duty by the triple entente.\n\n===Black Sea===\n{{Campaignbox Black Sea naval campaign of World War I}}\n\nThe Black Sea was mainly the domain of the Russians and the Ottoman Empire. The large Russian fleet was based in [[Sevastopol]] and it was led by two diligent commanders: Admiral [[Andrei Eberhardt]] (1914\u20131916) and Admiral [[Alexander Kolchak]] (1916\u20131917). The Ottoman fleet on the other hand was in a period of transition with many obsolete ships. It had been expecting to receive two powerful dreadnoughts fitting out in Britain, but the UK seized the completed {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Re\u015fadiye||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Sult\u00e2n Osm\u00e2n-\u0131 Evvel||2}} with the outbreak of war with Germany and incorporated them into the Royal Navy.\n\nThe war in the Black Sea started when the Ottoman Fleet [[Black Sea Raid|bombarded several Russian cities]] in October 1914. The most advanced ships in the Ottoman fleet consisted of two ships of the German Mediterranean Fleet: the powerful battlecruiser {{SMS|Goeben||6}} and the speedy light cruiser {{SMS|Breslau||6}}, both under the command of the skilled German Admiral [[Wilhelm Souchon]]. ''Goeben'' was a modern design, and with her well-drilled crew, could easily outfight or outrun any single ship in the Russian fleet. However, even though the opposing Russian battleships were slower, they were often able to amass in superior numbers to outgun ''Goeben'', forcing her to flee.\n\nA continual series of cat and mouse operations ensued for the first two years with both sides' admirals trying to capitalize on their particular tactical strengths in a surprise ambush. Numerous battles between the fleets were fought in the initial years, and ''Goeben'' and Russian units were damaged on several occasions.\n\nThe Russian Black Sea fleet was mainly used to support General [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich|Nikolai Yudenich]] in his [[Caucasus Campaign]]. However, the appearance of ''Goeben'' could dramatically change the situation, so all activities, even shore bombardment, had to be conducted by almost the entire Russian Black Sea Fleet, since a smaller force could fall victim to ''Goeben''{{'}}s speed and guns.\n\nHowever, by 1916, this situation had swung in the Russians favour \u2013 ''Goeben'' had been in constant service for the past two years. Due to a lack of facilities, the ship was not able to enter refit and began to suffer chronic engine breakdowns. Meanwhile, the Russian Navy had received the modern dreadnought {{ship|Russian battleship|Imperatritsa Mariya||2}} which although slower, would be able to stand up to and outfight ''Goeben''. Although the two ships [[Action of 8 January 1916|skirmished briefly]], neither managed to capitalize on their tactical advantage and the battle ended with ''Goeben'' fleeing and ''Imperatritsa Mariya'' gamely trying to pursue. However, the Russian ship's arrival severely curtailed ''Goeben''{{'}}s activities and so by this time, the Russian fleet had nearly complete control of the sea, exacerbated by the addition of another dreadnought, {{ship|Russian battleship|Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya||2}}. German and Turkish light forces would however continue to raid and harass Russian shipping until the end of the war in the east.\n\nAfter Admiral Kolchak took command in August 1916, he planned to invigorate the Russian Black Seas Fleet with a series of aggressive actions. The Russian fleet mined the exit from the [[Bosporus]], preventing nearly all Ottoman ships from entering the Black Sea. Later that year, the naval approaches to [[Varna]], [[Bulgaria]] were also mined. The greatest loss suffered by the Russian Black Sea fleet was the destruction of ''Imperatritsa Mariya'', which blew up in port on October 20 (October 7 o.s.) 1916, just one year after being commissioned. The subsequent investigation determined that the explosion was probably accidental, though sabotage could not be completely ruled out. The event shook Russian public opinion. The Russians continued work on two additional dreadnoughts under construction, and the balance of power remained in Russian hands until the collapse of Russian resistance in November 1917.\n\nTo support the Anglo-French attack on the Dardanelles, British, French and Australian submarines were sent into the Black Sea in the Spring of 1915. A number of Turkish supply ships and warships were sunk but several submarines were lost. The boats were withdrawn at the evacuation of the Dardanelles in January 1916.\n\nThe small Romanian Black Sea Fleet defended the port of [[Sulina]] throughout the second half of 1916, causing the sinking of one German submarine. Its minelayer also defended the Danube Delta from inland, leading to the sinking of one Austro-Hungarian Danube monitor. (See also [[Romanian Black Sea Fleet during World War I]])\n\nWhen Bulgaria entered World War I in 1915, its navy consisted mainly of a French-built torpedo gunboat called ''Nadezhda'' and six torpedo boats. It mainly engaged in mine warfare actions in the Black Sea against the Russian Black Sea Fleet and allowed the Germans to station two U-boats at Varna, one of which came under Bulgarian control in 1916 as ''[[SM UB-8#Bulgarian career|Podvodnik No. 18]]''. Russian mines sank one Bulgarian torpedo boat and damaged one more during the war.<ref>Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, ''Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 1'', p. 240</ref>\n\n===Baltic Sea===\n{{Campaignbox Baltic Sea 1914\u20131918}}\n\nIn the [[Baltic Sea]], Germany and Russia were the main combatants, with [[British submarine flotilla in the Baltic|a number of British submarines]] sailing through the [[Kattegat]] to assist the Russians. With the German fleet larger and more modern (many High Seas Fleet ships could easily be deployed to the Baltic when the North Sea was quiet), the Russians played a mainly defensive role, at most attacking convoys between Germany and Sweden.\n\nA major coup for the Allied forces occurred on August 26, 1914 when as part of a reconnaissance squadron, the [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Magdeburg||6}} ran aground in heavy fog in the [[Gulf of Finland]]. The other German ships tried to refloat her, but decided to scuttle her instead when they became aware of an approaching Russian intercept force. Russian Navy divers scoured the wreck and successfully recovered the German naval [[codebook]] which was later passed on to their British Allies and contributed immeasurably to Allied success in the North Sea.\n\nWith heavy defensive and offensive mining on both sides, fleets played a limited role in the Eastern Front. The Germans mounted major naval attacks on the [[Gulf of Riga]], [[Battle of the Gulf of Riga|unsuccessfully in August 1915]] and [[Operation Albion|successfully in October 1917]], when they occupied the islands in the Gulf and damaged Russian ships departing from the city of [[Riga]], recently captured by Germany. This second operation culminated in the one major Baltic action, the [[battle of Moon Sound]] at which the Russian battleship {{ship|Russian battleship|Slava||2}} was sunk.\n\nBy March 1918, the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] and the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] made the Baltic a German lake, and German fleets transferred troops to support the [[White Guard (Finland)|White side]] in the [[Finnish Civil War]] and to occupy much of Russia, halting only when defeated in the West.\n\n===Other Oceans===\n{{Campaignbox Command of the Oceans 1914\u20131917}}\nA number of German ships stationed overseas at the start of the war engaged in raiding operations in poorly defended seas, such as {{SMS|Emden|1908|6}}, which raided into the [[Indian Ocean]], sinking or capturing thirty Allied merchant ships and warships, bombarding [[Madras]] and [[Penang]], and destroying a radio relay on the [[Cocos Islands]] before being sunk there by {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}}. Better known was the [[German East Asia Squadron]], commanded by Admiral Graf [[Maximilian von Spee]], who sailed across the Pacific, [[Bombardment of Papeete|raiding Papeete]] and winning the [[Battle of Coronel]] before being defeated and mostly destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. The last remnants of Spee's squadron were interned at Chilean ports and destroyed at the [[Battle of Mas a Tierra]].\n\nAllied naval forces captured many of the isolated German colonies, with [[Samoa]], [[Micronesia]], [[Qingdao]], [[German New Guinea]], [[Togo]], and [[Cameroon]] falling in the first year of the war. As Austria-Hungary refused to withdraw its cruiser {{SMS|Kaiserin Elisabeth}} from the German naval base of Qingdao, Japan declared war in 1914 not only on Germany, but also on Austria-Hungary. The cruiser participated in the [[Siege of Tsingtao|defense of Qingdao]] where it was sunk in November 1914.<ref>''A Brief History of the Austrian Navy'' by Wilhelm Donko pg. 79</ref> Despite the loss of the last German cruiser in the Indian Ocean, {{SMS|K\u00f6nigsberg|1905|6}}, off the coast of [[German East Africa]] in July 1915, German East Africa held out in a long guerilla land [[East African Campaign (World War I)|campaign]]. [[HMS Mimi and HMS Toutou|British naval units]] despatched through Africa under Lieutenant-Commander [[Geoffrey Spicer-Simson]] had won strategic control of [[Lake Tanganyika]] in a [[Battle for Lake Tanganyika|series of engagements]] by February 1916, though fighting on land in German East Africa continued until 1918.\n\n==Fleets overview==\n\n===Allied Powers===\n{{WWI British ships}}\n{{WWIFrenchShips}}\n{{WWI Italian ships}}\n{{WWIJapaneseShips}}\n{{WWIRussianShips}}\n{{WWI US ships}}\n\n===Central Powers===\n{{Austro-Hungarian Navy classes}}\n{{WWIGermanShips}}\n{{WWI Ottoman ships}}\n\n===Neutral Powers===\n{{1890-1920DutchShips}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Benbow, Tim.

The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called [[osseointegration]], in which  materials such as [[titanium]] form an intimate bond to bone. The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an [[abutment (dentistry)|abutment]] is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic/crown.\n\nSuccess or failure of implants depends on the health of the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] forces created during [[mastication|chewing]] can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using [[computed tomography]] with [[CAD/CAM]] simulations and surgical guides called [[stent]]s. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy [[bone]] and [[gingiva]]. Since both can [[atrophy]] after [[tooth extraction]], pre-prosthetic procedures such as [[sinus lift]]s or [[gingival graft]]s are sometimes  required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva.\n\nThe final prosthetic can be either fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic.

Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).<ref name=\"branemark\"/>\n\nHowever, later research suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 [[Newton metre|Ncm]]) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months.<ref name=\"loadtimes\"/> The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.<ref name=\"Atieh\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Atieh MA, Atieh AH, Payne AG, Duncan WJ | title = Immediate loading with single implant crowns: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The International Journal of Prosthodontics | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 378\u201387 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19639076 }}</ref>\n\n===={{anchor|healing abutment}}One versus two-stage surgery====\nAfter an implant is placed, the internal components are covered with either a healing abutment, or a cover screw.

When replacing a tooth with an implant, a band of strong, attached gingiva is needed to keep the implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva surrounding an implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer [[biologic width]]).<ref name=\"Newman\">{{cite book | title=Carranza's Clinical Periodontology (in English) | publisher=Elsevier Saunders | veditors = Newman M, Takei H, Klokkevold P | year=2012 | location=St. Louis, Missouri | isbn=9781437704167}}</ref>{{rp|pages=629\u2013633}}\n\nWhen an adequate band of attached tissue is absent, it can be recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods that can be used to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), [[gingival graft|gingiva from the palate]] can be transplanted, deeper [[subepithelial connective tissue graft|connective tissue from the palate]] can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.<ref name=\"Sclar2003\"/>{{rp|pages=113\u2013188}}\n\nAdditionally, for an implant to look esthetic, a band of full, plump gingiva is needed to fill in the space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue complication is called a black-triangle, where the [[Interdental papilla|papilla]] (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth. Dentists can only expect 2\u20134&nbsp;mm of papilla height over the underlying bone. A black triangle can be expected if the distance between where the teeth touch and bone is any greater.<ref name=\"LindheJ\"/>{{rp|pages=81\u201384}}\n\n==Recovery==\n[[File:Dental-implant.gif|thumb|200px|The steps taken to secure dental crowns on the implant fixture including placement of the abutment and crown]]\nThe prosthetic phase begins once the implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance that it will integrate) and an abutment is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even in the event of early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the [[vertical dimension of occlusion]], the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.<ref name=\"branemark\"/>{{rp|pages=241\u2013251}}\n\n===Single teeth, bridges and fixed dentures===\n\nAn abutment is selected depending on the application. In many single crown and fixed partial denture scenarios (bridgework), custom abutments are used. An impression of the top of the implant is made  with the adjacent teeth and gingiva. A dental lab then simultaneously fabricates an abutment and crown. The abutment is seated on the implant, a screw passes through the abutment to secure it to an internal thread on the implant (lag-screw). There are variations on this, such as when the abutment and implant body are one piece or when a ''stock'' (prefabricated) abutment is used. Custom abutments can be made by hand, as a cast metal piece or custom milled from metal or zirconia, all of which have similar success rates.<ref name=\"LindheJ\"/>{{rp|page=1233}}\n\nThe platform between the implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, the collar of the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as [[platform switching]]. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.<ref name=\"Atieh2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Atieh MA, Ibrahim HM, Atieh AH | title = Platform switching for marginal bone preservation around dental implants: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Periodontology | volume = 81 | issue = 10 | pages = 1350\u201366 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20575657 | doi = 10.1902/jop.2010.100232 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7e4fdbd3a4cccd623b02af4a565842de6a478c5f }}</ref>\n\nRegardless of the abutment material or technique, an impression of the abutment is then taken and a crown secured to the abutment with dental cement. Another variation on abutment/crown model is when the crown and abutment are one piece and the lag-screw traverses both to secure the one-piece structure to the internal thread on the implant. There does not appear to be any benefit, in terms of success, for cement versus screw-retained prosthetics, although the latter is believed to be easier to maintain (and change when the prosthetic fractures) and the former offers high esthetic performance.<ref name=\"LindheJ\"/>{{rp|page=1233}}\n\n===Prosthetic procedures for removable dentures===\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = Overdentures\n| width     = 150\n| image1    = Four mandibular implants with Novaloc abutments.jpg\n| alt1      = Four mandibular implants\n| caption1  = Four lower implants to retain a complete denture with novaloc abutments\n| image2    = Complete lower denture with Novaloc abutments.jpg\n| alt2      = lower denture implant housing\n| caption2  = Underside of a denture; housing fits like a ball and socket to hold the denture\n| image3    = Implant supported overdenture.jpg\n| alt3      = Panorex radiograph showing implants\n| caption3  = Xray of four straumann implants and abutments\n}}\nWhen a removable denture is worn, retainers to hold the denture in place can be either custom made or \"off-the-shelf\" (stock) abutments. When custom retainers are used, four or more implant fixtures are placed and an impression of the implants is taken and a dental lab creates a custom metal bar with attachments to hold the denture in place. Significant retention can be created with multiple attachments and the use of semi-precision attachments (such as a small diameter pin that pushes through the denture and into the bar) which allows for little or no movement in the denture, but it remains removable.<ref name=\"Jokstad\"/>{{rp|pages=33\u201334}}  However, the same four implants angled in such a way to distribute [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] forces may be able to safely hold a fixed denture in place with comparable costs and number of procedures giving the denture wearer a fixed solution.<ref name=\"Patzelt\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Patzelt SB, Bahat O, Reynolds MA, Strub JR | title = The all-on-four treatment concept: a systematic review | journal = Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 836\u201355 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 23560986 | doi = 10.1111/cid.12068 }}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, stock abutments are used to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture.

The stability of the [[titanium]] [[screw]] implant in the patient's [[bone tissue]] post surgery may be non-invasively assessed using [[resonance frequency analysis]]. Sufficient initial stability may allow immediate loading with [[prosthetic]] reconstruction, though early loading poses a higher risk of implant failure than conventional loading.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhu Y, Zheng X, Zeng G, Xu Y, Qu X, Zhu M, Lu E | title = Clinical efficacy of early loading versus conventional loading of dental implants | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 5 | pages = 15995 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26542097 | pmc = 4635353 | doi = 10.1038/srep15995 | bibcode = 2015NatSR...515995Z }}</ref>\n\nThe relevance of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant in the first weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability is different from the initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant ([[osseointegration]]). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3\u20134 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.\n\n====Immediate post-operative risks====\n# Infection (pre-op antibiotics reduce the risk of implant failure by 33 percent but do not affect the risk of infection).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Esposito|first=Marco|last2=Grusovin|first2=Maria Gabriella|last3=Worthington|first3=Helen V.|date=2013-07-31|title=Interventions for replacing missing teeth: antibiotics at dental implant placement to prevent complications|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD004152|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004152.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6786879|pmid=23904048}}</ref>\n# Excessive bleeding<ref name=\"Branemark1992\"/>{{rp|page=68}}\n# Flap breakdown (less-than 5 percent)<ref name=\"Branemark1992\"/>{{rp|page=68}}\n\n====Failure to integrate====\nAn implant is tested between 8 and 24 weeks to determine if it is integrated. There is significant variation in the criteria used to determine implant success, the most commonly cited criteria at the implant level are the absence of pain, mobility, infection, gingival bleeding, radiographic lucency or peri-implant bone loss greater than 1.5&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"criteria\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Papaspyridakos P, Chen CJ, Singh M, Weber HP, Gallucci GO | title = Success criteria in implant dentistry: a systematic review | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 91 | issue = 3 | pages = 242\u20138 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22157097 | doi = 10.1177/0022034511431252 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/d1f633c2a2a119d5c49e55b1fc2e38d35d2c1f47 }}</ref>\n\nDental implant success is related to operator skill, quality and quantity of the bone available at the site, and the patient's [[oral hygiene]], but the most important factor is [[primary implant stability]].<ref name=\"Javed\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Javed F, Romanos GE | title = The role of primary stability for successful immediate loading of dental implants.

Immediate loading implants may have a higher rate of failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including [[smoking]] or drug use.\n\n===Long term===\nThe long-term complications that result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of the patient and the technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to [[biomechanics|biomechanical factors]], where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor [[crown-to-root ratio]]). Similarly, [[bruxism|grinding of the teeth]], lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk.<ref name=\"Renouard\" /> {{rp|pages=27\u201351}}  Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.<ref name=\"Renouard\">{{cite book | title=Risk Factors in Implant Dentistry: Simplified Clinical Analysis for Predictable Treatment | publisher=Quintessence International | last = Renouard | first = Frank | name-list-format = vanc | year=1999 | location=Paris, France | isbn=978-0867153552}}</ref>{{rp|pages=27\u201351}}\n\nFrom these theoretical risks, derive the real world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to [[peri-implantitis]] or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no [[dental enamel]] on an implant, it does not fail due to [[dental caries|cavities]] like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 93&ndash;98 percent depending on their clinical use.<ref name=\"main1\" /><ref name=\"main2\" /><ref name=\"main3\" /> During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to get caught in the gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there does not appear to be any additional [[peri-implantitis]] in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.<ref name=\"debrandao\">{{cite journal | vauthors = de Brand\u00e3o ML, Vettore MV, Vidigal J\u00fanior GM | title = Peri-implant bone loss in cement- and screw-retained prostheses: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Clinical Periodontology | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 287\u201395 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23297703 | doi = 10.1111/jcpe.12041 }}</ref>\nIn compound implants (two stage implants), between the actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity.

The most commonly cited criteria for success are function of at least five years in the absence of pain, mobility, radiographic lucency and  peri-implant bone loss of greater than 1.5&nbsp;mm  on the implant, the lack of suppuration or bleeding in the soft tissues and occurrence of technical complications/prosthetic maintenance, adequate function, and esthetics in the prosthetic.

The basis for modern dental implants is a biologic process called [[osseointegration]], in which  materials such as [[titanium]] form an intimate bond to bone. The implant fixture is first placed so that it is likely to osseointegrate, then a dental prosthetic is added. A variable amount of healing time is required for osseointegration before either the dental prosthetic (a tooth, bridge or denture) is attached to the implant or an [[abutment (dentistry)|abutment]] is placed which will hold a dental prosthetic/crown.\n\nSuccess or failure of implants depends on the health of the person receiving the treatment, drugs which affect the chances of osseointegration, and the health of the tissues in the mouth. The amount of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] that will be put on the implant and fixture during normal function is also evaluated. Planning the position and number of implants is key to the long-term health of the prosthetic since [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] forces created during [[mastication|chewing]] can be significant. The position of implants is determined by the position and angle of adjacent teeth, by lab simulations or by using [[computed tomography]] with [[CAD/CAM]] simulations and surgical guides called [[stent]]s. The prerequisites for long-term success of osseointegrated dental implants are healthy [[bone]] and [[gingiva]]. Since both can [[atrophy]] after [[tooth extraction]], pre-prosthetic procedures such as [[sinus lift]]s or [[gingival graft]]s are sometimes  required to recreate ideal bone and gingiva.\n\nThe final prosthetic can be either fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an abutment is attached to the implant fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the abutment either with [[lag screw]]s or with [[dental cement]]. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together.\n\nThe risks and complications related to implant therapy divide into those that occur during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those that occur in the first six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those that occur long-term (such as [[peri-implantitis]] and mechanical failures).

Implants preserve the integrity of the teeth adjacent to the edentulous area, and it has been shown that dental implant therapy is less costly and more efficient over time than tooth-supported FPDs for the replacement of one missing tooth.

Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as [[bridge (dentistry)|pontics]]. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments in the same way as a single tooth implant replacement. A fixed bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a fixed partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a fixed full denture).

Because of this duality, uncertainty exists in the dental community about how to best manage the risk of BRONJ when placing implants. A 2009 position paper by the [[American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons]], discussed that the risk of BRONJ from low dose oral therapy (or slow release injectable) as between 0.01 and 0.06 percent for any procedure done on the jaws (implant, extraction, etc.). The risk is higher with intravenous therapy, procedures on the lower jaw, people with other medical issues, those on steroids, those on more potent bisphosphonates and people who have taken the drug for more than three years. The position paper recommends against placing implants in people who are taking high dose or high frequency intravenous therapy for cancer care.

Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).<ref name=\"branemark\"/>\n\nHowever, later research suggests that the initial stability of the implant in bone is a more important determinant of success of implant integration, rather than a certain period of healing time. As a result, the time allowed to heal is typically based on the density of bone the implant is placed in and the number of implants splinted together, rather than a uniform amount of time. When implants can withstand high torque (35 [[Newton metre|Ncm]]) and are splinted to other implants, there are no meaningful differences in long-term implant survival or bone loss between implants loaded immediately, at three months, or at six months.<ref name=\"loadtimes\"/> The corollary is that single implants, even in solid bone, require a period of no-load to minimize the risk of initial failure.<ref name=\"Atieh\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Atieh MA, Atieh AH, Payne AG, Duncan WJ | title = Immediate loading with single implant crowns: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The International Journal of Prosthodontics | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 378\u201387 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19639076 }}</ref>\n\n===={{anchor|healing abutment}}One versus two-stage surgery====\nAfter an implant is placed, the internal components are covered with either a healing abutment, or a cover screw.

When replacing a tooth with an implant, a band of strong, attached gingiva is needed to keep the implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva surrounding an implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer [[biologic width]]).<ref name=\"Newman\">{{cite book | title=Carranza's Clinical Periodontology (in English) | publisher=Elsevier Saunders | veditors = Newman M, Takei H, Klokkevold P | year=2012 | location=St. Louis, Missouri | isbn=9781437704167}}</ref>{{rp|pages=629\u2013633}}\n\nWhen an adequate band of attached tissue is absent, it can be recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods that can be used to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (buccal), [[gingival graft|gingiva from the palate]] can be transplanted, deeper [[subepithelial connective tissue graft|connective tissue from the palate]] can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.<ref name=\"Sclar2003\"/>{{rp|pages=113\u2013188}}\n\nAdditionally, for an implant to look esthetic, a band of full, plump gingiva is needed to fill in the space on either side of implant. The most common soft tissue complication is called a black-triangle, where the [[Interdental papilla|papilla]] (the small triangular piece of tissue between two teeth) shrinks back and leaves a triangular void between the implant and the adjacent teeth.

Even in the event of early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the [[vertical dimension of occlusion]], the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.<ref name=\"branemark\"/>{{rp|pages=241\u2013251}}\n\n===Single teeth, bridges and fixed dentures===\n\nAn abutment is selected depending on the application. In many single crown and fixed partial denture scenarios (bridgework), custom abutments are used. An impression of the top of the implant is made  with the adjacent teeth and gingiva. A dental lab then simultaneously fabricates an abutment and crown. The abutment is seated on the implant, a screw passes through the abutment to secure it to an internal thread on the implant (lag-screw). There are variations on this, such as when the abutment and implant body are one piece or when a ''stock'' (prefabricated) abutment is used. Custom abutments can be made by hand, as a cast metal piece or custom milled from metal or zirconia, all of which have similar success rates.<ref name=\"LindheJ\"/>{{rp|page=1233}}\n\nThe platform between the implant and the abutment can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, the collar of the abutment sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and abutment and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the abutment collar, a narrowed collar on the abutment is used, referred to as [[platform switching]]. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.<ref name=\"Atieh2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Atieh MA, Ibrahim HM, Atieh AH | title = Platform switching for marginal bone preservation around dental implants: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Periodontology | volume = 81 | issue = 10 | pages = 1350\u201366 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20575657 | doi = 10.1902/jop.2010.100232 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7e4fdbd3a4cccd623b02af4a565842de6a478c5f }}</ref>\n\nRegardless of the abutment material or technique, an impression of the abutment is then taken and a crown secured to the abutment with dental cement.

Secondary stability is different from the initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant ([[osseointegration]]). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3\u20134 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead to failure.\n\n====Immediate post-operative risks====\n# Infection (pre-op antibiotics reduce the risk of implant failure by 33 percent but do not affect the risk of infection).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Esposito|first=Marco|last2=Grusovin|first2=Maria Gabriella|last3=Worthington|first3=Helen V.|date=2013-07-31|title=Interventions for replacing missing teeth: antibiotics at dental implant placement to prevent complications|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD004152|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004152.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6786879|pmid=23904048}}</ref>\n# Excessive bleeding<ref name=\"Branemark1992\"/>{{rp|page=68}}\n# Flap breakdown (less-than 5 percent)<ref name=\"Branemark1992\"/>{{rp|page=68}}\n\n====Failure to integrate====\nAn implant is tested between 8 and 24 weeks to determine if it is integrated.

Immediate loading implants may have a higher rate of failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including [[smoking]] or drug use.\n\n===Long term===\nThe long-term complications that result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of the patient and the technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to [[biomechanics|biomechanical factors]], where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor [[crown-to-root ratio]]). Similarly, [[bruxism|grinding of the teeth]], lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk.<ref name=\"Renouard\" /> {{rp|pages=27\u201351}}  Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.<ref name=\"Renouard\">{{cite book | title=Risk Factors in Implant Dentistry: Simplified Clinical Analysis for Predictable Treatment | publisher=Quintessence International | last = Renouard | first = Frank | name-list-format = vanc | year=1999 | location=Paris, France | isbn=978-0867153552}}</ref>{{rp|pages=27\u201351}}\n\nFrom these theoretical risks, derive the real world complications. Long-term failures are due to either loss of bone around the tooth and/or gingiva due to [[peri-implantitis]] or a mechanical failure of the implant. Because there is no [[dental enamel]] on an implant, it does not fail due to [[dental caries|cavities]] like natural teeth. While large-scale, long-term studies are scarce, several systematic reviews estimate the long-term (five to ten years) survival of dental implants at 93&ndash;98 percent depending on their clinical use.<ref name=\"main1\" /><ref name=\"main2\" /><ref name=\"main3\" /> During initial development of implant retained teeth, all crowns were attached to the teeth with screws, but more recent advancements have allowed placement of crowns on the abutments with dental cement (akin to placing a crown on a tooth). This has created the potential for cement, that escapes from under the crown during cementation to get caught in the gingiva and create a peri-implantitis (see picture below). While the complication can occur, there does not appear to be any additional [[peri-implantitis]] in cement-retained crowns compared to screw-retained crowns overall.<ref name=\"debrandao\">{{cite journal | vauthors = de Brand\u00e3o ML, Vettore MV, Vidigal J\u00fanior GM | title = Peri-implant bone loss in cement- and screw-retained prostheses: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Clinical Periodontology | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 287\u201395 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23297703 | doi = 10.1111/jcpe.12041 }}</ref>\nIn compound implants (two stage implants), between the actual implant and the superstructure (abutment) are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity.

The most commonly cited criteria for success are function of at least five years in the absence of pain, mobility, radiographic lucency and  peri-implant bone loss of greater than 1.5&nbsp;mm  on the implant, the lack of suppuration or bleeding in the soft tissues and occurrence of technical complications/prosthetic maintenance, adequate function, and esthetics in the prosthetic.

Within the root form type of implant, there are roughly 18 variants, all made of [[titanium]] but with different shapes and surface textures. There is limited evidence showing that implants with relatively smooth surfaces are less prone to peri-implantitis than implants with rougher surfaces and no evidence showing that any particular type of dental implant has superior long-term success.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Esposito M, Ardebili Y, Worthington HV | title = Interventions for replacing missing teeth: different types of dental implants | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 7 | pages = CD003815 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25048469 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003815.pub4 }}</ref>\n\n# [[Zygoma]] implant; a long implant that can anchor to the [[zygoma|cheek bone]] by passing through the [[maxillary sinus]] to retain a complete upper denture when bone is absent.

The number of [[drug offender]]s in state prisons declined by 12,400 over this period. Furthermore, while the number of sentenced violent offenders in state prison increased from 2000 through 2008, the expected length of stays for these offenders declined slightly during this period.<ref name=prisonersin2009 />\n\nMandatory sentencing for nonviolent crime can lead to life sentences. In 2013, ''The Week'' reported that at least 3,278 Americans were serving life sentences without parole for nonviolent crimes, including \"cursing at a policeman and selling $10 worth of drugs. More than 80 percent of these life sentences are the result of mandatory sentencing laws.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=News brief|date=6 December 2013|work=The Week|access-date=|page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, about 200,000, under 16%, of the 1.3 million people in state jails, were serving time for drug offenses. 700,000 were incarcerated for violent offenses.<ref name=\"wsj170128\" />\n\nViolent crime was not responsible for the quadrupling of the incarcerated population in the United States from 1980 to 2003. Violent crime rates had been relatively constant or declining over those decades. The prison population was increased primarily by public policy changes causing more prison sentences and lengthening time served, for example through mandatory minimum sentencing, \"three strikes\" laws, and reductions in the availability of parole or early release. 49% of sentenced state inmates were held for violent offenses.\n\n{{Main|War on Drugs}}Perhaps the single greatest force behind the growth of the prison population has been the national \"[[War on Drugs]]\". The War on Drugs initiative expanded during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. During Reagan's term, a bi-partisan Congress established the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]], galvanized by the death of [[Len Bias]]. According to the [[Human Rights Watch]], legislation like this led to the extreme increase in drug offense imprisonment and \"increasing racial disproportions among the arrestees\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/usa/Rcedrg00-05.htm|title=United States - Punishment and Prejudice: Racial Disparities in the War on Drugs|website=www.hrw.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref> The number of incarcerated drug offenders has increased twelvefold since 1980.

This is most likely explained by the older average age of those released with the longest sentences, and the study shows a strong negative correlation between recidivism and age upon release. According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], a study was conducted that tracked 404,638 prisoners in 30 states after their release from prison in 2005.

The federal government's [[Bureau of Prisons]] uses a numbered scale from one to five to represent the security level. Level five is the most secure, while level one is the least. State prison systems operate similar systems. California, for example, classifies its facilities from Reception Center through Levels I to V (minimum to maximum security) to specialized high security units (all considered Level V) including [[Security Housing Unit]] (SHU)\u2014California's version of [[supermax]]\u2014and related units. As a general rule, county jails, detention centers, and reception centers, where new commitments are first held while either awaiting trial or before being transferred to \"mainline\" institutions to serve out their sentences, operate at a relatively high level of security, usually close security or higher.\n\n'''[[Supermax prison]]''' facilities provide the highest level of prison security. These units hold those considered the most dangerous inmates, as well as inmates that have been deemed too high-profile or too great a national security risk for a normal prison. These include inmates who have committed assaults, murders, or other serious violations in less secure facilities, and inmates known to be or accused of being [[prison gang]] members. Most states have either a supermax section of a prison facility or an entire prison facility designated as a supermax. The [[United States Federal Bureau of Prisons]] operates a federal supermax, [[ADX Florence|A.D.X. Florence]], located in [[Florence, Colorado]], also known as the \"[[Alcatraz]] of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]\" and widely considered to be perhaps the most secure prison in the United States. A.D.X. Florence has a standard supermax section where assaultive, violent, and gang-related inmates are kept under normal supermax conditions of 23-hour confinement and abridged amenities. A.D.X. Florence is considered to be of a security level above that of all other prisons in the United States, at least in the \"ideological\" ultramax part of it, which features permanent, 24-hour [[solitary confinement]] with rare human contacts or opportunity to earn better conditions through good behavior.\n\nIn a '''maximum security''' prison or area (called '''high security''' in the federal system), all prisoners have individual cells<ref name=\"What Do Security Levels Means?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/journal/injustice/Security.html|title=What Do Security Levels Means|publisher=Injustice Security|language=English|accessdate=28 August 2016}}</ref> with sliding doors controlled from a secure remote control station. Prisoners are allowed out of their cells one out of twenty four hours (one hour and 30&nbsp;minutes for prisoners in California). When out of their cells, prisoners remain in the cell block or an exterior cage. Movement out of the cell block or \"pod\" is tightly restricted using restraints and escorts by correctional officers.\n[[File:US Incarceration Rates in 2016.svg|thumb|U.S. state prisoner distribution{{dubious|date=December 2019}}<!-- This looks like it could be incarceration rate for people *from* each state rather than the population of federal prisons *in* each state?

Each cell has its own toilet and sink. Inmates may leave their cells for work assignments or correctional programs and otherwise may be allowed in a common area in the cellblock or an exercise yard. The fences are generally double fences with watchtowers housing armed guards, plus often a third, lethal-current electric fence in the middle.\n\nPrisoners that fall into the '''medium security''' group may sleep in cells, but share them two and two, and use bunk beds<ref name=\"What Do Security Levels Means?\"/> with lockers to store their possessions. Depending upon the facility, each cell may have showers, toilets and sinks Cells are locked at night with one or more correctional officers supervising. There is less supervision over the internal movements of prisoners. The perimeter is generally double fenced and regularly patrolled.\n\nPrisoners in '''minimum security''' facilities are considered to pose little physical risk to the public and are mainly non-violent \"[[white collar crime|white collar criminals]]\". Minimum security prisoners live in less-secure dormitories,<ref name=\"What Do Security Levels Means?\"/> which are regularly patrolled by correctional officers. As in medium security facilities, they have communal showers, toilets, and sinks. A minimum-security facility generally has a single fence that is watched, but not patrolled, by armed guards. At facilities in very remote and rural areas, there may be no fence at all. Prisoners may often work on community projects, such as roadside litter cleanup with the state department of transportation or wilderness conservation. Many minimum security facilities are small camps located in or near military bases, larger prisons (outside the security perimeter) or other government institutions to provide a convenient supply of convict labor to the institution. Many states allow persons in minimum-security facilities access to the Internet.\n\n===Correspondence===\nResearch indicates that inmates who maintain contact with family and friends in the outside world are less likely to be convicted of further crimes and usually have an easier reintegration period back into society.<ref>diZerega, M., & Agudelo, S.

Most [[Department of Corrections]] websites provide detailed information regarding mail policies. These rules can even vary within a single prison depending on which part of the prison an inmate is housed.

The data from this study suggested that the privately run prisons operated more cost-effectively without sacrificing the safety of inmates and staff. The study concluded that both privately run prisons had a lower cost per inmate, a lower rate of critical incidents, a safer environment for employees and inmates, and a higher proportional rate of inmates who completed basic education, literacy, and vocational training courses. However, the publicly run prison outperformed the privately run prisons in areas such as experiencing fewer escape attempts, controlling substance abuse through testing, offering a wider range of educational and vocational courses, and providing a broader range of treatment, recreation, social services, and rehabilitative services.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Archambeault|first=William G.|author2=Donald R.

Re-entry is not relevant if a parent is not arrested for other crimes. During each of these phases, solutions can be implemented that mitigate the harm placed on the children during the process. While their parents are away, children rely on other caretakers (family or friends) to satisfy their basic need. Solutions for the children of incarcerated parents have identified caretakers as a focal point for successful intervention.\n\n=====Arrest phase=====\n[[File:Secret Service agent trainees practice executing a search warrant.jpg|thumb|Forced home entry is a primary stressor for children in a residence.]]\nOne in five children witness their parent arrested by authorities, and a study interviewing 30 children reported that the children experienced [[flashbulb memories]] and [[nightmare]]<nowiki/>s associated with the day their parent was arrested.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Children of incarcerated parents|date=1995|publisher=Lexington Books|others=Gabel, Katherine., Johnston, Denise, 1947-|isbn=978-0029110423|location=New York|oclc=31739788}}</ref> These single, adverse moments have long-reaching effects and policymakers around the country have attempted to ameliorate the situation. For example, the city of [[San Francisco]] in 2005 implemented training policies for its police officers with the goal of making them more cognizant of the familial situation before entering the home. The guidelines go a step further and stipulate that if no information is available before the arrest, that officers ask the suspect about the possibility of any children in the house.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/53721/2000256-Children-of-Incarcerated-Parents-Framework-Document.pdf|title=Children of Incarcerated Parents Framework Document|last=Peterson|first=Bryce|date=June 2015|website=Urban Institute|access-date=October 2, 2018}}</ref> San Francisco is not alone: [[New Mexico]] passed a law in 2009 advocating for child safety during parental arrest and [[California]] provides funding to agencies to train personnel how to appropriately conduct an arrest in the presence of family members.<ref>N.M.

Consideration of the sentencing effects on the defendant's children could help with the preservation of the parent-child relationship. In a law passed in 2014, [[Oklahoma]] requires judges to inquire if convicted individuals are single custodial parents, and if so, authorize the mobility of important resources so the child's transition to different circumstances is monitored.<ref>Okla. Stat. tit. 22, \u00a722-20</ref> The distance that the jail or prison is from the arrested individual's home is a contributing factor to the parent-child relationship. Allowing a parent to serve their sentence closer to their residence will allow for easier visitation and a healthier relationship. Recognizing this, the New York Senate passed a bill in 2015 that would ensure convicted individuals be jailed in the nearest facility.\n\n=====Incarceration phase=====\nWhile serving a sentence, measures have been put in place to allow parents to exercise their duty as role models and caretakers. The state of [[New York (state)]] allows newborns to be with their mothers for up to one year.<ref>N.Y. Corrections Law \u00a7611</ref> Studies have shown that parental, specifically maternal, presence during a newborn's early development are crucial to both physical and cognitive development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Winston|first=Robert|last2=Chicot|first2=Rebecca|date=2016|title=The importance of early bonding on the long-term mental health and resilience of children|journal=London Journal of Primary Care|volume=8|issue=1|pages=12\u201314|doi=10.1080/17571472.2015.1133012|issn=1757-1472|pmc=5330336|pmid=28250823}}</ref> [[Ohio]] law requires nursery support for pregnant inmates in its facilities.<ref>Ohio Rev.

Of the four outlined phases, re-entry is the least emphasized from a public policy perspective. This is not to say it is the least important, however, as there are concerns that time in a correctional facility can deteriorate the caretaking ability of some prisoners. As a result, Oklahoma has taken measurable strides by providing parents with the tools they need to re-enter their families, including classes on parenting skills.<ref>2007 Okla. Sess.

Depending on the relationship to the caregiver, the transition to a new household may not be easy for the child.

The federal government funds  states to provide counseling to caretaking family members to alleviate some of the associated emotional burden. A more comprehensive program from [[Washington (state)]] employs \"kinship navigators\" to address caretakers' needs with initiatives such as parental classes and connections to legal services.

Devah Pager performed a study in 2003 and found that white males with no criminal record had a 34% chance of callback compared to 17% for white males with a criminal record. Black males with no criminal record were called back at a rate of 14% while the rate dropped to 5% for those with a criminal record. Black men with no criminal background have a harder time finding employment than white men who have a history of criminal activity. While having a criminal record decreases the chance of a callback for white men by 50%, it decreases the callback chances for black men by 64%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile Pager's study is greatly informative, it does lack some valuable information. Pager only studied white and black males, which leaves out women and people of other races. It also fails to account for the fact that applying for jobs has largely shifted from applying in person to applying over the Internet. A study done by Scott H. Decker, Cassia Spohn, Natalie R. Ortiz, and Eric Hedberg from Arizona State University in 2014 accounts for this missing information. This study was set up similarly to the Pager study, but with the addition of female job applicants, Hispanic job applicants, and online job applications.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/244756.pdf|title=Criminal Stigma, Race, Gender, and Employment: An Expanded Assessment of the Consequences of Imprisonment for Employment|last=Decker|first=Scott|last2=Spohn|first2=Cassia|last3=Ortiz|first3=Natalie|last4=Hedberg|first4=Eric|publisher=National Institute of Justice|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Men and women of white, black, and Hispanic ethnicities account for 92% of the US prison population.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p13.pdf|title=Prisoners in 2013|last=Carson|first=E.

For females submitting applications online and in-person, regardless of criminal history, white women received the most callbacks, roughly 40%. Hispanic women followed up with a 34% callback rate. Black women had the lowest rate at 27%. The effects of incarceration on female applicants in general were that females with a prison record were less likely to receive a callback compared to females without a prison record. The significant exceptions are white women applying in person and Hispanic women with a community college degree applying online{{clarify|date=December 2019|reason=Does not explain how the exception affects these groups|text=}}.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFor males submitting applications online and in-person, regardless of criminal history, Hispanic males received the most callbacks, roughly 38%. White males followed up with a 35% callback rate. Black males had the lowest rate at 27%. The effects of incarceration on male applicants applying in-person was that males with a prison record were less likely than males without a prison record to receive a callback. However, the effects of incarceration on male applicants applying online were nearly nonexistent. In fact, the study found that \"there was no effect of race/ethnicity, prison record, or community college [education] on men's success in advancing through the [online] hiring process\". The Arizona State University study also had results that contradicted Pager's study. It found that white males with a prison record did not have a higher callback rate than black males (and Hispanic males) without a prison record. Hispanic men without a prison record had a 40% higher callback rate than white males with a prison record, and black men without a prison record had a 6% higher callback rate than white males without a prison record.<ref name=\":2\" /> Given that there is an 11 year gap between these studies, this discrepancy may be due to the social and demographic changes over time, rather than flaws in Pager's study.\n\n===Proposed solutions===\nMass incarceration cannot be remedied in a short length of time, because each prisoner serves a separate sentence, the average length of sentences has risen over the last 35 years and public support for [[prison reform]] is still relatively low. Decriminalizing drugs has been suggested by libertarians and advocated for by socialists, but remains a remote political option. Additional parole and probation can be facilitated with enhanced electronic monitoring, though monitoring is expensive. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld prisoner releases to relieve California's unconstitutional prison conditions in ''Brown v. Plata,'' long-standing litigation wherein the federal courts intervened as they have done in most states through the years.\n\nThere is also the [[Prison abolition movement]] which calls for the immediate elimination and reduction of both public and private prisons. [[Angela Davis]] is a popular advocate for the prison abolition movement and has outlined how organizations like [[G4S]], the third largest private corporation just behind McDonald's and Foxconn, make a huge profit from privatized prisons across the globe. Socialists have been a major advocate for abolition of prisons and argues that capitalism has led to the creation of prisons as well as mass-incarceration by pointing to G4S which profits from locking up other people behind bars and segregating lands in other countries, as well as enforcing borders and deporting immigrants.

By presenting the negative implications of mass incarceration in a way that is widespread throughout popular culture, [[rap music]] is more likely to impact younger generations than a book or scholarly article would.

According to Garza, \"Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.  It is an affirmation of Black folks' contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.\" This movement has focused on specific racial issues faced by African Americans in the justice system including police brutality, ending capital punishment, and eliminating \"the criminalization and dehumanization of Black youth across all areas of society.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/|title=A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza|last=Garza|first=Alicia|date=October 7, 2014|website=The Feminist Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009121354/http://thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/|archive-date=2014-10-09|url-status=dead|access-date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Federal prisons==\n{{Further|List of U.S. federal prisons}}\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], a division of the [[United States Department of Justice]], is responsible for the administration of United States federal prisons.\n\n==States and insular areas==\n{{Main|List of United States state correction agencies}}\n\nImprisonment by the state judicial systems has steadily diminished since 2006 to 2012, from 689,536 annually to 553,843 annually.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Kevin | last=Johnson | title=Toughness on Crime gradually gives way to fairness | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/30/tough-crime-fairness-cost/6836605/| work= | newspaper=USA Today | location=| pages= 1B, 2B | date=March 31, 2014 | id= | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Capital punishment in the United States]]\n* [[Death in custody]]\n* [[History of United States Prison Systems]]\n* [[Religion in United States prisons]]\n* [[Prison gangs in the United States]]\n* [[Prisoner rights in the United States]]\n* [[Prisoner suicide]]\n* [[Social groups in male and female prisons in the United States]]\n* [[United States incarceration rate]]\n;Administration\n* [[Federal Prison Industries, Inc.]]\n* [[Inmate telephone system]]\n\n;Conditions of confinement\n* [[Prison Legal News]]\n\n;Controversies\n* [[Kids for cash scandal]]\n\n;Prison advocacy groups\n* [[November Coalition]]\n* [[Prison Policy Initiative]]\n\n;Related\n* [[Parole in the United States]]\n* [[Crime in the United States]]\n* [[United States cities by crime rate]]\n* [[Law enforcement in the United States]]\n* [[List of detention sites in the United States]]\n* [[Penal labor in the United States]]\n* [[Civilian noninstitutional population]]\n* [[Felony disenfranchisement in the United States]]\n* [[Human rights in the United States#Prison system]]\n* [[Race in the United States criminal justice system]]\n* [[Race and the War on Drugs]]\n* [[Race and crime]]\n* [[Racial profiling in the United States]]\n\n;By state\n* [[Prisons in California]]\n* [[List of Florida state prisons]]\n* [[Incarceration in Florida]]<!--I think the incarceration template should point to these, rather than \"Department of corrections\" which are the result of incarceration rather than the other way around--->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Sister project links}}\n\n===Books===\n* [[Michelle Alexander|Alexander, Michelle]] (2012).

The number of [[drug offender]]s in state prisons declined by 12,400 over this period. Furthermore, while the number of sentenced violent offenders in state prison increased from 2000 through 2008, the expected length of stays for these offenders declined slightly during this period.<ref name=prisonersin2009 />\n\nMandatory sentencing for nonviolent crime can lead to life sentences. In 2013, ''The Week'' reported that at least 3,278 Americans were serving life sentences without parole for nonviolent crimes, including \"cursing at a policeman and selling $10 worth of drugs. More than 80 percent of these life sentences are the result of mandatory sentencing laws.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=News brief|date=6 December 2013|work=The Week|access-date=|page=16}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, about 200,000, under 16%, of the 1.3 million people in state jails, were serving time for drug offenses. 700,000 were incarcerated for violent offenses.<ref name=\"wsj170128\" />\n\nViolent crime was not responsible for the quadrupling of the incarcerated population in the United States from 1980 to 2003. Violent crime rates had been relatively constant or declining over those decades. The prison population was increased primarily by public policy changes causing more prison sentences and lengthening time served, for example through mandatory minimum sentencing, \"three strikes\" laws, and reductions in the availability of parole or early release. 49% of sentenced state inmates were held for violent offenses.\n\n{{Main|War on Drugs}}Perhaps the single greatest force behind the growth of the prison population has been the national \"[[War on Drugs]]\". The War on Drugs initiative expanded during the presidency of Ronald Reagan. During Reagan's term, a bi-partisan Congress established the [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986]], galvanized by the death of [[Len Bias]]. According to the [[Human Rights Watch]], legislation like this led to the extreme increase in drug offense imprisonment and \"increasing racial disproportions among the arrestees\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/2000/usa/Rcedrg00-05.htm|title=United States - Punishment and Prejudice: Racial Disparities in the War on Drugs|website=www.hrw.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref> The number of incarcerated drug offenders has increased twelvefold since 1980.

This is most likely explained by the older average age of those released with the longest sentences, and the study shows a strong negative correlation between recidivism and age upon release. According to the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], a study was conducted that tracked 404,638 prisoners in 30 states after their release from prison in 2005. From the examination it was found that within three years after their release 67.8% of the released prisoners were rearrested; within five years, 76.6% of the released prisoners were rearrested, and of the prisoners that were rearrested 56.7% of them were rearrested by the end of their first year of release.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Durose|first=Matthew|date=April 2014|title=Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 30 States in 2005: Patterns from 2005 to 2010|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rprts05p0510.pdf|journal=Bureau of Justice Statistics|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison with other countries===\n[[File:Prisoners world map png2.png|thumb|350px|A map of incarceration rates by country<ref name=WorldPrisonBrief/>]]\n{{Main|Comparison of United States incarceration rate with other countries}}\n{{See also|List of countries by incarceration rate}}\n\nWith around 100 prisoners per 100,000, the United States had an average prison and jail population until 1980.

The federal government's [[Bureau of Prisons]] uses a numbered scale from one to five to represent the security level. Level five is the most secure, while level one is the least. State prison systems operate similar systems. California, for example, classifies its facilities from Reception Center through Levels I to V (minimum to maximum security) to specialized high security units (all considered Level V) including [[Security Housing Unit]] (SHU)\u2014California's version of [[supermax]]\u2014and related units. As a general rule, county jails, detention centers, and reception centers, where new commitments are first held while either awaiting trial or before being transferred to \"mainline\" institutions to serve out their sentences, operate at a relatively high level of security, usually close security or higher.\n\n'''[[Supermax prison]]''' facilities provide the highest level of prison security. These units hold those considered the most dangerous inmates, as well as inmates that have been deemed too high-profile or too great a national security risk for a normal prison. These include inmates who have committed assaults, murders, or other serious violations in less secure facilities, and inmates known to be or accused of being [[prison gang]] members. Most states have either a supermax section of a prison facility or an entire prison facility designated as a supermax. The [[United States Federal Bureau of Prisons]] operates a federal supermax, [[ADX Florence|A.D.X. Florence]], located in [[Florence, Colorado]], also known as the \"[[Alcatraz]] of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]\" and widely considered to be perhaps the most secure prison in the United States. A.D.X. Florence has a standard supermax section where assaultive, violent, and gang-related inmates are kept under normal supermax conditions of 23-hour confinement and abridged amenities. A.D.X. Florence is considered to be of a security level above that of all other prisons in the United States, at least in the \"ideological\" ultramax part of it, which features permanent, 24-hour [[solitary confinement]] with rare human contacts or opportunity to earn better conditions through good behavior.\n\nIn a '''maximum security''' prison or area (called '''high security''' in the federal system), all prisoners have individual cells<ref name=\"What Do Security Levels Means?\">{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/journal/injustice/Security.html|title=What Do Security Levels Means|publisher=Injustice Security|language=English|accessdate=28 August 2016}}</ref> with sliding doors controlled from a secure remote control station. Prisoners are allowed out of their cells one out of twenty four hours (one hour and 30&nbsp;minutes for prisoners in California). When out of their cells, prisoners remain in the cell block or an exterior cage. Movement out of the cell block or \"pod\" is tightly restricted using restraints and escorts by correctional officers.\n[[File:US Incarceration Rates in 2016.svg|thumb|U.S. state prisoner distribution{{dubious|date=December 2019}}<!-- This looks like it could be incarceration rate for people *from* each state rather than the population of federal prisons *in* each state?

Each cell has its own toilet and sink. Inmates may leave their cells for work assignments or correctional programs and otherwise may be allowed in a common area in the cellblock or an exercise yard. The fences are generally double fences with watchtowers housing armed guards, plus often a third, lethal-current electric fence in the middle.\n\nPrisoners that fall into the '''medium security''' group may sleep in cells, but share them two and two, and use bunk beds<ref name=\"What Do Security Levels Means?\"/> with lockers to store their possessions. Depending upon the facility, each cell may have showers, toilets and sinks Cells are locked at night with one or more correctional officers supervising. There is less supervision over the internal movements of prisoners. The perimeter is generally double fenced and regularly patrolled.\n\nPrisoners in '''minimum security''' facilities are considered to pose little physical risk to the public and are mainly non-violent \"[[white collar crime|white collar criminals]]\". Minimum security prisoners live in less-secure dormitories,<ref name=\"What Do Security Levels Means?\"/> which are regularly patrolled by correctional officers. As in medium security facilities, they have communal showers, toilets, and sinks. A minimum-security facility generally has a single fence that is watched, but not patrolled, by armed guards. At facilities in very remote and rural areas, there may be no fence at all. Prisoners may often work on community projects, such as roadside litter cleanup with the state department of transportation or wilderness conservation. Many minimum security facilities are small camps located in or near military bases, larger prisons (outside the security perimeter) or other government institutions to provide a convenient supply of convict labor to the institution. Many states allow persons in minimum-security facilities access to the Internet.\n\n===Correspondence===\nResearch indicates that inmates who maintain contact with family and friends in the outside world are less likely to be convicted of further crimes and usually have an easier reintegration period back into society.<ref>diZerega, M., & Agudelo, S.

Most [[Department of Corrections]] websites provide detailed information regarding mail policies. These rules can even vary within a single prison depending on which part of the prison an inmate is housed.

The data from this study suggested that the privately run prisons operated more cost-effectively without sacrificing the safety of inmates and staff. The study concluded that both privately run prisons had a lower cost per inmate, a lower rate of critical incidents, a safer environment for employees and inmates, and a higher proportional rate of inmates who completed basic education, literacy, and vocational training courses. However, the publicly run prison outperformed the privately run prisons in areas such as experiencing fewer escape attempts, controlling substance abuse through testing, offering a wider range of educational and vocational courses, and providing a broader range of treatment, recreation, social services, and rehabilitative services.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Archambeault|first=William G.|author2=Donald R.

For example, Lee et al. showed significant correlation between high [[cholesterol]], [[Migraine]], and [[HIV/AIDS]] diagnosis to children with a parental incarceration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Rosalyn D.|last2=Fang|first2=Xiangming|last3=Luo|first3=Feijun|date=April 2013|title=The impact of parental incarceration on the physical and mental health of young adults|journal=Pediatrics|volume=131|issue=4|pages=e1188\u20131195|doi=10.1542/peds.2012-0627|issn=1098-4275|pmc=3608482|pmid=23509174}}</ref> &nbsp;Even while adjusting for various socioeconomic and racial factors, children with an incarcerated parent have a significantly higher chance of developing a wide variety of physical problems such as [[Obesity]], [[asthma]], and developmental delays.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turney|first=Kristin|date=September 2014|title=Stress proliferation across generations?

Though most of the adverse effects that result from parental incarceration are regardless of whether the mother or father was arrested, some differences have been discovered. For example, males whose father have been incarcerated display more behavioral issues than any other combination of parent/child.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThere has also been a substantial effort to understand how this traumatic experience manifests in the child's mental health and to identify externalizations that may be helpful for a diagnosis. The most prominent mental health outcomes in these children are [[Anxiety disorder]], [[Depression (mood)]], and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]](PTSD).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Joseph|last2=Murray|first2=Lynne|date=July 2010|title=Parental incarceration, attachment and child psychopathology|journal=Attachment & Human Development|volume=12|issue=4|pages=289\u2013309|doi=10.1080/14751790903416889|issn=1469-2988|pmid=20582842}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poehlmann|first=Julie|date=September 2005|title=Incarcerated mothers' contact with children, perceived family relationships, and depressive symptoms|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|volume=19|issue=3|pages=350\u2013357|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.19.3.350|issn=0893-3200|pmid=16221015}}</ref>&nbsp;These problems worsen in a typical [[positive feedback]] loop without the presence of a parental figure.

Re-entry is not relevant if a parent is not arrested for other crimes. During each of these phases, solutions can be implemented that mitigate the harm placed on the children during the process. While their parents are away, children rely on other caretakers (family or friends) to satisfy their basic need. Solutions for the children of incarcerated parents have identified caretakers as a focal point for successful intervention.\n\n=====Arrest phase=====\n[[File:Secret Service agent trainees practice executing a search warrant.jpg|thumb|Forced home entry is a primary stressor for children in a residence.]]\nOne in five children witness their parent arrested by authorities, and a study interviewing 30 children reported that the children experienced [[flashbulb memories]] and [[nightmare]]<nowiki/>s associated with the day their parent was arrested.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Children of incarcerated parents|date=1995|publisher=Lexington Books|others=Gabel, Katherine., Johnston, Denise, 1947-|isbn=978-0029110423|location=New York|oclc=31739788}}</ref> These single, adverse moments have long-reaching effects and policymakers around the country have attempted to ameliorate the situation. For example, the city of [[San Francisco]] in 2005 implemented training policies for its police officers with the goal of making them more cognizant of the familial situation before entering the home. The guidelines go a step further and stipulate that if no information is available before the arrest, that officers ask the suspect about the possibility of any children in the house.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/53721/2000256-Children-of-Incarcerated-Parents-Framework-Document.pdf|title=Children of Incarcerated Parents Framework Document|last=Peterson|first=Bryce|date=June 2015|website=Urban Institute|access-date=October 2, 2018}}</ref> San Francisco is not alone: [[New Mexico]] passed a law in 2009 advocating for child safety during parental arrest and [[California]] provides funding to agencies to train personnel how to appropriately conduct an arrest in the presence of family members.<ref>N.M.

Consideration of the sentencing effects on the defendant's children could help with the preservation of the parent-child relationship. In a law passed in 2014, [[Oklahoma]] requires judges to inquire if convicted individuals are single custodial parents, and if so, authorize the mobility of important resources so the child's transition to different circumstances is monitored.<ref>Okla. Stat. tit. 22, \u00a722-20</ref> The distance that the jail or prison is from the arrested individual's home is a contributing factor to the parent-child relationship. Allowing a parent to serve their sentence closer to their residence will allow for easier visitation and a healthier relationship. Recognizing this, the New York Senate passed a bill in 2015 that would ensure convicted individuals be jailed in the nearest facility.\n\n=====Incarceration phase=====\nWhile serving a sentence, measures have been put in place to allow parents to exercise their duty as role models and caretakers. The state of [[New York (state)]] allows newborns to be with their mothers for up to one year.<ref>N.Y. Corrections Law \u00a7611</ref> Studies have shown that parental, specifically maternal, presence during a newborn's early development are crucial to both physical and cognitive development.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Winston|first=Robert|last2=Chicot|first2=Rebecca|date=2016|title=The importance of early bonding on the long-term mental health and resilience of children|journal=London Journal of Primary Care|volume=8|issue=1|pages=12\u201314|doi=10.1080/17571472.2015.1133012|issn=1757-1472|pmc=5330336|pmid=28250823}}</ref> [[Ohio]] law requires nursery support for pregnant inmates in its facilities.<ref>Ohio Rev.

Though the time away is painful for the family, it does not always welcome back the previously incarcerated individual with open arms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Naser|first=Rebecca L.|last2=La Vigne|first2=Nancy G.|date=March 2006|title=Family Support in the Prisoner Reentry Process|journal=Journal of Offender Rehabilitation|volume=43|issue=1|pages=93\u2013106|doi=10.1300/j076v43n01_05|issn=1050-9674}}</ref> Not only is the transition into the family difficult, but also into society as they are faced with establishing secure housing, insurance, and a new job.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Serin|first=Ralph C.|last2=Lloyd|first2=Caleb D.|last3=Hanby|first3=Laura J.|date=August 2010|title=Enhancing Offender Re-Entry an Integrated Model for Enhancing Offender Re-Entry|journal=European Journal of Probation|volume=2|issue=2|pages=53\u201375|doi=10.1177/206622031000200205|issn=2066-2203}}</ref> &nbsp;As such, policymakers find it necessary to ease the transition of an incarcerated individual to the pre-arrest situation. Of the four outlined phases, re-entry is the least emphasized from a public policy perspective. This is not to say it is the least important, however, as there are concerns that time in a correctional facility can deteriorate the caretaking ability of some prisoners. As a result, Oklahoma has taken measurable strides by providing parents with the tools they need to re-enter their families, including classes on parenting skills.<ref>2007 Okla. Sess. Laws, Chap. 274</ref>\n\n===== Caretakers =====\n[[File:Grandmother and grandchild.jpg|thumb|159x159px|Grandmothers are a common caregiver of children with an incarcerated parent]]\nThough the effects on caregivers of these children vary based on factors such as the relationship to the prisoner and his or her support system, it is well known that it is a financial and emotional burden to take care of a child.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.2012.00283.x|title = The Collateral Consequences of Incarceration Revisited: A Qualitative Analysis of the Effects on Caregivers of Children of Incarcerated Parents| journal=Criminology| volume=50| issue=4| pages=913\u2013959|year = 2012|last1 = Turanovic|first1 = Jillian J.| last2=Rodriguez| first2=Nancy| last3=Pratt| first3=Travis C.}}</ref> In addition to taking care of their [[nuclear family]], caregivers are now responsible for another individual who requires attention and resources to flourish. Depending on the relationship to the caregiver, the transition to a new household may not be easy for the child. The rationale behind targeting caregivers for intervention policies is to ensure the new environment for the children is healthy and productive. The federal government funds  states to provide counseling to caretaking family members to alleviate some of the associated emotional burden. A more comprehensive program from [[Washington (state)]] employs \"kinship navigators\" to address caretakers' needs with initiatives such as parental classes and connections to legal services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2016/05/24/having-a-parent-behind-bars-costs-children-states|title=Having a Parent Behind Bars Costs Children, States|website=www.pewtrusts.org|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref>\n\n=== Effects on employment ===\nFelony records greatly influence the chances of people finding employment.

Devah Pager performed a study in 2003 and found that white males with no criminal record had a 34% chance of callback compared to 17% for white males with a criminal record. Black males with no criminal record were called back at a rate of 14% while the rate dropped to 5% for those with a criminal record. Black men with no criminal background have a harder time finding employment than white men who have a history of criminal activity. While having a criminal record decreases the chance of a callback for white men by 50%, it decreases the callback chances for black men by 64%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWhile Pager's study is greatly informative, it does lack some valuable information. Pager only studied white and black males, which leaves out women and people of other races. It also fails to account for the fact that applying for jobs has largely shifted from applying in person to applying over the Internet. A study done by Scott H. Decker, Cassia Spohn, Natalie R. Ortiz, and Eric Hedberg from Arizona State University in 2014 accounts for this missing information. This study was set up similarly to the Pager study, but with the addition of female job applicants, Hispanic job applicants, and online job applications.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/244756.pdf|title=Criminal Stigma, Race, Gender, and Employment: An Expanded Assessment of the Consequences of Imprisonment for Employment|last=Decker|first=Scott|last2=Spohn|first2=Cassia|last3=Ortiz|first3=Natalie|last4=Hedberg|first4=Eric|publisher=National Institute of Justice|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Men and women of white, black, and Hispanic ethnicities account for 92% of the US prison population.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p13.pdf|title=Prisoners in 2013|last=Carson|first=E.

For females submitting applications online and in-person, regardless of criminal history, white women received the most callbacks, roughly 40%. Hispanic women followed up with a 34% callback rate. Black women had the lowest rate at 27%. The effects of incarceration on female applicants in general were that females with a prison record were less likely to receive a callback compared to females without a prison record. The significant exceptions are white women applying in person and Hispanic women with a community college degree applying online{{clarify|date=December 2019|reason=Does not explain how the exception affects these groups|text=}}.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFor males submitting applications online and in-person, regardless of criminal history, Hispanic males received the most callbacks, roughly 38%. White males followed up with a 35% callback rate. Black males had the lowest rate at 27%. The effects of incarceration on male applicants applying in-person was that males with a prison record were less likely than males without a prison record to receive a callback. However, the effects of incarceration on male applicants applying online were nearly nonexistent. In fact, the study found that \"there was no effect of race/ethnicity, prison record, or community college [education] on men's success in advancing through the [online] hiring process\". The Arizona State University study also had results that contradicted Pager's study. It found that white males with a prison record did not have a higher callback rate than black males (and Hispanic males) without a prison record. Hispanic men without a prison record had a 40% higher callback rate than white males with a prison record, and black men without a prison record had a 6% higher callback rate than white males without a prison record.<ref name=\":2\" /> Given that there is an 11 year gap between these studies, this discrepancy may be due to the social and demographic changes over time, rather than flaws in Pager's study.\n\n===Proposed solutions===\nMass incarceration cannot be remedied in a short length of time, because each prisoner serves a separate sentence, the average length of sentences has risen over the last 35 years and public support for [[prison reform]] is still relatively low. Decriminalizing drugs has been suggested by libertarians and advocated for by socialists, but remains a remote political option. Additional parole and probation can be facilitated with enhanced electronic monitoring, though monitoring is expensive. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld prisoner releases to relieve California's unconstitutional prison conditions in ''Brown v. Plata,'' long-standing litigation wherein the federal courts intervened as they have done in most states through the years.\n\nThere is also the [[Prison abolition movement]] which calls for the immediate elimination and reduction of both public and private prisons. [[Angela Davis]] is a popular advocate for the prison abolition movement and has outlined how organizations like [[G4S]], the third largest private corporation just behind McDonald's and Foxconn, make a huge profit from privatized prisons across the globe. Socialists have been a major advocate for abolition of prisons and argues that capitalism has led to the creation of prisons as well as mass-incarceration by pointing to G4S which profits from locking up other people behind bars and segregating lands in other countries, as well as enforcing borders and deporting immigrants.

By presenting the negative implications of mass incarceration in a way that is widespread throughout popular culture, [[rap music]] is more likely to impact younger generations than a book or scholarly article would.

According to Garza, \"Black Lives Matter is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.  It is an affirmation of Black folks' contributions to this society, our humanity, and our resilience in the face of deadly oppression.\" This movement has focused on specific racial issues faced by African Americans in the justice system including police brutality, ending capital punishment, and eliminating \"the criminalization and dehumanization of Black youth across all areas of society.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/|title=A Herstory of the #BlackLivesMatter Movement by Alicia Garza|last=Garza|first=Alicia|date=October 7, 2014|website=The Feminist Wire|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009121354/http://thefeministwire.com/2014/10/blacklivesmatter-2/|archive-date=2014-10-09|url-status=dead|access-date=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Federal prisons==\n{{Further|List of U.S. federal prisons}}\nThe [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], a division of the [[United States Department of Justice]], is responsible for the administration of United States federal prisons.\n\n==States and insular areas==\n{{Main|List of United States state correction agencies}}\n\nImprisonment by the state judicial systems has steadily diminished since 2006 to 2012, from 689,536 annually to 553,843 annually.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Kevin | last=Johnson | title=Toughness on Crime gradually gives way to fairness | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/30/tough-crime-fairness-cost/6836605/| work= | newspaper=USA Today | location=| pages= 1B, 2B | date=March 31, 2014 | id= | accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Capital punishment in the United States]]\n* [[Death in custody]]\n* [[History of United States Prison Systems]]\n* [[Religion in United States prisons]]\n* [[Prison gangs in the United States]]\n* [[Prisoner rights in the United States]]\n* [[Prisoner suicide]]\n* [[Social groups in male and female prisons in the United States]]\n* [[United States incarceration rate]]\n;Administration\n* [[Federal Prison Industries, Inc.]]\n* [[Inmate telephone system]]\n\n;Conditions of confinement\n* [[Prison Legal News]]\n\n;Controversies\n* [[Kids for cash scandal]]\n\n;Prison advocacy groups\n* [[November Coalition]]\n* [[Prison Policy Initiative]]\n\n;Related\n* [[Parole in the United States]]\n* [[Crime in the United States]]\n* [[United States cities by crime rate]]\n* [[Law enforcement in the United States]]\n* [[List of detention sites in the United States]]\n* [[Penal labor in the United States]]\n* [[Civilian noninstitutional population]]\n* [[Felony disenfranchisement in the United States]]\n* [[Human rights in the United States#Prison system]]\n* [[Race in the United States criminal justice system]]\n* [[Race and the War on Drugs]]\n* [[Race and crime]]\n* [[Racial profiling in the United States]]\n\n;By state\n* [[Prisons in California]]\n* [[List of Florida state prisons]]\n* [[Incarceration in Florida]]<!--I think the incarceration template should point to these, rather than \"Department of corrections\" which are the result of incarceration rather than the other way around--->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Sister project links}}\n\n===Books===\n* [[Michelle Alexander|Alexander, Michelle]] (2012).

When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

spin-offs|spin-off]] of ''[[The Flintstones]]'' produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]] which aired on [[NBC]] from September 8, 1979 to December 1, 1979.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery

|url=https://archive.org/details/childrenstelevis0000wool/page/108/mode/2up |accessdate=14 March 2020 |page=108}}</ref>\n\nThe series contained the following two segments:\n\n*''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (a revival of ''The Flintstones'') \u2013 one episode, 30 minutes\n*''The Thing'' (based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]) \u2013 two episodes, 11 minutes each\n \nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together two magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing Ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8, [[Ant-Man]] and [[Dragon Man]] give pink-haired rock star turned reluctant superhero Darla Deering her own Thing Rings to summon Ben Grimm's old rocky Thing-bodied [[powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]]
