The child of a poor immigrant family, from the Greek islands of [[Rhodes]] and [[Nisyros]], Galis took up [[boxing]] in his early years, after his father, George Georgalis, who had also been a boxer in his youth. He was later persuaded to give up boxing by his mother, Stella Georgalis, who was terrified after each time that her son would return home from boxing training with a new facial injury. As a result, Galis started playing the sport of basketball instead of boxing. He attended [[Union Hill High School]], in Union City, where he also played high school basketball.<ref name=\"fibaeurope.com\"/>\n\n==College career==\nAfter high school, Galis enrolled at [[Seton Hall University]], where he played [[college basketball]] as a member of the [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]].

Later, while still playing in Greece, he would be offered [[NBA]] contracts by the Celtics and the [[New Jersey Nets]]. However, he turned the offers down, because at the time, and until 1989, [[FIBA]] did not have [[professional sports|professional]] status, and consequently did not allow NBA players to compete at the [[national sports team|national team]] level. Since playing with the senior [[Greek national basketball team|Greek national team]] meant so much to him, he stayed in Greece.

[[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] had also shown some interest in signing the newcomer, but it was Aris' interest that was the most persuasive. His move to the country would eventually help Greek [[sports club|club]] basketball to reach a level of popularity that had never been previously imagined.\n\nAveraging more than 30 points per game every season, Galis was the indisputable leader of Aris. While playing alongside other great players at Aris such as [[Panagiotis Giannakis]] and [[Slobodan Suboti\u0107]] (who was known in Greece as Lefteris Soumpotits), Galis won 8 [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championships (7 of them consecutively, and 3 undefeated, in the years 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991), 6 [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cups]] (4 of them consecutively, in the years 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992), and led Aris to 3 consecutive appearances at the [[EuroLeague|FIBA European Champions' Cup]] (now called EuroLeague) [[EuroLeague Final Four|Final Four]] ([[1988 EuroLeague Final Four|'88]], [[1989 EuroLeague Final Four|'89]], and [[1990 EuroLeague Final Four|'90]]). In the one disappointment of an otherwise glittering career with Aris, all three of the FIBA European Champions' Cup Final Four appearances ended in defeat in the semifinals, thus depriving Galis of the opportunity to shine all the way on Europe's biggest club stage, at the [[EuroLeague Finals|FIBA European Champions' Cup Finals]]. The team's performances and general standard of play, however, won the hearts of most basketball fans in Greece. Indeed, cinemas and theaters in Greece would often reduce their admission prices on Thursday evenings, when Aris was playing games, as large segments of the country settled down to watch them on television.\n\nAfter a disappointing season in 1991\u201392, Galis was forced to leave Aris.<ref>Rabotas, G., ''Nikos Galis'', p. 137</ref> The new management of the team, and the fact that the club was in decline, were the main causes for his departure. Galis, who adored the city of [[Thessaloniki]], had originally insisted on remaining in the club and playing for the team, as he believed that he still had a lot to offer the club. In one of his final European Champions' Cup games for Aris, in early-1992, Galis rolled back the years, at the age of 35, to score 46 points (15/18, 8/14, 5/6) in a narrow defeat to Phillips Milan. Also that season, in a Greek league match against Panionios, Galis scored 48 points on 12/13, 15/18, 2/3.\n\n===Panathinaikos Athens===\n[[Image:Nikos Galis Panathinaikos 1992.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Galis with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], during the 1992\u201393 season.]]\n\nGalis moved to [[Athens]] in the summer of 1992, to play with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], and he was the player who then led the \"Greens\" to a club rebirth, after it had suffered through a long drought period, during which the historical team remained without titles. The previous season (1991\u201392) had been particularly disappointing for the club, with the team finishing eighth in the Greek league. As the team's [[Captain (sports)|captain]], Galis inspired the young players of Panathinaikos, such as [[Fragiskos Alvertis]] and [[Nikos Oikonomou]], and gradually brought back hope to the team's fans. So much so, as to the point that the club's then home arena, [[Glyfada Indoor Hall]], was always overcrowded. In that season (1992\u201393), Panathinaikos finished second in the [[Greek Basket League|Greek league]], and won the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]], which was the seventh Greek Cup title for Galis.\n\nThe following season ([[1993\u201394 FIBA European League|1993\u201394]]), Galis was the FIBA European League (now called EuroLeague) [[EuroLeague Top Scorer|Top Scorer]] averaging 23.8 points per game in 21 games, and passer, averaging 4.7 assists per game, in 21 games. In the decisive game 3 of the EuroLeague quarterfinals, against the reigning [[EuroLeague|FIBA European League]] champions, [[Limoges CSP|Limoges]], Galis truly led Panathinaikos into a new club era, with their qualification to the [[1994 EuroLeague Final Four|1994 FIBA European League Final Four]], by scoring 30 points on 75% field goal shooting in the game. The \"Greens\" eventually finished in 3rd place in the FIBA European League that season, after losing in the semifinal, but it was still a success they had never reached before. Galis scored 30 points in the third place game against [[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|FC Barcelona]], leading all scorers in the game.\n\nIn his third season in Panthinaikos ([[1994\u201395 FIBA European League|1994\u201395]]), Galis teamed up with [[Panagiotis Giannakis]] and [[\u017darko Paspalj]], to make a strong effort to win the FIBA European League. Galis was the player who led Panathinaikos to the Top 16 group, as he prevented the elimination of Panathinaikos by [[Budivelnik Kiev]], with a team-high 23 points in the decisive second-leg victory. He was also the leader of the team in the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] win against [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], at [[Sporting Sports Arena]]. But Galis' career controversially ended on October 18, 1994,<ref>[http://www.gazzetta.gr/basket/a1/item/105797-\u0397\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd-\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac-\u03bf-\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Gazetta.gr \u0389\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac \u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 {{in lang|el}}.]</ref> a few games after the start of the Greek League 1994\u201395 season.

scorer, but that he was also a great play maker and passer. The majority of his points scored came inside the paint, due to his penetrating ability.<ref name=\"ironman\">Arbel, Y. ,\"Iron Man Galis\", November 08, 2006, FIBA Europe official website [http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_wro9VQVdG7cxqdc3r6woH2.coid_OetsMywJJtcKppVVZ6xGT3.articleMode_on.html]</ref> Galis' mid-range jumper was one of his biggest offensive weapons, being able to consistently pull it off under pressure. His post game was excellent, as he used his strength and leaping ability to counter his lack of height. Another enormous competitive advantage that Galis possessed was his incredible stamina, which was due to his exemplary physical condition. This led to his being given the nickname of \"Iron Man\". At the [[EuroBasket 1987]], he was never once substituted out of any game after the second day of the competition, completing 7 games in 9 days.<ref name=\"ironman\" />\n\n==Post-playing career==\nSince his official retirement on September 29, 1995, and up until early 2006, Galis was the owner of a summer basketball camp in [[Chalkidiki]], Greece. The basketball camp is listed at the [[Athens Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.galiscamp.gr/ |title=Official website of Galis's basketball camp |access-date=2006-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904231417/http://www.galiscamp.gr/ |archive-date=2006-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As a token of appreciation for his contribution to Greek sport, Galis was chosen to be the first torch bearer in the final round of the [[Olympic Flame]], for the [[Athens 2004|Athens 2004 Olympics]]. Galis entered the stadium at the conclusion of the [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]], and set off the procession of the flame to the altar.\n\nIn September 2007, Galis was elected as a member of the first class of the [[FIBA Hall of Famer|FIBA Hall of Fame]], which includes the best basketball players in the history of the game internationally. Galis was inducted as a player. [[Bill Russell]] of the famous [[Boston Celtics]] dynasty was another one of the 16 inaugural player inductees. Galis is also a member of the [[Eurobasket.com]] website's European Basketball Hall of Fame, inducted as a player. Galis is married to Eleni Panagiotou, and he has one daughter, named Stella.\n\nIn May 2013, his former club team [[Aris BC|Aris]], renamed their home arena to [[Nick Galis Hall]], organized a celebration of Galis' life and career, and [[Aris B.C.#Retired numbers|retired his number 6 Aris jersey]]. The event was attended by many of his teammates and opponents from the 1980s and 1990s. Attendees included Greek legends such as the majority of the [[1987 EuroBasket]] gold medal winning team, as well as international stars who played against Galis over the years, such as [[Dino Ra\u0111ja]], [[Jordi Villacampa]], and [[Doron Jamchi]].\n\nOn April 1, 2017, it was announced that Galis will be inducted to the [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the 2017 class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/04/01/tracy-mcgrady-jerry-krause-rebecca-lobo-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-fame|title=Tracy McGrady, Jerry Krause, Rebecca Lobo headline Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame class - NBA.com|first=The Associated|last=Press|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> Galis was accepted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2017. He became one of the very few basketball players from around the world, that joined the Hall of Fame, without having ever played in the [[NBA]]. On June 14, 2016, exactly 29 years after [[Greek national basketball team|Greece]] won the [[1987 EuroBasket|EuroBasket in 1987]], the biggest basketball arena in Greece, [[OAKA Olympic Indoor Hall]] was named 'Nikos Galis' in his honour.\n\n== Quotes about Galis ==\n\n''\"If I'm the devil's son, then Galis is the devil himself.\"'', '''[[Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107]]'''\n\n''\"If Galis wants to score, he will score no matter who's defending him.\"'', '''[[Arvydas Sabonis]]'''\n\n''\"I never thought that there was such a good offensive player in Europe, and especially in Greece.\"'', '''[[Michael Jordan]]'''\n\n''\"I've seen Galis do things that I have seen neither Lakers nor Celtics do.\"'', '''[[Bob McAdoo]]'''\n\n''\"Galis is the player of the 21st century.\"'', '''[[Alexander Gomelsky]]'''\n\n''\"Although Drazen (i.e. [[Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107]]) is my brother, for the best athlete of 1987, I voted for Galis.\"''', '''[[Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107 (basketball)|Aco Petrovi\u0107]]'''\n\n''\"I had given specific instructions on how to defend against the other 4 players.

The child of a poor immigrant family, from the Greek islands of [[Rhodes]] and [[Nisyros]], Galis took up [[boxing]] in his early years, after his father, George Georgalis, who had also been a boxer in his youth. He was later persuaded to give up boxing by his mother, Stella Georgalis, who was terrified after each time that her son would return home from boxing training with a new facial injury.

Later, while still playing in Greece, he would be offered [[NBA]] contracts by the Celtics and the [[New Jersey Nets]]. However, he turned the offers down, because at the time, and until 1989, [[FIBA]] did not have [[professional sports|professional]] status, and consequently did not allow NBA players to compete at the [[national sports team|national team]] level. Since playing with the senior [[Greek national basketball team|Greek national team]] meant so much to him, he stayed in Greece.

[[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]] and [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] had also shown some interest in signing the newcomer, but it was Aris' interest that was the most persuasive. His move to the country would eventually help Greek [[sports club|club]] basketball to reach a level of popularity that had never been previously imagined.\n\nAveraging more than 30 points per game every season, Galis was the indisputable leader of Aris. While playing alongside other great players at Aris such as [[Panagiotis Giannakis]] and [[Slobodan Suboti\u0107]] (who was known in Greece as Lefteris Soumpotits), Galis won 8 [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] championships (7 of them consecutively, and 3 undefeated, in the years 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991), 6 [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cups]] (4 of them consecutively, in the years 1985, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1992), and led Aris to 3 consecutive appearances at the [[EuroLeague|FIBA European Champions' Cup]] (now called EuroLeague) [[EuroLeague Final Four|Final Four]] ([[1988 EuroLeague Final Four|'88]], [[1989 EuroLeague Final Four|'89]], and [[1990 EuroLeague Final Four|'90]]). In the one disappointment of an otherwise glittering career with Aris, all three of the FIBA European Champions' Cup Final Four appearances ended in defeat in the semifinals, thus depriving Galis of the opportunity to shine all the way on Europe's biggest club stage, at the [[EuroLeague Finals|FIBA European Champions' Cup Finals]]. The team's performances and general standard of play, however, won the hearts of most basketball fans in Greece. Indeed, cinemas and theaters in Greece would often reduce their admission prices on Thursday evenings, when Aris was playing games, as large segments of the country settled down to watch them on television.\n\nAfter a disappointing season in 1991\u201392, Galis was forced to leave Aris.<ref>Rabotas, G., ''Nikos Galis'', p. 137</ref> The new management of the team, and the fact that the club was in decline, were the main causes for his departure. Galis, who adored the city of [[Thessaloniki]], had originally insisted on remaining in the club and playing for the team, as he believed that he still had a lot to offer the club. In one of his final European Champions' Cup games for Aris, in early-1992, Galis rolled back the years, at the age of 35, to score 46 points (15/18, 8/14, 5/6) in a narrow defeat to Phillips Milan. Also that season, in a Greek league match against Panionios, Galis scored 48 points on 12/13, 15/18, 2/3.\n\n===Panathinaikos Athens===\n[[Image:Nikos Galis Panathinaikos 1992.jpg|right|thumb|160px|Galis with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], during the 1992\u201393 season.]]\n\nGalis moved to [[Athens]] in the summer of 1992, to play with [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], and he was the player who then led the \"Greens\" to a club rebirth, after it had suffered through a long drought period, during which the historical team remained without titles. The previous season (1991\u201392) had been particularly disappointing for the club, with the team finishing eighth in the Greek league. As the team's [[Captain (sports)|captain]], Galis inspired the young players of Panathinaikos, such as [[Fragiskos Alvertis]] and [[Nikos Oikonomou]], and gradually brought back hope to the team's fans. So much so, as to the point that the club's then home arena, [[Glyfada Indoor Hall]], was always overcrowded. In that season (1992\u201393), Panathinaikos finished second in the [[Greek Basket League|Greek league]], and won the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]], which was the seventh Greek Cup title for Galis.\n\nThe following season ([[1993\u201394 FIBA European League|1993\u201394]]), Galis was the FIBA European League (now called EuroLeague) [[EuroLeague Top Scorer|Top Scorer]] averaging 23.8 points per game in 21 games, and passer, averaging 4.7 assists per game, in 21 games. In the decisive game 3 of the EuroLeague quarterfinals, against the reigning [[EuroLeague|FIBA European League]] champions, [[Limoges CSP|Limoges]], Galis truly led Panathinaikos into a new club era, with their qualification to the [[1994 EuroLeague Final Four|1994 FIBA European League Final Four]], by scoring 30 points on 75% field goal shooting in the game. The \"Greens\" eventually finished in 3rd place in the FIBA European League that season, after losing in the semifinal, but it was still a success they had never reached before. Galis scored 30 points in the third place game against [[FC Barcelona B\u00e0squet|FC Barcelona]], leading all scorers in the game.\n\nIn his third season in Panthinaikos ([[1994\u201395 FIBA European League|1994\u201395]]), Galis teamed up with [[Panagiotis Giannakis]] and [[\u017darko Paspalj]], to make a strong effort to win the FIBA European League. Galis was the player who led Panathinaikos to the Top 16 group, as he prevented the elimination of Panathinaikos by [[Budivelnik Kiev]], with a team-high 23 points in the decisive second-leg victory. He was also the leader of the team in the [[Greek Basketball Cup|Greek Cup]] win against [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]], at [[Sporting Sports Arena]]. But Galis' career controversially ended on October 18, 1994,<ref>[http://www.gazzetta.gr/basket/a1/item/105797-\u0397\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd-\u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac-\u03bf-\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Gazetta.gr \u0389\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bb\u03ac \u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 {{in lang|el}}.]</ref> a few games after the start of the Greek League 1994\u201395 season.

scorer, but that he was also a great play maker and passer. The majority of his points scored came inside the paint, due to his penetrating ability.<ref name=\"ironman\">Arbel, Y. ,\"Iron Man Galis\", November 08, 2006, FIBA Europe official website [http://www.fibaeurope.com/cid_wro9VQVdG7cxqdc3r6woH2.coid_OetsMywJJtcKppVVZ6xGT3.articleMode_on.html]</ref> Galis' mid-range jumper was one of his biggest offensive weapons, being able to consistently pull it off under pressure. His post game was excellent, as he used his strength and leaping ability to counter his lack of height. Another enormous competitive advantage that Galis possessed was his incredible stamina, which was due to his exemplary physical condition. This led to his being given the nickname of \"Iron Man\". At the [[EuroBasket 1987]], he was never once substituted out of any game after the second day of the competition, completing 7 games in 9 days.<ref name=\"ironman\" />\n\n==Post-playing career==\nSince his official retirement on September 29, 1995, and up until early 2006, Galis was the owner of a summer basketball camp in [[Chalkidiki]], Greece. The basketball camp is listed at the [[Athens Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.galiscamp.gr/ |title=Official website of Galis's basketball camp |access-date=2006-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904231417/http://www.galiscamp.gr/ |archive-date=2006-09-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As a token of appreciation for his contribution to Greek sport, Galis was chosen to be the first torch bearer in the final round of the [[Olympic Flame]], for the [[Athens 2004|Athens 2004 Olympics]]. Galis entered the stadium at the conclusion of the [[2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]], and set off the procession of the flame to the altar.\n\nIn September 2007, Galis was elected as a member of the first class of the [[FIBA Hall of Famer|FIBA Hall of Fame]], which includes the best basketball players in the history of the game internationally. Galis was inducted as a player. [[Bill Russell]] of the famous [[Boston Celtics]] dynasty was another one of the 16 inaugural player inductees. Galis is also a member of the [[Eurobasket.com]] website's European Basketball Hall of Fame, inducted as a player. Galis is married to Eleni Panagiotou, and he has one daughter, named Stella.\n\nIn May 2013, his former club team [[Aris BC|Aris]], renamed their home arena to [[Nick Galis Hall]], organized a celebration of Galis' life and career, and [[Aris B.C.#Retired numbers|retired his number 6 Aris jersey]]. The event was attended by many of his teammates and opponents from the 1980s and 1990s. Attendees included Greek legends such as the majority of the [[1987 EuroBasket]] gold medal winning team, as well as international stars who played against Galis over the years, such as [[Dino Ra\u0111ja]], [[Jordi Villacampa]], and [[Doron Jamchi]].\n\nOn April 1, 2017, it was announced that Galis will be inducted to the [[List of players in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] as part of the 2017 class.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2017/04/01/tracy-mcgrady-jerry-krause-rebecca-lobo-naismith-memorial-basketball-hall-fame|title=Tracy McGrady, Jerry Krause, Rebecca Lobo headline Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame class - NBA.com|first=The Associated|last=Press|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2018}}</ref> Galis was accepted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 9, 2017. He became one of the very few basketball players from around the world, that joined the Hall of Fame, without having ever played in the [[NBA]]. On June 14, 2016, exactly 29 years after [[Greek national basketball team|Greece]] won the [[1987 EuroBasket|EuroBasket in 1987]], the biggest basketball arena in Greece, [[OAKA Olympic Indoor Hall]] was named 'Nikos Galis' in his honour.\n\n== Quotes about Galis ==\n\n''\"If I'm the devil's son, then Galis is the devil himself.\"'', '''[[Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107]]'''\n\n''\"If Galis wants to score, he will score no matter who's defending him.\"'', '''[[Arvydas Sabonis]]'''\n\n''\"I never thought that there was such a good offensive player in Europe, and especially in Greece.\"'', '''[[Michael Jordan]]'''\n\n''\"I've seen Galis do things that I have seen neither Lakers nor Celtics do.\"'', '''[[Bob McAdoo]]'''\n\n''\"Galis is the player of the 21st century.\"'', '''[[Alexander Gomelsky]]'''\n\n''\"Although Drazen (i.e. [[Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107]]) is my brother, for the best athlete of 1987, I voted for Galis.\"''', '''[[Aleksandar Petrovi\u0107 (basketball)|Aco Petrovi\u0107]]'''\n\n''\"I had given specific instructions on how to defend against the other 4 players.

After looking at the circumstances that night, the investigation was not able to conclude whether having another crew member would have prevented the accident.<ref name=TSB_Summary />\n\nAir brakes on the train are supplied with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive on the train. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If the system is not recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied as in the case of the Lac-M\u00e9gantic accident.<ref name=TSB_Summary /> However, it is the usual practice for an engineer parking a train, once the train is stopped, to apply the brakes on the cars in the train by releasing air from the train line, and allowing the air in the cars' reservoirs to apply the cars' brakes. Therefore, it would not matter if the automatic brakes applied themselves or not, as the car brakes would already be in the applied position. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the \u201creset safety control\u201d on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train's brakes in the event of an engine failure.<ref name=\"G&M20129764\">{{cite news|title=Lac-M\u00e9gantic derailment: Anatomy of a disaster|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lac-megantic-derailment-anatomy-of-a-disaster/article20129764 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=August 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"G&M20110506\">{{cite news|title=Lac-M\u00e9gantic report: 18 things that went wrong|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lac-megantic-report-18-things-that-went-wrong/article20110506/?from=20129764|newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to air brake systems, all locomotives and rail cars are equipped with at least one hand brake. This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Had there been a two-man crew, they would have been able to perform a stabilization test, by releasing  all air brakes  and ensuring just the hand brakes would hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.<ref name=TSB_Summary />\n\n==Chronology==\n\n===Eight months before the derailment===\n\nIn October 2012, the lead locomotive, a [[GE C30-7]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Canadian police seek to block sale of ill-fated MM&A locomotive | website=Railway Age | date=2014-07-24 | url=https://www.railwayage.com/news/canadian-police-seek-to-block-sale-of-ill-fated-mma-locomotive/ }}</ref> #5017 was sent to MMA's repair shop following an engine failure.

Content of blended crude from multiple wells is not tested before loading, even though FRA indicates that \u201cit is critical that shippers determine the proper classification of the crude oil\u201d as a tanker with a higher safety classification (and not the standard DOT-111A car) is required for corrosive or explosive materials. The information is needed for provision to first responders and emergency services during a disaster.\n\nIn an increasing number of incidents, chemicals such as [[hydrochloric acid]] (used to release crude from oil well rock formations) have corroded tanks, covers, valves and fittings. As unit trains of tanker cars do not pass over weigh-in-motion scales in classification yards, many are overloaded, increasing risks of leakage as oil expands with temperature. The result has been twice the number of leaks from crude oil shipments as from alcohol shipments, the next highest hazardous material, even though comparable volumes of each travel by rail.<ref name=np-fra/>\n\nIn January 2014, Canada's Transportation Safety Board recommended that DOT-111 / CTC-111A oil-by-rail cars built before October 2011 be replaced with the newer, reinforced design.

After looking at the circumstances that night, the investigation was not able to conclude whether having another crew member would have prevented the accident.<ref name=TSB_Summary />\n\nAir brakes on the train are supplied with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive on the train. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If the system is not recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no braking force. When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied as in the case of the Lac-M\u00e9gantic accident.<ref name=TSB_Summary /> However, it is the usual practice for an engineer parking a train, once the train is stopped, to apply the brakes on the cars in the train by releasing air from the train line, and allowing the air in the cars' reservoirs to apply the cars' brakes. Therefore, it would not matter if the automatic brakes applied themselves or not, as the car brakes would already be in the applied position. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the \u201creset safety control\u201d on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train's brakes in the event of an engine failure.<ref name=\"G&M20129764\">{{cite news|title=Lac-M\u00e9gantic derailment: Anatomy of a disaster|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lac-megantic-derailment-anatomy-of-a-disaster/article20129764 |newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=August 19, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"G&M20110506\">{{cite news|title=Lac-M\u00e9gantic report: 18 things that went wrong|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/lac-megantic-report-18-things-that-went-wrong/article20110506/?from=20129764|newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to air brake systems, all locomotives and rail cars are equipped with at least one hand brake. This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Had there been a two-man crew, they would have been able to perform a stabilization test, by releasing  all air brakes  and ensuring just the hand brakes would hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.<ref name=TSB_Summary />\n\n==Chronology==\n\n===Eight months before the derailment===\n\nIn October 2012, the lead locomotive, a [[GE C30-7]]<ref>{{cite web | title=Canadian police seek to block sale of ill-fated MM&A locomotive | website=Railway Age | date=2014-07-24 | url=https://www.railwayage.com/news/canadian-police-seek-to-block-sale-of-ill-fated-mma-locomotive/ }}</ref> #5017 was sent to MMA's repair shop following an engine failure.

After uncoupling the tank cars, he used a [[rail car mover]] to pull them away from the derailment site.<ref name=vancouversun09 /> This version of events has been disputed by Lac-M\u00e9gantic's fire chief, who indicated that a volunteer firefighter had used a rail car mover borrowed from a local factory to remove these cars from danger.<ref>{{cite news|author=Les Whittington |author2=Liam Casey GTA |author3=Jessica McDiarmid |author4=Bruce Campion-Smith |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/07/09/ottawa_okayed_having_only_one_engineer_on_illfated_train.html |title=Lac Megantic explosion: Ottawa approved having only one engineer on ill-fated train |newspaper=The Toronto Star |date=July 9, 2013 |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref> It was later revealed that two employees of [[Tafisa Canada|Tafisa]] (Serge Morin, Sylvain Gr\u00e9goire), a firefighter (Beno\u00eet H\u00e9on), the MMA engineer (Tom Harding) and a member of the family-owned excavation company Lafontaine and Son (Pascal Lafontaine) had worked to move 9 tank cars away from the fire. Tafisa, a local [[particleboard]] industry that moves much of its product by rail, has a rail car mover which has the capability to deactivate the brakes on the cars it tows. Morin, aided by his colleague Gr\u00e9goire, used the rail car mover to move the first 5 tank cars away from the fire. When they could not find a level crossing to move the rail car mover back to the disaster site, they used a loader to remove another 4 tank cars, 2 at a time. Because the loader lacked equipment to deactivate railcar brakes, Harding told the men to use the loader to break the air lines on cars to release the air brakes on each of these four cars.<ref>{{cite web |title=Le conducteur Harding aurait permis d'\u00e9loigner des wagons du brasier |url=https://www.ledevoir.com/environnement/actualites-sur-l-environnement/382896/le-conducteur-harding-aurait-permis-d-eloigner-des-wagons-du-brasier |work=Le Devoir |date=July 13, 2013 |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Andy Blatchford |agency=Canadian Press |url=https://windsorstar.com/news/national/Witnesses+describe+train+driver+raced+disaster+scene/8653801/story.html |title=The frantic moment when the train driver in Lac-Megantic raced to the scene |newspaper=Windsor Star |date=July 15, 2013 |accessdate=July 15, 2013}}</ref> Lafontaine's workers hauled gravel to the site, created [[firebreak]]s and blocked manholes as burning oil spread into the town's [[storm sewer]] system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/dossiers/tragedie-a-lac-megantic/201307/10/01-4669313-plusieurs-travailleurs-ont-risque-leur-vie-sur-la-ligne-de-feu.php |title=Plusieurs travailleurs ont risqu\u00e9 leur vie sur la ligne de feu |author=CHRISTIANE DESJARDINS, DAVID SANTERRE et Gabrielle Duchaine |newspaper=La Presse |language=French |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter 20 hours, the centre of the fire was still inaccessible to firefighters<ref name=ctv /> and five pools of fuel were still burning.

Content of blended crude from multiple wells is not tested before loading, even though FRA indicates that \u201cit is critical that shippers determine the proper classification of the crude oil\u201d as a tanker with a higher safety classification (and not the standard DOT-111A car) is required for corrosive or explosive materials. The information is needed for provision to first responders and emergency services during a disaster.\n\nIn an increasing number of incidents, chemicals such as [[hydrochloric acid]] (used to release crude from oil well rock formations) have corroded tanks, covers, valves and fittings. As unit trains of tanker cars do not pass over weigh-in-motion scales in classification yards, many are overloaded, increasing risks of leakage as oil expands with temperature. The result has been twice the number of leaks from crude oil shipments as from alcohol shipments, the next highest hazardous material, even though comparable volumes of each travel by rail.<ref name=np-fra/>\n\nIn January 2014, Canada's Transportation Safety Board recommended that DOT-111 / CTC-111A oil-by-rail cars built before October 2011 be replaced with the newer, reinforced design.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]].

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman]], Denis O'Dell (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] to direct), and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the television rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1937994273|location=|pages=99\u2013108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumor (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumors it was later said in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \"any attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, storyboard artist [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney studios had \"never done a cartoon with this much story\", admitting that \"there are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\" and that \"many sections are too frightening for our purposes.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax apparently wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=March 7, 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2006|accessdate=November 29, 2006}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=978-1119656029|location=|pages=518\u201321}}</ref> \n\nWhile Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the United States to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Deitch was unaware of ''The Lord of the Rings'' until later in the scripting process,<ref name=\":0\" /> when he incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitutes the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectators who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a color film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for television in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptuous. Another attempt at purchasing the television rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65\u20137}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop-motion productions.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio.

Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits.

Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''. Some reports mention a treatment<ref name=\":17\" /> having been written by [[Paul Gallico]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archives.theonering.net/perl/newsview/1/961798278|title=If the Beatles HAD made a LOTR movie......|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> which seems unfounded.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with preproduction on ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"It's a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\"<ref name=\":4\" /> Another project Lean had recently declined in favour of ''Ryan's Daughter'' was a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic, which Lean first pitched in 1958. When Bolt pulled out of ''Gandhi'' in order to stay on Lean's film, he used a rhetoric similar to what Lean used to turn down O'Dell. In 1972, Lean and Bolt were in conversations to adapt ''[[Dune (novel)#Early stalled attempts|Dune]]'', but declined. A similarly labyrinthine project, ''Dune'' passed to [[Rospo Pallenberg]], and finally to [[Dune (1984 film)|David Lynch]], [[Frank Herbert's Dune|John Harrison]] and [[Denis Villeneuve]].<ref>Lean and Bolt were approached with a treatment written by [[Robert Greenhut]]. [[Charles Jarrott]] was also approached. Unproduced attempts to film ''Dune'' involved directors [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Ridley Scott]], [[Peter Berg]], and [[Pierre Morel]].</ref>\n\nO'Dell next contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. [[Ringo Starr]] wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, Ringo as Sam, and Harrison as Gandalf.

Kubrick's own films never exceeded the three-hour runtime before, and splitting the story (an approach considered with such widescreen epics as ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' and ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' around that time) would have been risky given that 60s widescreen epics rarely had sequels, and the nature of the story would result in the first part feeling unresolved.

At $2 million dollars to produce, the special would prove the costliest made up to that time,<ref name=\":0\" /> and starred John Huston, a fan of the book, as Gandalf.\n\nThey contacted Tolkien's Estate, who declined, but Rankin pointed out that, due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'', the books were public domain in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://law.marquette.edu/facultyblog/2011/10/one-public-domain-to-rule-them-all/|title=ONE PUBLIC DOMAIN TO RULE THEM ALL|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":24\">{{Cite web|url=http://enchantedworldofrankinbass.blogspot.com/2016/07/arthur-rankin-jr-interview-at-museum-of.html|title=The Enchanted World of Rankin-Bass: Arthur Rankin Jr., Interview at the Museum of Television & Radio (2003)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The Estate, along with Saul Zaentz who had since purchased the film rights, tried to stop the production through a law suit, but it instead \"became authorized through a series of settlement agreements\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2285701/saul-zaentz-company-v-wozniak-travel-inc/|title=SAUL ZAENTZ COMPANY v.

Some cell animation was produced by the time Goeff Dunbar and Oscar Grillo of Euronimation bowed out. Rankin then outsourced the animation to Japan's Topcraft (later [[Studio Ghibli|Studio Ghilbi]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.intanibase.com/forum/posts/m25152findunread-Middle-Earth-in-Animation|title=Middle Earth in Animation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe designs were done by Rankin, Bass and several Japanese animators working the United States. Lester Abrams sent Rankin 20 character designs after Rankin and Bass liked his work on an excerpt of Tolkien's for ''Children's Digest'' at the time. He was brought on board again later in the production to help illustrate the Dwarves \u2013 basing Thorin on concept art for Disney's Grumpy. He also drew Gollum as a corrupted Hobbit, but Rankin insisted that he be made more ferocious.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite magazine|last=Plesset|first=Ross|title=The Lord of the Rings: The Animated Films|url=https://archive.org/stream/CinefantastiqueVol34No1Feb2002/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2034%20No%201%20%28Feb%202002%29#page/n51/mode/2up|journal=Cinefantastique|volume=34|pages=52\u20133|publication-date=February 2002|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Romeo Muller]], who wrote previous teleplays for Rankin, was employed for the special. His first draft tried to encompass the whole of the story, plus a setup for The Lord of the Rings at the end. Rankin had him pare it down, and at one point also wanted to cut out the spiders, but was talked out of it by Lester. Beorn was \"sacrificed\" to keep the Spiders.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Stone Giants were animated, but they were cut from the film. While Rankin wanted it to be released in theaters if it was successful enough, this did not come to pass, making Ralph Bakshi's ''The Lord of the Rings'' the only theatrical feature based on Tolkien's works to appear before the WingNut films productions.\n\nThe television special received mixed reactions. In 1978, [[Romeo Muller]] won a [[Peabody Award]] for his teleplay. The film was also nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation]], but lost to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.<ref>Kask, TJ, ''NBC's The Hobbit'', [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon Magazine]], December 1977</ref> [[Douglas A.

R. R. Tolkien]] by a director at Terrytoons in 1956. In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=January 2, 2007|first=Jim |last=Korkis |date =June 24, 2003 |publisher=Jim Hill Media}}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become ''[[Wizards (film)|Wizards]]''. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\" and that his script would have made for a cheap film like \"a Roger Corman film\".<ref name=\":8\" /> He would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Medavoy didn't want to produce Bakshi's film, but allowed him to shop it around if he could get another studio to pay for the expenses on Boorman's script.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. Zaentz was only able to offer a humble budget of $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=Weiner|first=David|date=November 10, 2018|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz's Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nWith Conkling, Bakshi considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \"we didn't know how that middle film would work\"<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on two 150-minute films. At one point, the story was to be told in flashback by Merry and Pippin to Treebeard as a setup for the second film, which was tentatively set to be released in 1980. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some inconsistencies like the spelling of Saruman's (originally changed to Ruman to avoid confusion with Sauron) name in the film. Fans were threatening Bakshi to get it right, and he would constantly revise the story to include certain beats at the behest of such fans.<ref name=\":34\">{{Cite book|last=Ash|first=Roger|title=Modern Masters Volume 19: Mike Ploog|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}</ref>\n\nBakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action, and while Bakshi's contract allowed this, he said it couldn't be done and that he'd \"always seen it as animation.\"<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]], and [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was done in the United States by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=January 9, 2007 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rated PG, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was the longest animated film made at the time, and cost $8\u201312<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce, grossing $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref name=\":31\">\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. Assuming that it will be made into a live-action film eventually, he read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref name=\":35\">{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19021.php|title=John Howe interview|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with ''The Lord of the Rings'', leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. Jackson insisted to make two films (and even suggested three<ref name=\":35\" /><ref name=\":27\" />) and the Weinsteins \"blanched\"<ref name=\":35\" /> but agreed on two films. While filming, Jackson told Elijah Wood he wasn't interested in directing ''The Hobbit'', but during post-production on ''The Two Towers'', spoke more enthusiastically of it with composer Howard Shore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/interview-howard-shore-the-lord-of-the-rings|title=INTERVIEW: Howard Shore (\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d)|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Jackson also later made remarks about potential spinoff films<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.herr-der-ringe-film.de/v3/de/news/tolkienfilme/news_19958.php|title=20 QUESTIONS WITH PETER JACKSON - PART 2|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and even half-joking remarks about television spin-off shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, it became clear that the scope of the project was beyond Miramax' ability to finance on its own. An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, but his agent Ken Kamins convinced Harvey Weinstein that getting another filmmaker to work on the project will result in further delays and costs, at which point Harvey conceded to give Jackson the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success.

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then passed them in part to [[Saul Zaentz]] (which [[trade name|did business as]] [[Middle-earth Enterprises]]). During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Al Brodax]], [[Forrest J Ackerman]], [[Samuel Gelfman]], Denis O'Dell (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] to direct), and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the television rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=978-1937994273|location=|pages=99\u2013108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumor (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumors it was later said in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \"any attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, storyboard artist [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney studios had \"never done a cartoon with this much story\", admitting that \"there are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\" and that \"many sections are too frightening for our purposes.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Al Brodax ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works. The final volume of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had only just been published in the US, and didn't yet achieve the commercial success it would later find with the [[Counterculture|counter-culture]] movement, but Brodax apparently wanted to adapt it to animation. Tolkien, nearing retirement and yet to see substantial commercial success from his writings, was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it. \n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nAt the end of the 1956, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. He later became the editor of the American magazine ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]].'' \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour film with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref> According to Tolkien, it was described to him as an animated film, but he professed to being ignorant of the process, and its possible that Ackerman wished to make a primarily live-action film, using animation, stop-motion and miniature photography for specific characters and environments.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /> Cobb scouted locations around [[California]] for the project,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> showing pictures of mountains and deserts to Tolkien, who was impressed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. While Tolkien noted that a film \"would be pleasant\",<ref name=\":2\" /> he delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref name=\":29\">{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=March 7, 2004|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=September 3, 2006|accessdate=November 29, 2006}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien told Gutwillig he had \"given a considerable amount of time and thought\" to a film adaptation, noting \"some ideas concerning what I think would be desirable\" as well as the \"difficulties\" involved.<ref name=\":0\" /> Tolkien spoke with Gutwillig's agent and producer, [[Samuel Gelfman|Samuel W. Gelfman]]. Their discussion was appearantly amicable, with Tolkien finding Gelfman intelligent and reasonable,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?do=post_view_printable;post=133383;guest=126989777|title=FLASHBACK for...August 31 to September 13|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and Gelfman later recalled that they talked about specifics to do with an adaptation.<ref name=\":26\" /> Tolkien directed Gelfman to his publishers, but nothing came out of it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien later received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=978-1119656029|location=|pages=518\u201321}}</ref> \n\nWhile Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964, having released the new, second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the United States to great commercial success, Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Deitch was unaware of ''The Lord of the Rings'' until later in the scripting process,<ref name=\":0\" /> when he incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitutes the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectators who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a color film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for television in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptuous. Another attempt at purchasing the television rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65\u20137}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nThe idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s stop-motion productions. By 1967, Gelfman established Katzka-Bernie productions with [[Gabriel Katzka]] and entered negotiations with Tolkien to adapt ''The Lord of the Rings'' for United Artists,<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":26\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/29/movies/l-lord-of-the-rings-serious-issues-557552.html|title='LORD OF THE RINGS'; Serious Issues|last=|first=|date=December 29, 2002|work=The New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \"with an option for ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref name=\":16\" /> As was the case with Snyder, the emerging contracts would provide United Artists with complete creative freedom over the works, and even offered UA first bidding at the television rights, which were negotiated separately but never sold to them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2017/11/15/104416-tolkien-rights-and-the-amazon-television-deal-some-insight/|title=Tolkien Rights and the Amazon Television Deal \u2013 some insight|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, a couple of American teenagers unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the rights to ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Joy Hill, Tolkien's secretary who worked for Allen & Unwin, was said to have contacted Disney for the rights at the time,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/tolkien-cs-lewis-disney-snow-white-narnia-hobbit-dwarves|title=The Movie Date That Solidified J.R.R.

In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such products was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=December 15, 2002|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits.

Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]], and [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into lucrative widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.

When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\" and that his script would have made for a cheap film like \"a Roger Corman film\".<ref name=\":8\" /> He would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Medavoy didn't want to produce Bakshi's film, but allowed him to shop it around if he could get another studio to pay for the expenses on Boorman's script.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. Zaentz was only able to offer a humble budget of $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=Weiner|first=David|date=November 10, 2018|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Since Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz's Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nWith Conkling, Bakshi considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \"we didn't know how that middle film would work\"<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work, but eventually settled on two 150-minute films. At one point, the story was to be told in flashback by Merry and Pippin to Treebeard as a setup for the second film, which was tentatively set to be released in 1980. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs.<ref name=\":29\" />\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some inconsistencies like the spelling of Saruman's (originally changed to Ruman to avoid confusion with Sauron) name in the film. Fans were threatening Bakshi to get it right, and he would constantly revise the story to include certain beats at the behest of such fans.<ref name=\":34\">{{Cite book|last=Ash|first=Roger|title=Modern Masters Volume 19: Mike Ploog|publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=41}}</ref>\n\nBakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action, and while Bakshi's contract allowed this, he said it couldn't be done and that he'd \"always seen it as animation.\"<ref name=\"Robinson\" />\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]], and [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. \n\nIt was decided to move ahead with ''The Lord of the Rings'', leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. Jackson insisted to make two films (and even suggested three<ref name=\":35\" /><ref name=\":27\" />) and the Weinsteins \"blanched\"<ref name=\":35\" /> but agreed on two films.

An appeal to its parent company of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to manufacture additional funding was denied: CEO [[Michael Eisner]] later claimed this was due to Harvey Weinstein refusing to show him the scripts,<ref name=\":27\">{{Cite book|last=Nathan|first=|title=Anything You Can Imagine|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=141}}</ref> but his decision to split the precentage evenly with the Weinsteins may speak to a more fundemental mistrust in the project.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct. Jackson believes this was an empty threat to get him to concede to the one-film version. He refused, but his agent Ken Kamins convinced Harvey Weinstein that getting another filmmaker to work on the project will result in further delays and costs, at which point Harvey conceded to give Jackson the opportunity to find another studio to take over. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\n[[Robert Zemeckis]], [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] and Dreamworks declined. [[20th Century Studios|Fox]] were interested, but unwilling to enter a project involving Saul Zaentz, and [[Sony Pictures|Sony]] and [[Centropolis Entertainment|Centropolis]] didn't find the scripts to their liking. Harvey Weinstein limited the turnaround to three weeks, hoping that (by rendering it impossible for Jackson to find a studio in time) Jackson would have to come back to him and do the one-film version. <ref name=\":28\" /><ref name=\":27\" />\n\nIn 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003.

New Line suggested [[Sam Raimi]] to direct, but in 2008, [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]] was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. The films would have included much of the content present in Jackson's film, but would have been cast differently and featured Del Toro's distinctive design aesthetic, instead.\n\nTime constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.
