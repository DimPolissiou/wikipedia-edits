He was also a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.\n\n==Luftwaffe ace in World War II==\nAs a ''Gefreiter'' flying with I/[[JG 27]] Werfft participated in the [[Battle of Britain]]; the two air victories which he scored against RAF [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters on 27 September 1940 was his first.\n\nWerrft served with JG 27 in North Africa during 1941-42, claiming five kills over the [[Desert Air Force]]. Werfft was commissioned as a ''Leutnant'' (Lieutenant) in late 1942. Service over Greece and the Balkans followed in 1943, where he claimed the destruction of a [[P-38 Lightning]] and three USAAF heavy bombers.\n\nWerfft claimed 11 more heavies in 1944, he was a ''Hauptmann'' (Captain) by October 1944. He was awarded the ''Ritterkreuz'' on 28 January 1945.\n\nAt the end of World War II he was a Major and ''gruppenkommandeur'' of III./JG 27, flying a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] G-6 fighter [https://www.aviationillustration.com/shop/popup_image.php?pID=1143&osCsid=dc890d2c87e567a0f3af324a3a44b888 (\"Yellow One\")] with a green fuselage band signifying dedication to ''Reich'' strategic airspace defence; he also had a total of 26 air kills.\n\nOn 3 May 1945 he disbanded his III./JG 27 in the Austrian Alps near [[Saalbach-Hinterglemm|Saalbach]], together with the acting unit commander ''Hauptmann'' [[Emil Clade]], eventually becoming a prisoner of war of the United States.\n\n==Pharmaceutical Entrepreneur==\nReturning to Austria after his release from captivity, Werfft established InterChemie GmbH, a Vienna-based pharmaceutical and chemical limited liability enterprise, in 1948. Among the first commercial activities of the fledgling trading company in this difficult post-war period was the Austrian sales representation for certain [[American Cyanamid]] products. By 1961 the firm had been restructured into a successor company, Werfft-Chemie GmbH. In the years following the founder's death in 1970, Werfft-Chemie continued, initially as a family-run business, but met with increasing economic difficulties. It was taken over by the Austrian [[Sanochemia Pharmazeutika]] Group in 1983 and was subsequently converted to a purely veterinary medicine company. The legacy of Werfft-Chemie survives under the name [http://www.alvetrawerfft.com Alvetra u. Werfft AG], a Sanochemia company with subsidiaries in several central and eastern European countries.\n\n==Summary of career==\n\n===Aerial victory claims===\nWerfft was credited with 26 enemy aircraft shot down, all of which on the Western Front, including five in North Africa. This figure includes 14 four-engined bombers.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=222}}\n\n{{legend2|#fbec5d;|This along with the * (asterisk) indicates an ''Herausschuss'' (separation shot)\u2014a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from his combat box which was counted as an aerial victory.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | Chronicle of aerial victories\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Victory\n!scope=\"col\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Time\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"| Type\n!scope=\"col\"| Location\n!scope=\"col\"| Unit\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | Victory\n!scope=\"col\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Time\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"| Type\n!scope=\"col\"| Location\n!scope=\"col\"| Unit\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | \u2013 Claims with I.

The combats either side of the ones near Wolfsberg (14 days earlier and 4 days later) were near [[Marburg]], which is in [[Hesse]]; all were against U.S. bombers. It seems reasonable to assume that Werfft was stationed at the same aerodrome throughout. Several places called [[Wolfsberg (disambiguation)|Wolfsberg]] are listed in English Wikipedia; several more are listed at [[:de:Wolfsberg]] in German Wikipedia. None is in Hesse, and the only one which is both in modern Germany and in 1944 had the status of a town rather than a district of a town is [[Wolfsberg, Thuringia]], a place of little or no military significance with about 3,500 inhabitants. It is possible that \"Wolfsberg\" is an error for [[Wolfsburg]], the site of the [[Volkswagen Group|Volkswagen]] headquarters and main factory, population 124,000 in 2018, {{convert|270|km|mi}} from Marburg and therefore within flying distance.</ref>\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 22\n| 19 May 1944\n| 13:30\n| B-24\n| east Helmstedt\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| 15\n| 2 April 1944\n| 10:42\n| B-24\n| northwest Wolfsberg\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 23\n| 17 December 1944\n| 14:25\n| [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]\n| northeast [[Coesfeld]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| 16\n| 6 April 1944\n| 16:25\n| B-17\n| east Marburg\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 24\n| 23 December 1944\n| 12:05\n| P-47\n| {{Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest [[Bonn]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| 17\n| 12 April 1944\n| 11:50\n| B-24\n| {{Convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} northeast [[Eisenstadt]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 25\n| 27 December 1944\n| 11:10\n| [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]]\n| {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} east [[Dinant]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| style=\"background:#fbec5d;\" | 18*\n| 12 April 1944\n| 12:00\n| B-24\n| south [[\u00d6denburg]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | 26\n| 27 December 1944\n| 11:20\n| P-38\n| {{Convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} northwest [[Losheim]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n|-\n| style=\"background:#fbec5d;\" | 19*\n| 23 May 1944\n| 13:45\n| B-24\n| {{Convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} east-southeast [[Gy\u0151r|Raab]]\n| 9./JG&nbsp;77\n| style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Awards===\n* [[Iron Cross]] (1939) 2nd and 1st class\n* [[Honour Goblet of the Luftwaffe|Honour Goblet of the ''Luftwaffe'']] (''Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe'') on 15 July 1944{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=222}}\n* [[German Cross]] in Gold on 23 July 1944 as ''[[Leutnant]]'' in the III./''Jagdgeschwader'' 27{{sfn|Patzwall|Scherzer|2001|p=507}}\n* [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 28 January 1945 as ''[[Hauptmann]]'' and ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' of the III./''Jagdgeschwader'' 27{{sfn|Fellgiebel|2000|p=443}}{{refn|According to Scherzer as ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' of the [[Military reserve force|Reserves]]{{sfn|Scherzer|2007|p=779}}|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"Note\"}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Fellgiebel\n  |first=Walther-Peer\n  |authorlink=Walther-Peer Fellgiebel\n  |year=2000\n  |origyear=1986\n  |title=Die Tr\u00e4ger des Ritterkreuzes des Eisernen Kreuzes 1939\u20131945 \u2014 Die Inhaber der h\u00f6chsten Auszeichnung des Zweiten Weltkrieges aller Wehrmachtteile\n  |trans-title=The Bearers of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross 1939\u20131945 \u2014 The Owners of the Highest Award of the Second World War of all Wehrmacht Branches\n  |language=German\n  |location=Friedberg, Germany\n  |publisher=Podzun-Pallas\n  |isbn=978-3-7909-0284-6\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last=Obermaier\n  |first=Ernst\n  |year=1989\n  |title=Die Ritterkreuztr\u00e4ger der Luftwaffe Jagdflieger 1939 \u2013 1945\n  |trans-title=The Knight's Cross Bearers of the Luftwaffe Fighter Force 1939 \u2013 1945\n  |language=German\n  |location=Mainz, Germany\n  |publisher=Verlag Dieter Hoffmann\n  |isbn=978-3-87341-065-7\n  |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n  |last1=Patzwall\n  |first1=Klaus D.\n  |last2=Scherzer\n  |first2=Veit\n  |year=2001\n  |title=Das Deutsche Kreuz 1941 \u2013 1945 Geschichte und Inhaber Band II\n  |trans-title=The German Cross 1941 \u2013 1945 History and Recipients Volume 2\n  |language=German\n  |location=Norderstedt, Germany\n  |publisher=Verlag Klaus D.

He was also a recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang-de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}). The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.\n\n==Luftwaffe Ace in World War II==\nAs a ''Gefreiter'' flying with I/[[JG 27]] Werfft participated in the [[Battle of Britain]]; the two air victories which he scored against RAF [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters on 27 September 1940 was his first.\n\nWerrft served with JG 27 in North Africa during 1941-42, claiming five kills over the [[Desert Air Force]]. Werfft was commissioned as a ''Leutnant'' (Lieutenant) in late 1942. Service over Greece and the Balkans followed in 1943, where he claimed the destruction of a [[P-38 Lightning]] and three USAAF heavy bombers.\n\nWerfft claimed 11 more heavies in 1944, he was a ''Hauptmann'' (Captain) by October 1944. He was awarded the ''Ritterkreuz'' on 28 January 1945.\n\nAt the end of World War II he was a Major and ''gruppenkommandeur'' of III./JG 27, flying a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] G-6 fighter [https://www.aviationillustration.com/shop/popup_image.php?pID=1143&osCsid=dc890d2c87e567a0f3af324a3a44b888 (\"Yellow One\")] with a green fuselage band signifying dedication to ''Reich'' strategic airspace defence; he also had a total of 26 air kills.\n\nOn 3 May 1945 he disbanded his III./JG 27 in the Austrian Alps near [[Saalbach-Hinterglemm|Saalbach]], together with the acting unit commander ''Hauptmann'' [[Emil Clade]], eventually becoming a prisoner of war of the United States.\n\n==Pharmaceutical Entrepreneur==\nReturning to Austria after his release from captivity, Werfft established InterChemie GmbH, a Vienna-based pharmaceutical and chemical limited liability enterprise, in 1948. Among the first commercial activities of the fledgling trading company in this difficult post-war period was the Austrian sales representation for certain [[American Cyanamid]] products. By 1961 the firm had been restructured into a successor company, Werfft-Chemie GmbH. In the years following the founder's death in 1970, Werfft-Chemie continued, initially as a family-run business, but met with increasing economic difficulties. It was taken over by the Austrian [[Sanochemia Pharmazeutika]] Group in 1983 and was subsequently converted to a purely veterinary medicine company. The legacy of Werfft-Chemie survives under the name [http://www.alvetrawerfft.com Alvetra u. Werfft AG], a Sanochemia company with subsidiaries in several central and eastern European countries.\n\n==Summary of career==\n\n===Aerial victory claims===\nWerfft was credited with 26 enemy aircraft shot down, all of which on the Western Front, including five in North Africa. This figure includes 14 four-engined bombers.{{sfn|Obermaier|1989|p=222}}\n\n{{legend2|#fbec5d;|This along with the * (asterisk) indicates an ''Herausschuss'' (separation shot)\u2014a severely damaged heavy bomber forced to separate from his combat box which was counted as an aerial victory.|border=1px solid #AAAAAA}}\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | Chronicle of aerial victories\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"| Victory\n!scope=\"col\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Time\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"| Type\n!scope=\"col\"| Location\n!scope=\"col\"| Unit\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"border-left: 3px solid grey;\" | Victory\n!scope=\"col\"| Date\n!scope=\"col\"| Time\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"100px\"| Type\n!scope=\"col\"| Location\n!scope=\"col\"| Unit\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | \u2013 Claims with I.

Gigi Goode, and Crystal Methyd. RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode. They lipsync to \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]; Widow Von'Du wins the lipsync, earning the first win of the season. \n\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Nicki Minaj]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original rap verse to \"I'm That Bitch\" and choreograph a routine to be performed live on the main stage.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Sparkles\n*'''Top Two''': Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Widow Von'Du</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =147\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|2}}2\n |Title           = You Don't Know Me\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|06}}\n |ShortSummary    = At the beginning of the episode, the remaining six contestants are introduced: Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation. After the judges deliberate, Gigi Goode is announced as the winner of the challenge, while Brita and Rock M. Sakura face off in a lip sync to \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]]. Brita is the winner of the lip sync and Rock M. is eliminated from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' \"The Beehive Jive\" dance competition\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' A $2,500 cash tip\n*'''Main Challenge:'''  Create three looks based on Sports Balls; Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip \n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Rock M.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe. This leaves Nicky and Heidi in the bottom, as they both receive negative reviews on their runway looks and for their performance in ''Gay's Anatomy''. The two queens lipsync to \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]], Heidi N Closet is the winner, and Nicky Doll sashays away.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Normani]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Pink Pill or Silver Pill\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' Assigning the roles for the main challenge\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Overact in ''Gay's Anatomy'', a parody of the popular TV show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which focuses on a group of young doctors that work in a hospital.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Planet of the Capes\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''\n*'''Bottom Two''': Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Nicky Doll</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I may not have gotten a crown.

Brita rehashes the drama between her and Aiden, with Aiden exhausted over Brita's attitude.\n\nFor the main challenge, RuPaul announces that the queens will be participating in the Snatch Game. He brings in [[Vanessa Vanjie Mateo]] to give tips on what to do and what not to do during Snatch Game. The Snatch Game characters are as followed: Aiden Zhane as [[Patricia Quinn]]; Brita as [[Jennifer Holliday]]; Crystal Methyd as [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]]; Gigi Goode as \"[[Sophia (robot)|Maria the Robot]]\"; Heidi N Closet as [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]; Jackie Cox as [[Lisa Rinna]]; Jan as [[Bernadette Peters]]; Jaida Essence Hall as [[Cardi B]]; Sherry Pie as [[Katharine Hepburn]]; and, Widow Von'Du as [[Tina Turner]] and [[Ike Turner]].\n\nFor the runway, the category is Frozen Eleganza, inspired by the [[Frozen (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]]. On the main stage, Heidi N Closet, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given glowing critiques over their runways, with Gigi receiving commendations from RuPaul herself for exceeding expectations. Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Crystal Methyd receive negative critiques over their performances, with the latter two receiving positive feedback over their runways.\n\nGigi Goode is declared the winner of the challenge, with Aiden Zhane and Brita in the bottom two.

Some of the queens, notably Brita, say how proud they are of how Aiden did in the competition, with Widow Von'Du claiming they were being fake after the criticism Aiden had previously received at various times. The queens rehash some of the critical comments made during the previous week\u2019s Untucked episode, with notable conflict between Gigi Goode and Heidi N Closet and well as between Jackie Cox and Widow.\n\nAt the start of the next day, the tension remains. RuPaul enters the workroom and tells the queens that the week\u2019s maxi-challenge is called \u201cMadonna: The Unauthorized Rusical.\u201d For the challenge, the queens will have to sing lyrics and learn choreography for a musical chronicling [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]\u2019s life and career. RuPaul leaves the queens to assign themselves roles for the musical, and after some discussion, the queens decide on the following roles: Jan as Early Madonna, Jackie as Boy Toy Madonna, Gigi as Unapologetic Madonna, Brita as Cone Bra Madonna, Jaida Essence Hall as Sex Madonna, Sherry Pie as Movie Star Madonna, Crystal Methyd as Enlightened Madonna, Widow as Fempire Madonna, and Heidi as Forever Madonna. Michelle Visage helps the queens work with music producers Erik Paparozzi and David Benjamin Steinberg to record their lyrics. Later, the queens work with Jamal Sims on their group and individual choreography for the performance.\n\nOn the main stage, the queens perform the Rusical and show their looks for the runway theme: Night of a Thousand Michelle Visages. Jaida Essence Hall, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Crystal Methyd, Gigi Goode, and Jan all receive positive critiques for their performances and runway looks. Brita and Jackie Cox receive positive critiques for their runway looks, but negative critiques for their performances. Heidi N Closet received mixed critiques for both her performance and runway look.\n\nAfter deliberating with the other judges, RuPaul declares Gigi to be the winner of the week\u2019s challenge with Heidi and Brita being placed the bottom two, the latter for the third time. The pair lip sync to the Madonna song \"Burning Up\", RuPaul then declares that Heidi won the lip sync, eliminating Brita from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] and [[Winnie Harlow]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Madonna: The Unauthorized Rusical\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Night of a Thousand Michelle Visages\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Heidi N Closet\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Brita</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"SIS.

Jan, who is close friends with Brita, is visibly upset and in tears since Brita is no longer in the competition. Some of the queens, such as Jaida Essence Hall, suspect that Jan is perhaps more upset that she didn\u2019t win that week\u2019s challenge like many of the other queens expected she would.\n\nThe next day in the workroom, RuPaul pairs the queens up to compete in the week\u2019s mini-challenge: Gigi Goode and Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd and Jaida, Jan and Heidi N Closet, and Widow Von'Du and Sherry Pie. The queens have to curate a box of products from the company FabFitFun to exchange with another pair of queens, using a lot of shade and backhanded compliments. Gigi and Jackie win the mini-challenge, each winning a $1,000 cash tip and a one year subscription to FabFitFun.\n\nFor the main challenge, the queens are tasked with creating an extravagant and unnecessary product fitting their personal brand, and shooting an [[infomercial]] to sell their product, for the fictional drag queen lifestyle brand called Droop. After the queens start their work, RuPaul and personal trainer Bob Harper drop by to share ideas and give feedback on the queens\u2019 products. Harper later directs the queens as they record their infomercials. The products the queens create are:\n\n* Crystal Methyd: The Magic Mullet, a collection of [[Mullet (haircut)|mullets]]\n* Gigi Goode: Goode Night Bitch, a fragrance and sleeping aid\n* Heidi N Closet: Heidi\u2019s Hydrates Multipurpose Lotion, a hydrating lotion\n* Jackie Cox: Jackie\u2019s Magic Carpet Merkins, a collection of [[Merkin|merkins]]\n* Jaida Essence Hall: Luxuratuck, diamond-encrusted panties\n* Jan: Sure, Jan, a personal style spray\n* Sherry Pie: Sherry Pie\u2019s Aura Pie, an expensive pie that improves one's [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]\n* Widow Von'Du: Throat\u00e9, a throat coating spray\n\nOn the main stage, the runway theme is Black Wedding. The judges watch each of the queens\u2019 infomercials and critique their runway looks. All eight queens receive positive critiques for their runway looks, with particular praise given to Crystal, Gigi, and Heidi. Jaida and Heidi receive glowing critiques for their commercials with Crystal and Jackie also garnering extremely positive feedback. The rest of the queens  receive negative feedback for their commercials, with the harshest critiques going to Jan and Widow. RuPaul then asks all queens which of their competitors should go home and why.

Gigi Goode, and Crystal Methyd. RuPaul announces the first mini-challenge is to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall, akin to Season 7's first mini-challenge.\n\nFor the main challenge, the seven queens are tasked to write lyrics and provide choreography to the track, \"I'm That Bitch\". Tensions erupt between Brita, Heidi, Jackie, and Widow regarding choreography, resulting in Heidi taking charge of choreography. The queens are able to perform the routine in front of guest judge, Nicki Minaj. The runway category for the episode is \"Sparkles\".\n\nOn the main stage, four girls (Gigi Goode, Widow Von'Du, Brita, and Jackie Cox) are given high praises, despite critiques on Brita's verse not showing much of her personality and Jackie's makeup not being able to hide her beard. Crystal Methyd is given mixed reviews on her runways but praise for her verse. Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques, with the latter coming off as nervous during the performance despite the judges loving her runways and the former selling her performance but faltering on her looks. After the judges deliberate, Brita, Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd, Nicky Doll, and Heidi N Closet are all declared safe, leaving Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du to be declared as the top two of the episode. They lipsync to \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]; Widow Von'Du wins the lipsync, earning the first win of the season. \n\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Nicki Minaj]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original rap verse to \"I'm That Bitch\" and choreograph a routine to be performed live on the main stage.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Sparkles\n*'''Top Two''': Gigi Goode and Widow Von'Du\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Widow Von'Du</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Starships (song)|Starships]]\" by [[Nicki Minaj]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =147\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|2}}2\n |Title           = You Don't Know Me\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|06}}\n |ShortSummary    = At the beginning of the episode, the remaining six contestants are introduced: Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, Sherry Pie, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall and Aiden Zhane. For the mini challenge, each queen needs to present two sets of runway looks: one for spring and one for fall.\n\nFor the maxi challenge, the queens are asked to perform in an introductory musical number inspired by [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]. The theme for the runway is tulle. \n\nDuring critiques, the queens receive mostly glowing critiques, especially Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie, albeit Rock M. Sakura receiving a mild negative critique about using fart humor and mixed reviews regarding her runway. Dahlia Sin receives negative feedback and is called out for letting her nerves get to her and for not fully showing who she truly is. After deliberations, Jan, Aiden Zhane, Rock M. Sakura, and Dahlia Sin are all declared safe, leaving Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie as the top two of the episode. After they lipsync to \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]; Jaida Essence Hall is declared the winner of the challenge.\n\nAfter the episode, the six queens meet the first seven girls of the season.\n\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Robyn]] and [[Thandie Newton]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini-Challenge:''' Walk the runway showing off two looks; one from their spring collection, the other from their fall collection.\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Write and record an original [[Bob Fosse|Fosse]]-inspired jazz number.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Tulle\n*'''Top Two''': Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Jaida Essence Hall</span>\n*'''Lip Sync Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Call Your Girlfriend]]\" by [[Robyn]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' None</span>\n |LineColor       = #274EC3\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|RuPaul's Drag Race (season 12)\n |EpisodeNumber   =148\n |EpisodeNumber2  ={{anchor|3}}3\n |Title           = World's Worst\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|03|13}}\n |ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the first seven queens meeting the last six queens in the werkroom. They kiki over what transpired during their respective weeks, resulting in the second group revealing that there have been spats between them, particularly between Jaida Essence Hall and Sherry Pie. The first group conceals the earlier argument between Jackie Cox, Brita, Widow Von'Du, and Heidi N Closet as a sort of unity tactic against the second group.\n\nThe mini-challenge is for the two past challenge winners, Widow and Jaida, to rank their competition from their opposite weeks between \"TOPS\" (their fiercest competition) to \"BOTTOMS\" (their least intimidating competition), resulting in Widow, Jaida, Heidi, and Aiden Zhane as the team captains of the week. \n\nThe main challenge of the week is an improv challenge where the queens are grouped into fours for a talent competition called \"''World's Worst''\". The queens are grouped as follows: (1) Aiden Zhane, Sherry Pie, and Brita; (2) Heidi N Closet, Gigi Goode, and Jackie Cox; (3) Widow Von'Du, Nicky Doll, and Crystal Methyd; and (4) Jaida Essence Hall, Rock M. Sakura, Dahlia Sin, and Jan. On the runway, the category is Buttons and Bows.\n\nAfter the runway presentations are complete, Aiden Zhane, Brita, Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, Jan, Rock M. Sakura, and Widow Von'Du are all declared safe. Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given positive critiques for both their performances and runways, and Heidi is commended for stepping up her game as team captain. Meanwhile, Crystal Methyd, Dahlia Sin, and Nicky Doll receive negative critiques for their performances in the challenge, while Nicky receives high accolades for her runway with both Crystal and Dahlia garnering mixed reviews. Ultimately, Sherry Pie is declared the winner of the challenge, while Nicky Doll and Dahlia Sin are declared the bottom two and duel to a lipsync to [[Ariana Grande]] and [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\"; Nicky wins the lip sync, eliminating Dahlia who hastily leaves the stage.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Olivia Munn]]\n*'''Alternating Judges:''' [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Queer-Peer Assessment\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Improv in a talent competition, called \"World's Worst\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Buttons and Bows\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/drag-race-sherry-pie-disqualification-win.html|title=Here\u2019s How RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Is Dealing With Its Sherry Pie Problem|date=March 13, 2020|first=Rebecca|last=Alter|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n*'''Bottom Two''': Dahlia Sin and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\" by [[Ariana Grande]] ft.

Gigi Goode is declared the winner and RuPaul announces that this weeks maxi challenge is a ball-themed ball (known as The Ball Ball) where the queens need to participate in three categories: Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza. The queens must make the final look from scratch having already brought looks for the other two categories. As the queens are preparing, Nicky Doll expresses her bewilderment with not being able to bring her silly side to the runway and feeling so reserved in front of the judges, despite being freely goofy and comedic in the werkroom, and vows to change that, while Rock M. Sakura tells the others about how her makeup style, resemblant of [[Kim Chi (drag queen)|Kim Chi]] and [[Trixie Mattel]], originated from racist remarks against her supposed work-ethic as a drag queen. Tensions rise when Aiden Zhane proceeds to take a nap after she finishes her final runway look far ahead of everyone else, irritating the other queens as they feel she isn't working as hard as them to push and elevate their drag in order to win the competition.\n\nOn the main stage, the girls present all of their outfits and Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll receive positive feedback from the judges on all their outfits, but Nicky is once again critiqued for presenting herself too stiff onstage and is encouraged to continue to let go and do weird things. Meanwhile, Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Rock M. Sakura are negatively critiqued by the judges. Aiden is told her Lady Baller runway is a \"home run\" but is heavily clocked by Michelle for doing nothing more than gluing balls to a corset for her Eleganza look and her last two looks being far too simple. Rock M. meanwhile is praised for her creativity but is critiqued for doing too much particularly on her Eleganza runway and not editing her aesthetic, and Brita receives overall mediocre feedback, particularly for her Balls to the Wall creation. After the judges deliberate, Gigi Goode is announced as the winner of the challenge, while Brita and Rock M. Sakura face off in a lip sync to \"[[S&M (song)|S&M]]\" by [[Rihanna]]. Brita is the winner of the lip sync and Rock M. is eliminated from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' \"The Beehive Jive\" dance competition\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' A $2,500 cash tip\n*'''Main Challenge:'''  Create three looks based on Sports Balls; Lady Baller, Basketball Wife Realness, and Balls to the Wall Eleganza\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip \n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Rock M.

Sakura's elimination, with Jackie Cox and Brita emotional over Rock M.'s departure. The queens sit on the couch, discussing Gigi Goode's win, and Nicky Doll's constant criticism from the judges for being unable to show a lighthearted, comedic side of her. Aiden Zhane discusses her performance in last week's ball, defending her looks while Jaida Essence Hall admonishes Aiden for making excuses, saying that she should have been in the bottom two. The queens disperse, with Heidi N Closet and Widow Von'Du discussing Aiden's overall performance in the competition.\n\nThe next morning, the queens enter the workroom and RuPaul informs the queens that they will be acting in a ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' parody titled \"''Gay's Anatomy''\". The queens randomly select pills to decide which two queens will get to assign roles, and Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll choose the winning pills. The queens discuss which parts they want, and most of the queens end up getting the roles they requested. However, Aiden Zhane and Widow Von'Du receive different roles to their dismay. [[Carson Kressley]] directs the skit, and critiques Jaida Essence Hall for not being able to deliver her lines, Brita for inconsistent acting, and Nicky for being low energy. He gives praise to Gigi for her acting, Widow for incorporating improv into her performance, and to Aiden for following his direction. \n\nOn the main stage, with [[Normani]] as a guest judge, the queens walk the runway wearing capes. The queens see the final cut of ''Gay's Anatomy''. Aiden Zhane, Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, Jan, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are the best of the week, with Sherry Pie being the winner, while Brita, Crystal Methyd, Heidi N Closet, Jaida Essence Hall, and Nicky Doll were overshadowed. Crystal receives positive critiques for her runway and performance and is the first to be deemed safe. Jaida receives lukewarm reception for her performance, but is praised for her runway and is declared safe. Brita receives mixed reviews for her performance and is the last queen to be deemed safe. This leaves Nicky and Heidi in the bottom, as they both receive negative reviews on their runway looks and for their performance in ''Gay's Anatomy''. The two queens lipsync to \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]], Heidi N Closet is the winner, and Nicky Doll sashays away.\n*'''Guest Judge:''' [[Normani]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' Pink Pill or Silver Pill\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Nicky Doll\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' Assigning the roles for the main challenge\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Overact in ''Gay's Anatomy'', a parody of the popular TV show ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', which focuses on a group of young doctors that work in a hospital.\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Planet of the Capes\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Sherry Pie</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip ''(VH1 and World of Wonder donated $5,000 to [[The Trevor Project]] as a result of Sherry Pie's disqualification from the competition.)''\n*'''Bottom Two''': Heidi N Closet and Nicky Doll\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Heart to Break]]\" by [[Kim Petras]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Nicky Doll</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"I may not have gotten a crown.

Brita rehashes the drama between her and Aiden, with Aiden exhausted over Brita's attitude.\n\nFor the main challenge, RuPaul announces that the queens will be participating in the Snatch Game. He brings in [[Vanessa Vanjie Mateo]] to give tips on what to do and what not to do during Snatch Game. The Snatch Game characters are as followed: Aiden Zhane as [[Patricia Quinn]]; Brita as [[Jennifer Holliday]]; Crystal Methyd as [[Poppy (entertainer)|Poppy]]; Gigi Goode as \"[[Sophia (robot)|Maria the Robot]]\"; Heidi N Closet as [[Leslie Jones (comedian)|Leslie Jones]]; Jackie Cox as [[Lisa Rinna]]; Jan as [[Bernadette Peters]]; Jaida Essence Hall as [[Cardi B]]; Sherry Pie as [[Katharine Hepburn]]; and, Widow Von'Du as [[Tina Turner]] and [[Ike Turner]].\n\nFor the runway, the category is Frozen Eleganza, inspired by the [[Frozen (musical)|Broadway musical of the same name]]. On the main stage, Heidi N Closet, Jan, Jaida Essence Hall, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Gigi Goode, Jackie Cox, and Sherry Pie are given glowing critiques over their runways, with Gigi receiving commendations from RuPaul herself for exceeding expectations. Aiden Zhane, Brita, and Crystal Methyd receive negative critiques over their performances, with the latter two receiving positive feedback over their runways.\n\nGigi Goode is declared the winner of the challenge, with Aiden Zhane and Brita in the bottom two.

Some of the queens, notably Brita, say how proud they are of how Aiden did in the competition, with Widow Von'Du claiming they were being fake after the criticism Aiden had previously received at various times. The queens rehash some of the critical comments made during the previous week\u2019s Untucked episode, with notable conflict between Gigi Goode and Heidi N Closet and well as between Jackie Cox and Widow.\n\nAt the start of the next day, the tension remains. RuPaul enters the workroom and tells the queens that the week\u2019s maxi-challenge is called \u201cMadonna: The Unauthorized Rusical.\u201d For the challenge, the queens will have to sing lyrics and learn choreography for a musical chronicling [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]\u2019s life and career. RuPaul leaves the queens to assign themselves roles for the musical, and after some discussion, the queens decide on the following roles: Jan as Early Madonna, Jackie as Boy Toy Madonna, Gigi as Unapologetic Madonna, Brita as Cone Bra Madonna, Jaida Essence Hall as Sex Madonna, Sherry Pie as Movie Star Madonna, Crystal Methyd as Enlightened Madonna, Widow as Fempire Madonna, and Heidi as Forever Madonna. Michelle Visage helps the queens work with music producers Erik Paparozzi and David Benjamin Steinberg to record their lyrics. Later, the queens work with Jamal Sims on their group and individual choreography for the performance.\n\nOn the main stage, the queens perform the Rusical and show their looks for the runway theme: Night of a Thousand Michelle Visages. Jaida Essence Hall, Sherry Pie, and Widow Von'Du are declared safe. Crystal Methyd, Gigi Goode, and Jan all receive positive critiques for their performances and runway looks. Brita and Jackie Cox receive positive critiques for their runway looks, but negative critiques for their performances. Heidi N Closet received mixed critiques for both her performance and runway look.\n\nAfter deliberating with the other judges, RuPaul declares Gigi to be the winner of the week\u2019s challenge with Heidi and Brita being placed the bottom two, the latter for the third time. The pair lip sync to the Madonna song \"Burning Up\", RuPaul then declares that Heidi won the lip sync, eliminating Brita from the competition.\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] and [[Winnie Harlow]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Carson Kressley]]\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Madonna: The Unauthorized Rusical\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Night of a Thousand Michelle Visages\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Gigi Goode</span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Bottom Two''': Brita and Heidi N Closet\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]\" by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Brita</span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"SIS.

Jan, who is close friends with Brita, is visibly upset and in tears since Brita is no longer in the competition. Some of the queens, such as Jaida Essence Hall, suspect that Jan is perhaps more upset that she didn\u2019t win that week\u2019s challenge like many of the other queens expected she would.\n\nThe next day in the workroom, RuPaul pairs the queens up to compete in the week\u2019s mini-challenge: Gigi Goode and Jackie Cox, Crystal Methyd and Jaida, Jan and Heidi N Closet, and Widow Von'Du and Sherry Pie. The queens have to curate a box of products from the company FabFitFun to exchange with another pair of queens, using a lot of shade and backhanded compliments. Gigi and Jackie win the mini-challenge, each winning a $1,000 cash tip and a one year subscription to FabFitFun.\n\nFor the main challenge, the queens are tasked with creating an extravagant and unnecessary product fitting their personal brand, and shooting an [[infomercial]] to sell their product, for the fictional drag queen lifestyle brand called Droop. After the queens start their work, RuPaul and personal trainer Bob Harper drop by to share ideas and give feedback on the queens\u2019 products. Harper later directs the queens as they record their infomercials. The products the queens create are:\n\n* Crystal Methyd: The Magic Mullet, a collection of [[Mullet (haircut)|mullets]]\n* Gigi Goode: Goode Night Bitch, a fragrance and sleeping aid\n* Heidi N Closet: Heidi\u2019s Hydrates Multipurpose Lotion, a hydrating lotion\n* Jackie Cox: Jackie\u2019s Magic Carpet Merkins, a collection of [[Merkin|merkins]]\n* Jaida Essence Hall: Luxuratuck, diamond-encrusted panties\n* Jan: Sure, Jan, a personal style spray\n* Sherry Pie: Sherry Pie\u2019s Aura Pie, an expensive pie that improves one's [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]\n* Widow Von'Du: Throat\u00e9, a throat coating spray\n\nOn the main stage, the runway theme is Black Wedding. The judges watch each of the queens\u2019 infomercials and critique their runway looks. All eight queens receive positive critiques for their runway looks, with particular praise given to Crystal, Gigi, and Heidi. Jaida and Heidi receive glowing critiques for their commercials with Crystal and Jackie also garnering extremely positive feedback. The rest of the queens  receive negative feedback for their commercials, with the harshest critiques going to Jan and Widow. RuPaul then asks all queens which of their competitors should go home and why. Widow says that Jan should go home, while all of the other queens say Widow should.\n\nAfter deliberating, Heidi is declared the winner of the challenge, while Jan and Widow lip sync to the Chaka Khan song \"This is My Night\". RuPaul declares that Widow won the lip sync, leaving Jan to sashay away.\n*'''Guest Judges:''' [[Chaka Kahn]]\n*'''Alternating Judge:''' [[Ross Mathews]]\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge:''' In pairs, curate a box of FabFitFun products for another duo, then gift it to them with shade\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Winners:''' Gigi Goode and Jackie Cox\n*'''Mini\u2013Challenge Prize:''' A $1,000 cash tip and a 1 year subscription to FabFitFun\n*'''Main Challenge:''' Create and market products for the new drag queen lifestyle brand \"Droop\"\n*'''Runway Theme:''' Black Wedding\n*<span style=\"color:royalblue\">'''Challenge Winner:''' Heidi N Closet </span>\n*'''Main Challenge Prize''': A $5,000 cash tip\n*'''Bottom Two''': Jan and Widow Von'Du\n*'''Lip Sync Song''': \"[[This Is My Night|This Is My Night]]\" by [[Chaka Khan|Chaka Khan]]\n* <span style=\"color:red\">'''Eliminated:''' Jan </span>\n*'''Farewell message''': ''\"Sisters, I'am so happy I got to share this experience with you.

The Red Hawks name was never much liked by the student body; a Red Hawk mascot was frequently taunted by fans who threw objects at him and chanted, \"kill the chicken!\". Finally, in 2009 the nickname was changed back to Engineers. In contrast, the official ice hockey mascot, Puckman (an anthropomorphic hockey puck with an engineer's helmet) has always been very popular.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, one RPI cheer was:\n:''E to the x, dy/dx, E to the x, dx''\n:''Cosine, secant, tangent, sine''\n:''3.14159''\n:''Square root, cube root, log of pi''\n:''Disintegrate them, RPI!''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stutt.net/rensselaer/doku.php?id=cheers:e_to_the_x |title=E to the X |publisher=RPI Information |accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001016.php|title=Witness's recollection of the cheer originating at RPI|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lacrosse at the Olympics, London, 1948.

Men's sports include baseball, football, and golf. Women's sports include field hockey, and softball.

The Red Hawks name was never much liked by the student body; a Red Hawk mascot was frequently taunted by fans who threw objects at him and chanted, \"kill the chicken!\". Finally, in 2009 the nickname was changed back to Engineers. In contrast, the official ice hockey mascot, Puckman (an anthropomorphic hockey puck with an engineer's helmet) has always been very popular.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, one RPI cheer was:\n:''E to the x, dy/dx, E to the x, dx''\n:''Cosine, secant, tangent, sine''\n:''3.14159''\n:''Square root, cube root, log of pi''\n:''Disintegrate them, RPI!''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stutt.net/rensselaer/doku.php?id=cheers:e_to_the_x |title=E to the X |publisher=RPI Information |accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.languagehat.com/archives/001016.php|title=Witness's recollection of the cheer originating at RPI|accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lacrosse at the Olympics, London, 1948.

(No RPI Engineer has played in the majors, but Dave Lohrman and Bill Snyder, who were both drafted in 1997, made it as far as AAA ball.) The team is coached by Karl Steffen (Ithaca '78). The Engineers play their home games at the historic Robison Field.\n\n===Football===\nAmerican rugby was played on campus in the late 1870s. Intercollegiate football begin as late as 1886 when an RPI team first played a Union College team on a leased field in West Troy (Watervliet). Since 1903, RPI and nearby Union have been rivals in football, making it the oldest such rivalry in the state. The teams have played for the [[Dutchman's Shoes]] since 1950. RPI Football had their most successful season in 2003, when they finished 11-2 and lost to St. Johns (Minn.) in the NCAA Division III semi final game.<ref>{{cite web|last=DiTursi|first=Dan|title=Football 2003: A season to remember|date = 2004-01-14|url=http://poly.rpi.edu/old/article_view.php3?view=2739&part=1|accessdate=18 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Track and Field===\nThe track and field team competes as part of NCAA Division 3 and the Liberty League.\n\n===Athletic facilities===\n[[File:RPIHoustonFieldHouse.jpg|thumb|Houston Field House]]\n[[File:RPIAthleticVillage.jpg|thumb|300px|East Campus Athletic Village, under construction]]\n{{see also|Houston Field House}}\nThe Houston Field House is a 4,780\u2011seat multi-purpose arena located on the RPI campus.
