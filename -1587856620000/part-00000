It is the [[List of New York City parks|fifth-largest park in New York City]] by area, covering {{convert|843|acre|km2|abbr=}}. Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 37.5\u201338 million visitors annually, as well as one of the most filmed locations in the world. \n\nFollowing proposals for a large park in Manhattan during the 1840s, Central Park was first approved in 1853 as a {{convert|778|acre|km2|adj=on|abbr=}} park. In 1857, landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and architect/landscape designer [[Calvert Vaux]] won a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] to construct the park with a plan they titled the \"Greensward Plan\". Construction began the same year, and the park's first areas were opened to the public in late 1858. Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was purchased in 1859, and the park was completed in 1876. After a period of decline in the early 20th&nbsp;century, New York City parks commissioner [[Robert Moses]] started a program to clean up Central Park. Another decline in the late 20th&nbsp;century spurred the creation of the [[Central Park Conservancy]] in 1980, which refurbished many parts of the park during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe park's main attractions include landscapes such as [[the Ramble and Lake]], [[the Pond and Hallett Nature Sanctuary|Hallett Nature Sanctuary]], the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir]], and [[Sheep Meadow]]; amusement attractions such as [[Wollman Rink]], [[Central Park Carousel]], and the [[Central Park Zoo]]; formal spaces such as the [[Central Park Mall]] and [[Bethesda Terrace and Fountain|Bethesda Terrace]]; and the [[Delacorte Theater]], which hosts [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park]] programs in the summer. The park also contains sports facilities including the [[North Meadow Recreation Center]], basketball courts, and baseball and soccer fields.\n\nCentral Park was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1963 and as a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City scenic landmark]] in 1974. The park is owned by the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] (NYC Parks) but has been managed by the Central Park Conservancy since 1998, under a contract with the municipal government in a public-private partnership. The Conservancy, a non-profit organization, contributes 75%&nbsp;of Central Park's $65&nbsp;million annual budget and is responsible for all basic care of the park.\n\n== {{anchor|Geography|Design and layout}} Description ==\n{{Central Park map||zoom=13|width=300|height=300}}\n\nCentral Park is bordered on the north by [[110th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park North]] (110th&nbsp;Street) and the neighborhood of [[Harlem]]; on the south by [[59th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park South]] (59th&nbsp;Street) and [[Midtown Manhattan]]; on the west by [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Central Park West]] (Eighth Avenue) and the [[Upper West Side]]; and on the east by [[Fifth Avenue]] and the [[Upper East Side]].

Such a viewpoint was reinforced following a 1941 incident when 12-year-old Jerome Dore fatally stabbed 15-year-old James O'Connell in the northern section of the park. Local tabloids cited this incident and several other crimes as evidence of a highly exaggerated \"crime wave\". Though recorded crime had indeed increased since Central Park opened in the late 1850s, this was in line with crime trends seen in the rest of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=471\u2013473|ignore-err=yes}}</ref> Central Park's reputation for crime was reinforced by its worldwide name recognition, and the fact that crimes in the park were covered disproportionately compared to crimes in the rest of the city. For instance, in 1973 ''The New York Times'' wrote stories about 20%&nbsp;of murders that occurred citywide but wrote about three of the four murders that took place in Central Park that year. By the 1970s and 1980s, the number of murders in the police precincts north of Central Park was 18&nbsp;times higher than the number of murders within the park itself, and even in the precincts south of the park, the number of murders was three times as high.<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 474\u2013475\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=474\u2013475|ignore-err=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe park was the site of numerous high-profile crimes during the late 20th&nbsp;century.

It is the [[List of New York City parks|fifth-largest park in New York City]] by area, covering {{convert|843|acre|km2|abbr=}}. Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States, with an estimated 37.5\u201338 million visitors annually, as well as one of the most filmed locations in the world. \n\nFollowing proposals for a large park in Manhattan during the 1840s, Central Park was first approved in 1853 as a {{convert|778|acre|km2|adj=on|abbr=}} park. In 1857, landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and architect/landscape designer [[Calvert Vaux]] won a [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] to construct the park with a plan they titled the \"Greensward Plan\". Construction began the same year, and the park's first areas were opened to the public in late 1858. Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was purchased in 1859, and the park was completed in 1876. After a period of decline in the early 20th&nbsp;century, New York City parks commissioner [[Robert Moses]] started a program to clean up Central Park. Another decline in the late 20th&nbsp;century spurred the creation of the [[Central Park Conservancy]] in 1980, which refurbished many parts of the park during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe park's main attractions include landscapes such as [[the Ramble and Lake]], [[the Pond and Hallett Nature Sanctuary|Hallett Nature Sanctuary]], the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir]], and [[Sheep Meadow]]; amusement attractions such as [[Wollman Rink]], [[Central Park Carousel]], and the [[Central Park Zoo]]; formal spaces such as the [[Central Park Mall]] and [[Bethesda Terrace and Fountain|Bethesda Terrace]]; and the [[Delacorte Theater]], which hosts [[Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)|Shakespeare in the Park]] programs in the summer. The park also contains sports facilities including the [[North Meadow Recreation Center]], basketball courts, and baseball and soccer fields.\n\nCentral Park was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1963 and as a [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission|New York City scenic landmark]] in 1974. The park is owned by the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]] (NYC Parks) but has been managed by the Central Park Conservancy since 1998, under a contract with the municipal government in a public-private partnership. The Conservancy, a non-profit organization, contributes 75%&nbsp;of Central Park's $65&nbsp;million annual budget and is responsible for all basic care of the park.\n\n== {{anchor|Geography|Design and layout}} Description ==\n{{Central Park map||zoom=13|width=300|height=300}}\n\nCentral Park is bordered on the north by [[110th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park North]] (110th&nbsp;Street) and the neighborhood of [[Harlem]]; on the south by [[59th Street (Manhattan)|Central Park South]] (59th&nbsp;Street) and [[Midtown Manhattan]]; on the west by [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Central Park West]] (Eighth Avenue) and the [[Upper West Side]]; and on the east by [[Fifth Avenue]] and the [[Upper East Side]].

Such a viewpoint was reinforced following a 1941 incident when 12-year-old Jerome Dore fatally stabbed 15-year-old James O'Connell in the northern section of the park. Local tabloids cited this incident and several other crimes as evidence of a highly exaggerated \"crime wave\". Though recorded crime had indeed increased since Central Park opened in the late 1850s, this was in line with crime trends seen in the rest of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=471\u2013473|ignore-err=yes}}</ref> Central Park's reputation for crime was reinforced by its worldwide name recognition, and the fact that crimes in the park were covered disproportionately compared to crimes in the rest of the city. For instance, in 1973 ''The New York Times'' wrote stories about 20%&nbsp;of murders that occurred citywide but wrote about three of the four murders that took place in Central Park that year. By the 1970s and 1980s, the number of murders in the police precincts north of Central Park was 18&nbsp;times higher than the number of murders within the park itself, and even in the precincts south of the park, the number of murders was three times as high.<ref name=\"Rosenzweig Blackmar pp. 474\u2013475\">{{harvnb|ps=.|Rosenzweig|Blackmar|1992|pages=474\u2013475|ignore-err=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe park was the site of numerous high-profile crimes during the late 20th&nbsp;century.
