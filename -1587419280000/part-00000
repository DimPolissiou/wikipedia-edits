[[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] accordingly instructed the [[Governor of Massachusetts]], [[John A.

Many of these officers were of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] families and several were chosen by Governor Andrew himself. Lt. Col. Norwood Hallowell was joined by his younger brother [[Edward Needles Hallowell]] who commanded the 54th as a full colonel for the rest of the war after Shaw's death. Twenty-four of the 29 officers were veterans, but only six had been previously commissioned.{{sfn| Emilio| 1995 | p=6}}\n\nThe soldiers were recruited by black abolitionists like [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Martin Delany|Major Martin Robison Delany, M.D.]], and white abolitionists, including Shaw's parents. Lieutenant J.

Stephens]], African-American military correspondent to the ''Weekly Anglo-African'' who recruited over 200 men in Philadelphia and would go on to serve as a First Sergeant in the 54th.{{sfn|Shepard|2017|pp=37-39}}\n\nThe 54th trained at [[Camp Meigs]] in [[Readville, Massachusetts|Readville]] near [[Boston]]. While there they received considerable moral support from abolitionists in Massachusetts, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].{{sfn| Emilio| 1995| pp=15\u201316}} Material support included warm clothing items, battle flags and $500 contributed for the equipping and training of a regimental band. As it became evident that many more recruits were coming forward than were needed, the medical exam for the 54th was described as \"rigid and thorough\" by the Massachusetts Surgeon-General. This resulted in what he described as \"a more robust, strong and healthy set of men were never mustered into the service of the United States.\"{{sfn | Emilio | 1995 | pp=19\u201320}} Despite this, as was common in the Civil War, a few men died of disease prior to the 54th's departure from Camp Meigs.{{sfn | Emilio | 1894 | pp=339-388}}\n\nBy most accounts the 54th left Boston with very high morale. This was despite the fact that [[Jefferson Davis]]'s proclamation of December 23, 1862, effectively put both African-American enlisted men and white officers under a death sentence if captured on the grounds that they were inciting servile insurrection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/pow.htm |title=Jefferson Davis's Proclamation Regarding Captured Black Soldiers, December 23, 1862 |work=  |publisher=[[University of Maryland, College Park]]|accessdate=2008-07-18|url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025133641/http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/pow.htm |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df=}}</ref>\n\nAfter muster into federal service on May 13, 1863,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battle-units-detail.htm?battleUnitCode=UMA0054RI00C|title=Battle Unit Details - The Civil War (U.S. National Park Service)|publisher=}}</ref> the 54th left Boston with fanfare on May 28, and arrived to more celebrations in [[Beaufort, South Carolina]].

The Union attack on James Island was intended to draw Confederate troops away from [[Fort Wagner]] in anticipation of an upcoming Union assault on the fort. During the Battle of Grimball's Landing, the 54th Massachusetts stopped a Confederate advance, taking 45 casualties in the process.{{sfn|Emilio|1894|pp=63}}\n\nIn an account of the engagement which was later published, First Sergeant [[Robert John Simmons]] of the 54th Massachusetts described a \"desperate battle\" in which about 250 [[picket (military)|pickets]] of the regiment were attacked by about 900 Confederates. He estimated that the Confederates in their front were supported by a reserve of 3,000 men. The 54th Massachusetts stopped the Confederate advance then, as he described, \"had to fire and retreat toward our own encampment.\"<ref>[http://54th-mass.org/tag/bcf/ 54th Mass.org]</ref>\n\nAfter the engagement, their division commander, Brig. Gen. [[Alfred H. Terry]], complimented \"steadiness and soldierly conduct\" of 54th Massachusetts by courier to Col. Shaw and in his official report of the action. This recognition raised the morale of the regiment.{{sfn|Emilio|1894|pp=62-63}}\n\n==Battle of Fort Wagner==\n[[File:William Harvey Carney c1864.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[William Harvey Carney]] circa 1864]]The regiment gained widespread acclaim on July 18, 1863, when it spearheaded an assault on Fort Wagner, a key position overlooking the water approach to [[Charleston Harbor]]. The 54th Massachusetts numbered 600 men at the time of the assault. Of these, 270 were killed, wounded, or captured during the engagement. Col. Shaw was killed, along with 29 of his men; 24 more later died of wounds, 15 were captured, 52 were missing in action and never accounted for, and 149 were wounded. These casualties represented the highest in the history of the regiment during a single engagement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals/54thmass.html|title=Exhibit: 54th Mass Casualty List|work=|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|year=1996|accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Union forces were not able to take and hold the fort (despite taking a portion of the ramparts in the initial assault), the 54th was widely acclaimed for its valor during the battle, and the event helped encourage the further enlistment and mobilization of African-American troops, a key development that President [[Abraham Lincoln]] once noted as helping to secure the final victory. Decades later, Sergeant [[William Harvey Carney]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for grabbing the U.S. flag as the flag bearer fell, carrying the flag to the enemy ramparts and back, and singing \"[[Boys the Old Flag Never Touched the Ground|Boys, the old flag never touched the ground]]!\" While other African Americans had since been granted the award by the time it was presented to Carney, Carney's is the earliest action for which the Medal of Honor was awarded to an African American.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henig|first1=Gerald S.|title=Glory at Battery Wagner: William H.

During the retreat, the unit was suddenly ordered to counter-march back to Ten-Mile station.  The locomotive of a train carrying wounded Union soldiers had broken down and the wounded were in danger of capture. When the 54th arrived, the men attached ropes to the engine and cars and manually pulled the train approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} to Camp Finnegan, where horses were secured to help pull the train. After that, the train was pulled by both men and horses to Jacksonville for a total distance of {{convert| 10 |mi|km|spell=in}}. It took forty-two hours to pull the train that distance.{{sfn | Emilio | 1995| pp=1\u20135}}\n\nAs part of an all-black brigade under Col. [[Alfred S. Hartwell]], they unsuccessfully attacked entrenched Confederate [[militia]] at the November 1864 [[Battle of Honey Hill]]. In mid-April 1865, they fought at the [[Battle of Boykin's Mill]], a small affair in South Carolina that proved to be one of the last engagements of the war.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Pay controversy==\nThe enlisted men of the 54th were recruited on the promise of pay and allowances equal to their white counterparts. This was supposed to amount to subsistence and $13 a month.{{sfn| Emilio | 1991| pp=viii\u2013ix, 8\u20139}} Instead, they were informed upon arriving in South Carolina, the Department of the South would pay them only $7 per month ($10 with $3 withheld for clothing, while white soldiers did not pay for clothing at all.){{sfn|Rose| 1964 | p=261}} Colonel Shaw and many others immediately began protesting the measure.{{sfn| Emilio| 1995 | pp=47\u201348, 109}} Although the state of Massachusetts offered to make up the difference in pay, on principle, a regiment-wide boycott of the pay tables on paydays became the norm.{{sfn| Emilio| 1995| pp=130\u2013131, 136\u2013138}}\n\nAfter Shaw's death at Fort Wagner, Colonel [[Edward Needles Hallowell]] took up the fight to get full pay for the troops.{{sfn| McPherson| 1964| pp= 217\u2013218}} Lt.

In fact, at the [[Battle of Olustee]], when ordered forward to protect the retreat of the Union forces, the men moved forward shouting, \"Massachusetts and Seven Dollars a Month!\"{{sfn| Emilio| 1995| pp=1\u20135}}\n\nThe Congressional bill, enacted on June 16, 1864, authorized equal and full pay to those enlisted troops who had been free men as of April 19, 1861. Of course not all the troops qualified. Colonel Hallowell, a Quaker, rationalized that because he did not believe in slavery he could therefore have all the troops swear that they were free men on April 19, 1861. Before being given their back pay the entire regiment was administered what became known as \"the Quaker oath\".{{sfn| McPherson| 1964| pp=217\u2013218}} Colonel Hallowell skillfully crafted the oath to say: \"You do solemnly swear that you owed no man unrequited labor on or before the 19th day of April 1861.

[[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Edwin M. Stanton]] accordingly instructed the [[Governor of Massachusetts]], [[John A.

Many of these officers were of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] families and several were chosen by Governor Andrew himself. Lt. Col. Norwood Hallowell was joined by his younger brother [[Edward Needles Hallowell]] who commanded the 54th as a full colonel for the rest of the war after Shaw's death. Twenty-four of the 29 officers were veterans, but only six had been previously commissioned.{{sfn| Emilio| 1995 | p=6}}\n\nThe soldiers were recruited by black abolitionists like [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Martin Delany|Major Martin Robison Delany, M.D.]], and white abolitionists, including Shaw's parents.

Stephens]], African-American military correspondent to the ''Weekly Anglo-African'' who recruited over 200 men in Philadelphia and would go on to serve as a First Sergeant in the 54th.{{sfn|Shepard|2017|pp=37-39}}\n\nThe 54th trained at [[Camp Meigs]] in [[Readville, Massachusetts|Readville]] near [[Boston]]. While there they received considerable moral support from abolitionists in Massachusetts, including [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].{{sfn| Emilio| 1995| pp=15\u201316}} Material support included warm clothing items, battle flags and $500 contributed for the equipping and training of a regimental band. As it became evident that many more recruits were coming forward than were needed, the medical exam for the 54th was described as \"rigid and thorough\" by the Massachusetts Surgeon-General. This resulted in what he described as \"a more robust, strong and healthy set of men were never mustered into the service of the United States.\"{{sfn | Emilio | 1995 | pp=19\u201320}} Despite this, as was common in the Civil War, a few men died of disease prior to the 54th's departure from Camp Meigs.{{sfn | Emilio | 1894 | pp=339-388}}\n\nBy most accounts the 54th left Boston with very high morale. This was despite the fact that [[Jefferson Davis]]'s proclamation of December 23, 1862, effectively put both African-American enlisted men and white officers under a death sentence if captured on the grounds that they were inciting servile insurrection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/pow.htm |title=Jefferson Davis's Proclamation Regarding Captured Black Soldiers, December 23, 1862 |work=  |publisher=[[University of Maryland, College Park]]|accessdate=2008-07-18|url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025133641/http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/pow.htm |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df=}}</ref>\n\nAfter muster into federal service on May 13, 1863,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/search-battle-units-detail.htm?battleUnitCode=UMA0054RI00C|title=Battle Unit Details - The Civil War (U.S. National Park Service)|publisher=}}</ref> the 54th left Boston with fanfare on May 28, and arrived to more celebrations in [[Beaufort, South Carolina]].

The Union attack on James Island was intended to draw Confederate troops away from [[Fort Wagner]] in anticipation of an upcoming Union assault on the fort. During the Battle of Grimball's Landing, the 54th Massachusetts stopped a Confederate advance, taking 45 casualties in the process.{{sfn|Emilio|1894|pp=63}}\n\nIn an account of the engagement which was later published, First Sergeant [[Robert John Simmons]] of the 54th Massachusetts described a \"desperate battle\" in which about 250 [[picket (military)|pickets]] of the regiment were attacked by about 900 Confederates. He estimated that the Confederates in their front were supported by a reserve of 3,000 men. The 54th Massachusetts stopped the Confederate advance then, as he described, \"had to fire and retreat toward our own encampment.\"<ref>[http://54th-mass.org/tag/bcf/ 54th Mass.org]</ref>\n\nAfter the engagement, their division commander, Brig. Gen. [[Alfred H. Terry]], complimented \"steadiness and soldierly conduct\" of 54th Massachusetts by courier to Col. Shaw and in his official report of the action. This recognition raised the morale of the regiment.{{sfn|Emilio|1894|pp=62-63}}\n\n==Battle of Fort Wagner==\n[[File:William Harvey Carney c1864.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[William Harvey Carney]] circa 1864]]The regiment gained widespread acclaim on July 18, 1863, when it spearheaded an assault on Fort Wagner, a key position overlooking the water approach to [[Charleston Harbor]]. The 54th Massachusetts numbered 600 men at the time of the assault. Of these, 270 were killed, wounded, or captured during the engagement. Col. Shaw was killed, along with 29 of his men; 24 more later died of wounds, 15 were captured, 52 were missing in action and never accounted for, and 149 were wounded. These casualties represented the highest in the history of the regiment during a single engagement.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/american_originals/54thmass.html|title=Exhibit: 54th Mass Casualty List|work=|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|year=1996|accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Union forces were not able to take and hold the fort (despite taking a portion of the ramparts in the initial assault), the 54th was widely acclaimed for its valor during the battle, and the event helped encourage the further enlistment and mobilization of African-American troops, a key development that President [[Abraham Lincoln]] once noted as helping to secure the final victory. Decades later, Sergeant [[William Harvey Carney]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for grabbing the U.S. flag as the flag bearer fell, carrying the flag to the enemy ramparts and back, and singing \"[[Boys the Old Flag Never Touched the Ground|Boys, the old flag never touched the ground]]!\" While other African Americans had since been granted the award by the time it was presented to Carney, Carney's is the earliest action for which the Medal of Honor was awarded to an African American.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henig|first1=Gerald S.|title=Glory at Battery Wagner: William H.

During the retreat, the unit was suddenly ordered to counter-march back to Ten-Mile station.  The locomotive of a train carrying wounded Union soldiers had broken down and the wounded were in danger of capture. When the 54th arrived, the men attached ropes to the engine and cars and manually pulled the train approximately {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}} to Camp Finnegan, where horses were secured to help pull the train. After that, the train was pulled by both men and horses to Jacksonville for a total distance of {{convert| 10 |mi|km|spell=in}}. It took forty-two hours to pull the train that distance.{{sfn | Emilio | 1995| pp=1\u20135}}\n\nAs part of an all-black brigade under Col. [[Alfred S. Hartwell]], they unsuccessfully attacked entrenched Confederate [[militia]] at the November 1864 [[Battle of Honey Hill]]. In mid-April 1865, they fought at the [[Battle of Boykin's Mill]], a small affair in South Carolina that proved to be one of the last engagements of the war.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Pay controversy==\nThe enlisted men of the 54th were recruited on the promise of pay and allowances equal to their white counterparts. This was supposed to amount to subsistence and $13 a month.{{sfn| Emilio | 1991| pp=viii\u2013ix, 8\u20139}} Instead, they were informed upon arriving in South Carolina, the Department of the South would pay them only $7 per month ($10 with $3 withheld for clothing, while white soldiers did not pay for clothing at all.){{sfn|Rose| 1964 | p=261}} Colonel Shaw and many others immediately began protesting the measure.{{sfn| Emilio| 1995 | pp=47\u201348, 109}} Although the state of Massachusetts offered to make up the difference in pay, on principle, a regiment-wide boycott of the pay tables on paydays became the norm.{{sfn| Emilio| 1995| pp=130\u2013131, 136\u2013138}}\n\nAfter Shaw's death at Fort Wagner, Colonel [[Edward Needles Hallowell]] took up the fight to get full pay for the troops.{{sfn| McPherson| 1964| pp= 217\u2013218}} Lt. Col. Hooper took command of the regiment starting June 18, 1864.

In fact, at the [[Battle of Olustee]], when ordered forward to protect the retreat of the Union forces, the men moved forward shouting, \"Massachusetts and Seven Dollars a Month!\"{{sfn| Emilio| 1995| pp=1\u20135}}\n\nThe Congressional bill, enacted on June 16, 1864, authorized equal and full pay to those enlisted troops who had been free men as of April 19, 1861. Of course not all the troops qualified. Colonel Hallowell, a Quaker, rationalized that because he did not believe in slavery he could therefore have all the troops swear that they were free men on April 19, 1861. Before being given their back pay the entire regiment was administered what became known as \"the Quaker oath\".{{sfn| McPherson| 1964| pp=217\u2013218}} Colonel Hallowell skillfully crafted the oath to say: \"You do solemnly swear that you owed no man unrequited labor on or before the 19th day of April 1861.

Icarus and his father attempt to escape from [[Crete]] by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of [[hubris]], asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings nor the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned, sparking the idiom ''\"don't fly too close to the sun\"''.\n\nThis tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of [[Phaethon|Pha\u00ebthon]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Greek {{lang|grc|\u1f3c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}} is more directly transliterated into English as '''Ikaros'''. In [[Latin]], the name becomes '''{{lang|la|Icarus}}''' ({{IPA-la|\u02c8i\u02d0kar\u028as}}); by convention it is the Latin name that is most often used in English. The Greek name is thought to have come from an earlier {{lang|grc|*\u03dc\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}} (''W\u012b&#769;karos''); this would be reflected in Icarus' [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name, which was ''Vikare''.<ref>Larissa Bonfante, Judith Swaddling, ''Etruscan Myths'', p. 43</ref>\n\n==The legend==\n[[File:Herbert Draper - The Lament for Icarus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Lament for Icarus]]'' (1898) by [[Herbert James Draper|H.

Minos imprisoned Daedalus himself in the labyrinth because he gave Minos's daughter, [[Ariadne]], a [[wikt:clew|clew]]<!--please do not change this to 'cklue'; it's a 'clew,' a ball of string; see wiktionary link--><ref>[[wiktionary:clew|clew]]&nbsp;\u2013 a ball of yarn or thread.

Daedalus tried his wings first, but before trying to escape the island, he warned his son not to fly too close to the sun, nor too close to the sea, but to follow his path of flight. Overcome by the giddiness that flying lent him, Icarus soared into the sky, but in the process, he came too close to the sun, which due to the [[heat]] melted the wax. Icarus kept flapping his wings but soon realized that he had no feathers left and that he was only flapping his bare arms, and so Icarus fell into the sea and drowned in the area which today bears his name, the [[Icarian Sea]] near [[Icaria]], an island southwest of [[Samos]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Graves|authorlink=Robert Graves|year=1955|title=[[The Greek Myths]]|chapter=92&nbsp;\u2013 Daedalus and Talus|isbn=0-14-007602-6}}</ref><ref>[[Thomas Bullfinch]] - The Age of Fable Stories of Gods and Heroes [http://www.kundaliniawakeningsystems1.com/downloads/thomas-bulfinchs-mythology-age-of-fable-vols1&2.pdf ''KundaliniAwakeningSystem.com''] & The Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C.

Icarus and his father attempt to escape from [[Crete]] by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of [[hubris]], asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings nor the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun; when the wax in his wings melted he tumbled out of the sky and fell into the sea where he drowned, sparking the idiom ''\"don't fly too close to the sun\"''.\n\n==Name==\nThe Greek {{lang|grc|\u1f3c\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}} is more directly transliterated into English as '''Ikaros'''. In [[Latin]], the name becomes '''{{lang|la|Icarus}}''' ({{IPA-la|\u02c8i\u02d0kar\u028as}}); by convention it is the Latin name that is most often used in English.

Minos imprisoned Daedalus himself in the labyrinth because he gave Minos's daughter, [[Ariadne]], a [[wikt:clew|clew]]<!--please do not change this to 'cklue'; it's a 'clew,' a ball of string; see wiktionary link--><ref>[[wiktionary:clew|clew]]&nbsp;\u2013 a ball of yarn or thread.

Daedalus tried his wings first, but before trying to escape the island, he warned his son not to fly too close to the sun, nor too close to the sea, but to follow his path of flight. Overcome by the giddiness that flying lent him, Icarus soared into the sky, but in the process, he came too close to the sun, which due to the [[heat]] melted the wax. Icarus kept flapping his wings but soon realized that he had no feathers left and that he was only flapping his bare arms, and so Icarus fell into the sea and drowned in the area which today bears his name, the [[Icarian Sea]] near [[Icaria]], an island southwest of [[Samos]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Graves|authorlink=Robert Graves|year=1955|title=[[The Greek Myths]]|chapter=92&nbsp;\u2013 Daedalus and Talus|isbn=0-14-007602-6}}</ref><ref>[[Thomas Bullfinch]] - The Age of Fable Stories of Gods and Heroes [http://www.kundaliniawakeningsystems1.com/downloads/thomas-bulfinchs-mythology-age-of-fable-vols1&2.pdf ''KundaliniAwakeningSystem.com''] & The Internet Classics Archive by Daniel C.
