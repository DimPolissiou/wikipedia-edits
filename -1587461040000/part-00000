Sarah Schenirer concluded that only providing young Jewish women with a thorough, school-based Jewish education would effectively combat this phenomenon. She started a school of her own, trained other women to teach, and set up similar schools in other cities throughout [[Europe]].\n\nShe obtained the approval of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (author of ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]''), who issued a [[responsum]] holding that contemporary conditions required departing from traditional prohibitions on teaching women Torah and accepting the view that it was permitted. Following the Chofetz Chaim's approbation, the Bais Yaakov Movement in Poland was taken under the wing of [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]]. Additionally, she sought and received approbation from [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] rabbis as well, most notably the [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer rebbe)|Belzer Rebbe]] and the [[Avraham Mordechai Alter|Gerrer Rebbe]].<ref>\"From Sarah to Sarah\" by S.

These run various courses generally lasting between one and three years. There are also post-secondary schools that combine Torah education with practical workforce skills, such as computer programming, education, and graphic arts.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Bais Yaakov comes from a verse in the [[Book of Exodus]] in which the term \"House of Jacob\" is understood by [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] to refer to the female segment of the Jewish nation.<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus|19:3}}</ref>\n\n== Current ==\n=== Educational approach ===\nThe educational policies of most Bais Yaakov schools worldwide is generally that of [[Haredi Judaism]] and the [[Agudath Israel movement]]. In accordance with the differences between the Israeli and Diaspora Haredi communities, there are slight variations in outlook and philosophy between Israeli, American and European Bais Yaakov schools. Israeli Bais Yaakov schools tend to de-emphasize the secular content of the [[curriculum]], whereas in North America and Europe the girls frequently receive a more diverse secular education. Large cities may have several Bais Yaakov schools, each with small variations in philosophy, typically over the importance placed on secular studies and/or accommodations made to secular values.\n\nStudents are required to uphold a dress code or wear uniforms which conform to the rules of ''[[tzniut|tznius]]'' (modesty). Uniforms differ from school to school but typically consist of a long pleated skirt, [[oxford shirt]], and sweater or sweatshirt.\n\nThe schools' primary purpose is to prepare students to be contributors to family and community, as good [[Jew]]s, wives, professionals, and mothers. \n\nSecular studies sometimes reflect government proficiency requirements in such subjects as math, science, literature and history in their respective countries.\n\n=== Curriculum ===\n:''See also: [[Midrasha #Curriculum]]; [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]].''\nMost non-Hasidic Bais Yaakov schools in America teach Judaic studies in the mornings and a college preparatory program of secular studies in the afternoons. Judaic studies usually include study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] ([[Pentateuch]]), [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets), and other parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]]; and instruction in [[Hebrew language]], [[Jewish history]] and the study of practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), sometimes directly from the text, and other times as a summary of classic ''halakha'' sources.\n\nOne of the tenets of [[Orthodox Judaism]] is that it is impossible to fully understand the written Torah without the Jewish commentaries, so Bais Yaakov girls are taught the [[Tanakh]] through this approach. A major focus is on [[Rashi]], considered the foremost Torah commentator.\n\nThe curriculum of Bais Yaakov differs from that of male-only [[yeshiva]]s, where the core component of study is the [[Talmud]]. Girls in Bais Yaakov schools do not learn law from the text of the Talmud itself, but may study its non-legal portions of ''[[aggadah]]'' (homiletics). This contrasts with the approach of many [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] [[Jewish day school]]s, which increasingly teach Talmud to women.\n\n=== Locations ===\n[[Image:\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \"\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1\" \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, \u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1 (1).jpg|thumb|250px|Beit Yaakov teachers' Seminary, [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.]]\nBranches exist in most North American cities with large [[:Category:Orthodox Jewish communities|populations of Orthodox Jews]] such as New York City, Montreal, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Toronto, [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], and in most Israeli cities.

Starting as a sex therapist and feminist, she came to public prominence in the 1970s, establishing a career in publishing and broadcasting as well as writing several books. In the last two decades she has abandoned feminism and attracted controversy with her social commentary and her views on sexual abuse, domestic violence and men's rights advocacy.\n\n== Early life ==\nArndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 \u2013 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 \u2013 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children.<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/> Her parents were German, and escaped [[Nazi Germany]] prior to [[WWII]].<ref name=\"father\"/> They emigrated to Australia in 1945 and she grew up in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to [[Sydney]] and studied at the [[University of New South Wales]] where she completed a [[Master of Psychology]] degree in 1973;<ref name=\"rats\" /><ref name=\"quals\"/> her thesis was on orgasm dysfunction.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"Overington\"/>\n\n== Family ==\nSince graduating, Arndt has predominantly lived in [[Woollahra]] in the eastern-suburbs of Sydney [[New South Wales]]. She was first married to journalist Dennis Minogue in 1977, who died in 1981. Arndt and Minoque were business partners during this time. Her second marriage was to American corporate lawyer Warren Scott in 1986, and they divorced in 2007. During the years 1986 to 1991 she lived with Scott in the borough of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] NY. Arndt has three children of her own, two girls and one boy.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"sexpert\"/><ref name=\"marries\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Arndt practiced as a [[sex therapist]] until 1981.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She describes herself as \"one of Australia's first sex therapists\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/>\n\nArndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982.<ref name=\"advocate\"/> The publication proved controversial in conservative circles, and in [[Queensland Parliament]] in 1977 MP [[Des Frawley]] said: \"It is a dirty, filthy magazine\".<ref name=\"hansard\"/> [[Queensland Police Service|Queensland police]] also raided a newsagent, seizing copies of the magazine, requesting the proprietor [[show cause]].<ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\nBetween 1973 and 1976 the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] had ruled, without explanation, that all TV and radio programs in which Arndt takes part in be pre-recorded so that they may be approved by station management before being transmitted.<ref name=\"abt\" /><ref name=\"tharunka\" />\n\nIn 1978 Arndt said that \"The sexual revolution has been a [[damp squib]]\" expressing some doubts about what level people were really more sophisticated in their attitudes toward sex. She did acknowledge that the The [[Women's Movement]] had made physiological discoveries about the sexuality of women, that there was more tolerance to one's [[sexual preference]], and there had been a recognition of the importance of sex for [[senior citizens]] and those with [[disabilities]]. Arndt also praised the introduction of [[South Australian]] laws criminalising [[rape]] within marriage.<ref name=\"noisy\"/>\n\nHer work in sex education also involved postgraduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In the mid 1980s, Arndt wrote for ''[[Australian Playboy]]''<ref name=\"tharunka\"/> and also wrote about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia. In 1982 she appeared on the TV panel-show series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|Beauty and the Beast]]''<ref name=\"beauty\" /> and, from 1981 to 1986, was a weekly guest on television program ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|The Today Show]]''.<ref name=\"cv2011\" />\n\nIn 1984, Arndt ran a mail-order lingerie and sex toy business and authored a number of books on sex advice, including ''The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Women'', in which she wrote that \"Looking at what's happening to men and women in bed today, it wouldn't surprise me at all if more and more males chose to stick to their beer. Sex is fast becoming a battlefield, with women calling more of the shots.\"<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nIn 1986 Arndt moved to New York City for five years and, while living in the United States, wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in Canberra, [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989).<ref name=\"sexpert\"/> In 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s onward Arndt wrote a personal advice column for ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo magazine]]'',<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> wrote for ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'',<ref name=\"Talking\"/> ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''. She was a guest reporter on ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]]<ref name=\"gg\"/> and a regular guest on [[ABC Local Radio|ABC radio]] in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She was on the board of the [[Australian National University]] and was the president of the board of the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] Foundation in 1999. She also served as an online dating coach from 2001 to 2017,<ref name=\"gg\"/> and more recently has assisted men in writing their dating profiles and referring them on to good photographers for their dating profile photos.<ref name=\"could be\"/>\n\nDuring the first half of her career Arndt was a [[feminist]], but since the mid 1990s<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> has turned to men's rights advocacy.<ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> Her later work encapsulated socially conservative ideas about relationships and family structures.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"advocate\"/> In 2010, Arndt said, \"I spent my early career lobbying for women but turned to men when I realised how lousy they are about advocating for issues that affect their private lives.\"<ref name=\"Overington\"/> Kate Gleeson, a senior lecturer at [[Macquarie Law School]] who has studied her, says \"Arndt's extolling of men's rights, as well as her critique of feminist analyses of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and sex within marriage, has provoked feminist ire in the press\", adding \"To Arndt's frustration, the male revolution she advocated of political reaction against feminism had failed to emerge\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nDuring the conservative [[Howard Government]] (1996-2007) Arndt was brought into the fold as an adviser on issues such as assisted reproduction, education and child support.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> She served on a number of committees advising the Australian Government on policy matters, including the National Advisory Committee on Ageing (2003), the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team (2005) and the Child Support Review Reference Group (2004).<ref name=\"gg\"/> In 2003 the government awarded her the [[Centenary Medal]], which recognises \"people who made a contribution to Australian society or government.\".<ref name=\"cv2011\"/><ref name=\"centenary-medal\"/> Gleeson observed that at this time Arndt had a \"persistent criticism of matters of [[family law]]\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> A government committee she was part of from 2000 to 2001, the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, was instrumental in later redrafting Australian family law.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the Australian television program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' demonstrated that a newspaper article written by Arndt for the ''[[Brisbane Courier Mail]]'' plagiarised large tracts of a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Dick Taverne]] published three years earlier.<ref name=\"leftovers\"/> The program also accused Arndt of journalistic non-disclosure in a column she wrote for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' when she identified [[Kerryn Phelps]]'s same-sex marriage to [[Ascham School|Ascham Girls' School]] teacher Jackie Stricker. Arndt failed to disclose that her daughter attended the school and Phelps holds Arndt partly responsible for ending her wife's career there. In her defence Arndt said that \"I've never been anti-gay\", saying she was merely reporting the anxieties of some Ascham parents.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nArndt wrote ''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire. It was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"blokes\"/>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend]]'' said she had repositioned herself as \"a champion of the downtrodden male of the species\", adding that \"In her writing, the former libertine started to sound like a self-appointed guardian of public morals.\" Her friend Merri Southwood said of Arndt's newspaper columns at the time, \"I'm not sure how much of it is the author seeking an audience and how much is the genuine Bettina ... Because, in fact, the way she writes is sometimes a little at odds with her own personal life.\"<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nIn 2020 Arndt's previously good relationship with political conservatives and the conservative media shifted. ''Media Watch'' reported that \"Arndt has been in the media for more than 40 years and has written for many of Australia's leading papers and magazines as sex therapist, [[social commentator]] and, most recently, outspoken men's rights advocate\". But her comments on the [[murder of Hannah Clarke]] incident in 2020 had since led to near universal condemnation in the media, including those she had previously worked with. ''Media Watch'' questioned whether or not they would use her again in the future.<ref name=\"condemned\"/> When questioned about Arndt's time advising the Howard Government (1996-2007), Victorian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] shadow minister [[Tim Smith (Australian politician)|Tim Smith]] said: \"I think Bettina Arndt has become more extreme as the years have gone by. I don't think she was nearly this extreme during the Howard Government years. I think some of her commentary of recent years has gone beyond mainstream Australia to the fringes.\"<ref name=\"crossed\"/> [[News Corp Australia|News Corp's]] [[David Penberthy]] lamented the loss of the Arndt of the 70s and 80s when she was a sex therapist and a \"fun person... trying to make couples happier through sex\", saying she seems to have now \"herded all of the really angry guys in Australia into the one corner and has, sort of, created almost a business model out of it\".<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===Men's rights activism===\nArndt has now been termed a [[men's rights activist]],<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> and says \"we need to start calling out feminism which is a really destructive force in our society\".<ref name=\"condemned\"/> She believes there is a pervasive \"anti-male bias\" in society, media and the law - also extending into in areas such as divorce, cancer research and domestic violence - saying that women are prioritised, thus denying men their rights.<ref name=\"toxic\"/> In 2012, [[Janet Albrechtsen|Albrechtsen]] wrote that Arndt \"now argues that with women dominating public discussion of gender and sexual issues, men's views are being silenced\".<ref name=\"Albrechtsen\"/> Arndt argues that \"[[radical feminism]], where men are presented as violent and sexist, is guilty of manshaming and destroying what should be a bond of mutual acceptance and respect between the sexes\".<ref name=\"toxic\"/> Arndt has been accused of being hostile towards women.<ref name=\"storm\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/> Author [[Susan Maushart]] says that Arndt \"seems, for whatever reason, to not like women very much\".<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\n===On partnerships and parenting===\nWhen Australia's first female prime minister, [[Julia Gillard]] (Labor), was elected in 2010, Arndt criticised the new prime minister for setting a bad example by living in a [[Common-law marriage|de facto]] relationship, or as Arndt described it \"marriage lite\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nArndt has been criticised for dismissing genuine academic research when writing about the children of [[LGBTIQ]] parents. Ex Federal Senator [[Brian Greig]] denounced Arndt for using \"the work of 'researchers' with strong links to the American religious right\" when discussing [[same-sex parenting]], saying she should have been \"able to distinguish such research from sham, politically motivated studies.\"<ref name=\"qnews\"/>\n\n===Comments about sexual abuse===\nArndt has drawn controversy over several incidents in which she has been accused of downplaying the [[sexual abuse]] of children by adults.\n\nShe has suggested that rape is not always violent and has said that most children do not incur long-term damage from sexual assault.<ref name=\"silence\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Arndt defended a doctor who had molested a 12-year-old child and other patients including herself,<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> arguing that he should not be charged because in another context masturbation would have been \"a loving and pleasurable act\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 2005, in an article in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', Arndt discussed convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Potter, a scoutmaster who had molested four boys, one of whom subsequently attempted suicide. She described Potter as \"a good bloke\"<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> and argued that \"such minor abuse rarely has lasting consequences\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a 2012 article she wrote that \"Demonising sexuality inevitably distorts a proper perspective on sexual crimes, leading to politically inspired calls for absurdly longer sentences, misinformation about the likelihood of offenders to reoffend and exaggeration of the emotional damage to the victims of minor abuse\" and that \"Our prurient interest in sex crimes often robs the perpetrator of any chance of redemption - as the sad death of cricket commentator [[Peter Roebuck]] bears witness.\"<ref name=\"prudes\"/>\n \nIn 2017, Arndt conducted a 17-minute interview for her YouTube channel with Nicolaas Bester, a high school teacher in [[Tasmania]] who in 2011 was sentenced to two years and 10 months jail for sexual assault,<ref name=\"urges\" /> maintaining a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student<ref name=\"jailed\"/> and possessing child pornography.<ref name=\"ironic\"/> He was subsequently jailed again for producing child exploitation material<ref name=\"awesome\"/><ref name=\"silent\"/> and bragging that the sexual abuse had been \"awesome\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/> In the video, Arndt referred to \"sexually provocative behaviour from female students\" and said young women should \"behave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\". Bester's victim subsequently criticised Arndt for supporting Bester and accusing her of trivialising his crime,<ref name=\"arndt awarded\"/> saying there \"was no evidence of my provocative behaviour\". \"Not only is the interview disturbing because it gives a platform to a paedophile. It's not a truthful interview.\"<ref name=\"survivor\"/> Arndt was criticised for not seeking out the victim for her side of the story.<ref name=\"4bc\"/><ref name=\"ironic\" /> Following widespread public outrage, Arndt apologised for her tone and said her interview was in poor taste, but in a later interview said of Bester that \"He is not a [[pederast]]. He is not preying on kids.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nArndt is a champion of male victims of [[domestic violence]] who have been abused by women and has said that the \"real picture\" of domestic violence is \"where our official evidence shows at least a third of the victims are male\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/><ref name=\"bring\"/> Arndt is an advocate for the purported statistical claim that \"one in three\" male victims of domestic violence have been abused by women.<ref name=\"no evidence\"/><ref name=\"fiction\"/> Jacinta Masters, from Gender Equity Victoria, says the statistics Arndt uses have \"been roundly dismissed by experts as inaccurate and a misrepresentation\".<ref name=\"no evidence\"/> Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) says Arndt's \"claims: 1) are inaccurate; and 2) appear to be more focussed on undermining the gains made to address violence against women, than genuine concern for men subjected to violence.\"<ref name=\"anrows\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) states that Arndt \"has, for many years, been downplaying domestic violence - even in her language, she uses terms like the 'myth of domestic violence' and 'feminist narrative', so while we're trying to highlight it as a problem, she's casting doubt and doing the opposite of that.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/>\n\nArndt is a critic of domestic violence campaigner [[Rosie Batty]], saying that her campaigning \"denies women's role in family violence\" and that Batty has been \"playing the feminist puppet\".<ref name=\"mumbrella\"/>\n\t\nArndt defended a comment by a Queensland police officer that a man who had killed his wife and children by [[Death by burning|immolation]] may have been a \"husband being driven too far by issues\".<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"examines\"/><ref name=\"reece\"/>\n\n===2018 \"fake rape crisis\" campus tour===\nArndt says that there is a \"manufactured rape crisis\" on Australian university campuses fuelled by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], where the institutions convene a \"[[kangaroo court]]\" once an allegation has been made where the male alleged to have raped the female has no chance of defence.<ref name=\"bias\"/> In 2018-2019 she conducted her \"fake rape crisis\" university campus tour where she campaigned against changes to consent laws with her main argument being that rates of sexual harassment and assault on university campuses were being artificially inflated to stoke anti-male sentiment. University women's groups and anti-violence representatives said Arndt's events were \"a misinformed and harmful attempt to undo the work of generations of student activists and advocates in combating the issues of sexual violence on campus\" and that she was \"mocking sexual assault survivors at [universities] around the country\".<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":3\"/><ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nStudents protested her on-campus appearances<ref name=\"heterosexual\" /> and the student [[Sydney University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]] hosted her \"Fake Rape Crisis Campus Tour\" event at [[Sydney University]]. Afterwards Arndt lobbied and petitioned against her protesters in an attempt to have them disciplined. At the time ''[[The Saturday Paper]]'' reported that \"Federal government ministers and conservative media personalities have been quick to praise Arndt as the latest free speech hero threatened by a censorious left-wing culture on university campuses.\"<ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nArndt's \"Fake Rape Crisis\" university speaking tour was cited in the granting of her 2020 Order of Australia award.<ref name=\":3\" /> When referring to the former federal [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]], [[Kate Ellis]]', advocacy for victims on campus, Arndt stated that \"My campus work poses a direct threat to Ellis' longtime advocacy for victims of sexual assault.\"<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===2020 Order of Australia award===\nArndt was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] \"for significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Among other significant services to the community,<ref name=\"gg\" /> the citation for Arndt's honour from the [[Council for the Order of Australia]] highlights her \"Campus Tour, since 2018\" (known as the \"Fake Rape Crisis\" Campus Tour),<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"gg\" /> and for being a contributor to \"[[Jordan Peterson]]'s ''[[Thinkspot]]'', since 2019\" (an anti-censorship website).<ref name=\"thinkspot\" /><ref name=\"gg\" />\n\nArndt's appointment sparked a petition on [[Change.org]] calling for the honour to be revoked and had reached 33,000 signatures within the first week.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> The award also drew a reaction from prominent Australian women and abuse survivors,<ref name=\"ballarat\"/><ref name=\"survivor\"/> with 2015 [[Australian of the Year]] and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty saying she felt \"sickened\" and \"utterly dismayed\" by it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer and activist [[Van Badham]] called the granting of the award \"vile\".<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":2\"/> Bester's sexual assault victim, Grace Tame, said that \"I believe that honouring someone who actively defended a paedophile on a public platform is a blatant example of the protracted, systemic moral corruption that still hampers our society.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Sharna Bremner, from End Rape on Campus Australia, said she also felt sick after hearing of the award to Arndt and to \"see someone like her be rewarded for mocking those people that have been sexually assaulted sends a message that sexual assault doesn't matter in this country, survivors don't matter, it's a huge slap in the face.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Arndt responded by saying the criticism shows \"the poisonous side of modern feminism and their determination to shut down anyone who challenges the orthodoxy\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/>\n \n[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] attorney-general [[Jill Hennessy (politician)|Jill Hennessy]] wrote to the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[David Hurley]], urging that Arndt be stripped of the award,<ref name=\"stripped\"/> saying that \"Ms Arndt's views and activities diminish the devastating experiences of victim-survivors of family and sexual violence, promote division and encourage victim-survivors from taking steps to ensure their survival and safety.\"<ref name=\"jill\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) also called for Arndt's award to be withdrawn. Karen Williams, a psychiatrist from the group, said that \"Being awarded this honour gives her credibility that she doesn't deserve on this subject - she's had some psychological training but never been registered as a health practitioner; she doesn't work or do research in this field.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/> Also calling for the award to be revoked, Sue Williamson from the [[ADFA|University of New South Wales in Canberra]] noted that the relevant government \"Ordinance enables the Governor-General to revoke an award if the awardee has 'has behaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute on the order'\".<ref name=\"disturbing\"/>\n\nIn February 2020, following further controversy surrounding Arndt's comments on a [[Murder of Hannah Clarke|domestic violence quadruple murder-suicide]] in Queensland, Liberal MP Tim Smith wrote to the chairman of the Council of the Order of Australia, [[Shane Stone]], calling for her award to be revoked, the first [[bipartisan]] support for the move. He stated that Arndt's comments brought the Order into disrepute, were inconsistent with the role of the awards in acknowledging the bravery of military personnel, and suggested that \"the Council of the Order of Australia has an important role protecting the Vice-Regal office and the [[Monarchy of Australia|Crown in Australia]] from associating itself with views that seek to make excuses for extreme violence\".<ref name=\"calls grow\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/> Arndt had said, \"Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'. But note the misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of seeking excuses...\"<ref name=\"calls grow\"/> Within days many politicians from Liberal, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] were also calling for her award to be revoked,<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"mikakos\"/><ref name=\"federal\"/><ref name=\"geelong\"/><ref name=\"letter\"/><ref name=\"lyons\"/> including the Federal Minister for Women, [[Marise Payne]].<ref name=\"table\"/>\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the [[Australian Senate]] voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion calling for the revocation of Arndt's Order of Australia award, with [[Pauline Hanson]] and [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] being the only senators to vote against the motion. The motion is not binding on the Order of Australia Council.<ref name=\"federal\"/> In response to the Senate vote Arndt said conservative MPs had \"caved in\" to \"feminist power\" and urged her supporters to \"maintain the rage\" and mobilise against what she believes are \"feral mobs trying to take [her] out\" in calling for her AM to be revoked.<ref name=\"urges\"/> Following the bipartisan Senate motion, the Governor-General's secretary Paul Singer told a Senate estimates committee that the Governor-General would not unilaterally revoke the award, \"because in practice the Governor-General does always act on the advice and recommendations of [the Council for the Order of Australia]\". While refusing to comment on Arndt's case specifically, he also noted in relation to past removals that they \"largely attribute to legal proceedings having been exhausted\" and confirmed that some recipients convicted of serious charges retained their awards while still undergoing appeals. ''The Age'' reported that these comments suggested that Arndt \"was unlikely to have her honour rescinded\", given that the reasons argued for revoking Arndt's award were not criminal in nature.<ref name=\"will not\"/>\n\n===Controversy about credentials===\nIn 2020, an article published by the ''[[New Matilda]]'' website pointed out that the media and publishers have frequently misrepresented Arndt as a [[psychologist]], [[clinical psychologist]] or doctor. The back cover of the 2009 edition of her book ''The Sex Diaries'' states that \"Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist\" and \"she draws on her thirty-five years of experience as a sex therapist and psychologist\". Arndt, however, is not a registered psychologist, clinical psychologist, [[medical doctor]] or has a [[PhD]] degree. The article criticised Arndt for distributing material containing these misrepresentations without correcting them. In response, Arndt stated that she never described herself in this way, saying that \"I've had a 45-year career. I say I trained as a clinical psychologist, I explain my career, whenever I'm asked to do a [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] or put it out publicly. But people still introduce me in the wrong way.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/> When she began her career, she did not need to register as a psychologist as the registration of psychologists only began with the ''Psychologists Act 1989'' (NSW).<ref name=\"rejects\"/><ref name=\"act\"/> The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) investigated the allegations detailed in the ''New

Starting as a sex therapist and feminist, she came to public prominence in the 1970s, establishing a career in publishing and broadcasting as well as writing several books. In the last two decades she has abandoned feminism and attracted controversy with her social commentary and her views on sexual abuse, domestic violence and men's rights advocacy.\n\n== Early life ==\nArndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 \u2013 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 \u2013 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children.<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/> Her parents were German, and escaped Nazi Germany prior to WWII.<ref name=\"father\"/> They emigrated to Australia in 1945 and she grew up in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to [[Sydney]] and studied at the [[University of New South Wales]] where she completed a [[Master of Psychology]] degree in 1973;<ref name=\"rats\" /><ref name=\"quals\"/> her thesis was on orgasm dysfunction.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"Overington\"/>\n\n== Family ==\nSince graduating, Arndt has predominantly lived in [[Woollahra]] in the eastern-suburbs of Sydney [[New South Wales]]. She was first married to journalist Dennis Minogue in 1977, who died in 1981. Arndt and Minoque were business partners during this time. Her second marriage was to American corporate lawyer Warren Scott in 1986, and they divorced in 2007. During the years 1986 to 1991 she lived with Scott in the borough of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] NY. Arndt has three children of her own, two girls and one boy.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"sexpert\"/><ref name=\"marries\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Arndt practiced as a [[sex therapist]] until 1981.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She describes herself as \"one of Australia's first sex therapists\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/>\n\nArndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982.<ref name=\"advocate\"/> The publication proved controversial in conservative circles, and in [[Queensland Parliament]] in 1977 MP [[Des Frawley]] said: \"It is a dirty, filthy magazine\".<ref name=\"hansard\"/> [[Queensland Police Service|Queensland police]] also raided a newsagent, seizing copies of the magazine, requesting the proprietor [[show cause]].<ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\nBetween 1973 and 1976 the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] had ruled, without explanation, that all TV and radio programs in which Arndt takes part in be pre-recorded so that they may be approved by station management before being transmitted.<ref name=\"abt\" /><ref name=\"tharunka\" />\n\nIn 1978 Arndt said that \"The sexual revolution has been a [[damp squib]]\" expressing some doubts about what level people were really more sophisticated in their attitudes toward sex. She did acknowledge that the The [[Women's Movement]] had made physiological discoveries about the sexuality of women, that there was more tolerance to one's [[sexual preference]], and there had been a recognition of the importance of sex for [[senior citizens]] and those with [[disabilities]]. Arndt also praised the introduction of [[South Australian]] laws criminalising [[rape]] within marriage.<ref name=\"noisy\"/>\n\nHer work in sex education also involved postgraduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In the mid 1980s, Arndt wrote for ''[[Australian Playboy]]''<ref name=\"tharunka\"/> and also wrote about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia. In 1982 she appeared on the TV panel-show series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|Beauty and the Beast]]''<ref name=\"beauty\" /> and, from 1981 to 1986, was a weekly guest on television program ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|The Today Show]]''.<ref name=\"cv2011\" />\n\nIn 1984, Arndt ran a mail-order lingerie and sex toy business and authored a number of books on sex advice, including ''The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Women'', in which she wrote that \"Looking at what's happening to men and women in bed today, it wouldn't surprise me at all if more and more males chose to stick to their beer. Sex is fast becoming a battlefield, with women calling more of the shots.\"<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nIn 1986 Arndt moved to New York City for five years and, while living in the United States, wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in Canberra, [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989).<ref name=\"sexpert\"/> In 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s onward Arndt wrote a personal advice column for ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo magazine]]'',<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> wrote for ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'',<ref name=\"Talking\"/> ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''. She was a guest reporter on ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]]<ref name=\"gg\"/> and a regular guest on [[ABC Local Radio|ABC radio]] in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She was on the board of the [[Australian National University]] and was the president of the board of the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] Foundation in 1999. She also served as an online dating coach from 2001 to 2017,<ref name=\"gg\"/> and more recently has assisted men in writing their dating profiles and referring them on to good photographers for their dating profile photos.<ref name=\"could be\"/>\n\nDuring the first half of her career Arndt was a [[feminist]], but since the mid 1990s<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> has turned to men's rights advocacy.<ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> Her later work encapsulated socially conservative ideas about relationships and family structures.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"advocate\"/> In 2010, Arndt said, \"I spent my early career lobbying for women but turned to men when I realised how lousy they are about advocating for issues that affect their private lives.\"<ref name=\"Overington\"/> Kate Gleeson, a senior lecturer at [[Macquarie Law School]] who has studied her, says \"Arndt's extolling of men's rights, as well as her critique of feminist analyses of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and sex within marriage, has provoked feminist ire in the press\", adding \"To Arndt's frustration, the male revolution she advocated of political reaction against feminism had failed to emerge\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nDuring the conservative [[Howard Government]] (1996-2007) Arndt was brought into the fold as an adviser on issues such as assisted reproduction, education and child support.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> She served on a number of committees advising the Australian Government on policy matters, including the National Advisory Committee on Ageing (2003), the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team (2005) and the Child Support Review Reference Group (2004).<ref name=\"gg\"/> In 2003 the government awarded her the [[Centenary Medal]], which recognises \"people who made a contribution to Australian society or government.\".<ref name=\"cv2011\"/><ref name=\"centenary-medal\"/> Gleeson observed that at this time Arndt had a \"persistent criticism of matters of [[family law]]\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> A government committee she was part of from 2000 to 2001, the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, was instrumental in later redrafting Australian family law.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the Australian television program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' demonstrated that a newspaper article written by Arndt for the ''[[Brisbane Courier Mail]]'' plagiarised large tracts of a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Dick Taverne]] published three years earlier.<ref name=\"leftovers\"/> The program also accused Arndt of journalistic non-disclosure in a column she wrote for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' when she identified [[Kerryn Phelps]]'s same-sex marriage to [[Ascham School|Ascham Girls' School]] teacher Jackie Stricker. Arndt failed to disclose that her daughter attended the school and Phelps holds Arndt partly responsible for ending her wife's career there. In her defence Arndt said that \"I've never been anti-gay\", saying she was merely reporting the anxieties of some Ascham parents.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nArndt wrote ''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire. It was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"blokes\"/>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend]]'' said she had repositioned herself as \"a champion of the downtrodden male of the species\", adding that \"In her writing, the former libertine started to sound like a self-appointed guardian of public morals.\" Her friend Merri Southwood said of Arndt's newspaper columns at the time, \"I'm not sure how much of it is the author seeking an audience and how much is the genuine Bettina ... Because, in fact, the way she writes is sometimes a little at odds with her own personal life.\"<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nIn 2020 Arndt's previously good relationship with political conservatives and the conservative media shifted. ''Media Watch'' reported that \"Arndt has been in the media for more than 40 years and has written for many of Australia's leading papers and magazines as sex therapist, [[social commentator]] and, most recently, outspoken men's rights advocate\". But her comments on the [[murder of Hannah Clarke]] incident in 2020 had since led to near universal condemnation in the media, including those she had previously worked with. ''Media Watch'' questioned whether or not they would use her again in the future.<ref name=\"condemned\"/> When questioned about Arndt's time advising the Howard Government (1996-2007), Victorian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] shadow minister [[Tim Smith (Australian politician)|Tim Smith]] said: \"I think Bettina Arndt has become more extreme as the years have gone by. I don't think she was nearly this extreme during the Howard Government years. I think some of her commentary of recent years has gone beyond mainstream Australia to the fringes.\"<ref name=\"crossed\"/> [[News Corp Australia|News Corp's]] [[David Penberthy]] lamented the loss of the Arndt of the 70s and 80s when she was a sex therapist and a \"fun person... trying to make couples happier through sex\", saying she seems to have now \"herded all of the really angry guys in Australia into the one corner and has, sort of, created almost a business model out of it\".<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===Men's rights activism===\nArndt has now been termed a [[men's rights activist]],<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> and says \"we need to start calling out feminism which is a really destructive force in our society\".<ref name=\"condemned\"/> She believes there is a pervasive \"anti-male bias\" in society, media and the law - also extending into in areas such as divorce, cancer research and domestic violence - saying that women are prioritised, thus denying men their rights.<ref name=\"toxic\"/> In 2012, [[Janet Albrechtsen|Albrechtsen]] wrote that Arndt \"now argues that with women dominating public discussion of gender and sexual issues, men's views are being silenced\".<ref name=\"Albrechtsen\"/> Arndt argues that \"[[radical feminism]], where men are presented as violent and sexist, is guilty of manshaming and destroying what should be a bond of mutual acceptance and respect between the sexes\".<ref name=\"toxic\"/> Arndt has been accused of being hostile towards women.<ref name=\"storm\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/> Author [[Susan Maushart]] says that Arndt \"seems, for whatever reason, to not like women very much\".<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\n===On partnerships and parenting===\nWhen Australia's first female prime minister, [[Julia Gillard]] (Labor), was elected in 2010, Arndt criticised the new prime minister for setting a bad example by living in a [[Common-law marriage|de facto]] relationship, or as Arndt described it \"marriage lite\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nArndt has been criticised for dismissing genuine academic research when writing about the children of [[LGBTIQ]] parents. Ex Federal Senator [[Brian Greig]] denounced Arndt for using \"the work of 'researchers' with strong links to the American religious right\" when discussing [[same-sex parenting]], saying she should have been \"able to distinguish such research from sham, politically motivated studies.\"<ref name=\"qnews\"/>\n\n===Comments about sexual abuse===\nArndt has drawn controversy over several incidents in which she has been accused of downplaying the [[sexual abuse]] of children by adults.\n\nShe has suggested that rape is not always violent and has said that most children do not incur long-term damage from sexual assault.<ref name=\"silence\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Arndt defended a doctor who had molested a 12-year-old child and other patients including herself,<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> arguing that he should not be charged because in another context masturbation would have been \"a loving and pleasurable act\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 2005, in an article in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', Arndt discussed convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Potter, a scoutmaster who had molested four boys, one of whom subsequently attempted suicide. She described Potter as \"a good bloke\"<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> and argued that \"such minor abuse rarely has lasting consequences\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a 2012 article she wrote that \"Demonising sexuality inevitably distorts a proper perspective on sexual crimes, leading to politically inspired calls for absurdly longer sentences, misinformation about the likelihood of offenders to reoffend and exaggeration of the emotional damage to the victims of minor abuse\" and that \"Our prurient interest in sex crimes often robs the perpetrator of any chance of redemption - as the sad death of cricket commentator [[Peter Roebuck]] bears witness.\"<ref name=\"prudes\"/>\n \nIn 2017, Arndt conducted a 17-minute interview for her YouTube channel with Nicolaas Bester, a high school teacher in [[Tasmania]] who in 2011 was sentenced to two years and 10 months jail for sexual assault,<ref name=\"urges\" /> maintaining a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student<ref name=\"jailed\"/> and possessing child pornography.<ref name=\"ironic\"/> He was subsequently jailed again for producing child exploitation material<ref name=\"awesome\"/><ref name=\"silent\"/> and bragging that the sexual abuse had been \"awesome\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/> In the video, Arndt referred to \"sexually provocative behaviour from female students\" and said young women should \"behave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\". Bester's victim subsequently criticised Arndt for supporting Bester and accusing her of trivialising his crime,<ref name=\"arndt awarded\"/> saying there \"was no evidence of my provocative behaviour\". \"Not only is the interview disturbing because it gives a platform to a paedophile. It's not a truthful interview.\"<ref name=\"survivor\"/> Arndt was criticised for not seeking out the victim for her side of the story.<ref name=\"4bc\"/><ref name=\"ironic\" /> Following widespread public outrage, Arndt apologised for her tone and said her interview was in poor taste, but in a later interview said of Bester that \"He is not a [[pederast]]. He is not preying on kids.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nArndt is a champion of male victims of [[domestic violence]] who have been abused by women and has said that the \"real picture\" of domestic violence is \"where our official evidence shows at least a third of the victims are male\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/><ref name=\"bring\"/> Arndt is an advocate for the purported statistical claim that \"one in three\" male victims of domestic violence have been abused by women.<ref name=\"no evidence\"/><ref name=\"fiction\"/> Jacinta Masters, from Gender Equity Victoria, says the statistics Arndt uses have \"been roundly dismissed by experts as inaccurate and a misrepresentation\".<ref name=\"no evidence\"/> Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) says Arndt's \"claims: 1) are inaccurate; and 2) appear to be more focussed on undermining the gains made to address violence against women, than genuine concern for men subjected to violence.\"<ref name=\"anrows\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) states that Arndt \"has, for many years, been downplaying domestic violence - even in her language, she uses terms like the 'myth of domestic violence' and 'feminist narrative', so while we're trying to highlight it as a problem, she's casting doubt and doing the opposite of that.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/>\n\nArndt is a critic of domestic violence campaigner [[Rosie Batty]], saying that her campaigning \"denies women's role in family violence\" and that Batty has been \"playing the feminist puppet\".<ref name=\"mumbrella\"/>\n\t\nArndt defended a comment by a Queensland police officer that a man who had killed his wife and children by [[Death by burning|immolation]] may have been a \"husband being driven too far by issues\".<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"examines\"/><ref name=\"reece\"/>\n\n===2018 \"fake rape crisis\" campus tour===\nArndt says that there is a \"manufactured rape crisis\" on Australian university campuses fuelled by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], where the institutions convene a \"[[kangaroo court]]\" once an allegation has been made where the male alleged to have raped the female has no chance of defence.<ref name=\"bias\"/> In 2018-2019 she conducted her \"fake rape crisis\" university campus tour where she campaigned against changes to consent laws with her main argument being that rates of sexual harassment and assault on university campuses were being artificially inflated to stoke anti-male sentiment. University women's groups and anti-violence representatives said Arndt's events were \"a misinformed and harmful attempt to undo the work of generations of student activists and advocates in combating the issues of sexual violence on campus\" and that she was \"mocking sexual assault survivors at [universities] around the country\".<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":3\"/><ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nStudents protested her on-campus appearances<ref name=\"heterosexual\" /> and the student [[Sydney University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]] hosted her \"Fake Rape Crisis Campus Tour\" event at [[Sydney University]]. Afterwards Arndt lobbied and petitioned against her protesters in an attempt to have them disciplined. At the time ''[[The Saturday Paper]]'' reported that \"Federal government ministers and conservative media personalities have been quick to praise Arndt as the latest free speech hero threatened by a censorious left-wing culture on university campuses.\"<ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nArndt's \"Fake Rape Crisis\" university speaking tour was cited in the granting of her 2020 Order of Australia award.<ref name=\":3\" /> When referring to the former federal [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]], [[Kate Ellis]]', advocacy for victims on campus, Arndt stated that \"My campus work poses a direct threat to Ellis' longtime advocacy for victims of sexual assault.\"<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===2020 Order of Australia award===\nArndt was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] \"for significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Among other significant services to the community,<ref name=\"gg\" /> the citation for Arndt's honour from the [[Council for the Order of Australia]] highlights her \"Campus Tour, since 2018\" (known as the \"Fake Rape Crisis\" Campus Tour),<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"gg\" /> and for being a contributor to \"[[Jordan Peterson]]'s ''[[Thinkspot]]'', since 2019\" (an anti-censorship website).<ref name=\"thinkspot\" /><ref name=\"gg\" />\n\nArndt's appointment sparked a petition on [[Change.org]] calling for the honour to be revoked and had reached 33,000 signatures within the first week.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> The award also drew a reaction from prominent Australian women and abuse survivors,<ref name=\"ballarat\"/><ref name=\"survivor\"/> with 2015 [[Australian of the Year]] and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty saying she felt \"sickened\" and \"utterly dismayed\" by it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer and activist [[Van Badham]] called the granting of the award \"vile\".<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":2\"/> Bester's sexual assault victim, Grace Tame, said that \"I believe that honouring someone who actively defended a paedophile on a public platform is a blatant example of the protracted, systemic moral corruption that still hampers our society.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Sharna Bremner, from End Rape on Campus Australia, said she also felt sick after hearing of the award to Arndt and to \"see someone like her be rewarded for mocking those people that have been sexually assaulted sends a message that sexual assault doesn't matter in this country, survivors don't matter, it's a huge slap in the face.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Arndt responded by saying the criticism shows \"the poisonous side of modern feminism and their determination to shut down anyone who challenges the orthodoxy\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/>\n \n[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] attorney-general [[Jill Hennessy (politician)|Jill Hennessy]] wrote to the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[David Hurley]], urging that Arndt be stripped of the award,<ref name=\"stripped\"/> saying that \"Ms Arndt's views and activities diminish the devastating experiences of victim-survivors of family and sexual violence, promote division and encourage victim-survivors from taking steps to ensure their survival and safety.\"<ref name=\"jill\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) also called for Arndt's award to be withdrawn. Karen Williams, a psychiatrist from the group, said that \"Being awarded this honour gives her credibility that she doesn't deserve on this subject - she's had some psychological training but never been registered as a health practitioner; she doesn't work or do research in this field.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/> Also calling for the award to be revoked, Sue Williamson from the [[ADFA|University of New South Wales in Canberra]] noted that the relevant government \"Ordinance enables the Governor-General to revoke an award if the awardee has 'has behaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute on the order'\".<ref name=\"disturbing\"/>\n\nIn February 2020, following further controversy surrounding Arndt's comments on a [[Murder of Hannah Clarke|domestic violence quadruple murder-suicide]] in Queensland, Liberal MP Tim Smith wrote to the chairman of the Council of the Order of Australia, [[Shane Stone]], calling for her award to be revoked, the first [[bipartisan]] support for the move. He stated that Arndt's comments brought the Order into disrepute, were inconsistent with the role of the awards in acknowledging the bravery of military personnel, and suggested that \"the Council of the Order of Australia has an important role protecting the Vice-Regal office and the [[Monarchy of Australia|Crown in Australia]] from associating itself with views that seek to make excuses for extreme violence\".<ref name=\"calls grow\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/> Arndt had said, \"Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'. But note the misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of seeking excuses...\"<ref name=\"calls grow\"/> Within days many politicians from Liberal, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] were also calling for her award to be revoked,<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"mikakos\"/><ref name=\"federal\"/><ref name=\"geelong\"/><ref name=\"letter\"/><ref name=\"lyons\"/> including the Federal Minister for Women, [[Marise Payne]].<ref name=\"table\"/>\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the [[Australian Senate]] voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion calling for the revocation of Arndt's Order of Australia award, with [[Pauline Hanson]] and [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] being the only senators to vote against the motion. The motion is not binding on the Order of Australia Council.<ref name=\"federal\"/> In response to the Senate vote Arndt said conservative MPs had \"caved in\" to \"feminist power\" and urged her supporters to \"maintain the rage\" and mobilise against what she believes are \"feral mobs trying to take [her] out\" in calling for her AM to be revoked.<ref name=\"urges\"/> Following the bipartisan Senate motion, the Governor-General's secretary Paul Singer told a Senate estimates committee that the Governor-General would not unilaterally revoke the award, \"because in practice the Governor-General does always act on the advice and recommendations of [the Council for the Order of Australia]\". While refusing to comment on Arndt's case specifically, he also noted in relation to past removals that they \"largely attribute to legal proceedings having been exhausted\" and confirmed that some recipients convicted of serious charges retained their awards while still undergoing appeals. ''The Age'' reported that these comments suggested that Arndt \"was unlikely to have her honour rescinded\", given that the reasons argued for revoking Arndt's award were not criminal in nature.<ref name=\"will not\"/>\n\n===Controversy about credentials===\nIn 2020, an article published by the ''[[New Matilda]]'' website pointed out that the media and publishers have frequently misrepresented Arndt as a [[psychologist]], [[clinical psychologist]] or doctor. The back cover of the 2009 edition of her book ''The Sex Diaries'' states that \"Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist\" and \"she draws on her thirty-five years of experience as a sex therapist and psychologist\". Arndt, however, is not a registered psychologist, clinical psychologist, [[medical doctor]] or has a [[PhD]] degree. The article criticised Arndt for distributing material containing these misrepresentations without correcting them. In response, Arndt stated that she never described herself in this way, saying that \"I've had a 45-year career. I say I trained as a clinical psychologist, I explain my career, whenever I'm asked to do a [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] or put it out publicly. But people still introduce me in the wrong way.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/> When she began her career, she did not need to register as a psychologist as the registration of psychologists only began with the ''Psychologists Act 1989'' (NSW).<ref name=\"rejects\"/><ref name=\"act\"/> The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) investigated the allegations detailed in the ''New Matilda'' article<ref name=\"watchdog\"/> and cautioned Arndt over the use of the 'psychologist' title, urging that she act to prevent media outlets from using incorrect titles when referring to her and to refrain from promoting any content in which she is falsely described.<ref name=\"escapes\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Arndt |first=Bettina |title=Female Forum: The Key to Being

{"title_page": "Waterloo Mining Railroad", "text_new": "[[Image:Calico Mining Crew Silver King2.png|thumb|375px|Mining crew at the Silver King Mine in [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico]]. The engine shown is Calico R.R. #2 'Emil'.]]\nThe '''Waterloo Mining Railroad''', also known as the '''Calico Railroad''' or '''Daggett-Calico Railroad''', was a {{RailGauge|3ft|lk=on}} [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[railroad]] built to carry [[silver]] ore from the mines in the [[Calico Mountains (California)|Calico Mountains]] north of [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico]] to the mills located at Elephant Mountain near [[Daggett, California]] from 1888 to 1903.\n\nThe American Borax Company leased, and later bought, a small length of the railroad to use for their borax mining operations near Lead Mountain in 1901, and the line managed to last for about another 6 years afterwards. During this time, it was referred to as the '''American Borax Company Railroad''' (or A.B.C. Railroad), and the '''Columbia Mine Railroad'''.\n\n==History==\n===Silver mining===\n[[Image:Columbia Borax Mill, Daggett, California.png|thumb|right|350px|The Columbia Mill near [[Daggett, California]], where Calico R.R. No. 1 'Uncle Dan' bought the borax shales mined from Lead Mountain to be processed.]]\nIn the 1880s, [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico]] was one of  the most successful silver mining towns in [[Southern California]], with a large town population of about 1,200. It had two silver mines, the Waterloo and Silver King, which produced about over $1,000,000 worth of silver ore in just 14 months. The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] built a railroad line to the nearest town of [[Daggett, California|Daggett]] about 10 miles away, to become involved in the silver mining business, and in return, supply the residents of Calico with goods, timber and whatever else was needed to keep the mines going.\n\nThe Oro Grande Mining Company owned most of the silver mines in and around Calico, and was usually responsible for the transfer of the silver ore from the mines to Waterloo Mills near Daggett, and for the export of the silver products from there. Hauling silver ore was about $2.50 per ton, but production was limited by the amount that could be hauled. Oro Grande had their own 14-mule team hauling the silver ore from the mines to the processing plants at Elephant Mountain near Daggett, but thought they could do better with a shortline from Calico to Daggett. In March 1885, plans were put forward for a standard gauge line to be built from the junction at Daggett, to branch off to the silver mines and mills, and connect with Calico to provide a direct rail service with trains incoming from [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] and [[Needles, California|Needles]]. However, the Calico mines were already showing signs of declining production, and the rising costs of transportation and the falling prices of silver made the project unfeasible. The plans for the shortline were soon abandoned.\n\n====Railroad====\nBy 1887 production of silver ore at the mines had increased sufficiently for the Waterloo Mills at Daggett to upgrade their operations to a 60-stamp mill, powered by electricity and water from the [[Mojave River]]. It was decided that a railroad had to be built to keep up with the increase in demand for ore. The Calico Railroad was built for 11 miles long starting at the Waterloo Mine, about 2 to 3 miles to the west of Calico. From there, the line went straight down for about 11 miles before looping around Elephant Mountain at a steady rising grade before finally reaching the Waterloo Mill on the side of the mountain facing towards Daggett. A spur was later added to the Silver King Mine in Calico in 1889. The railroad was built up Wall Street Canyon, where at the end was a huge ore bin which was fed ore from the mine high above the town by either animal-drawn ore wagons or mine carts.\n\nThe line never actually reached Daggett, but luckily the town was right over the river from the mill at Elephant Mountain, so whenever something needed to be shipped over to Daggett, either the local wagon roads took the goods to the town or people walked across the riverbed whenever it was dry. The line also hauled a few passengers, but the line never owned any carriages, so people rode in the ore wagons in between Calico or Daggett, or miners would ride them from Calico to wherever they worked.\n\nThe declining demands and prices of silver forced the Calico mines to go into decline, and in March 1892 the Waterloo Mine was closed down, followed by the Silver King later on in 1896, and the Calico Railroad ceased operations for a while. The locomotives and rolling stock were stored at the engine house located near to the Waterloo Mill, on the north-west side of the [[Mojave River]] close to the location of the current road bridge linking Daggett and Yermo. Later in 1899, D.D. Connell and Marcus Pluth agreed to lease the properties of the Waterloo Mining Company, including the railroad, to haul whatever profitable amount of silver was left in the mines. Silver ore was hauled from the Waterloo Mine down towards Elephant Mountain, where the silver was processed in the original 16-stamp mill the company had erected since Calico's early days in 1883. The lease for the silver operations lasted from 1899 until 1903.\n\n===Borax mining===\nIn 1897, the [[Pacific Coast Borax Company]] began constructing the [[Borate and Daggett Railroad]] to link the nearby borax mines of Borate to the standard-gauge railway at Daggett, and were short on locomotives to run the line. They leased the one of the saddle-tank engines (No. 2, \"Emil\") from the Waterloo Mining Company to aid in the construction of the new line. The locomotive was said to have been rather slippy on the steep grade ascending to Borate, and was used for only a few months until the arrival of PCB's first locomotive and \"Emil\" was sent back to Waterloo.\n\n====American Borax Company====\nIn 1899, the American Borax Company bought mining claims at Lead Mountain, about four miles west of Calico, to mine boric acid and plotted to build a railroad to reach Daggett across the river where they had their processing plants. American Borax agreed with the Waterloo Mining Company and D.D. Connell (who by then was also leasing the line from Waterloo Mining along with fellow miner Marcus Pluth, to transport the last of the ore from Waterloo Mine in 1899) to reserve running rights on the line to allow their trains to use the same track in between the junctions going towards Calico and the borax mine at Lead Mountain (named \"Columbia\"). They had also leased the line's first locomotive \"Uncle Dan,\" to operate the borax trains outgoing from Lead Mountain.\n\nThe line was extended from the mill branch at Elephant Mountain to cross the [[Mojave River]] on a Pratt through truss bridge before pulling into the Columbia Mill on the other side of the river, where the calcining plants were located. Once the boric acid was processed into borax, the train took the ore to the railhead in the town of Daggett where the [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad]] came and took away the borax to sell in the market.\n\nAmerican Borax and D.D. Connell both ran the line for their reasons, until a disastrous train wreck between the two engines at a switch in 1903 happened due to Connell hurrying with his engine (No. 2, \"Emil\") to get back to Daggett during a storm to terminate his lease. After Connell had been contracted to tear up the rail line towards Calico and all the wooden structures in the town, Waterloo Mining Co. gave full ownership of the railroad to American Borax to use the remainder of the line for the borax traffic from the Columbia Mine at Lead Mountain.\n\nBy 1907, the American Borax Company discovered better deposits of borax in the [[Tick Canyon Formation]], about 30 miles northwest of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Once they partnered up with fellow borax company, Sterling Borax, to take a hold of the borax claims there, the mining operations at Daggett were shut down and all the mining equipment, even the railroad itself was moved up to [[Lang, California]], and the mining operations of the Calico Mountains ceased to exist.\n\n[[Image:Waterloo Mining Railroad No. 1 'Emil'.png|thumb|right|300px|Daggett & Calico/Waterloo Mining Railroad's No. 1 'Uncle Dan'.]]\n[[Image:Waterloo Mining Railroad No. 2 'Sanger'.png|thumb|right|300px|Daggett & Calico/Waterloo Mining Railroad's No. 2 'Emil'.]]\n\n==Locomotives and rolling stock==\nThe Waterloo Mining Railroad only had two engines. Both were built by [[H.K. Porter, Inc.]] in 1888 for use on the railway line in between Daggett and Calico. One was called 'Uncle Dan' was an {{whyte|0-4-0|ST}} (H.K. Porter B-S Class; s/n 937), the other 'Emil' was an {{whyte|0-6-0|ST}} (H.K. Porter C-S Class; s/n 962). Both were named for the important heads of the mining company and the railroad, Daniel Wells Jr. and Emil Sanger, who was appointed head of the Waterloo Mining Company in 1888 and the one who ordered for the building of the railroad.\n\nThey were both used on the line, even after the American Borax Company took over the operations of the railroad. In 1903, 'Emil' was bought by the [[Mohave and Milltown Railway]], and 'Uncle Dan' was left to handle the borax operations alone until about 1907 when the railroad was torn up and moved up to Lang, California to work the mines at Tick Canyon for the Sterling Borax Company.\n\nNo records were kept of the two engines being moved away, sold or scrapped from their respective railroads after that. Whether they actually survived scrapping or not is one of the great mysteries surrounding this little-known mining railroad.\n\nRolling stock consisted of at least four ore wagons built at the [[Virginia & Truckee Railroad]]'s shops at [[Carson City, Nevada]], along with a water car. American Borax added a further five ore wagons for hauling borax to the roster, these cars' design is of unknown origin.\n\n[[File:Calico train.JPG|thumb|left|300px|The present-day Calico & Odessa Railroad with its steam-outlined diesel engine puttering about the old mine ruins.]]\n\n==Legacy==\nThe town of Calico was bought and rebuilt from the ground up in 1951 by [[Walter Knott]], the owner of [[Knott's Berry Farm]], as a ghost town tourist attraction. A [[tourist railroad]] was planned to be built to revive the history and legacy of the old Waterloo Mining Railroad. The {{RailGauge|2ft6in|lk=on}} narrow gauge [[Calico and Odessa Railroad|Calico & Odessa Railroad]] was built by Shafe-Malcom Enterprises in 1954. It loops around one of the mountains nearest to Calico Ghost Town to one of the old silver mine shafts and the site of the former eastern portion of Calico. The line is operated by a single 0-4-2 steam-outline diesel locomotive.\n\nThe line today does not follow any of the former trackbed of the Waterloo Mining Railroad. The original line began below at the mouth of Wall Street Canyon, and is now a paved road for tourists to access Calico from [[Interstate 10 in California|Interstate 10]].\n\nSome segments of the old railbed can still be traced out in some places in the desert, but much has now been covered by housing developments of Yermo. The best place to see traces of the old line are at the site of the former Waterloo Mine, where a large ore bin had dumped silver ore into the waiting trains below. The old foundations of the mills at Elephant Mountain near Daggett also can still be seen and explored.\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book| last = Myrick | first = David F. | authorlink = | coauthors =\n | year = 1992 | title = Railroads of Nevada and Eastern California - The Southern Roads\n | publisher =  University of Nevada Press| location = | isbn =0-87417-193-8}}\n*{{cite book| last = Steeples | first = Douglas W. | authorlink = | coauthors =\n | year = 1999 | title = Treasure from the Painted Hills: A History of Calico, California, 1882\u20131907.\n | publisher = Westport, CT: Greenwood Press| location = | isbn =0-313-30836-5}}\n*{{cite book| last = Peyton | first = Paige M. | authorlink = | coauthors =\n | year = 2012 | title = Images of America: Calico\n | publisher = Charleston, SC:Arcadia| location = | isbn =978-0-7385-8905-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Calico Ghost Town|position=left}}\n*[http://www.pacificng.com/template.php?page=roads/ca/calicorr/index.htm - PacificNG article about the history of the Calico Railroad]\n*[http://www.pacificng.com/template.php?page=roads/ca/abcrr/index.htm - PacificNG article about the American Borax Company Railroad]\n*[http://www.pacificng.com/imglib/main.php?g2_itemId=8516 - Original specification sheets of the Calico Porter locomotives, from the PacificNG website]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Waterloo Mining Railroad}}\n[[Category:Defunct California railroads]]\n[[Category:Mining railways in the United States]]\n[[Category:Mining in California]]\n[[Category:History of the Mojave Desert region]]\n[[Category:History of San Bernardino County, California]]\n[[Category:Narrow gauge railroads in California]]\n[[Category:3 ft gauge railways in the United States]]\n[[Category:Transportation in San Bernardino County, California]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Calico Mining Crew Silver King2.png|thumb|375px|Mining crew at the Silver King Mine in [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico]].

During this time, it was referred to as the '''American Borax Company Railroad''' (or A.B.C. Railroad), and the '''Columbia Mine Railroad'''.\n\n==History==\n===Silver mining===\n[[Image:Columbia Borax Mill, Daggett, California.png|thumb|right|350px|The Columbia Mill near [[Daggett, California]], where Calico R.R. No. 1 'Uncle Dan' bought the borax shales mined from Lead Mountain to be processed.]]\nIn the 1880s, [[Calico, San Bernardino County, California|Calico]] was one of  the most successful silver mining towns in [[Southern California]], with a large town population of about 1,200. It had two silver mines, the Waterloo and Silver King, which produced about over $1,000,000 worth of silver ore in just 14 months. The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] built a railroad line to the nearest town of [[Daggett, California|Daggett]] about 10 miles away, to become involved in the silver mining business, and in return, supply the residents of Calico with goods, timber and whatever else was needed to keep the mines going. \n\nThe Oro Grande Mining Company owned most of the silver mines in and around Calico, and was usually responsible for the transfer of the silver ore from the mines to Waterloo Mills near Daggett, and for the export of the silver products from there. Hauling silver ore was about $2.50 per ton, but production was limited by the amount that could be hauled. Oro Grande had their own 14-mule team hauling the silver ore from the mines to the processing plants at Elephant Mountain near Daggett, but thought they could do better with a shortline from Calico to Daggett. In March 1885, plans were put forward for a standard gauge line to be built from the junction at Daggett, to branch off to the silver mines and mills, and connect with Calico to provide a direct rail service with trains incoming from [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] and [[Needles, California|Needles]]. However, the Calico mines were already showing signs of declining production, and the rising costs of transportation and the falling prices of silver made the project unfeasible. The plans for the shortline were soon abandoned.\n\n====Railroad====\nBy 1887 production of silver ore at the mines had increased sufficiently for the Waterloo Mills at Daggett to upgraded their operations to a 60-stamp mill, powered by electricity and water from the [[Mojave River]]. It was decided that a railroad had to be built to keep up with the increase in demand for ore. The Calico Railroad was built for 11 miles long starting at the Waterloo Mine, about 2 to 3 miles to the west of Calico. From there, the line went straight down for about 11 miles before looping around Elephant Mountain at a steady rising grade before finally reaching the Waterloo Mill on the side of the mountain facing towards Daggett. A spur was later added to the Silver King Mine in Calico in 1889. The railroad was built up Wall Street Canyon, where at the end was a huge ore bin which was fed ore from the mine high above the town by either animal-drawn ore wagons or mine carts.\n\nThe line never actually reached Daggett, but luckily the town was right over the river from the mill at Elephant Mountain, so whenever something needed to be shipped over to Daggett, either the local wagon roads took the goods to the town or people walked across the riverbed whenever it was dry. The line also hauled a few passengers, but the line never owned any carriages, so people rode in the ore wagons in between Calico or Daggett, or miners would ride them from Calico to wherever they worked. \n\nThe declining demands and prices of silver forced the Calico mines to go into decline, and in March 1892 the Waterloo Mine was closed down, followed by the Silver King later on in 1896, and the Calico Railroad ceased operations for a while. The locomotives and rolling stock were stored at the engine house located near to the Waterloo Mill, on the north-west side of the [[Mojave River]] close to the location of the current road bridge linking Daggett and Yermo. Later in 1899, D.D. Connell and Marcus Pluth agreed to lease the properties of the Waterloo Mining Company, including the railroad, to haul whatever profitable amount of silver was left in the mines. Silver ore was hauled from the Waterloo Mine down towards Elephant Mountain, where the silver was processed in the original 16-stamp mill the company had erected since Calico's early days in 1883. The lease for the silver operations lasted from 1899 until 1903.\n\n===Borax mining===\nIn 1897, the [[Pacific Coast Borax Company]] began constructing the [[Borate and Daggett Railroad]] to link the nearby borax mines of Borate to the standard-gauge railway at Daggett, and were short on locomotives to run the line. They leased the one of the saddle-tank engines (No. 2, \"Emil\") from the Waterloo Mining Company to aid in the construction of the new line. The locomotive was said to have been rather slippy on the steep grade ascending to Borate, and was used for only a few months until the arrival of PCB's first locomotive and \"Emil\" was sent back to Waterloo.\n\n====American Borax Company====\nIn 1899, the American Borax Company bought mining claims at Lead Mountain, about four miles west of Calico, to mine boric acid and plotted to build a railroad to reach Daggett across the river where they had their processing plants. American Borax agreed with the Waterloo Mining Company and D.D. Connell (who by then was also leasing the line from Waterloo Mining along with fellow miner Marcus Pluth, to transport the last of the ore from Waterloo Mine in 1899) to reserve running rights on the line to allow their trains to use the same track in between the junctions going towards Calico and the borax mine at Lead Mountain (named \"Columbia\"). They had also leased the line's first locomotive \"Uncle Dan,\" to operate the borax trains outgoing from Lead Mountain.\n\nThe line was extended from the mill branch at Elephant Mountain to cross the [[Mojave River]] on a Pratt through truss bridge before pulling into the Columbia Mill on the other side of the river, where the calcining plants were located. Once the boric acid was processed into borax, the train took the ore to the railhead in the town of Daggett where the [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad]] came and took away the borax to sell in the market. \n\nAmerican Borax and D.D. Connell both ran the line for their reasons, until a disastrous train wreck between the two engines at a switch in 1903 happened due to Connell hurrying with his engine (No. 2, \"Emil\") to get back to Daggett during a storm to terminate his lease. After Connell had been contracted to tear up the rail line towards Calico and all the wooden structures in the town, Waterloo Mining Co. gave full ownership of the railroad to American Borax to use the remainder of the line for the borax traffic from the Columbia Mine at Lead Mountain.\n\nBy 1907, the American Borax Company discovered better deposits of borax in the [[Tick Canyon Formation]], about 30 miles northwest of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].

Their criticisms (usually in comparison with the [[M16 rifle#M16S1|M16S1]] rifles they were already trained with) include:\n\n*the awkward position of the magazine well, and the difficulty in changing magazines, requiring multiple hand changes due to its bullpup shape{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n*the awkward position of the fire selector (located at the butt, with the action), as opposed to the thumb selector on the M16S1<ref name=cutshaw/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensereview.com/sar-21-bullpup-assault-rifle-worlds-best-combat-bullpup/ |title=SAR-21 Bullpup Assault Rifle: World\u2019s Best Combat Bullpup? |author=David Crane |access-date=24 July 2010 |date=16 March 2004 |publisher=Defense Review |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721204110/http://www.defensereview.com/sar-21-bullpup-assault-rifle-worlds-best-combat-bullpup/ |archive-date=21 July 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n*the sluggish trigger pull compared with the [[crisp trigger]] of the M16S1\n*the weight of the weapon\n*the increased muzzle blast, due to the muzzle being nearer to the user's ears\n*being told by instructors that it is a \"right-handed only\" weapon and left-handed soldiers having to (and are still being taught to) fire with their right hand\n*iron sights that chip off easily when weapon is dropped\n*Lack of internal illumination of the scope (the crosshairs in the scope are virtually invisible in the dark)\n\nSome of these criticisms were addressed with design modifications to the later production models. New weapon handling procedures were also introduced.\n*The magazine changing issue was solved with training soldiers to always hold the pistol grip with their master hand. The charging of the weapon and reloading of magazines are to be done by the non-master hand.\n*The sluggish trigger pull was improved by using a stiff sliding plate in place of the flexible rod.\n*The [[Steyr AUG]] styled iron sights were replaced with stockier, hardier ones.\n\nThe Kevlar plating on the left side of the weapon butt (where a right-handed user's face would typically be) is effective in protecting the user from any internal chamber explosion by directing the resulting force to the right.<ref name=\"SAR-21\"/> However, that resultant force would also seriously injure anyone unfortunate enough to be on the right side of the weapon. In the case of a user firing from his or her left shoulder, this could cause severe injury to his or her face. As a result, all left-handed SAF soldiers are taught to fire from their right shoulder as a safety measure. The SAR 21 was designed with a small in-built brass deflector to eject spent bullet casings forward, thus reducing the chances of the spent casings hitting a left-handed user's face. This means the rifle is not completely ambidextrous but may, in a pinch, be fired from the left shoulder.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\nHowever, [[ST Kinetics]] has taken these criticisms into consideration and had improved the SAR-21 design with the upcoming SAR 21A.{{Advert inline|date=April 2020}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The prototype was unveiled at the Singapore Airshow 2010 and production began in 2012.\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:SAR 21 Rifle.jpg|thumb|A Singaporean soldier takes aim with the SAR-21. Note the emitted red laser beam.]]\n\nLike the [[M16 rifle]], the bolt locks open on an empty magazine. When the magazine is exhausted, it is removed by depressing the [[AK-47|AK]]-style lever. Clearing the weapon is accomplished by removing the magazine, pulling the charging handle to the rear, and observing the chamber. After loading a magazine into the housing, the weapon is made \"ready\" by cocking the weapon, and engaging the [[FN MAG]]-type safety button forward of the trigger guard. The position of the fire selector button (SEMI or AUTO) on the stock may also be adjusted.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\nThe on/off switch for the laser aiming device is located on the left handguard; when holding the weapon at ready, the left thumb rests naturally on it.<ref name=\"SAR-21\"/> With sluggish operation due to fouling, the gas regulator setting may be increased by turning it with a coin, screwdriver, or any other thin flat object. Alternatively, the gas regulator can be unlatched and turned by hand with aid of the knurled surface.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\n==Variants==\n;SAR 21 Light Machine Gun (LMG)\n:Fitted with an open bolt, it has a heavy {{cvt|513|mm|1}} barrel with an integral folding bipod and a foregrip.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\n;SAR 21 Sharpshooter\n:Same as the basic SAR 21, but has 3.0x optical sight instead of standard 1.5x sight.

Coupled with the rising costs of maintaining the M16S1s in SAF's armory, this made it even more justifiable to develop a low-maintenance weapon.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\nThe rifle was in Indian news when an audit was made on whether criminal charges should be filed against ex-Ordnance Factory Board director Sudipta Ghosh for improperly declaring a partnership with STK over supplying Indian law enforcement with the SAR 21 MMS.<ref>https://www.stratpost.com/anatomy-of-a-blacklist-singapore-technologies/</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Army.mil-101955-2011-03-16-100334.jpg|left|thumb|A Singaporean soldier gives an overview of the SAR-21 rifle to a group of [[United States Army|US Army]] soldiers at Multinational Base [[Tarin Kowt]].]]\n\nThe SAR 21 is made of a rugged, high impact polymer, most of the manufacturing is done utilising [[Numerical control|CNC]] machines, with [[ultrasonic welding]] for the [[Alloy steel|steel-reinforced]] [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] halves and the [[gun barrel]] being [[cold forming|cold hammer forged]].<ref name=\"SAR-21\"/> It uses a modified [[Eugene Stoner|Stoner]] operating system, boasting higher reliability and lower recoil.<ref name=\"SAR-21\"/> The translucent magazine allows precise assessment of current ammo load.<ref name= cutshaw/>\n\nThe SAR 21 is also the first production assault rifle of its class to incorporate a built-in [[List of applications for lasers#Laser sight|Laser Aiming Device]]<ref name=\"Fact\"/> (powered by a single [[AA battery|\"AA-size\" battery]]) as standard.<ref name=\"SAR-21\"/> It has a 5 position switch which can emit a visible beam at high or low power. It can also be set to \"steady on\" or \"momentary on\" which is triggered with the use of a pressure switch activated with the user's left thumb.<ref name=\"MF\"/> The rifle incorporates various patented safety features, such as a [[Kevlar]] cheek plate and overpressure vent that protects the shooter in the event of a chamber explosion or catastrophic failure.<ref name= brochure/><ref name=\"PM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4273222.html?page=3 |title=SAR 21 |publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]] |access-date=24 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127083309/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/military_law/4273222.html?page=3 |archive-date=27 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It also has an integral 1.5x [[optics|optical]] [[telescopic sight|scope]] that is built into its carrying handle (A 3.0x version is also available).

The scope is factory-zeroed, and requires minimal further zeroing to suit different users.<ref name= brochure/><ref name=\"Fact\"/> This minimizes non-training range time.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\n==Design issues==\nEarly users of the weapon in the Singapore Armed Forces experienced many problems due to their unfamiliarity with the [[bullpup]] design. Their criticisms (usually in comparison with the [[M16 rifle#M16S1|M16S1]] rifles they were already trained with) include:\n\n*the awkward position of the magazine well, and the difficulty in changing magazines, requiring multiple hand changes due to its bullpup shape{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n*the awkward position of the fire selector (located at the butt, with the action), as opposed to the thumb selector on the M16S1<ref name=cutshaw/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defensereview.com/sar-21-bullpup-assault-rifle-worlds-best-combat-bullpup/ |title=SAR-21 Bullpup Assault Rifle: World\u2019s Best Combat Bullpup? |author=David Crane |access-date=24 July 2010 |date=16 March 2004 |publisher=Defense Review |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721204110/http://www.defensereview.com/sar-21-bullpup-assault-rifle-worlds-best-combat-bullpup/ |archive-date=21 July 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n*the sluggish trigger pull compared with the [[crisp trigger]] of the M16S1\n*the weight of the weapon\n*the increased muzzle blast, due to the muzzle being nearer to the user's ears\n*being told by instructors that it is a \"right-handed only\" weapon and left-handed soldiers having to (and are still being taught to) fire with their right hand\n*iron sights that chip off easily when weapon is dropped\n*Lack of internal illumination of the scope (the crosshairs in the scope are virtually invisible in the dark)\n\nSome of these criticisms were addressed with design modifications to the later production models. New weapon handling procedures were also introduced.\n*The magazine changing issue was solved with training soldiers to always hold the pistol grip with their master hand. The charging of the weapon and reloading of magazines are to be done by the non-master hand.\n*The sluggish trigger pull was improved by using a stiff sliding plate in place of the flexible rod.\n*The [[Steyr AUG]] styled iron sights were replaced with stockier, hardier ones.\n\nThe Kevlar plating on the left side of the weapon butt (where a right-handed user's face would typically be) is effective in protecting the user from any internal chamber explosion by directing the resulting force to the right.<ref name=\"SAR-21\"/> However, that resultant force would also seriously injure anyone unfortunate enough to be on the right side of the weapon. In the case of a user firing from his or her left shoulder, this could cause severe injury to his or her face. As a result, all left-handed SAF soldiers are taught to fire from their right shoulder as a safety measure. The SAR 21 was designed with a small in-built brass deflector to eject spent bullet casings forward, thus reducing the chances of the spent casings hitting a left-handed user's face. This means the rifle is not completely ambidextrous but may, in a pinch, be fired from the left shoulder.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\nHowever, [[ST Kinetics]] has taken these criticisms into consideration and had improved the SAR-21 design with the upcoming SAR 21A.{{Advert inline|date=April 2020}}{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The prototype was unveiled at the Singapore Airshow 2010 and production began in 2012.\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:SAR 21 Rifle.jpg|thumb|A Singaporean soldier takes aim with the SAR-21. Note the emitted red laser beam.]]\n\nLike the [[M16 rifle]], the bolt locks open on an empty magazine. When the magazine is exhausted, it is removed by depressing the [[AK-47|AK]]-style lever. Clearing the weapon is accomplished by removing the magazine, pulling the charging handle to the rear, and observing the chamber. After loading a magazine into the housing, the weapon is made \"ready\" by cocking the weapon, and engaging the [[FN MAG]]-type safety button forward of the trigger guard. The position of the fire selector button (SEMI or AUTO) on the stock may also be adjusted.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\nThe on/off switch for the laser aiming device is located on the left handguard; when holding the weapon at ready, the left thumb rests naturally on it.<ref name=\"SAR-21\"/> With sluggish operation due to fouling, the gas regulator setting may be increased by turning it with a coin, screwdriver, or any other thin flat object. Alternatively, the gas regulator can be unlatched and turned by hand with aid of the knurled surface.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\n==Variants==\n;SAR 21 Light Machine Gun (LMG)\n:Fitted with an open bolt, it has a heavy {{cvt|513|mm|1}} barrel with an integral folding bipod and a foregrip.<ref name=\"JGRG2008\"/>\n\n;SAR 21 Sharpshooter\n:Same as the basic SAR 21, but has 3.0x optical sight instead of standard 1.5x sight.

My family has been my pillar of strength and have always stood by me through thick and thin. I could really relate to the emotions of the film. Plus, Ashwiny is known for her slice-of-life films and I loved her recent work in Bareilly Ki Barfi. Panga is even more special for me as, for the first time, I will be playing the role of a National-level Kabaddi player. That's going to be challenging for sure! I am looking forward to some exciting times with Ashwiny and the Fox Star team.\u201d<ref name=\"ht\"/>\n\nGill who is playing the role of the husband of Ranaut in this film told the Mumbai Mirror: \u201cI loved the script, especially the inspiring family angle. The film is a roller-coaster of emotions but to me the real Indian family feeling was the most heart-warming part of the subject. Since I come from a very close-knit family, I could identify with the story.\u201d<ref name=\"ht\">{{Cite web|url=https://m.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/panga-kangana-ranaut-s-kabaddi-movie-with-ashwiny-iyer-tiwari-gets-a-title/story-Sl5Q6YaMnwQRWHRspc1xmL.html|title=Panga, Kangana Ranaut's kabaddi film title announced with emotional Instagram video|publisher= Hindustani Times|date=21 August 2018|access-date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Training ===\nThe actors appearing in the film as kabbadi players including Ranaut underwent training in kabaddi for over two months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnaindia.com/bollywood/report-kangana-ranaut-ahwiny-iyer-tiwari-s-panga-first-look-out-movie-slated-to-release-next-year-2727345|title=Kangana Ranaut-Ahwiny Iyer Tiwari's 'Panga' first look out, movie slated to release next year|publisher=DNA India|date=7 March 2019|access-date=7 March 2019}}</ref>\n=== Filming ===\nThe film went on floor on 23 March 2017 in [[Panaji]].<ref name=\"india_west\" /><ref name=\"ranaut_heads\" /> The first schedule of the film was wrapped up on 7 December 2018.<ref name=\"times_of_india\" /> The second schedule of the film was wrapped up on 22 June 2019.<ref name=\"bollywood\" /> The director planned next schedule in a Delhi stadium in April.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/panga-shoot-takes-ashwiny-iyer-tiwari-to-delhi/articleshow/68298930.cms|title=Panga shoot takes Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari to Delhi|date=7 March 2019|website=Times of India}}</ref> The third schedule of shooting began in April 2019 in [[Delhi]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/photo-kangana-ranaut-enjoys-gol-gappas-in-delhi/articleshow/68730683.cms|title=Photo: Kangana Ranaut enjoys 'Gol Gappas' in Delhi|date=5 April 2019|accessdate=6 April 2019|website=Times of India}}</ref> The Delhi schedule of the film was completed in mid April and next schedule of shooting to begin in Kolkata.<ref>{{cite web|title=Photos: Kangana Ranaut wraps up the Delhi schedule of her upcoming film 'Panga'|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/photo-features/movies-to-look-forward-to/photos-kangana-ranaut-wraps-up-the-delhi-schedule-of-her-upcoming-film-panga/photostory/68803460.cms|website=Times of India|date=10 April 2019|access-date=7 May 2019}}</ref> The filming was completed in mid July 2019, [[Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari]], the director of the film wrote on her Instagram account, \"My dearest Panga Humans are the sun.

The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] makes the region mild for its latitude. Locally, the area is sunnier than most areas this far north in the British Isles, and also considerably drier, due to the rain shadowing effect of the Pennines. It is somewhat warmer than west coast areas at a similar latitude such as [[Liverpool]] in summer due to stronger shielding from maritime air but also colder in winter and North Sea breezes keep the city cooler than inland areas during summer. It is also one of the most northerly areas where the July average maximum temperature exceeds {{convert|21.5|C|F}}, although this appears to be very localised around the city itself. Flooding in June 2007 caused significant damage to areas of the city.

Though the rhythm of the accent is more like that of northern Lincolnshire than that of the rural East Riding, which is perhaps due to migration from Lincolnshire to the city during its industrial growth, one feature that it does share with the surrounding rural area is that an {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} sound in the middle of a word often becomes an {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}: for example, \"five\" may sound like \"fahve\", \"time\" like \"tahme\".<ref>{{cite web\n |last = Williams\n |first = Ann\n |last2 = Kerswill\n |first2 = Paul\n |title = Dialect Levelling:Continuity VS.

The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] makes the region mild for its latitude. Locally, the area is sunnier than most areas this far north in the British Isles, and also considerably drier, due to the rain shadowing effect of the Pennines. It is somewhat warmer than west coast areas at a similar latitude such as [[Liverpool]] in summer due to stronger shielding from maritime air but also colder in winter and North Sea breezes keep the city cooler than inland areas during summer. It is also one of the most northerly areas where the July average maximum temperature exceeds {{convert|21.5|C|F}}, although this appears to be very localised around the city itself. Flooding in June 2007 caused significant damage to areas of the city. Droughts and heatwaves also occur such as in 2003, 2006 and recently in 2018.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/eengland/7100_1km/MaxTemp_Average_1971-2000_7.gif\n |title       = July average maximum map\n |accessdate  = 1 March 2011\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110409010351/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/eengland/7100_1km/MaxTemp_Average_1971-2000_7.gif\n |archivedate = 9 April 2011\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe absolute maximum temperature recorded is {{convert|34.4|C|F}},<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=5&year=1990&indexid=TXx&stationid=273\n|title = 1990 Maximum\n|accessdate = 1 March 2011\n|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120507121813/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=5&year=1990&indexid=TXx&stationid=273\n|archive-date = 7 May 2012\n|url-status = dead\n}}</ref> set in August 1990.

The vowel in \"Hull\" is pronounced the same way as in northern English, however, and not as the very short {{IPA|/\u028a/}} that exists in Lincolnshire. Though the rhythm of the accent is more like that of northern Lincolnshire than that of the rural East Riding, which is perhaps due to migration from Lincolnshire to the city during its industrial growth, one feature that it does share with the surrounding rural area is that an {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} sound in the middle of a word often becomes an {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}: for example, \"five\" may sound like \"fahve\", \"time\" like \"tahme\".<ref>{{cite web\n |last = Williams\n |first = Ann\n |last2 = Kerswill\n |first2 = Paul\n |title = Dialect Levelling:Continuity VS.
