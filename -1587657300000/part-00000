His marriage to Euphemia of Czersk founded a tradition of relationships of Cieszyn Piasts with [[Masovia]]n Piasts.\n\nCasimir I initially had good relations with [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]], who became the [[King of Poland]] in 1320. But when during 1321\u20131324 Lithuanian forces supporting Elbow-high plundered Cieszyn, Casimir I broke with the Polish King. He then became a closer ally of [[John of Luxembourg]], [[King of Bohemia]] and swore [[homage (medieval)|homage]] to him on 8 February 1327 in [[Opava]]; in exchange for his submission, Casimir I received the promise of inheritance of [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]]. Fifteen days later, on 23 February, he received Cieszyn as a hereditary possession, maintaining a large internal sovereignty.\n\nCasimir I wanted to maintain the territorial unity of his Duchy, so he chose only one of his sons to be his successor \u2014 firstly the eldest, W\u0142adys\u0142aw, and after his early death in 1355 the third, but the only one who remained outside the Church, Przemys\u0142aw Noszak \u2014 and the others were destined for a Church career. In 1337 he acquired the districts of [[Siewierz]] and [[Czelad\u017a]] from the Dukes of [[Bytom]] by 720 fines; also, he (temporarily) took the town of [[Namys\u0142\u00f3w]] from the Dukes of [[Brzeg]], as a part of the dowry of his daughter Anna.\n\nWhen Duke [[Leszek of Racib\u00f3rz|Leszek]] of [[Racib\u00f3rz]] died in 1336, Casimir I tried unsuccessfully to obtain his lands. King John of Bohemia granted this land to Duke [[Nicholas II of Opava|Nicholas II]] of [[Opava]].\n\nIn 1355, after the death of [[Boles\u0142aw of Bytom|Boles\u0142aw]], Duke of [[Ko\u017ale]]-[[Bytom]] without male issue, Casimir I entered a conflict over his inheritance with [[Konrad I of Ole\u015bnica]]. The dispute was only resolved in 1357 (the decision was made as early as 1355, but Bytom remained until that time under the rule of [[Margareta of Sternberg]] \u2014Boles\u0142aw's widow\u2014 as her [[dower]]): the Duke of Cieszyn took possession of half of [[Bytom]] and [[Gliwice]], [[Toszek]] and [[Pyskowice]].\n\nIn the internal politics, Casimir I supported the economic development of his Duchy, mostly towns. He also surrounded Cieszyn with walls and by 1320 granted the town of [[Bielsko]] with German laws.\n\nCasimir I died in 1358 (although there are some indications that he lived until 1360, but this is refuted by the majority of historians) and was buried in the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] church of Cieszyn.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nBy 1321, Casimir I married Euphemia (b. 1310 \u2013 d. aft. 11 January 1374), daughter of Duke [[Trojden I of Czersk|Trojden I]] of [[Czersk, Masovian Voivodeship|Czersk]]-[[Warsaw]].

However, many residents of the District of Columbia recommended that he be appointed as the Commander of the 50th U.S. Colored Volunteer Infantry during the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. This request was not seriously considered by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], and the participation of colored soldiers from the District of Columbia was similarly disregarded. It is not known whether Fleetwood's short stature and physical ailments reduced his chances for consideration.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} His army records state that he was five feet, four and one half inches tall. These records also state that he applied in 1891 for a pension because of \"total\" deafness in his left ear, the result of \"gunshot concussion,\" and \"severe\" deafness in his right ear, the result of [[catarrh]] contracted while in the army.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezN1DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA59|title=Out of the Storm: A Legacy|last=Cochran|first=Anthony B.|date=October 12, 2018|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-9772-0039-6|pages=58\u201359|language=en}}</ref> His application also stated that these ailments prevented him from speaking or singing in public.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nFor a number of years he served as choirmaster of the 15th Street Presbyterian Church, St. Luke's and St. Mary's Protestant Episcopal Churches, as well as the Berean Baptist Church.

It is spoken by the [[Kristang people|Kristang]], a community of people of mixed Portuguese and Asian ancestry of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] race, chiefly in [[Malacca]] ([[Malaysia]]).\n\nThe language is also called '''''Crist\u00e3o''''' or '''''Cristan''''' (\"Christian\"), '''''Portugues di Melaka''''' (\"Malacca Portuguese\"), '''''Linggu Mai''''' (\"Mother Tongue\") or simply '''''Papia'''''. Papia means speak. However, locals and most of the Kristang community refer to the language as \"[[Portugis language|Portugis]]\".\n\nIn ''[[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]'' (2010; formerly the ''Red Book of Endangered Languages'') published by [[UNESCO]], Kristang is classified as a \u201cseverely endangered\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last= Moseley|first= Christopher|author-link= |date= 2012 |title= The UNESCO atlas of the world's languages in danger|url= |location= |publisher=World Oral Literature Project |page= |isbn=978-92-3-104096-2}}</ref> language, with only about 2,000 people who speak it.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nThe Kristang language originated after the conquest of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] (Malaysia) in 1511 by the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The community of speakers descends mainly from [[interracial relationship]]s between Portuguese men and local women, as well as a number of migrants from [[Portuguese India]], themselves of mixed [[Luso-Indian|Indo-Portuguese]] ancestry.\n\nKristang had a substantial influence on [[Macanese language|Macanese]], the creole language spoken in [[Macau]], due to substantial migration from Malacca after its takeover by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]].\n\nEven after Portugal lost Malacca and almost all contact in 1641, the Kristang community largely preserved its language. The demographics of Malacca in the mid 17 century was still predominantly made up of the Portuguese, even after the Dutch took over. The ''Irmang di Greza'' was a manifestation of the bond between language and religion in the KRistang culture. Despite prohibition by the Dutch, the ''Irmang di Greza'' was intermediary between the priest and the remnants of the Portuguese population.  Liturgy and pastoral sessions were conducted in Kristang in Malacca, which contributed to the longevity of the language into a period as late as the 20th century.\n\n=== Attrition of Kristang ===\nThe ceding of Malacca by the Dutch to the British via the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 directly caused the decline of the Kristang language. By the mid 19th century, many Kristangs flocked towards clerical and auxiliary positions provided by their new colonial masters. As such, the Kristang language saw a decline in use compared to English. In addition, the rising affluence of the region meant more job opportunities, resulting in many Kristangs moving away from Malacca. Moreover, the language is not taught at school, although there are still some Church services in Kristang.\n\nIn the context of Singapore, Kristang arrived in the 1820s due to the large influx of Eurasian immigrants from Malacca.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pereira|first= Alexius A| date= 2015 |title= Singapore Chronicles - Eurasians |url= |location= |publisher=Straits Times Press |page= |isbn=9789814747028}}</ref> This resulted in a Kristang-speaking community large enough for the variety of the language spoken in Singapore to be acknowledged as a distinct variety of Creole Portuguese.<ref>{{cite paper|author = Kevin Martens Wong Zhi Qiang|title =  Differential Object Marking in Kristang, An Endangered Creole in Singapore| publisher = | date = 2016|url = https://mitcho.com/students/wong2016.pdf|format = PDF|pages = |accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref> However, there was little exposure and recognition of Kristang in Singapore, especially when English became entrenched as the sole language of education and the major language used in most spheres of society after the country gained independence in 1965. As a result, the intergenerational transmission of Kristang ceased almost completely.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.acu.ac.uk/the-acu-review/awaken-kristang/|title= Awaken, Kristang|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Present status ===\n\nPapia Kristang is facing a decrease in language use within the community.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Baxter |first1= Alan.N |date= 1996|title= Portuguese and Creole Portuguese in the Pacific and Western Pacific rim|doi= 10.1515/9783110819724.2.299 |access-date=}}</ref> There is a language shift to [[English_language|English]] and [[Malay_language|Bahasa Malaysia]] due to prestige and accessibility that eventually led to a decline in Kristang language use.

This long-term revitalisation initiative seeks to revitalize the language by teaching it to a new generation of learners through complementary classes and the provision of online materials.\n\nIn 2017, they held the first Kristang Language Festival which was attended by more than 1,400 people, including the Portuguese-Eurasian community in Singapore and Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister [[Teo Chee Hean]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://kodrah.kristang.com/1st-kristang-language-festival/|title= 1st Kristang Language Festival|accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA Kristang Online Dictionary was also launched at the first Kristang Language Festival. The project, ''Pinchah Kristang: A Dictionary of Kristang''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.luismc.com/pinchah_kristang/|title= Pinchah Kristang: A Dictionary of Kristang|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>, is led and developed by Lu\u00eds Morgado da Costa based on the WordNet system developed at the [[Nanyang_Technological_University|Nanyang Technological University]].\n\nThis dictionary also supports another initiative known as ''Jardinggu, or Kristang Lexical Incubator''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://kodrahkristang.wordpress.com/jardinggu/|title= Jardinggu: The Kristang Lexical Incubator|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>. Initiated in April 2017, the Jardinggu provides a space for the discussion and accelerated addition of new words into the Kristang lexicon. Through this initiative, around 320 new lexemes for concepts that were previously represented by English loans have been suggested by the Kodrah community.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/0/11221/files/2019/12/Wong-special-session.pdf|title=New word development in Singapore Kristang and its implications for variation |publisher= |access-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Malacca====\nThe Kristang-speaking community located at the Portuguese Settlement, or Padri sa Chang (\u201cThe Priest\u2019s Land\u201d) was able to undertake more sustained revitalisation efforts and publicise itself to non-Eurasian Malaysians, and the language. Notably with texts, stories and phrasebooks in Kristang produced by [[Joan Margaret Marbeck]] and through investments and interest from individuals and organisations outside the community. Joan Marbeck has produced three publications: ''Ungu Adanza'' (An Inheritance), ''Linggu Mai'' (Mother Tongue) and the Kristang Phrasebook. She is also credited with writing probably the only play in Kristang, called ''Seng Marianne'' (Without Marianne) and was also instrumental in staging a musical in Kristang - ''Kazamintu no Praiya'' which translates to 'Wedding on the beach'.<ref>{{cite paper|author = HAJA MOHIDEEN BIN MOHAMED ALI|title = THE MAINTENANCE OF MALAYSIA\u2019S MINORITY LANGUAGES| publisher = | date = 2010|url = http://irep.iium.edu.my/9829/4/ICMM2010_p27.pdf|format = PDF|pages = |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWithin the community, there were efforts made together with the help of academics to promote their culture and the Kristang language. In 1988, Alan Baxter published ''A grammar of Kristang'' based on his fieldwork within the community.<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/>\n\nThere are also supports from the Lisbon-based Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, which funded and published Marbeck\u2019s Kristang texts<ref>Joan Margaret Marbeck. ''Ungua Adanza'' (Heritage). Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 1995</ref>, and the University of Malaya and linguists like Dr. Stefanie Pillai, who have produced a CD of Kristang hymns, and in plans of developing Kristang textbook for beginners.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://unravellingmag.com/articles/revitalising-kristang/|title= Revitalising Kristang: An interview with Stefanie Pillai|accessdate=March 15, 2020}}</ref> \n\nAlong with Malacca Portuguese-Eurasian Association (MPEA) president Michael Gerald Singho, they published a textbook, ''Beng Prende Portugues Malak\u00e1 (Papi\u00e1 Cristang)'', also known as Come, Let's Learn Portugues Malak\u00e1 (Papi\u00e1 Cristang) for people who want to learn Kristang. The association also maintains an active Facebook page aimed at sharing and promoting information related to the Kristang language the Kristang way of life.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe Kristang lexicon is borrowed heavily from Portuguese, but often with drastic truncation; for example, Portuguese ''padrinho'' and ''madrinha'' (\"godfather\" and \"godmother\") became ''inyu'' and ''inya'' in Kristang. Because of its largely Portuguese vocabulary, and perhaps also as a result of migrations and cultural exchange along trade routes, the Kristang lexicon has much in common with other Portuguese-based creoles, including the near-extinct creoles of [[Indonesia]] and [[East Timor]]. As it is primarily a creole, much of its vocabulary is also derived from Chinese, Indian and Malay languages to varying degrees.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohideen, S & Mohideen, S|first=|date=2008|title=Survival of the Minority Kristang Language in Malaysia|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/85673255/|journal=Language in India|volume=8(7)|pages=1-18|via=}}</ref>\n!Meaning\n!Kristang Word\n!Origin Word\n!Origin Word Language\n|-\n|Shrimp Paste\n|blacan\n|belacan\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Malay\n|-\n|Walking Stick\n|tongkah\n|tongkat\n|-\n|Hoe\n|changkol\n|cangkul\n|-\n|Jellyfish\n|ampeh\n|ampai\n|-\n|Loincloth\n|kachu\n|katchu\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Tamil\n|-\n|Lime\n|churutu\n|surutu\n|-\n|Grandfather\n|tata\n|thatha\n|-\n|Spatula\n|chengsi\n|chiensi\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hokkien\n|-\n|Lantern\n|aloleng\n|leng tsu\n|-\n|Open-air restaurant\n|kolau\n|kou lau\n|Cantonese\n|-\n|Convent\n|konventu\n|convent\n| rowspan=\"2\" |English\n|-\n|Hospital\n|ospital\n|hospital\n|-\n|Toilet\n|kakus\n|kakhuis\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Dutch\n|-\n|Tombstone\n|kelda\n|kelder\n|}\n[[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] was common: for example, Portuguese ''gordo'' \"fat\" gave Kristang ''godru''.  The Portuguese diphthong ''oi'' (or archaic ''ou'') was reduced to ''o'', e.g. ''dois''/''dous'' \"two\" \u2192 ''dos'',  ''\u00e0 noite''/''\u00e0 noute'' \"tonight\" \u2192 ''anoti''/''anuti''.\n \nMany Portuguese words that began with ''ch'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (\"sh\") in modern Portuguese, have the pronunciation {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} (\"ch\" as in \"cheese\") in Kristang. So, for example, Portuguese ''chegar'' \"to arrive\" and ''chuva'' \"rain\" produced Kristang ''chegak'' and ''chua'' (pronounced with {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}). This could have been due to [[Malay language|Malay]] influence, or it could be that Kristang preserved the original pronunciation  {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} of Old Portuguese. (Note that Portuguese \"ch\" pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} occurs in Northern Portugal.)\n\nThe chief resource for individuals to pick up Kristang is a Kristang-English dictionary compiled by Baxter and de Silva<ref>{{Cite journal|last=N Baxter|first=Alan|date=2004|title=A dictionary of Kristang (Malacca Creole Portuguese) with an English-Kristang finderlist|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/146269/1/PL-564|journal=Pacific Linguistics|volume=|pages=|via=Pacific Linguistics}}</ref>\n\n= Writing system =\nKristang was and is largely an oral language and has never been taught officially in schools.

For example, the stress in /au/ is on the first vowel whereas in /io/, the second vowel is stressed<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/>.\n\n= Grammar =\nThe grammatical structure of Kristang is similar to that of the [[Malay language]]. The usage of verbs is one of the grammatical features of Kristang that displays this quality. While Portuguese verbs mainly use morphology, or suffixes, to change a verb\u2019s tense or for it to match with the person and number of its subject, Malay does not change the form of the verb itself. Instead, it makes use of pre-verbal words to convey tense and does not indicate the person or number of the subject in the form of the verb. Kristang\u2019s structure is practically identical to Malay, although the choice of words comes from Portuguese. \n\nTo indicate verb tenses, the following appositions are used: ''jah'' (i.e. from the Portuguese ''j\u00e1'', meaning \"already\", or controversially a corruption of Malay ''dah'', shortened version of ''sudah'', also \"already\") for past tenses; ''ta'' (from ''est\u00e1'', which means \"is\") for present continuous tenses and ''logu'' or ''lo'' (from ''logo'', which means \"soon\") for the future tense. These simplified forms correspond with their equivalents in Malay ''sudah'', ''sedang'', and ''akan'', respectively.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!English\n!Portuguese\n!Malay\n!Kristang\n|-\n|I eat \n|Eu como\n|Saya makan\n|Yo kumih\n|-\n|I ate/have eaten \n|Eu comi\n|Saya sudah makan\n|Yo ja kumih\n|-\n|I will eat \n|Eu comerei\n|Saya akan makan\n|Yo logu kumih\n|-\n|He eats\n|Ele come\n|Dia makan\n|Eli kumih\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\nPluralisation is also the same in Malay as in Kristang. For example in English and Portuguese, an \u2018\u2013s\u2019 is added to make cats or gatos, whereas in Kristang and Malay, the entire word is duplicated, such as gatu-gatu in Kristang, and kucing-kucing in Malay. Reduplication is not only a\nfeature of the noun class but also a feature of the adjective, adverb and verb classes.<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/> Adjectives and adverbs reduplicate to signify intensity: ''k\u011bni~k\u011bninu'', \u201cquite small, very small\u201d, ''belu belu'' \u201cquite old\u201d, ''sedu sedu'' \u201cquite/very early\u201d. On the other hand, the interrogative pronouns reduplicate to signify indefiniteness: ''keng keng'' (who who) \u201cwhoever\u201d, ''ki ki'' (what what \u201cwhatever\u201d. As for the reduplication of the numerals, ''dos'' \u201ctwo\u201d  and ''tres'' \u201cthree\u201d, it gave the respective readings \u201cin pairs\u201d and \u201cin threes\u201d.<ref name=\"Baxter 2013\"/>\n\nAdversity Passive, which is used to talk about situations where a negative action happens to something, but the person or originator of the negative action is not mentioned something, is also present both in Kristang and Malay. The Adversity Passive is signaled by kena (Malay), and by tokah (Kristang). \n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Colloquial Malay \n!Kristang\n!Colloquial English near-equivalent\n|-\n|Ikan kena makan\n|Pesi tokah kumih\n|The fish got eaten\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\nIn terms of sentence clause structure, Papi\u00e1 Kristang has SVO (Subject\u2013Verb\u2013Object) word order in simple sentences. The direct human objects are case-marked by the preposition ''ku''. The same preposition also marks indirect objects. In transitive clauses, the case-marked indirect object may precede the direct object, especially when the former is pronominal. Noncore arguments are generally located either at the beginning or at the end of the sentence:\n{|class=wikitable\n!Kristang \n|Amiang Diego lo d\u00e1 ku bos ak\u00e9 doi na butika\n|-\n!English\n|Tomorrow, Diego will give you that money, at the shop\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\nFor complex sentences, the phrases and clauses are joined by coordinating conjunctions ''ku'' \"with, and\", ''k\u011b'' \"or\", and ''mas'' \"but\". There are also instances where object clauses may be headed by ''ki''; however, this is rare and is only found in traditional formal registers, as in a wedding speech. The most frequent means of expressing nominal subordination is parataxis.<ref name=\"Baxter 2013\">{{cite web|url= https://apics-online.info/surveys/42#section-7simplesentences|title= Survey chapter: Papi\u00e1 Kristang|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdverbial clauses are headed by ''antis di'' \"before\", ''kiora'' \"when\", ''chuma'' \"as\", ''kantu'' \"if\", ''padi'' \"in order to\", ''kauzu ki'' \"because\", ''kifoi'' \"because\", etc., yet may also be indicated by parataxis without conjunctions. <ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/>\n\nRelative clauses are headed by ''ki'' \"what, who\u2019\"(and very rarely by ''keng'' \"who\"), yet also commonly occur with a pronoun head or may occur without it.\n\n=Kristang examples=\n\n===Numbers===\nMuch of the lexicon for Kristang numbers draws influence from Portuguese, a [[Romance language]]. However, unlike Portuguese, which distinguishes between the masculine and feminine forms of \u201cone\u201d (''um/uma'') and \u201ctwo\u201d (''dois/duas''), numbers in Kristang do not inflect for gender.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Kristang\n!Portuguese\n!Malay\n|-\n|one\n|ungua/ngua \n|um (''masc.'') / uma (''fem.'')\n|satu\n|-\n|two\n|dos\n|dois (''masc.'') / duas

[[creole language]]. It is spoken by the [[Kristang people|Kristang]], a community of people of mixed Portuguese and Asian ancestry of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] race, chiefly in [[Malacca]] ([[Malaysia]]).\n\nThe language is also called '''''Crist\u00e3o''''' or '''''Cristan''''' (\"Christian\"), '''''Portugues di Melaka''''' (\"Malacca Portuguese\"), '''''Linggu Mai''''' (\"Mother Tongue\") or simply '''''Papia'''''. Papia means speak. However, locals and most of the Kristang community refer to the language as \"[[Portugis language|Portugis]]\".\n\nIn ''[[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]'' (2010; formerly the ''Red Book of Endangered Languages'') published by [[UNESCO]], Kristang is classified as a \u201cseverely endangered\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last= Moseley|first= Christopher|author-link= |date= 2012 |title= The UNESCO atlas of the world's languages in danger|url= |location= |publisher=World Oral Literature Project |page= |isbn=978-92-3-104096-2}}</ref> language, with only about 2,000 people who speak it.\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\nThe Kristang language originated after the conquest of [[Sultanate of Malacca|Malacca]] (Malaysia) in 1511 by the [[Portuguese Empire]]. The community of speakers descends mainly from [[interracial relationship]]s between Portuguese men and local women, as well as a number of migrants from [[Portuguese India]], themselves of mixed [[Luso-Indian|Indo-Portuguese]] ancestry.\n\nKristang had a substantial influence on [[Macanese language|Macanese]], the creole language spoken in [[Macau]], due to substantial migration from Malacca after its takeover by the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]].\n\nEven after Portugal lost Malacca and almost all contact in 1641, the Kristang community largely preserved its language. The demographics of Malacca in the mid 17 century was still predominantly made up of the Portuguese, even after the Dutch took over. The ''Irmang di Greza'' was a manifestation of the bond between language and religion in the KRistang culture. Despite prohibition by the Dutch, the ''Irmang di Greza'' was intermediary between the priest and the remnants of the Portuguese population.  Liturgy and pastoral sessions were conducted in Kristang in Malacca, which contributed to the longevity of the language into a period as late as the 20th century.\n\n=== Attrition of Kristang ===\nThe ceding of Malacca by the Dutch to the British via the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 directly caused the decline of the Kristang language. By the mid 19th century, many Kristangs flocked towards clerical and auxiliary positions provided by their new colonial masters. As such, the Kristang language saw a decline in use compared to English. In addition, the rising affluence of the region meant more job opportunities, resulting in many Kristangs moving away from Malacca. Moreover, the language is not taught at school, although there are still some Church services in Kristang.\n\nIn the context of Singapore, Kristang arrived in the 1820s due to the large influx of Eurasian immigrants from Malacca.<ref>{{cite book |last= Pereira|first= Alexius A| date= 2015 |title= Singapore Chronicles - Eurasians |url= |location= |publisher=Straits Times Press |page= |isbn=9789814747028}}</ref> This resulted in a Kristang-speaking community large enough for the variety of the language spoken in Singapore to be acknowledged as a distinct variety of Creole Portuguese.<ref>{{cite paper|author = Kevin Martens Wong Zhi Qiang|title =  Differential Object Marking in Kristang, An Endangered Creole in Singapore| publisher = | date = 2016|url = https://mitcho.com/students/wong2016.pdf|format = PDF|pages = |accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref> However, there was little exposure and recognition of Kristang in Singapore, especially when English became entrenched as the sole language of education and the major language used in most spheres of society after the country gained independence in 1965.

Therefore, there are revitalisation efforts made to save this endangered language.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\nThe language has about 750 speakers in Malacca<ref>{{harvp|Baxter|2005|page=16}}</ref> and another 100 in Singapore.<ref name=\"Wong 2016\">{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Kevin Martens|title=Kodrah Kristang Kaminyu di Kodramintu: Kinyang Ngua (The Kristang Language Revitalization Plan, Phase One)|url=https://kodrahkristang.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/kaminyu-di-kodramintu-v1.pdf|website=Kodrah Kristang|accessdate=August 12, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013200854/https://kodrahkristang.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/kaminyu-di-kodramintu-v1.pdf|archivedate=October 13, 2016}}</ref> A small number of speakers also live in other Portuguese Eurasian communities in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Penang]] in Malaysia, and in diaspora communities in [[Perth]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and elsewhere.<ref name=\"Baxter1988\">{{Cite book |url=http://sealang.net/archives/pl/pdf/PL-B95.pdf |title=A Grammar of Kristang (Malacca Creole Portuguese) |last=Baxter |first=Alan N. |publisher=Pacific Linguistics |year=1988 |isbn=0-85883-375-1  |series=Pacific Linguistics Series B - No. 95 |location=Canberra |doi=10.15144/pl-b95 |hdl=1885/145643 |hdl-access=free |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Revitalisation efforts===\nThe language is currently in steep decline, although efforts to revive it have begun in recent years in both the Portuguese Settlement in Malacca and Singapore.\n\n====Singapore====\nThe revitalisation of Papia Kristang in Singapore can be largely attributed to the [https://kodrah.kristang.com Kodrah Kristang]('Awaken, Kristang') initiative led by Kevin Martens Wong<ref name=\"Wong 2016\"/>. This long-term revitalisation initiative seeks to revitalize the language by teaching it to a new generation of learners through complementary classes and the provision of online materials.\n\nIn 2017, they held the first Kristang Language Festival which was attended by more than 1,400 people, including the Portuguese-Eurasian community in Singapore and Singapore\u2019s Deputy Prime Minister [[Teo Chee Hean]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://kodrah.kristang.com/1st-kristang-language-festival/|title= 1st Kristang Language Festival|accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nA Kristang Online Dictionary was also launched at the first Kristang Language Festival. The project, ''Pinchah Kristang: A Dictionary of Kristang''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.luismc.com/pinchah_kristang/|title= Pinchah Kristang: A Dictionary of Kristang|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>, is led and developed by Lu\u00eds Morgado da Costa based on the WordNet system developed at the [[Nanyang_Technological_University|Nanyang Technological University]].\n\nThis dictionary also supports another initiative known as ''Jardinggu, or Kristang Lexical Incubator''<ref>{{cite web|url= https://kodrahkristang.wordpress.com/jardinggu/|title= Jardinggu: The Kristang Lexical Incubator|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>. Initiated in April 2017, the Jardinggu provides a space for the discussion and accelerated addition of new words into the Kristang lexicon. Through this initiative, around 320 new lexemes for concepts that were previously represented by English loans have been suggested by the Kodrah community.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/0/11221/files/2019/12/Wong-special-session.pdf|title=New word development in Singapore Kristang and its implications for variation |publisher= |access-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Malacca====\nThe Kristang-speaking community located at the Portuguese Settlement, or Padri sa Chang (\u201cThe Priest\u2019s Land\u201d) was able to undertake more sustained revitalisation efforts and publicise itself to non-Eurasian Malaysians, and the language. Notably with texts, stories and phrasebooks in Kristang produced by [[Joan Margaret Marbeck]] and through investments and interest from individuals and organisations outside the community. Joan Marbeck has produced three publications: ''Ungu Adanza'' (An Inheritance), ''Linggu Mai'' (Mother Tongue) and the Kristang Phrasebook. She is also credited with writing probably the only play in Kristang, called ''Seng Marianne'' (Without Marianne) and was also instrumental in staging a musical in Kristang - ''Kazamintu no Praiya'' which translates to 'Wedding on the beach'.<ref>{{cite paper|author = HAJA MOHIDEEN BIN MOHAMED ALI|title = THE MAINTENANCE OF MALAYSIA\u2019S MINORITY LANGUAGES| publisher = | date = 2010|url = http://irep.iium.edu.my/9829/4/ICMM2010_p27.pdf|format = PDF|pages = |accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nWithin the community, there were efforts made together with the help of academics to promote their culture and the Kristang language. In 1988, Alan Baxter published ''A grammar of Kristang'' based on his fieldwork within the community.<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/>\n\nThere are also supports from the Lisbon-based Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, which funded and published Marbeck\u2019s Kristang texts<ref>Joan Margaret Marbeck. ''Ungua Adanza'' (Heritage). Lisbon: Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, 1995</ref>, and the University of Malaya and linguists like Dr. Stefanie Pillai, who have produced a CD of Kristang hymns, and in plans of developing Kristang textbook for beginners.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://unravellingmag.com/articles/revitalising-kristang/|title= Revitalising Kristang: An interview with Stefanie Pillai|accessdate=March 15, 2020}}</ref> \n\nAlong with Malacca Portuguese-Eurasian Association (MPEA) president Michael Gerald Singho, they published a textbook, ''Beng Prende Portugues Malak\u00e1 (Papi\u00e1 Cristang)'', also known as Come, Let's Learn Portugues Malak\u00e1 (Papi\u00e1 Cristang) for people who want to learn Kristang. The association also maintains an active Facebook page aimed at sharing and promoting information related to the Kristang language the Kristang way of life.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nThe Kristang lexicon is borrowed heavily from Portuguese, but often with drastic truncation; for example, Portuguese ''padrinho'' and ''madrinha'' (\"godfather\" and \"godmother\") became ''inyu'' and ''inya'' in Kristang. Because of its largely Portuguese vocabulary, and perhaps also as a result of migrations and cultural exchange along trade routes, the Kristang lexicon has much in common with other Portuguese-based creoles, including the near-extinct creoles of [[Indonesia]] and [[East Timor]]. As it is primarily a creole, much of its vocabulary is also derived from Chinese, Indian and Malay languages to varying degrees.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohideen, S & Mohideen, S|first=|date=2008|title=Survival of the Minority Kristang Language in Malaysia|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/85673255/|journal=Language in India|volume=8(7)|pages=1-18|via=}}</ref>\n!Meaning\n!Kristang Word\n!Origin Word\n!Origin Word Language\n|-\n|Shrimp Paste\n|blacan\n|belacan\n| rowspan=\"4\" |Malay\n|-\n|Walking Stick\n|tongkah\n|tongkat\n|-\n|Hoe\n|changkol\n|cangkul\n|-\n|Jellyfish\n|ampeh\n|ampai\n|-\n|Loincloth\n|kachu\n|katchu\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Tamil\n|-\n|Lime\n|churutu\n|surutu\n|-\n|Grandfather\n|tata\n|thatha\n|-\n|Spatula\n|chengsi\n|chiensi\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hokkien\n|-\n|Lantern\n|aloleng\n|leng tsu\n|-\n|Open-air restaurant\n|kolau\n|kou lau\n|Cantonese\n|-\n|Convent\n|konventu\n|convent\n| rowspan=\"2\" |English\n|-\n|Hospital\n|ospital\n|hospital\n|-\n|Toilet\n|kakus\n|kakhuis\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Dutch\n|-\n|Tombstone\n|kelda\n|kelder\n|}\n[[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] was common: for example, Portuguese ''gordo'' \"fat\" gave Kristang ''godru''.  The Portuguese diphthong ''oi'' (or archaic ''ou'') was reduced to ''o'', e.g. ''dois''/''dous'' \"two\" \u2192 ''dos'',  ''\u00e0 noite''/''\u00e0 noute'' \"tonight\" \u2192 ''anoti''/''anuti''.\n \nMany Portuguese words that began with ''ch'', pronounced {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (\"sh\") in modern Portuguese, have the pronunciation {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} (\"ch\" as in \"cheese\") in Kristang. So, for example, Portuguese ''chegar'' \"to arrive\" and ''chuva'' \"rain\" produced Kristang ''chegak'' and ''chua'' (pronounced with {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}). This could have been due to [[Malay language|Malay]] influence, or it could be that Kristang preserved the original pronunciation  {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} of Old Portuguese. (Note that Portuguese \"ch\" pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} occurs in Northern Portugal.)\n\nThe chief resource for individuals to pick up Kristang is a Kristang-English dictionary compiled by Baxter and de Silva<ref>{{Cite journal|last=N Baxter|first=Alan|date=2004|title=A dictionary of Kristang (Malacca Creole Portuguese) with an English-Kristang finderlist|url=https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/146269/1/PL-564|journal=Pacific Linguistics|volume=|pages=|via=Pacific Linguistics}}</ref>\n\n== Writing system ==\nKristang was and is largely an oral language and has never been taught officially in schools. The first proposal<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/> for a standard orthography was made in the late 1980s, with the publication of a thesis, \u201cA Grammar of Kristang\u201d by Alan N. Baxter, in which he emphasizes the use of the [[Malay alphabet|Malay orthography]].\n\nIt was seldom written except by isolated individuals, including linguists and Portuguese missionaries, and most of the existing texts were of a religious nature, and written in some modification of Portuguese orthography.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://kreolmagazine.com/culture/history-and-culture/papia-kristang-the-creole-portuguese-of-malacca-and-singapore/#.XqG2RlMzY0o|title= Papia Kristang: The Creole Portuguese of Malacca and Singapore|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs in most [[Portuguese dialects]], the vowel ''e'' is usually pronounced {{IPA|[i]}} when followed by a syllable with {{IPA|/i/}}; so, for example, ''penitensia'' (\"penitence\") is pronounced {{IPA|[pini\u02c8te\u0272sia]}}.\n\nIn the 1990s, [[Joan Margaret Marbeck]]'s book ''Ungua Andanza'' was published, with the orthography written in a Luso-Malay context.<ref>Joan Margaret Marbeck.

For example, the stress in /au/ is on the first vowel whereas in /io/, the second vowel is stressed<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/>.\n\n= Grammar =\nThe grammatical structure of Kristang is similar to that of the [[Malay language]]. The usage of verbs is one of the grammatical features of Kristang that displays this quality. While Portuguese verbs mainly use morphology, or suffixes, to change a verb\u2019s tense or for it to match with the person and number of its subject, Malay does not change the form of the verb itself. Instead, it makes use of pre-verbal words to convey tense and does not indicate the person or number of the subject in the form of the verb. Kristang\u2019s structure is practically identical to Malay, although the choice of words comes from Portuguese. \n\nTo indicate verb tenses, the following appositions are used: ''jah'' (i.e. from the Portuguese ''j\u00e1'', meaning \"already\", or controversially a corruption of Malay ''dah'', shortened version of ''sudah'', also \"already\") for past tenses; ''ta'' (from ''est\u00e1'', which means \"is\") for present continuous tenses and ''logu'' or ''lo'' (from ''logo'', which means \"soon\") for the future tense. These simplified forms correspond with their equivalents in Malay ''sudah'', ''sedang'', and ''akan'', respectively.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n!English\n!Portuguese\n!Malay\n!Kristang\n|-\n|I eat \n|Eu como\n|Saya makan\n|Yo kumih\n|-\n|I ate/have eaten \n|Eu comi\n|Saya sudah makan\n|Yo ja kumih\n|-\n|I will eat \n|Eu comerei\n|Saya akan makan\n|Yo logu kumih\n|-\n|He eats\n|Ele come\n|Dia makan\n|Eli kumih\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\nPluralisation is also the same in Malay as in Kristang. For example in English and Portuguese, an \u2018\u2013s\u2019 is added to make cats or gatos, whereas in Kristang and Malay, the entire word is duplicated, such as gatu-gatu in Kristang, and kucing-kucing in Malay. Reduplication is not only a\nfeature of the noun class but also a feature of the adjective, adverb and verb classes.<ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/> Adjectives and adverbs reduplicate to signify intensity: ''k\u011bni~k\u011bninu'', \u201cquite small, very small\u201d, ''belu belu'' \u201cquite old\u201d, ''sedu sedu'' \u201cquite/very early\u201d. On the other hand, the interrogative pronouns reduplicate to signify indefiniteness: ''keng keng'' (who who) \u201cwhoever\u201d, ''ki ki'' (what what \u201cwhatever\u201d. As for the reduplication of the numerals, ''dos'' \u201ctwo\u201d  and ''tres'' \u201cthree\u201d, it gave the respective readings \u201cin pairs\u201d and \u201cin threes\u201d.<ref name=\"Baxter 2013\"/>\n\nAdversity Passive, which is used to talk about situations where a negative action happens to something, but the person or originator of the negative action is not mentioned something, is also present both in Kristang and Malay. The Adversity Passive is signaled by kena (Malay), and by tokah (Kristang). \n\n{|class=wikitable\n!Colloquial Malay \n!Kristang\n!Colloquial English near-equivalent\n|-\n|Ikan kena makan\n|Pesi tokah kumih\n|The fish got eaten\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\nIn terms of sentence clause structure, Papi\u00e1 Kristang has SVO (Subject\u2013Verb\u2013Object) word order in simple sentences. The direct human objects are case-marked by the preposition ''ku''. The same preposition also marks indirect objects. In transitive clauses, the case-marked indirect object may precede the direct object, especially when the former is pronominal. Noncore arguments are generally located either at the beginning or at the end of the sentence:\n{|class=wikitable\n!Kristang \n|Amiang Diego lo d\u00e1 ku bos ak\u00e9 doi na butika\n|-\n!English\n|Tomorrow, Diego will give you that money, at the shop\n|-\n<sup></sup> \n|}\n\nFor complex sentences, the phrases and clauses are joined by coordinating conjunctions ''ku'' \"with, and\", ''k\u011b'' \"or\", and ''mas'' \"but\". There are also instances where object clauses may be headed by ''ki''; however, this is rare and is only found in traditional formal registers, as in a wedding speech. The most frequent means of expressing nominal subordination is parataxis.<ref name=\"Baxter 2013\">{{cite web|url= https://apics-online.info/surveys/42#section-7simplesentences|title= Survey chapter: Papi\u00e1 Kristang|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdverbial clauses are headed by ''antis di'' \"before\", ''kiora'' \"when\", ''chuma'' \"as\", ''kantu'' \"if\", ''padi'' \"in order to\", ''kauzu ki'' \"because\", ''kifoi'' \"because\", etc., yet may also be indicated by parataxis without conjunctions. <ref name=\"Baxter1988\"/>\n\nRelative clauses are headed by ''ki'' \"what, who\u2019\"(and very rarely by ''keng'' \"who\"), yet also commonly occur with a pronoun head or may occur without it.\n\n=Kristang examples=\n\n===Numbers===\nMuch of the lexicon for Kristang numbers draws influence from Portuguese, a [[Romance language]]. However, unlike Portuguese, which distinguishes between the masculine and feminine forms of \u201cone\u201d (''um/uma'') and \u201ctwo\u201d (''dois/duas''), numbers in Kristang do not inflect for gender.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Kristang\n!Portuguese\n!Malay\n|-\n|one\n|ungua/ngua \n|um (''masc.'') / uma (''fem.'')\n|satu\n|-\n|two\n|dos\n|dois (''masc.'') / duas
