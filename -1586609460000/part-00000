This goal crumbles when her parents are forced to undergo sterilization or lose their welfare checks. Alice represents the only real beneficial family member; her aging parents are lazy alcoholics and her siblings have physical and mental disabilities, or criminal ties. But she is told that she too must be sterilized: as their family's corrupt bloodline must end.\n\nAlice's parents grudgingly accept the court order, but she flees the house. Unfortunately, the police soon catch her. Her fianc\u00e9 Jim makes a bold case to Dr. Brooks, who testifies on Alice's behalf, but it doesn't change the court's decision. Meanwhile, another ally of Alice and Jim, Father O'Brien (played by director Crane Wilbur), begs Mrs. Mason to reconsider the sterilization decision. She refuses, desperate to keep receiving welfare, but she becomes so drunk that she reveals that Alice was a foundling the Masons took in, so she actually isn't of their blood. Father O'Brien races to stop the procedure with the new information. Dr. Brooks is ultimately able to stop the procedure in time.\n\n== Cast ==\n*[[Diane Sinclair]] as Alice Mason\n*[[Donald Douglas (American actor)|Donald Douglas]] as Dr. Brooks\n*[[John Preston (actor)|John Preston]] as Dr. Crosby\n*[[Carlyle Moore Jr.]] as Jim Baker\n*[[Sterling Holloway]] as Dr. Dorsey\n*[[W.

The route was originally planned to go from [[Tai Wai station]] to [[Central South station|Central West station]] (proposed to be located under the [[Mid-Levels]]), as an extension of the then-under-construction KCR Ma On Shan Rail (now the [[Ma On Shan line]]).\n\nThe KCRC announced modifications to the proposal in 2005, with the East Kowloon portion of the line joining KCR Ma On Shan Rail at Tai Wai and KCR West Rail (now the [[West Rail line]]) at [[Hung Hom station|Hung Hom]], with the cross-harbour portion joining KCR East Rail (now the [[East Rail line]]) at Hung Hom. Mong Kok Station (now [[Mong Kok East station|Mong Kok East]]) would have been relocated, joining a new tunnel to a deeper Hung Hom station platform connecting to the cross-harbour section. Additionally, stations at [[Tsz Wan Shan]] and [[Whampoa Garden]] were removed from the proposal; the areas would instead have been served by [[people mover]]s ({{abbr|APMs|Automatic People Movers}}) from other stations. However, the KCRC's proposal had not yet been finalised.\n\nAt the same time, the MTRC submitted a new proposal to the government. According to the proposal, the [[Kwun Tong line]] would be extended from [[Yau Ma Tei station]] to [[Whampoa station]] (as the KCRC had decided to omit Whampoa Garden station from its proposal), and the route of the SCL would follow the KCRC's original proposal instead of the 2005 modified proposal. An underground train depot would have been built beneath the passenger terminal of the former [[Kai Tak International Airport]], adjacent to [[Prince Edward Road East]] in [[Kowloon City]]; however, under the Kai Tak redevelopment plan released by the government in October 2006, the depot would have to be constructed somewhere else.<ref>\"Diamond Hill eyed for train depot\", [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/ ''The Standard''], 13 November 2006.</ref>\n\n===MTR\u2013KCR merge plan===\nOn 11 April 2006, MTRC signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the government of Hong Kong, the owner of KCRC, to [[MTR\u2013KCR merger|merge the operations]] of the territory's two railway networks. According to the memorandum, the MTRC-owned MTR lines will be fully integrated with the Shatin to Central Link, which will be part of the MTR system. The government also intended to choose the KCRC's modified proposal to build the railway, that is, extending the current [[East Rail line]] to [[Hong Kong Island]]. However, final decisions were not made before conducting further studies on the proposal with the MTRC.\n\nThe new proposal was announced jointly by both companies on 12 July 2007,<ref>http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr06-07/chinese/panels/tp/tp_rdp/papers/tp_rdp0716cb1-2058-1-c.pdf</ref> before the merger of the two rail networks on 2 December that year. Under this proposal, the depot for the Sha Tin to Central Link would have been built underneath the former [[Tai Hom Village]] site between Kai Tak and Diamond Hill stations. The people movers were omitted; Causeway Bay North station was also removed from the proposal due to potential adverse effects on road traffic during construction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

The route was originally planned to go from [[Tai Wai station]] to [[Central South station|Central West station]] (proposed to be located under the [[Mid-Levels]]), as an extension of the then-under-construction KCR Ma On Shan Rail (now the [[Ma On Shan line]]).\n\nThe KCRC announced modifications to the proposal in 2005, with the East Kowloon portion of the line joining KCR Ma On Shan Rail at Tai Wai and KCR West Rail (now the [[West Rail line]]) at [[Hung Hom station|Hung Hom]], with the cross-harbour portion joining KCR East Rail (now the [[East Rail line]]) at Hung Hom. Mong Kok Station (now [[Mong Kok East station|Mong Kok East]]) would have been relocated, joining a new tunnel to a deeper Hung Hom station platform connecting to the cross-harbour section. Additionally, stations at [[Tsz Wan Shan]] and [[Whampoa Garden]] were removed from the proposal; the areas would instead have been served by [[people mover]]s ({{abbr|APMs|Automatic People Movers}}) from other stations. However, the KCRC's proposal had not yet been finalised.\n\nAt the same time, the MTRC submitted a new proposal to the government. According to the proposal, the [[Kwun Tong line]] would be extended from [[Yau Ma Tei station]] to [[Whampoa station]] (as the KCRC had decided to omit Whampoa Garden station from its proposal), and the route of the SCL would follow the KCRC's original proposal instead of the 2005 modified proposal. An underground train depot would have been built beneath the passenger terminal of the former [[Kai Tak International Airport]], adjacent to [[Prince Edward Road East]] in [[Kowloon City]]; however, under the Kai Tak redevelopment plan released by the government in October 2006, the depot would have to be constructed somewhere else.<ref>\"Diamond Hill eyed for train depot\", [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/ ''The Standard''], 13 November 2006.</ref>\n\n===MTR\u2013KCR merge plan===\nOn 11 April 2006, MTRC signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with the government of Hong Kong, the owner of KCRC, to [[MTR\u2013KCR merger|merge the operations]] of the territory's two railway networks. According to the memorandum, the MTRC-owned MTR lines will be fully integrated with the Shatin to Central Link, which will be part of the MTR system. The government also intended to choose the KCRC's modified proposal to build the railway, that is, extending the current [[East Rail line]] to [[Hong Kong Island]]. However, final decisions were not made before conducting further studies on the proposal with the MTRC.\n\nThe new proposal was announced jointly by both companies on 12 July 2007,<ref>http://www.legco.gov.hk/yr06-07/chinese/panels/tp/tp_rdp/papers/tp_rdp0716cb1-2058-1-c.pdf</ref> before the merger of the two rail networks on 2 December that year. Under this proposal, the depot for the Sha Tin to Central Link would have been built underneath the former [[Tai Hom Village]] site between Kai Tak and Diamond Hill stations. The people movers were omitted; Causeway Bay North station was also removed from the proposal due to potential adverse effects on road traffic during construction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"
