'''BBC Radio & Music Production''' unit ({{aka}} '''Bristol Network Radio''') operates separately from [[BBC Radio Bristol]] (part of the BBC local radio network), which serves listeners in and around the city. The network production team makes programs for the UK and a global audience. The genre focus in Bristol includes a wide range of topics such as food and farming, environmental journalism, natural history, investigative documentaries, human interest, Bristol R&M Production readings, drama, poetry, conversation, and political debates. In 2017, the team in Bristol began producing podcasts for the BBC. It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London-based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies. The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns. A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>\n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service. It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref>\n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019, presenter and poet Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer, and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech at the Radio 4 listening festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSoul Music has no presenter, focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them. The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit. The same programme won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013. It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television. Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began, it has changed the face of international broadcasting. The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940s when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer. His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success. He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share. When he was given the freedom of the city of Bristol, Sir David Attenborough paid tribute to Christopher Parsons and Desmond Hawkins, who established the Natural History TV Unit in 1957. \"I had the honour and luck and privilege to be asked to join these two men. The honour belongs to them,\" he said.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes for the West Region and was keen to see if his radio formats would work in the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and Christopher Parsons. The three men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nSir David Attenborough has worked with the NHU Radio Department in Bristol including the wonderful \"Life Stories\" \u2013 a series of talks on the natural histories of creatures and plants from around the world. He was also the first voice to introduce Tweet of the Day, a daily celebration of global birdlife that from 2013 has woken up BBC Radio 4 listeners every morning. Here is a blog by Sarah Blunt, the distinguished natural history radio producer, writing about the birth of Tweet.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/3143388d-5c2f-3e73-a3c1-727bb8c6b65d</ref>\n\n== Natural history ==\nBristol Network Radio still makes original and groundbreaking Natural History content for public service radio (not for profit)\nand produced the first eco-thriller drama podcast 'FOREST 404' for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds.\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06tqsg3</ref>\n\nSet in the 24th century, after a data crash called 'The Cataclysm'. Pan, the main character, is a young woman with a boring job sorting and deleting old sound files that survived the crash. She uncovers a set of sound recordings from the early 21st century that haunt her.\n\nThis immersive sci-fi thriller stars Pearl Mackie, Tanya Moodie, and Pippa Haywood \u2013 with original music by Bonobo. You can still hear it on BBC Sounds.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p074m60p</ref>\n\nForest 404 was used to launch a groundbreaking public experiment investigating the impact of natural sounds on well-being and mental health. This was done in partnership with the AHRC (Arts & Humanities Research Council), Natural History Television, Exeter University, Bristol University, and the Open University. The drama was written by Bristol-based writer Tim X Atack<ref>http://www.timatack.co.uk/</ref>\n\nIt was produced and directed by Becky Ripley and the accompanying talks were produced by Eliza Lomas. The series has received critical acclaim, which includes winning a British Writers Guild award in January 2020 for Tim X Atack, as well as winning a silver Prix Europa. It was the first drama to make it into the iTunes podcast Top Ten. Its highest position was #2.\n\n== The Fun Factory ==\nBBC Bristol began producing BBC drama from 1940 onward. \nShows like ITMA, Bandwagon, Workers Playtime, and Garrison Theatre were all made and broadcast from BBC Bristol as part of what they called \"The Fun Factory\". \nThe BBC acquired the Christchurch Studios in Clifton to record dramas. (These studios were subsequently taken over by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2001). As drama changed, the network radio team in Bristol, led by then Chief Producer Jeremy Howe [[Jeremy Howe (radio drama editor)]] (currently the editor of BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers) encouraged a new approach. Subject matter and stories, the production techniques and editing are more typical of factual documentary making with producers digitally editing their own work and focusing as much on the edit as the performances.\n\n== Partnerships ==\nThe BBC Network Radio department in Bristol was honoured to receive a special award for its contribution to the nation, to the city and to the region in 2013 by the local Royal Television Society. They recognised radio's role in encouraging new talent, discovering and celebrating British actors, writers, and broadcasters. The award was accepted by broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby who started his own distinguished career as a news reporter at the BBC in Bristol.\n\n<ref>https://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/1431/radio-is-honoured-at-rts-west-of-england-awards</ref>\n\nBBC Radio & Music Production in Bristol has also been the catalyst for two festivals in the city. More Than Words - a celebration of Radio 4 and speech radio - in 2012. Bristol Food Connections (2013 - 2019) bringing good food and people together to debate and celebrate inspiring ideas through the filter of food.\n\n== Programs of note ==\nThe BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster. The licence fee pays for radio as well as television programmes. The BBC radio programmes made in Bristol include:\n* ''Any Questions''\n* ''Great Lives''\n* ''One To One''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Word of Mouth''\n* ''Poetry Please''\n* ''Out of the Ordinary''\n* ''The Patch''\n* ''The Untold''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics''\n* ''Evil Genius''\n* ''Ramblings with Clare Balding''\n* ''Farming Today''\n* ''Open Country''\n* ''On Your Farm''\n* ''Costing the Earth''\n* ''The Food Programme''\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''The BBC Earth Podcast''\n* ''The Living World''\n* ''Tweet of the Day''\n* ''Natural Histories''\n* ''Book of the Week''\n* ''Short Cuts''\n* ''The Invention of...''\n* ''Recycle Radio''\n* ''Afternoon Drama''\n* ''With Great Pleasure''\n* ''The History of Ideas'' (with BBC Radio 4)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bwydw]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''The People's Shipping Forecast'' was a highlight of the ''We British'' day - exploring the many identities and influences on our islands as evidenced through its poems and its voices. This encouraged BBC Radio 4 listeners to suggest their own poetic lines (inspired by the BBC Radio 4 shipping forecast) which were joined together to create something for the stormy waters of everyday living. The poet Murray Lachlan Young used these to create and read this work.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3zW5TLdY6q1K17bBjKmwnZG/the-peoples-shipping-forecast</ref>\n\nMore recently the Bristol-based poetry & arts team in BBC network radio has made the Four Seasons equinox poetry inserts for BBC Radio 4 - quarterly burst of poetry to reconnect listeners with nature and poems which chime with the changing of the seasons.\n\n== Famous voices ==\nPresenters associated with Bristol include:\n* [[Matthew Parris]]\n* [[Roger McGough]]\n* [[Harriett Gilbert]]\n* [[Grace Dent]]\n* [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]\n* [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]]\n* [[Clare Balding]]\n* Jolyon Jenkins<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rh55j</ref>\n* Joe Queenan<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wxpqh</ref>\n* [[Natalie Haynes]]\n* [[Sheila Dillon]]\n* Dan Saladino<ref>https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1083274/dan-saladino.html?tab=penguin-books</ref>\n* Helen Mark<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/11/full-steam-ahead</ref>\n* Charlotte Smith<ref>https://www.countryfilelive.com/windsor-great-park/meet-the-stars/charlotte-smith</ref>\n* Anna Hill<ref>https://www.ofc.org.uk/blog/i-never-said-qa-anna-hill</ref>\n* Caz Graham<ref>https://www.gaj.org.uk/article/member-profile-caz-graham</ref>\n* Sybil Ruscoe<ref>[[Sybil Ruscoe]]</ref>\n* Tom Heap<ref>[[Tom Heap]]</ref>\n* Brett Westwood<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ynnmn</ref>\n* Polly Weston<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-story-of-the-cook-who-spent-10-years-preparing-food-for-those-on-death-row/</ref>\n* Emily Knight<ref>https://podbiblemag.com/2019/06/05/a-bbc-earth-blog-telling-stories-of-nature-in-the-glorious-technicolour-world-of-audio/</ref>\n* Michael Rosen<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtnz</ref>\n* Dr Laura Wright<ref>https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/news/archives/3746</ref>\n* Melvyn Bragg<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g26x</ref>\n* Russell Kane<ref>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/evil-genius-with-russell-kane/id1356142765?mt=2</ref>\n* Jaega Wise<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/moves-like-jaega-meet-the-brewer-changing-the-face-of-craft-beer/</ref>\n* Leyla Kazim<ref>https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/contributors/leyla-kazim</ref>\n\n== Partnerships ==\nIn March 2012, The Network Radio team in Bristol curated and presented a weekend speech festival in Bristol called ''More Than Words.''<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/more-than-words/</ref> It was sponsored by BBC Audio & Music Content and was a not-for-profit partnership festival.\n\nIt brought together different creative groups and organizations in the city as part of the Bristol BBC cultural partnership. It was staged to celebrate the best of BBC Radio 4 in conjunction with appropriate non-commercial partners including St George's Bristol, The British Library, Bristol City Council, University of the West of England, Pervasive Media Studios, Bristol University, QEH Bristol, and BBC Radio Bristol.\n\nSome of the events and involvement with the creative people of Bristol were captured in this blog\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2012/03/more_than_words_festival_-_day_1.html</ref>\n\nIn March 2013, BBC Network Radio in Bristol celebrated the arrival of Radio 4's Food Programme to the city by inviting food professionals, food groups, and food lovers to join them in an innovative community partnership festival called \"Bristol Food Connections\", bringing people together around good food. The first Bristol Food Connections festival was an ambitious 11-day initiative, born out of a five-year partnership between the BBC and public bodies in the city to drive much stronger engagement between the BBC in Whiteladies Road and local people. The aim of Bristol Food Connections was to open up food education, aspiring entrepreneurs, and the food industry to the widest possible talent pool through outreach and education initiatives via BBC broadcasting.<ref>https://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/the-bbc-at-bristol-food-connections/</ref><ref>https://visitbristol.co.uk/whats-on/bristol-food-connections-p2196433</ref>\n\n== BBC Food and Farming Awards ==\nThe BBC Food and Farming Awards has been an annual event in the city since 2013 although the awards themselves were launched in 2000 in London by HRH Prince Charles.

'''BBC Radio & Music Production''' unit ({{aka}} '''Bristol Network Radio''') operates separately from [[BBC Radio Bristol]] (part of the BBC local radio network), which serves listeners in and around the city. The network production team makes programs for the UK and a global audience. The genre focus in Bristol includes a wide range of topics such as food and farming, environmental journalism, natural history, investigative documentaries, human interest, Bristol R&M Production readings, drama, poetry, conversation, and political debates. In 2017, the team in Bristol began producing podcasts for the BBC. It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\n\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies. The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns.  A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\n\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>  \n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service.  It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\n\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref> \n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019, presenter and poet Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer, and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech at the Radio 4 listening festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\n\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSoul Music has no presenter, focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them.  The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit.  The same programme won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013.  It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\n\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television.  Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began, it has changed the face of international broadcasting.  The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940's when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer.  His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success.  He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share.  When he was given the freedom of the city of Bristol, Sir David Attenborough paid tribute to Christopher Parsons and Desmond Hawkins, who established the Natural History TV Unit in 1957. \"I had the honour and luck and privilege to be asked to join these two men. The honour belongs to them,\" he said.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes for the West Region and was keen to see if his radio formats would work in the developing medium of television. At the time, radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and Christopher Parsons. The three men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nSir David Attenborough has worked with the NHU Radio Department in Bristol including the wonderful \"Life Stories\" \u2013 a series of talks on the natural histories of creatures and plants from around the world.  He was also the first voice to introduce Tweet of the Day, a daily celebration of global birdlife that from 2013 has woken up BBC Radio 4 listeners every morning.  Here is a blog by Sarah Blunt, the distinguished natural history radio producer, writing about the birth of Tweet.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/3143388d-5c2f-3e73-a3c1-727bb8c6b65d</ref>\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nBristol Network Radio still makes original and groundbreaking Natural History content for public service radio (not for profit)\nand produced the first eco-thriller drama podcast 'FOREST 404' for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds.\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06tqsg3</ref>\n\nSet in the 24th century, after a data crash called 'The Cataclysm'. Pan, the main character, is a young woman with a boring job sorting and deleting old sound files that survived the crash. She uncovers a set of sound recordings from the early 21st century that haunt her. \n\nThis immersive sci-fi thriller stars Pearl Mackie, Tanya Moodie, and Pippa Haywood \u2013 with original music by Bonobo. You can still hear it on BBC Sounds.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p074m60p</ref>\n\nForest 404 was used to launch a groundbreaking public experiment investigating the impact of natural sounds on well-being and mental health. This was done in partnership with the AHRC (Arts & Humanities Research Council), Natural History Television, Exeter University, Bristol University, and the Open University. The drama was written by Bristol-based writer Tim X Atack<ref>http://www.timatack.co.uk/</ref>  \n\nIt was produced and directed by Becky Ripley and the accompanying talks were produced by Eliza Lomas.  The series has received critical acclaim, which includes winning a British Writers Guild award in January 2020 for Tim X Atack, as well as winning a silver Prix Europa. It was the first drama to make it into the iTunes podcast Top Ten.  Its highest position was #2.\n\n== The Fun Factory ==\n\nBBC Bristol began producing BBC drama from 1940 onward. \nShows like ITMA, Bandwagon, Workers Playtime, and Garrison Theatre were all made and broadcast from BBC Bristol as part of what they called \"The Fun Factory\".  \nThe BBC acquired the Christchurch Studios in Clifton to record dramas. (These studios were subsequently taken over by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2001).  As drama changed, the network radio team in Bristol, led by then Chief Producer Jeremy Howe [[Jeremy Howe (radio drama editor)]] (currently the editor of BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers) encouraged a new approach. Subject matter and stories, the production techniques and editing are more typical of factual documentary making with producers digitally editing their own work and focusing as much on the edit as the performances.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nThe BBC Network Radio department in Bristol was honoured to receive a special award for its contribution to the nation, to the city and to the region in 2013 by the local Royal Television Society. They recognised radio's role in encouraging new talent, discovering and celebrating British actors, writers, and broadcasters.  The award was accepted by broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby who started his own distinguished career as a news reporter at the BBC in Bristol.  \n\n<ref>https://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/1431/radio-is-honoured-at-rts-west-of-england-awards</ref>\n\nBBC Radio & Music Production in Bristol has also been the catalyst for two festivals in the city.  More Than Words - a celebration of Radio 4 and speech radio - in 2012.  Bristol Food Connections (2013 - 2019) bringing good food and people together to debate and celebrate inspiring ideas through the filter of food.\n\n== Programs of note ==\n\nThe BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster.  The licence fee pays for radio as well as television programmes.  The BBC radio programmes made in Bristol include:\n\n* ''Any Questions''\n* ''Great Lives''\n* ''One To One''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Word of Mouth''\n* ''Poetry Please''\n* ''Out of the Ordinary''\n* ''The Patch''\n* ''The Untold''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics''\n* ''Evil Genius''\n* ''Ramblings with Clare Balding''\n* ''Farming Today''\n* ''Open Country''\n* ''On Your Farm''\n* ''Costing the Earth''\n* ''The Food Programme''\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''The BBC Earth Podcast''\n* ''The Living World''\n* ''Tweet of the Day''\n* ''Natural Histories''\n* ''Book of the Week''\n* ''Short Cuts''\n* ''The Invention of...''\n* ''Recycle Radio''\n* ''Afternoon Drama''\n* ''With Great Pleasure''\n* ''The History of Ideas'' (with BBC Radio 4)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bwydw]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''The People's Shipping Forecast'' was a highlight of the ''We British'' day - exploring the many identities and influences on our islands as evidenced through its poems and its voices. This encouraged BBC Radio 4 listeners to suggest their own poetic lines (inspired by the BBC Radio 4 shipping forecast) which were joined together to create something for the stormy waters of everyday living.  The poet Murray Lachlan Young used these to create and read this work.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3zW5TLdY6q1K17bBjKmwnZG/the-peoples-shipping-forecast</ref>\n\nMore recently the Bristol-based poetry & arts team in BBC network radio has made the Four Seasons equinox poetry inserts for BBC Radio 4 - quarterly burst of poetry to reconnect listeners with nature and poems which chime with the changing of the seasons.\n\n== Famous voices ==\n\nPresenters associated with Bristol include: \n\n* [[Matthew Parris]]\n* [[Roger McGough]]\n* [[Harriett Gilbert]]\n* [[Grace Dent]]\n* [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]\n* [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]]\n* [[Clare Balding]]\n* Jolyon Jenkins<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rh55j</ref>\n* Joe Queenan<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wxpqh</ref>\n* [[Natalie Haynes]]\n* [[Sheila Dillon]]\n* Dan Saladino<ref>https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1083274/dan-saladino.html?tab=penguin-books</ref>\n* Helen Mark<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/11/full-steam-ahead</ref>\n* Charlotte Smith<ref>https://www.countryfilelive.com/windsor-great-park/meet-the-stars/charlotte-smith</ref>\n* Anna Hill<ref>https://www.ofc.org.uk/blog/i-never-said-qa-anna-hill</ref>\n* Caz Graham<ref>https://www.gaj.org.uk/article/member-profile-caz-graham</ref>\n* Sybil Ruscoe<ref>[[Sybil Ruscoe]]</ref>\n* Tom Heap<ref>[[Tom Heap]]</ref>\n* Brett Westwood<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ynnmn</ref>\n* Polly Weston<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-story-of-the-cook-who-spent-10-years-preparing-food-for-those-on-death-row/</ref>\n* Emily Knight<ref>https://podbiblemag.com/2019/06/05/a-bbc-earth-blog-telling-stories-of-nature-in-the-glorious-technicolour-world-of-audio/</ref>\n* Michael Rosen<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtnz</ref>\n* Dr Laura Wright<ref>https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/news/archives/3746</ref>\n* Melvyn Bragg<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g26x</ref>\n* Russell Kane<ref>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/evil-genius-with-russell-kane/id1356142765?mt=2</ref>\n* Jaega Wise<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/moves-like-jaega-meet-the-brewer-changing-the-face-of-craft-beer/</ref>\n* Leyla Kazim<ref>https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/contributors/leyla-kazim</ref>\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nIn March 2012, The Network Radio team in Bristol curated and presented a weekend speech festival in Bristol called ''More Than Words.''<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/more-than-words/</ref> It was sponsored by BBC Audio & Music Content and was a not-for-profit partnership festival.\n\nIt brought together different creative groups and organizations in the city as part of the Bristol BBC cultural partnership. It was staged to celebrate the best of BBC Radio 4 in conjunction with appropriate non-commercial partners including St George's Bristol, The British Library, Bristol City Council, University of the West of England, Pervasive Media Studios, Bristol University, QEH Bristol, and BBC Radio Bristol.\n\nSome of the events and involvement with the creative people of Bristol were captured in this blog\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/2012/03/more_than_words_festival_-_day_1.html</ref>\n\nIn March 2013, BBC Network Radio in Bristol celebrated the arrival of Radio 4's Food Programme to the city by inviting food professionals, food groups, and food lovers to join them in an innovative community partnership festival called \"Bristol Food Connections\", bringing people together around good food.

Many sports were struggling at this time because so many of their players had gone away to fight in the First World War.

He played in 3 tour matches but did not play in any tests as there were none played on this tour. He lived in Auckland and played for the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[North Shore Albions]] senior teams from 1915 to 1920<ref name=\"Statistics at rugbyleagueproject.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/Dougie-McGregor/summary.html|title=Statistics at rugbyleagueproject.org|publisher=rugbyleagueproject.org|date=31 December 2017|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref>.\n\n==Playing career==\nArthur Matthews began his career playing for [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He played for them in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|1915]] and [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 seasons]]. He was an electrician by trade and in 1917 he volunteered for the war effort on March 16. After being physically examined he was declared fit for active duty though he never went away to fight<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Recruiting/First Medical Board/Fit For Active Service\n| page = 6\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 66\n| date = 1917-03-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170317.2.31\n| accessdate = 2020-04-05}}</ref>.\n\nHe was involved in some controversy early in the 1917 season. He and his brother (W Matthews) turned out for the [[North Shore Albions]] without having formalised a transfer. [[Grafton Athletic]] protested and the Auckland Rugby League stood down both players and stated that the match should be replayed<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Northern Union/Executive Committee Meeting\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 123\n| date = 1917-05-24\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170524.2.17\n| accessdate = 2020-04-05}}</ref>. It was later reported that it was an oversight as W Matthews had just returned from war service and had played some matches for Ponsonby 3rd grade team years earlier, while the Ponsonby 3rd grade team had withdrawn from the competition due to a lack of playing numbers. As a result the Ponsonby club had granted both brothers transfers<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLVIII, Issue 129\n| date = 1917-05-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19170531.2.18\n| accessdate = 2020-04-05}}</ref>.

The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Thessaloniki was captured by the Ottomans in 1430. A few islands in the Aegean and the [[Propontis]] remained under Byzantine rule until 1453 (not shown on the map).]]\n\nIn the summer of 1452, when [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumel\u0131 Hisari]] was completed and the threat had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the Union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}} Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V did not have the influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing papal control, and these had not the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, especially in light of the weakened state of France and England from the [[Hundred Years' War]], Spain, being in the final part of the [[Reconquista]], the internecine fighting in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and Hungary and Poland's defeat at the [[Battle of Varna]] of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the [[Golden Horn]] offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from [[Venice]], and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|81}}\n\nIn Venice, meanwhile, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, it was already too late for it to be able to take part in the battle.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}} Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors\u2014even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}}<ref name=\"ThackerayFindling2012\" /><ref name=\"Norwich1998\" /><ref name=\"Somerwil-Ayrton2007\" /><ref name=\"Roberts1973\" /><ref name=\"Brownworth2009\" /><ref name=\"Norwich v.3\" />\n\n[[File:Walls of Constantinople.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1|Restored Walls of Constantinople]]\n[[File:Hali\u00e7 zinciri (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[boom (navigational barrier)|chain]] that closed off the entrance to the Golden Horn in 1453, now on display in the [[\u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n\nFearing a possible naval attack along the shores of the Golden Horn, Emperor Constantine XI ordered that a [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] be placed at the mouth of the harbour. This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards. The land fortifications comprised a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide moat fronting inner and outer [[Battlement|crenellated walls]] studded with towers every 45\u201355 metres.<ref name=\"f6GY9\" />\n\n===Strength===\n[[File:Siege of Constantinople 1453 map-fr.svg|thumb|left|Map of Constantinople and the dispositions of the defenders and the besiegers]]\n\nThe army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totalling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners.{{NoteTag|According to Sphrantzes, whom Constantine had ordered to make a census, the Emperor was appalled when the number of native men capable of bearing arms turned out to be only 4,983. Leonardo di Chio gave a number of 6,000 Greeks.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} At the onset of the siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|32}} {{NoteTag|The Spanish [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villal\u00f3n]] claims there were ' 60,000 Turkish households, 40,000 Greek and Armenian, 10,000 Jewish.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally [[monks]]. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the citizens repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.\n\nThe Ottomans had a much larger force. Recent studies and Ottoman archival data state that there were about 50,000\u201380,000 Ottoman soldiers including between 5,000 and 10,000 [[Janissary|Janissaries]],<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, 70 [[cannon]]s<ref name=\"battle100\" />{{rp|139\u2013140}}<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"halilosmanimpklas\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, an elite infantry corps, and thousands of Christian troops, notably 1,500 Serbian cavalry{{cn|date=February 2020}} that the [[Serbs|Serbian]] lord [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] was forced to supply as part of his obligation to the Ottoman sultan\u2014just a few months before, he had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of Constantinople.

The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn.

The walls had recently been repaired (under [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]]) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|39}} In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from [[Genoa]], 5 from [[Venice]], 3 from Venetian [[Crete]], 1 from [[Ancona]], 1 from [[Aragon]], 1 from France, and about 10 Byzantine.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|45}}\n\nOn 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers.

The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively. The Venetian Alviso Diedo commanded the ships in the harbour.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94}}\n\nAlthough the Byzantines also had cannons, they were much smaller than those of the Ottomans and the [[recoil]] tended to damage their own walls.<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" />\n\nAccording to [[David Nicolle]], despite many odds, the idea that Constantinople was inevitably doomed is wrong, and the overall situation was not as one-sided as a simple glance at a map might suggest.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|40}} It has also been claimed that Constantinople was \"the best-defended city in Europe\" at that time.<ref name=\"bZgqW\" />\n\n==Siege==\nAt the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days. The [[Princes' Islands]] in the Sea of Marmara were taken by [[Suleiman Baltoghlu|Admiral Baltoghlu]]'s fleet.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|96\u201397}} Mehmed's massive cannon fired on the walls for weeks, but due to its imprecision and extremely slow rate of reloading the Byzantines were able to repair most of the damage after each shot, limiting the cannon's effect.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}}\n\n[[File:Kusatma Zonaro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Ottoman Turks transport their fleet overland into the [[Golden Horn]].]]\n\nMeanwhile, despite some probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under [[Suleiman Baltoghlu]] could not enter the Golden Horn due to the chain the Byzantines had previously stretched across the entrance. Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using [[fire ship]]s, but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with heavy losses. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls.

Many of the sappers were miners of Serbian origin sent from [[Novo Brdo]] by the Serbian [[Despot (court title)|despot]]. They were placed under the command of [[Zagan Pasha]]. However, an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]], a German{{NoteTag|[[Steven Runciman|Runciman]] speculates that he may have been Scottish<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|84}}}} who came together with the Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession.\n\n{{quote|As to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our lives.{{NoteTag|Original text: \u03a4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u1fd6 \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f10\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3\u2022 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fc7 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u1fc3 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd.<ref name=\"29maiouiefemerida\" />}}}}\n\nAround this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers. Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha|Halil Pasha]], who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. [[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defence by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\n===Final assault===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\n\nPreparations for the final assault were started in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} For 36 hours after the war council decision to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower in order to prepare for the general offensive.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} Prayer and resting would be then granted to the soldiers on the 28th, and then the final assault would be launched. On the Byzantine side, a small Venetian fleet of 12 ships, after having searched the Aegean, reached the Capital on May 27 and reported to the Emperor that no large Venetian relief fleet was on its way.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|377}} On May 28, as the Ottoman army prepared for the final assault, large-scale religious processions were held in the city.

The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by the successive waves of the irregular [[azap]]s, who were poorly trained and equipped, and [[Anatolia]]ns who focused on a section of the [[Blachernae]] walls in the north-west part of the city, which had been damaged by the cannon. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders. Finally, as the battle was continuing, the last wave, consisting of elite Janissaries, attacked the city walls.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward. Many Greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families, the Venetians ran over to their ships, and a few of the Genoese got over to Galata. The rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.{{NoteTag|Barbaro added the description of the emperor's heroic last moments to his diary based on information he received afterward.

Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}\nThe Army converged upon the [[Augusteum]], the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection.

The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan. As Western Europe entered the 16th century, the [[Crusades|age of Crusading]] began to come to an end.\n\nFor some time Greek scholars had gone to [[Italian city-states]], a cultural exchange begun in 1396 by [[Coluccio Salutati]], chancellor of Florence, who had invited [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], a Byzantine scholar to lecture at the [[University of Florence]].<ref name=\"Mw3eQ\" /> After the conquest many Greeks, such as [[John Argyropoulos]] and [[Constantine Lascaris]], fled the city and found refuge in the Latin West, [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|bringing with them knowledge and documents from the Greco-Roman tradition to Italy]] and other regions that further propelled the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"J2i2B\" /><ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" /> Those Greeks who stayed behind in Constantinople mostly lived in the [[Phanar]] and [[Galata]] districts of the city. The [[Phanariotes]], as they were called, provided many capable advisers to the Ottoman rulers.\n\n===Third Rome===\n{{Main|Third Rome}}\n\n[[File:Gentile Bellini 003.jpg|thumb|''Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror'', by [[Gentile Bellini]]]]\n\n[[Byzantium]] is a term used by modern historians to refer to the later Roman Empire. In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire. Other potential claimants, such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] have disintegrated into history.<ref name=\"W8pk7\" />\n\n===Impact on the Churches===\nIn 17th-century Russia, the fall of Constantinople had a role in the fierce theological and political controversy between adherents and opponents of the [[Raskol|reforms]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] carried out by [[Patriarch Nikon]], which he intended to bring the Russian Church closer to the norms and practices of other Orthodox churches. [[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam. As a result of this process, the centre of authority in the Orthodox Church changed and migrated to Eastern Europe (e.g., [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]]) rather than remaining in the former Byzantine Near East.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Cultural references==\n===Legends===\nThere are many legends in Greece surrounding the Fall of Constantinople. It was said that [[May 1453 lunar eclipse|the partial lunar eclipse]] that occurred on 22 May 1453 represented a fulfilment of a prophecy of the city's demise.<ref name=\"L0Kni\" /> Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick [[fog]], a condition unknown in that part of the world in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about the dome of the Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit]] departing from the city. \"This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears.\"<ref name=\"OBWWf\" /> For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of [[John Hunyadi]] who had come to relieve the city.{{NoteTag|It is possible that all these phenomena were local effects of the cataclysmic [[Kuwae]] volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean. The \"fire\" seen may have been an optical illusion due to the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"nasakuwae\" />}}\n\nAnother legend holds that two priests saying [[divine liturgy]] over the crowd disappeared into the cathedral's walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again on the day that Constantinople returns to Christian hands.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|147}} Another legend refers to the ''Marble King'' (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the [[sleeping hero]] legend).<ref name=\"3otvo\" /><ref name=\"hatzfallhec\" />\n\n===Cultural impact===\n[[Guillaume Dufay]] composed several songs lamenting the fall of the Eastern church, and the duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]], [[Feast of the Pheasant|avowed]] to take up arms against the Turks. However, as the growing Ottoman power from this date on coincided with the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent [[Counter-Reformation]], the recapture of Constantinople became an ever-distant dream. Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nNonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor's resurrection by [[Leo the Wise]] persisted.<ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" />{{rp|280}}\n\n29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.<ref name=\"QMrK6\" />\n\n===Impact on the Renaissance===\n{{Main|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\nThe migration waves of [[Byzantine]] scholars and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking of Constantinople]] and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies that led to the development of the [[Renaissance humanism]]<ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" />{{dead link|date=November 2016}}{{better source|reason=Tall claim requires high-quality academic citation, not a website|date=November 2016}} and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

''Islambol'' ({{lang|ota| \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0644}}, ''Full of Islam'') or ''Islambul'' (''find Islam'') or ''Islam(b)ol'' (''old [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: be Islam''), both in Turkish Language, were [[folk etymology|folk-etymological]] adaptations of ''Istanbul'' created after the Ottoman conquest of 1453 to express the city's new role as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan [[Mehmed II]] himself.<ref name=\"istanbulunadlari\" />\n\nThe [[Names of Istanbul|name of Istanbul]] is thought to be derived from the Greek phrase ''\u012bs t\u012bmbol\u012b(n)'' ({{lang-el|\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''eis t\u0113n p\u00f3lin'', \"to the City\"), and it is claimed that it had already spread among the Turkish populace of the Ottoman Empire before the conquest.  However, Istanbul only became the official name of the city in 1930 by the revised Turkish Postal Law as part of [[Atat\u00fcrk]]'s reforms.<ref name=\"ZooPt\" /><ref name=\"DwbQb\" /><ref name=\"YEruk\" />\n\n===In historical fiction===\n* [[Lew Wallace]], ''The Prince of India; or, Why Constantinople Fell''.

{{lang-tr|{{italics correction|\u0130stanbul'un Fethi}}|lit= '''Conquest of Istanbul'''}}) was the capture of the [[capital city]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] by an invading [[Ottoman army]] on 29 May 1453. The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Thessaloniki was captured by the Ottomans in 1430. A few islands in the Aegean and the [[Propontis]] remained under Byzantine rule until 1453 (not shown on the map).]]\n\nIn the summer of 1452, when [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumel\u0131 Hisari]] was completed and the threat had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the Union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}} Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V did not have the influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing papal control, and these had not the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, especially in light of the weakened state of France and England from the [[Hundred Years' War]], Spain, being in the final part of the [[Reconquista]], the internecine fighting in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and Hungary and Poland's defeat at the [[Battle of Varna]] of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the [[Golden Horn]] offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from [[Venice]], and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|81}}\n\nIn Venice, meanwhile, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, it was already too late for it to be able to take part in the battle.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}} Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors\u2014even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}}<ref name=\"ThackerayFindling2012\" /><ref name=\"Norwich1998\" /><ref name=\"Somerwil-Ayrton2007\" /><ref name=\"Roberts1973\" /><ref name=\"Brownworth2009\" /><ref name=\"Norwich v.3\" />\n\n[[File:Walls of Constantinople.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1|Restored Walls of Constantinople]]\n[[File:Hali\u00e7 zinciri (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[boom (navigational barrier)|chain]] that closed off the entrance to the Golden Horn in 1453, now on display in the [[\u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n\nFearing a possible naval attack along the shores of the Golden Horn, Emperor Constantine XI ordered that a [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] be placed at the mouth of the harbour. This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards. The land fortifications comprised a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide moat fronting inner and outer [[Battlement|crenellated walls]] studded with towers every 45\u201355 metres.<ref name=\"f6GY9\" />\n\n===Strength===\n[[File:Siege of Constantinople 1453 map-fr.svg|thumb|left|Map of Constantinople and the dispositions of the defenders and the besiegers]]\n\nThe army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totalling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners.{{NoteTag|According to Sphrantzes, whom Constantine had ordered to make a census, the Emperor was appalled when the number of native men capable of bearing arms turned out to be only 4,983. Leonardo di Chio gave a number of 6,000 Greeks.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} At the onset of the siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|32}} {{NoteTag|The Spanish [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villal\u00f3n]] claims there were ' 60,000 Turkish households, 40,000 Greek and Armenian, 10,000 Jewish.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally [[monks]]. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the citizens repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.\n\nThe Ottomans had a much larger force. Recent studies and Ottoman archival data state that there were about 50,000\u201380,000 Ottoman soldiers including between 5,000 and 10,000 [[Janissary|Janissaries]],<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, 70 [[cannon]]s<ref name=\"battle100\" />{{rp|139\u2013140}}<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"halilosmanimpklas\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, an elite infantry corps, and thousands of Christian troops, notably 1,500 Serbian cavalry{{cn|date=February 2020}} that the [[Serbs|Serbian]] lord [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] was forced to supply as part of his obligation to the Ottoman sultan\u2014just a few months before, he had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of Constantinople.

They were built at [[foundries]] that employed Turkish cannon founders and technicians, most notably Saruca, in addition to at least one foreign cannon founder, [[Orban]] (also called Urban). Most of the cannons at the siege were built by Turkish engineers, including a large bombard by Saruca, while one cannon was built by Orban, who contributed a large bombard.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" />\n\nOrban, a Hungarian (though some suggest he was German), was a somewhat mysterious figure.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|374}} His cannon was named \"[[Basilic (cannon)|Basilica]]\" and was {{convert|27|ft|m}} long, and able to hurl a 600&nbsp;lb (272&nbsp;kg) stone ball over a mile (1.6&nbsp;km).<ref name=\"q6rsq\" /> The founder initially tried to sell his services to the Byzantines, who were unable to secure the funds needed to hire him. Orban then left Constantinople and approached Mehmed II, claiming that his weapon could blast 'the walls of [[Babylon]] itself'.

The account of the cannon's collapse is disputed,<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} given that it was only reported in the letter of Archbishop Leonardo di Chio<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" /> and in the later, and often unreliable, Russian chronicle of [[Nestor Iskander]].{{NoteTag|Another expert who was employed by the Ottomans was [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli]], also known as Ciriaco of [[Ancona]], a traveler and collector of antiquities.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}}}\n\n[[File:Conquest_of_Constantinople,_Zonaro.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Modern painting of Mehmed and the Ottoman Army approaching Constantinople with a giant bombard, by [[Fausto Zonaro]].]]\n\nHaving previously established a large foundry about {{convert|150|mi|km}} away, Mehmed now had to undertake the painstaking process of transporting his massive artillery pieces. Orban's giant cannon was said to have been accompanied by a crew of 60 oxen and over 400 men.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|374}} There was another large bombard, independently built by Turkish engineer Saruca, that was also used in the battle.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" />\n\nIn preparation for the final assault, Mehmed had an artillery train of seventy large pieces dragged from his headquarters at Edirne, in addition to the bombards cast on the spot.<ref name=\"n61Q6\" />\n\nMehmed planned to attack the Theodosian Walls, the intricate series of walls and ditches protecting Constantinople from an attack from the West, the only part of the city not surrounded by water. His army encamped outside the city on the Monday after [[Easter]], 2 April 1453.\n\nThe bulk of the Ottoman army were encamped south of the Golden Horn. The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn. Communication was maintained by a road that had been constructed over the marshy head of the Horn.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94\u201395}}\n\n====Byzantine dispositions and strategies====\n[[File:Fall-of-constantinople-22.jpg|thumb|Painting of the Fall of Constantinople, by [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]]]]\n\nThe city had about 20&nbsp;km of walls ([[Theodosian Walls|land walls]]: 5.5&nbsp;km; sea walls along the Golden Horn: 7&nbsp;km; sea walls along the Sea of Marmara: 7.5&nbsp;km), one of the strongest sets of fortified walls in existence. The walls had recently been repaired (under [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]]) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|39}} In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from [[Genoa]], 5 from [[Venice]], 3 from Venetian [[Crete]], 1 from [[Ancona]], 1 from [[Aragon]], 1 from France, and about 10 Byzantine.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|45}}\n\nOn 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers.

The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively.

Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders.

Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls.

Many of the sappers were miners of Serbian origin sent from [[Novo Brdo]] by the Serbian [[Despot (court title)|despot]]. They were placed under the command of [[Zagan Pasha]]. However, an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]], a German{{NoteTag|[[Steven Runciman|Runciman]] speculates that he may have been Scottish<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|84}}}} who came together with the Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city.

Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha|Halil Pasha]], who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. [[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defence by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\n===Final assault===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\n\nPreparations for the final assault were started in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} For 36 hours after the war council decision to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower in order to prepare for the general offensive.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} Prayer and resting would be then granted to the soldiers on the 28th, and then the final assault would be launched.

The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by the successive waves of the irregular [[azap]]s, who were poorly trained and equipped, and [[Anatolia]]ns who focused on a section of the [[Blachernae]] walls in the north-west part of the city, which had been damaged by the cannon. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders. Finally, as the battle was continuing, the last wave, consisting of elite Janissaries, attacked the city walls. The Genoese general in charge of the land troops,<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"isbesepistle\" /><ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" /> [[Giovanni Giustiniani]], was grievously wounded during the attack, and his evacuation from the ramparts caused a panic in the ranks of the defenders.{{NoteTag|Sources hostile towards the Genoese (such as the Venetian Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro), however, report that Longo was only lightly wounded or not wounded at all, but, overwhelmed by fear, simulated the wound to abandon the battlefield, determining the fall of the city.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward. Many Greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families, the Venetians ran over to their ships, and a few of the Genoese got over to Galata. The rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.{{NoteTag|Barbaro added the description of the emperor's heroic last moments to his diary based on information he received afterward.

Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}\nThe Army converged upon the [[Augusteum]], the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection.

The loss of the city was a crippling blow to Christendom, and it exposed the Christian west to a vigorous and aggressive foe in the east. The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan.

In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire.

[[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam.

It was the first A-League Grand Final played at a neutral home ground, due to [[Bluetongue Stadium]] being deemed by [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] to not have a sufficient capacity to hold the centrepiece of the A-League season. This move created a stir of controversy and was protested by the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]], who won the right to host the match, but to no avail.\n\n==Route to the finals==\n{{See also|2007\u201308 A-League}}\n\n{{PagePlayoffBracket-2LegQF\n|RD1-date1=27 Jan & 10 Feb\n|RD1-team1='''[[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]'''\n|RD1-score1L1='''0'''\n|RD1-score1L2='''3'''\n|RD1-team2=[[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]\n|RD1-score2L1=2\n|RD1-score2L2=0\n|RD1-date2=25 Jan & 8 Feb\n|RD1-team3=[[Sydney FC]]\n|RD1-score3L1=0\n|RD1-score3L2=0\n|RD1-team4='''[[Brisbane Roar FC|Queensland Roar]]'''\n|RD1-score4L1='''0'''\n|RD1-score4L2='''2'''\n|RD2-date=17 February\n|RD2-team1='''[[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]''' ([[Extra time|aet]])\n|RD2-team2=[[Brisbane Roar FC|Queensland Roar]]\n|RD2-score1='''3'''\n|RD2-score2=2\n|RD3-date=24 February\n|RD3-team1=[[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]\n|RD3-team2='''[[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]'''\n|RD3-score1=0\n|RD3-score2='''1'''\n}}\n\n==Match==\n\n===Summary===\n[[File:2008 A-League Grand Final celebrations.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]] celebrating after their Grand Final victory.]]\nThe first half of the game ended in a draw with neither side scoring a goal, though each had good scoring opportunities. [[Gary van Egmond]] made a risky change to his side's starting formation, playing with a back three. In the 64th minute [[Mark Bridge]] scored the only goal after Tony Vidmar slipped, giving the ball to Bridge in the last quarter.\n\nThe game ended in controversy after Central Coast earned a corner late into extra time in the second half. As the ball was crossed into Newcastle's penalty area, it appeared to hit Newcastle player [[James Holland (footballer)|James Holland]] on the right arm, before it was cleared away. Mariners players immediately demanded a penalty, yet referee Mark Shield decided not to award one. The Mariners players, enraged, continued to scream at Shield, pressuring him for a penalty. Mariners keeper [[Danny Vukovic]] as a result of this frustration, hit Shields' arm away when the referee was penalizing one of Vukovic's teammates with a yellowcard. Shield then immediately awarded Vukovic with a red card. Vukovic would later be charged with striking a match official by the FFA, and was subsequently banned for 9 months, 3 of those months suspended. Due to this, Vukovic missed a significant portion of the next A-League season as well as the Olympic Games.\n\n===Details===\n{{footballbox\n | date = 24 February 2008<br />17:00 [[Australian Eastern Daylight Time|AEDT]]\n | team1 = [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]\n | score = 0\u20131\n | report= [http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=hal_newsdisplay&id=21580&pageid=1001 Report]\n | team2 = [[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]\n | goals1 =\n | goals2 = [[Mark Bridge|Bridge]] {{goal|64}}\n | stadium = [[Sydney Football Stadium]], [[Sydney]]\n | attendance = 36,354\n | referee = [[Mark Shield]]\n}}\n{| width=92% |\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la  = \n |pattern_b   = \n |pattern_ra  = \n |leftarm     = 000066\n |body        = FFD700\n |rightarm    = 000066\n |shorts      = 000066\n |socks       = FFD700\n |title       = Central Coast Mariners\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la =\n |pattern_b  = \n |pattern_ra =\n |leftarm    = D4AF37\n |body       = FFFFFF\n |rightarm   = D4AF37\n |shorts     = D4AF37\n |socks      = FFFFFF\n |title      = Newcastle Jets\n}}\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top;

It was the first A-League Grand Final played at a neutral home ground, due to [[Bluetongue Stadium]] being deemed by [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] to not have a sufficient capacity to hold the centrepiece of the A-League season. This move created a stir of controversy and was protested by the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]], who won the right to host the match, but to no avail.\n\n==Route to the finals==\n{{See also|2007\u201308 A-League}}\n\n{{PagePlayoffBracket-2LegQF\n|RD1-date1=27 Jan & 10 Feb\n|RD1-team1='''[[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]'''\n|RD1-score1L1='''0'''\n|RD1-score1L2='''3'''\n|RD1-team2=[[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]\n|RD1-score2L1=2\n|RD1-score2L2=0\n|RD1-date2=25 Jan & 8 Feb\n|RD1-team3=[[Sydney FC]]\n|RD1-score3L1=0\n|RD1-score3L2=0\n|RD1-team4='''[[Brisbane Roar FC|Queensland Roar]]'''\n|RD1-score4L1='''0'''\n|RD1-score4L2='''2'''\n|RD2-date=17 February\n|RD2-team1='''[[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]''' ([[Extra time|aet]])\n|RD2-team2=[[Brisbane Roar FC|Queensland Roar]]\n|RD2-score1='''3'''\n|RD2-score2=2\n|RD3-date=24 February\n|RD3-team1=[[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]\n|RD3-team2='''[[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]'''\n|RD3-score1=0\n|RD3-score2='''1'''\n}}\n\n==Match==\n\n===Summary===\n[[File:2008 A-League Grand Final celebrations.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]] celebrating after their Grand Final victory.]]\nThe first half of the game ended in a draw with neither sides scoring a goal, though each had good scoring opportunities. [[Gary van Egmond]] made a risky change to his sides starting formation, playing with a back three. In the 64th minute [[Mark Bridge]] scored the only goal after Tony Vidmar slipped, giving the ball to Bridge in the last quarter.\n\nThe game ended in controversy after Central Coast earned a corner late into extra time in the second half. As the ball was crossed into Newcastle's penalty area, it appeared to hit Newcastle player [[James Holland (footballer)|James Holland]] on the right arm, before it was cleared away. Mariners players immediately demanded a penalty, yet referee Mark Shield decided not to award one. The Mariners players, enraged, continued to scream at Shield, pressuring him for a penalty. Mariners keeper [[Danny Vukovic]] as a result of this frustration, hit Shields' arm away when the referee was penalizing one of Vukovic's teammates with a yellowcard. Shield then immediately awarded Vukovic with a red card. Vukovic would later be charged with striking a match official by the FFA, and was subsequently banned for 9 months, 3 of those months suspended. Due to this, Vukovic missed a significant portion of the next A-League season as well as the Olympic Games.\n\n===Details===\n{{footballbox\n | date = 24 February 2008<br />17:00 [[Australian Eastern Daylight Time|AEDT]]\n | team1 = [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]\n | score = 0\u20131\n | report= [http://www.a-league.com.au/default.aspx?s=hal_newsdisplay&id=21580&pageid=1001 Report]\n | team2 = [[Newcastle Jets FC|Newcastle Jets]]\n | goals1 =\n | goals2 = [[Mark Bridge|Bridge]] {{goal|64}}\n | stadium = [[Sydney Football Stadium]], [[Sydney]]\n | attendance = 36,354\n | referee = [[Mark Shield]]\n}}\n{| width=92% |\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la  = \n |pattern_b   = \n |pattern_ra  = \n |leftarm     = 000066\n |body        = FFD700\n |rightarm    = 000066\n |shorts      = 000066\n |socks       = FFD700\n |title       = Central Coast Mariners\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la =\n |pattern_b  = \n |pattern_ra =\n |leftarm    = D4AF37\n |body       = FFFFFF\n |rightarm   = D4AF37\n |shorts     = D4AF37\n |socks      = FFFFFF\n |title      = Newcastle Jets\n}}\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n|  style=\"vertical-align:top;

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 12th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Peyton Reed]], with a screenplay by the writing teams of [[Edgar Wright]] and [[Joe Cornish]], and [[Adam McKay]] and [[Paul Rudd]]. It stars Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, alongside [[Evangeline Lilly]], [[Corey Stoll]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[T.I.|Tip \"T.I.\" Harris]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Wood Harris]], [[Judy Greer]], [[David Dastmalchian]], and [[Michael Douglas]] as Hank Pym. <!--Starring list is based on the film poster's billing block, with Mackie added per his placement in the film and based on talk page discussions.--> In ''Ant-Man'', Lang must help defend Pym's Ant-Man shrinking technology and plot a heist with worldwide ramifications.\n\nDevelopment of ''Ant-Man'' began in April 2006 with the hiring of Wright to direct and co-write with Cornish. By April 2011, Wright and Cornish had completed three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]''. Casting began in December 2013, with the hiring of Rudd to play Lang. In May 2014, Wright left the project citing creative differences, though he still received screenplay and story credits with Cornish as well as an executive producer credit. The following month, Reed was brought in to replace Wright, while McKay was hired to contribute to the script with Rudd. Principal photography took place between August and December 2014 in San Francisco and [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Metro Atlanta]].\n\n''Ant-Man'' held its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 29, 2015, and was released in the United States on July 17, 2015, in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]]. It grossed more than $519 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, who generally welcomed the film's smaller stakes than preceding MCU installments, as well as its cast (particularly Rudd, Pe\u00f1a, Lilly and Douglas), humor and CGI sequences. A sequel, titled ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', was released on July 6, 2018. A third film is in development, for a potential 2022 release.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Do NOT change the paragraph layout. There is no need to have a bunch of smaller, few sentence ones. Also, per film plot, the summary should be between 400-700 words only. Thank you. -->\nIn 1989, scientist [[Hank Pym]] resigns from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after discovering their attempt to replicate his [[Ant-Man]] shrinking technology. Believing the technology would be dangerous if replicated, Pym vows to hide it for as long as he lives.\n\nIn the present day,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film are set a few months after the events of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\" />}} Pym's estranged daughter, [[Hope van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hope van Dyne]], and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Darren Cross]], have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]], which horrifies Pym.\n\nUpon his release from prison, well-meaning thief [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]] unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fianc\u00e9, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out.\n\nPym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], disappeared into a subatomic [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]] while disabling a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' headquarters, where he briefly fights [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]].\n\nCross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's [[server (computing)|servers]], and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Van Dyne, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. Lang breaks free and he and Van Dyne dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross's particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and Van Dyne escape.\n\nCross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross's suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, presumably killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pym shows Van Dyne a new Wasp prototype suit and offers it to her. In a [[post-credits scene]], Wilson and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] have [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] in their custody.

I took the [[Chris Pratt]] approach to training for an action movie.

However, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] was developing a film based on a similar concept, ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'', and although ''Ant-Man'' went into development, nothing came to fruition.<ref name=\"TheUntoldStory\" />\n\nIn 2000, [[Howard Stern]] met with Marvel in an attempt to purchase the film rights to Ant-Man.<ref name=\"HowardStern\" /> In May of that year, [[Artisan Entertainment]] announced a deal with Marvel to coproduce, finance, and distribute a film based on Ant-Man.<ref name=\"ArtisanDeal\" /> In 2003, [[Edgar Wright]] and his writing partner [[Joe Cornish]] wrote a treatment for Artisan, with Wright explaining that it revolved around [[Scott Lang]] as a burglar \"so he could have gone slightly in the [[Elmore Leonard]] route\", though Artisan wanted the film to be \"like a family thing\". However, Wright believed that the treatment was never sent to Marvel.<ref name=\"Artisan\" /> A year later, the duo pitched the film to [[Marvel Studios]]' then head of production, [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name=\"EWJan2015\" /> In April 2006, Marvel Studios hired Wright to direct and co-write ''Ant-Man'' with Cornish as part of the company's first slate of independently produced films.

Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014,<ref name=\"EW\" /> and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013.<ref name=\"IGN3\" /> In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the script for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'',<ref name=\"digitalspy\" /> as that film's producer [[Eric Fellner]] was diagnosed with cancer.<ref name=\"DeadlineDec2013\" />\n\nIn August 2013, after [[Joss Whedon]], director of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', announced that Hank Pym would not be [[Ultron]]'s creator, Wright said Ultron was never a part of the story of ''Ant-Man'',<ref name=\"sciencefiction\" /> explaining that \"just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie\".<ref name=\"HuffPost\" /> Wright described ''Ant-Man'' as a [[Stand-alone sequel|stand-alone]] film but said it would fit into the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, \"I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think ''Iron Man'' really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable. I definitely want to go into finding a streamlined format where you use the origin format to introduce the main character and further adventures can bring other people into it.\"<ref name=\"IndieWire\" /> Wright also stated that pre-production for ''Ant-Man'' would begin in October and filming would begin in 2014.<ref name=\"Collider\" /> The next month, Disney moved the film's release date up to July 31, 2015.<ref name=\"Deadline\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\nIn October 2013, Wright revealed that he was in Los Angeles to work on ''Ant-Man'' by tweeting a photograph from the production of the June 2012 test reel.<ref name=\"HuffPost2\" /> [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] and [[Paul Rudd]] were soon being considered for the lead role,<ref name=\"VarietyOct2013\" /> though {{nowrap|Gordon-Levitt}} dismissed his consideration as a rumor.<ref name=\"GordonLevitt\" /> Feige stated that ''Ant-Man'' would be a \"[[heist film|heist movie]]\", and that a casting announcement for Hank Pym would come before the end of 2013.<ref name=\"IGN4\" /> The next month, Feige stated that [[Eric O'Grady]]'s Ant-Man would not be featured in the film,<ref name=\"EricO'Grady\" /> while Rudd became the front-runner to play Hank Pym, and casting for the character's girlfriend had begun.<ref name=\"HollywoodReporterNov2013\" /> Around that time, the filmmakers' intentions to shoot in the United Kingdom were dashed because of a lack of studio space, which Wright believed was due to the plan by [[The Pinewood Studios Group|Pinewood Shepperton]] to add fifteen studios to their facility, which was rejected in part by the local council in May 2013 because the project was eyeing protected land.<ref name=\"Filming1\" /><ref name=\"Filming2\" /> By the end of the month, the film was scheduled to be shot in the U.S. instead.<ref name=\"Filming3\" />\n\nIn December 2013, Wright, a fan of the comic book since childhood\u2014owning copies of ''Tales to Astonish'' #27 featuring \"The Man in the Ant-Hill\" storyline and ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #47 featuring the first appearance of Scott Lang\u2014<ref name=\"CultBox\" /> stated that the difference between ''Ant-Man'' and other films featuring size-changing is \"other shrinking movies are usually about somebody trapped small. This is different in that he can actually change size and he can do that at will, so it becomes more of a power than an impediment.\"<ref name=\"DailyMirror\" /> Wright also talked about the challenge of directing a superhero film, saying, \"''Shaun'' and ''Hot Fuzz'' and ''World's End'' are all R-rated films.

Or wasn't inheriting something that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad,\" Feige continued. \"He looked at everything, he talked with us, and he said 'Number one, I agree with the direction you're going in.

It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different\u2014but the idea is all theirs.\"<ref name=\"RuddEWWriting\" /> Some additions to the film that had not been featured in Wright's version included Janet van Dyne, the quantum realm, and a fight with an Avenger.<ref name=\"ReedTHRJul2018\" /><ref name=\"McKayPodcastTHR\" /><ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" /> According to Reed, the quantum realm was the MCU's version of the [[microverse]],<ref name=\"Microverse\" /> which could not be called that due to legal reasons. The alternate name was suggested by consultant Spiros Michalakis, a quantum physicist and staff researcher at the [[California Institute of Technology]], to \"inject elements of modern physics into the script\".<ref name=\"QuantumRealmConsultant\" /> Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result.<ref name=\"IGNSetVisit1\" /> One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being \"a crucial part\" of the Ant-Man comics.<ref name=\"ReedNov2015\" /> For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story.<ref name=\"Screenwriters/StoryCredit\" /> Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.<ref name=\"WrightEP\" />\n\nBy the end of July, Wilson left the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and [[Kevin Weisman]] were cut in McKay's revised script.<ref name=\"JulyActorCuts\" /> Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco.<ref name=\"ReedJuly2014\" /> The next month, Reed revealed that [[Cassandra Lang|Scott Lang's daughter]] would appear in the film,<ref name=\"Daughter\" /> and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script.<ref name=\"FerrariBarrer\" /> Ferrari and Barrer were hired after Reed read their [[spec script]] ''Die in a Gunfight'' which Reed felt was \"really interesting\".<ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" /> [[Eric Pearson]], a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the [[Marvel One-Shot]] films, did uncredited work on the film as well,<ref name=\"Pearson\" /> scripting the strip club scene and Stan Lee's cameo.<ref name=\"Pearson2\" /> After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was \"pulled\" more into the MCU than Wright's version which \"was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films.\" She added that, while Wright's version was \"incredible\" and would have been great to film and watch, \"it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe.

The truth is the phases mean a lot to me and some people but...''Civil War'' is the start of Phase Three. It just is. And ''Ant-Man'' is a different kind of culmination of Phase Two because it very much is in the MCU. You meet new characters and you learn about Hank Pym and his lineage with the MCU over the years. But at the same time, it also picks up the thread of ''Age of Ultron'' in terms of heroes\u2014major heroes, Avengers\u2014coming from unexpected places... And in that way it connects a lot. Also, Hank Pym's attitude towards Avengers, towards [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and kind of the cinematic universe in general, is much more informed after the events of ''Age of Ultron'', and in a certain way, before the events of ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"FeigePhase\" />}}\n\n[[File:Peyton Reed (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Reed at the world premiere of ''Ant-Man'' in Hollywood]]\nFeige later expanded on this by saying, \"[W]e put ''Ant-Man'' at the end of Phase Two as opposed to the beginning of Phase Three, because it sets up a lot of the things you're going to see heading into Phase Three, one of which is this mind-bending, reality-altering landscape [in ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]''].\"<ref name=\"AntManFalcon\" /> On December 5, 2014, Reed announced on social media that principal photography on ''Ant-Man'' had been completed.<ref name=\"FilmingComplete\" />\n\nFor the film, cinematographer [[Russell Carpenter]] used a 1.85 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] shot with [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] and [[Arri Alexa#Alexa M|M]] cameras, using the M for fight sequences and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, \"Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 was a good call, since at 2.35 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [Ant-Man] going from standing full-size to falling through a crack in the floor.\" Carpenter and [[Technicolor]] also devised a [[lookup table]] (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, \"For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of '[[Kodak]]' \u2013 saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to something a little more weathered.\"<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\nThe filmmakers made extensive use of [[macro photography]]. Production designer Shepherd Frankel said, \"It's more visually interesting to depict things from Ant-Man's point of view instead of seeing him from a normal perspective. But we wanted a realistic realization, not ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' with its oversized set pieces.\"<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Rebecca Baehler served as the director of macro photography, taking cues from Carpenter.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Carpenter said vibration became \"a tremendous problem\" when moving the camera during the macro photography because \"one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air. From an ant's perspective, you move four inches, to a human perspective, that's a football field!\" The filmmakers needed a creative solution, so they turned to Baehler, who had a background in commercial \"tabletop\" photography. In order to add Rudd's performance as Ant-Man when in the macro world, a Centroid facial capture set up was used, with a five-camera array of Alexas surrounding Rudd. Rosenfeld explained, \"One camera was set up vertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas, all set to record at 48 frames per second. This maximized resolution and provided 3D modeling [of] Paul's performance.\" Reed would then call out story moments with Rudd performing \"facial expressions that would later be composited on a [[computer graphics|CG]] Ant-Man.\"<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Entomologist Steven Kutcher provided suggestions to the filmmakers on how to film live ants.<ref name=\"AntFilmingConsultant\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nFollowing the completion of principal photography, Marvel released an updated synopsis revealing that [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]] was included in the cast and the names of several supporting characters.<ref name=\"StitchCast\" /> However, Moll\u00e0 subsequently did not appear in the theatrical release of the film. Reed explained that the film's original opening, which was filmed and cut in the editing process, featured a standalone sequence similar to the opening of a [[James Bond in film|James Bond film]], where an unseen Pym was attempting to retrieve some microfilm from Moll\u00e0's character, Castillo, a Panama army general. Reed stated the scene was going to show Ant-Man's powers, without seeing him, almost \"like an Invisible Man sequence, and it's really, really cool. It started to feel tonally disconnected from the movie we were making and story-wise, and it also kind of like, it set a standalone adventure, but it didn't just connect to the rest of our story...It felt like vestige of those earlier drafts [by Wright and Cornish], which as a standalone thing was really cool.\"<ref name=\"ReedOriginalOpening\" /> Dan Lebental and Colby Parker, Jr. served as [[film editing|film editors]].<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> In March 2015, [[Hayley Atwell]] confirmed that she would reprise her role as [[Peggy Carter]] in the film.<ref name=\"AtwellAntMan\" /> In April 2015, Reed stated that the film was not completed yet and would be undergoing \"a little bit of additional\" filming.<ref name=\"AddtionalFilming\" />\n\nIn June 2015, Feige confirmed that the character of Janet van Dyne would be seen, though the film would not address Pym and Van Dyne's infamous domestic abuse storyline in the comics, saying, \"We hint at a temper in a way that people who know the stories might go, 'Oh, perhaps that's a bit of [Hank's] character,' but not in a way that would ever indicate [he beat his wife].\"<ref name=\"IGNSetVisit3\" /> Also in the month, Reed confirmed there would be a post-credit sequence \"that may tie into the other films.\"<ref name=\"/Film65Things5\" /> Feige revealed the post-credit sequence was footage shot by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]] for ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', saying the clip would be seen in that film, though it may be \"different takes...different angles.\"<ref name=\"FeigePostCredit\" /><ref name=\"FeigePostCredit2\" /> On June 25, 2015, Reed announced on social media that production of ''Ant-Man'' was officially complete.<ref name=\"AntManComplete\" /> In early July 2015, an international teaser trailer revealed that [[Anthony Mackie]] would appear in the film as [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]].<ref name=\"Mackie\" /> Mackie appears in the post-credit sequence as well, along with [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]], respectively.<ref name=\"EvansStanAntMan\" /> Stan stated the scene that was used for the post-credit sequence was shot in May 2015, and would appear in the middle of ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"StanCollider\" /> Reed also said that the end of the film originally had a sequence where Ant-Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross's particles, \"...&nbsp;But then for a couple reasons, it felt like maybe we should leave those particles out there.\"<ref name=\"ReedCinemaBlend\" /> For the title sequences, Marvel again went with design firm Sarofsky, who had done the credits for both ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', with the credits \"intricately connected to the film's overall narrative.\"<ref name=\"Sarofsky\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[File:Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket.jpg|thumb|For Yellowjacket sequences, Stoll wore a [[motion capture]] suit while on set (top), which was replaced by an entirely digital creation built by Double Negative (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], [[Luma Pictures]], and [[Method Studios]], with [[previsualization]] by The Third Floor.<ref name=\"IGNSetVisit1\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"YoungDouglas\" /> Double Negative handled the scenes featuring shrunken characters, incorporating the macro photography and [[motion capture]] performances shot in principal photography with digital models of the characters.

We'd have two CG cameras rendering the action from different points along the timeline with slightly different framings. One would be the main shot camera, the other would be a utility camera that would provide renders of static poses of Ant-Man at different points along the timeline.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nFor the flashbacks in 1989, Douglas and Donovan appeared [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] via CGI, alongside Atwell as Carter (aged in makeup and with CGI) and [[John Slattery]] as [[Howard Stark]].<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\" /><ref name=\"SHHypeSetVisit\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"IGNSetVisit3\" /> To de-age Douglas, Lola VFX used a similar process and technology that was used to make Steve Rogers skinny in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' and Carter older in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' as well as footage of Douglas' other films from the late 1980s as reference.<ref name=\"AntManFalcon\" /><ref name=\"YoungDouglas\" /> [[Dax Griffin]] served as Douglas' [[body double]] and an additional reference for Lola, because of his \"striking resemblance of Michael when he was about 40\".<ref name=\"YoungDouglas\" /><ref name=\"Griffin\" /> For Donovan, he only needed to be de-aged about a decade, so no double was used. The work on him focused on his eyes, neck, and chin. Atwell wore a wig on set, along with a fine layer of latex makeup to give the skin a more leathery look, with Lola transposing the facial features of an elderly actress onto her face.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nMethod and Luma both worked on creating the various ants seen in the film, with Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors. Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in ''The Winter Soldier''. Using practical suit pieces built by [[Legacy Effects]], ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on ''[[Lucy (2014 film)|Lucy]]''.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Ant-Man (soundtrack)}}\nIn February 2014, Wright announced that [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]] would [[Film score|score]] the film.<ref name=\"Pope-Price\" /> However, Price left soon after Wright's departure from the project in May 2014.<ref name=\"PopePriceLeave\" /> In January 2015, [[Christophe Beck]], who worked with Reed on ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', was hired to replace Price.<ref name=\"BeckToScore\"/> Describing the film's score, Beck said, \"For ''Ant-Man'', I wanted to write a score in the grand symphonic tradition of my favorite superhero movies, with a sweeping scope and a big, catchy main theme. What makes this score stand out among other Marvel movies, though, is a sneaky sense of fun since it is, after all, not only a superhero movie, but also a heist comedy.\"<ref name=\"Beck\" /> [[Hollywood Records]] released the soundtrack digitally on July 17, 2015, and had a physical release on August 7.<ref name=\"SoundtrackRelease\"/>\n\n==Marketing==\nIn March 2014, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired a one-hour [[television special]], ''Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe'', which included a sneak peek of ''Ant-Man''.<ref name=\"TVSpecial\" /><ref name=\"TVSpecialAntMan\" /> In July 2014, Reed, Rudd, Douglas, Lilly, and Stoll appeared at Marvel Studios' panel at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International to help promote the film and screen a visual effects test featuring Rudd and Douglas.<ref name=\"2014SDCCPanel\" /> In October 2014, Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief [[Axel Alonso]] stated there are comic tie-in plans for the film.<ref name=\"ComicTieIn\" /> In November 2014, ABC aired another one-hour television special titled, ''[[Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!]]'', which featured behind the scenes footage of ''Ant-Man''.<ref name=\"TVSpecialPulpPop\" /> Marvel Comics' February 2015 solicitations released in December 2014, revealed a two-issue comic tie-in, ''Marvel's Ant-Man Prelude'', following Hank Pym as Ant-Man on a mission during the Cold War.<ref name=\"MarvelFeb2015Solicits\" /> A second comic tie-in, ''Marvel's Ant-Man\u2014Scott Lang: Small Time'', was released digitally on March 3, 2015. It explains Lang's circumstances at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"SmallTime1\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney officially began the film's marketing campaign by releasing a miniature \"ant-sized\" teaser trailer, a full-sized version of the same teaser trailer, a poster, a cover on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and a full-length trailer during the premiere of the television series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]''. Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'', said, \"It was darn-clever for Disney to put out a miniature 'can't see anything without a microscope' version of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little when they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney had just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But nonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days.\" Mendelson went on to say that \"the peppy, witty trailer above is a general audience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but it's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good.\"<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> However, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of ''Agent Carter'', its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, \"The ''Ant-Man'' trailer isn't bad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which almost seems worse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, ''Ant-Man'' has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if not financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much as anything else, doesn't do enough \u2014 or anything, really \u2014 to persuade audiences that that's not the case.\"<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" /> The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind trailers for ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Marvel debuted a second trailer for ''Ant-Man''. Mendelson said it was \"frankly the ''Ant-Man'' trailer that we've been waiting for. It's not just funny and exciting, it's an 'Ah ha!' moment when we realize just what exactly an ''Ant-Man'' movie has to offer.\"<ref name=\"ForbesAprilTrailer\" /> Also in April, miniature [[billboard]]s promoting ''Ant-Man'' with battery-powered [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights began appearing in [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]] and other areas around [[Queensland]], Australia as part of a [[street marketing]] campaign for the film.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> The next month, Marvel, in partnership with [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], and [[Raspberry Pi]], announced the \"Ant-Man Micro-Tech Challenge\", aimed at females aged 14 through 18, to create [[Do it yourself|DIY]] projects involving micro technology and readily accessible and found materials. Winners teamed with [[STEM fields|STEM]] (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) programs in their areas to lead teams in recreating their projects.<ref name=\"MicroTechChallenge\" /> In June, Marvel released posters featuring Ant-Man juxtaposed with [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|Iron Man's armor]], [[Captain America's shield#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Captain America's shield]], and Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. Mendelson compared this to Disney's marketing campaign for ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' that put the [[Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)|protagonist]] into iconic scenes from other Disney cartoons.<ref name=\"AvengersPosters\" /> A six-minute IMAX preview of the film began screeing before showings of ''[[Jurassic World]]'',<ref name=\"IMAXPreview\" /> and scenes from the film were shown at [[Disney California Adventure]]'s [[It's Tough to Be a Bug!|Bug's Life Theater]] in 3D with in-theater effects.<ref name=\"DisneyCalifornia\" />\n\nIn early July 2015, Marvel began a [[viral marketing]] campaign featuring [[Leslie Bibb]], reprising her role from the ''Iron Man'' films as journalist [[Christine Everhart]], reporting for the faux news program ''[[WHIH Newsfront]]''. In the program, Everhart discuses the fallout from the events of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Lang's imprisonment,<ref name=\"Newsfront1\" /><ref name=\"Newsfront2\" /> and events leading to ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name=\"Newsfront3\" /> Also in July, Michael Douglas and executives from [[Marvel Entertainment]] rang the closing bell of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in celebration of the release of ''Ant-Man''.<ref name=\"NYSE\" /> Disney spent $34.8 million on television advertising for the film, more than the $26.9 million spent for ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', since the former was a new property.<ref name=\"TVMoney\" />\n\nIn December 2015, to commemorate the home media release of ''Ant-Man'', [[Marvel UK]] launched a website that offers visitors a view of various London landmarks from the perspective of an ant in a [[Google Street View]]-type experience. The company commissioned photographer Will Pearson to capture ten different locations including [[Tower Bridge]], [[Oxford Circus]], the [[British Museum]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and [[Nelson's Column]] using a 360\u00b0 miniature camera that sat centimeters off of the ground.<ref name=\"ant-view\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n[[File:Paul Rudd (cropped) 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudd at the world premiere of ''Ant-Man'' in Hollywood]]\n''Ant-Man'' premiered at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood on June 29, 2015,<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> and opened the 2015 [[Fantasia International Film Festival]] on July 14, 2015, along with ''[[Miss Hokusai]]''.<ref name=\"FantasiaFest\" /> The film was released in France on July 14,<ref name=\"DeadlineRelease\" /> and was released in North America on July 17,<ref name=\"ReleaseChange\" /> in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]].<ref name=\"IMAX\" /><ref name=\"ForbesAntManPoster\" /> The film was released in the United States in 3,800 theaters, with the breakdown of 3,100 3D screens, 361 IMAX screens, 388 [[Large format (photography)|large format]] screens and 133 [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] screens.<ref name=\"DeadlineRelease\" /> ''Ant-Man'' had originally been scheduled for release on November 6, 2015.<ref name=\"collider\" /> In September 2013, the release was moved to July 31, 2015,<ref name=\"Deadline\" /> before changing for a final time to July 17, 2015 in January 2014.<ref name=\"ReleaseChange\" /> An unfinished version of the film was screened on June 24, 2015, at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''Ant-Man'' was released for [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on November 17, 2015 and released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray Disc#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D]], and [[DVD]] on December 8, 2015.

Produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]], it is [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the 12th film]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). The film was directed by [[Peyton Reed]], with a screenplay by the writing teams of [[Edgar Wright]] and [[Joe Cornish]], and [[Adam McKay]] and [[Paul Rudd]]. It stars Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man, alongside [[Evangeline Lilly]], [[Corey Stoll]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[Michael Pe\u00f1a]], [[T.I.|Tip \"T.I.\" Harris]], [[Anthony Mackie]], [[Wood Harris]], [[Judy Greer]], [[David Dastmalchian]], and [[Michael Douglas]] as Hank Pym. <!--Starring list is based on the film poster's billing block, with Mackie added per his placement in the film and based on talk page discussions.--> In ''Ant-Man'', Lang must help defend Pym's Ant-Man shrinking technology and plot a heist with worldwide ramifications.\n\nDevelopment of ''Ant-Man'' began in April 2006 with the hiring of Wright to direct and co-write with Cornish. By April 2011, Wright and Cornish had completed three drafts of the script and Wright shot test footage for the film in July 2012. Pre-production began in October 2013 after being put on hold so that Wright could complete ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]''. Casting began in December 2013, with the hiring of Rudd to play Lang. In May 2014, Wright left the project citing creative differences, though he still received screenplay and story credits with Cornish as well as an executive producer credit. The following month, Reed was brought in to replace Wright, while McKay was hired to contribute to the script with Rudd. Principal photography took place between August and December 2014 in San Francisco and [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Metro Atlanta]].\n\n''Ant-Man'' held its world premiere in Los Angeles on June 29, 2015, and was released in the United States on July 17, 2015, in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]]. It grossed more than $519 million worldwide and received positive reviews from critics, who generally welcomed the film's smaller stakes than preceding MCU installments, as well as its cast (particularly Rudd, Pe\u00f1a, Lilly and Douglas), humor and CGI sequences. A sequel, titled ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'', was released on July 6, 2018. A third film is in development, for a potential 2022 release.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Do NOT change the paragraph layout. There is no need to have a bunch of smaller, few sentence ones. Also, per film plot, the summary should be between 400-700 words only. Thank you. -->\nIn 1989, scientist [[Hank Pym]] resigns from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] after discovering their attempt to replicate his [[Ant-Man]] shrinking technology. Believing the technology would be dangerous if replicated, Pym vows to hide it for as long as he lives.\n\nIn the present day,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|The events of the film are set a few months after the events of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015).<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\" />}} Pym's estranged daughter, [[Hope van Dyne (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Hope van Dyne]], and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[Darren Cross]], have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]], which horrifies Pym.\n\nUpon his release from prison, well-meaning thief [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]] moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter [[Cassandra Lang|Cassie]] unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fianc\u00e9, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out.\n\nPym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], disappeared into a subatomic [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Extradimensional places|quantum realm]] while disabling a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]' headquarters, where he briefly fights [[Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Sam Wilson]].\n\nCross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's [[server (computing)|servers]], and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Van Dyne, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. Lang breaks free and he and Van Dyne dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and Van Dyne escape.\n\nCross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, presumably killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Pym shows Van Dyne a new Wasp prototype suit and offers it to her. In a [[post-credits scene]], Wilson and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]] have [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bucky Barnes]] in their custody.

However, [[Walt Disney Pictures]] was developing a film based on a similar concept, ''[[Honey, I Shrunk the Kids]]'', and although ''Ant-Man'' went into development, nothing came to fruition.<ref name=\"TheUntoldStory\" />\n\nIn 2000, [[Howard Stern]] met with Marvel in an attempt to purchase the film rights to Ant-Man.<ref name=\"HowardStern\" /> In May of that year, [[Artisan Entertainment]] announced a deal with Marvel to coproduce, finance, and distribute a film based on Ant-Man.<ref name=\"ArtisanDeal\" /> In 2003, [[Edgar Wright]] and his writing partner [[Joe Cornish]] wrote a treatment for Artisan, with Wright explaining that it revolved around [[Scott Lang]] as a burglar \"so he could have gone slightly in the [[Elmore Leonard]] route\", though Artisan wanted the film to be \"like a family thing\". However, Wright believed that the treatment was never sent to Marvel.<ref name=\"Artisan\" /> A year later, the duo pitched the film to [[Marvel Studios]]' then head of production, [[Kevin Feige]].<ref name=\"EWJan2015\" /> In April 2006, Marvel Studios hired Wright to direct and co-write ''Ant-Man'' with Cornish as part of the company's first slate of independently produced films. Wright would also co-produce the film with his [[Big Talk Productions]] partner [[Nira Park]].<ref name=\"animationmagazine\" />\n\n{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote=\"The thing I like about Ant-Man is that it's not like a secret power, there's no supernatural element or it's not a genetic thing.

Wright also stressed that the film would not be a [[spoof film|spoof]] but an action-adventure with some comedic elements and would incorporate both the [[Hank Pym]] and Scott Lang incarnations of the character.<ref name=\"IGN\" /> Wright said that he was looking to \"do a prologue where you see Pym as Ant-Man in action in the 60s, in sort of ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' mode basically, and then the contemporary, sort of flash-forward, is Scott Lang's story, and how he comes to acquire the suit, how he crosses paths with Hank Pym, and then, in an interesting sort of Machiavellian way, teams up with him.\"<ref name=\"superherohype\" /> The next February, Wright said that the project was in \"a holding pattern\" while the script was being revised,<ref name=\"IGN2\" /> and that he had been doing research for the film by studying [[nanotechnology]].<ref name=\"moviehole\" /> In March 2008, Wright said that the first draft of the script had been completed and he was working on the second.<ref name=\"empireonline\" />\n\n[[Stan Lee]] [[Twitter|tweeted]] in February 2010 that Marvel was prepping the film and that he met with Wright for lunch to discuss the character.<ref name=\"superherohype2\" /> Wright noted that there was no timetable for the film because Marvel did not consider the character to be one of their bigger, tentpole properties, so \"It's more like me and Kevin Feige saying...'Let's make a good script that works, that's all about a great genre film, and that isn't necessarily relying on anything else'\".<ref name=\"MTV\" /> At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright remarked that because his film would be an origin story and would not be released until after ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', the first ''Avengers'' film would not include Ant-Man, although Wright acknowledged that the character might appear in future ''Avengers'' films.<ref name=\"cinemablend\" /> In January 2011, Wright stated that he had resumed writing the script for the film following the conclusion of the international promotion for ''[[Scott Pilgrim vs. the World]]'',<ref name=\"LATimes\" /> and by April he and Cornish delivered the second draft of ''Ant-Man'' to Marvel.<ref name=\"superherohype3\" /> At the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, Wright revealed a third draft had been handed in.<ref name=\"MTV2\" />\n\n[[File:San Diego Comic-Con 2012 - Ant-Man announcement.jpg|thumb|left|(L-R) moderator Geoff Boucher, producer [[Kevin Feige]] and Wright at the 2012 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]]]\nIn May 2012, Feige said that the project was \"as close as it's ever been\" while Wright teased the film by tweeting a pictogram of Ant-Man.<ref name=\"comicbookresources\" /> In June, Wright spent just under a week shooting footage for a reel that would be used to test out the potential look and tone of his movie, as well as to decide how convincing Ant-Man's powers look on screen.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> The test footage was screened to audiences during the Marvel Studios panel at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International, with Wright confirming that ''Ant-Man'' would be happening.<ref name=\"empireonline2\" /> Germain Lussier of [[/Film]] felt the footage worked and was \"awesome\", as \"it had a totally different vibe from the other Marvel films.

Feige also stated that shooting was slated to begin sometime in 2014,<ref name=\"EW\" /> and that casting would begin towards the end of 2013.<ref name=\"IGN3\" /> In July 2013, Wright said that he and Cornish had completed the script for the film and that Marvel allowed him to delay its production so that he could complete ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'',<ref name=\"digitalspy\" /> as that film's producer [[Eric Fellner]] was diagnosed with cancer.<ref name=\"DeadlineDec2013\" />\n\nIn August 2013, after [[Joss Whedon]], director of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', announced that Hank Pym would not be [[Ultron]]'s creator, Wright said Ultron was never a part of the story of ''Ant-Man'',<ref name=\"sciencefiction\" /> explaining that \"just to sort of set up what Ant-Man does is enough for one movie\".<ref name=\"HuffPost\" /> Wright described ''Ant-Man'' as a [[Stand-alone sequel|stand-alone]] film but said it would fit into the larger continuity of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, explaining, \"I like to make it standalone because I think the premise of it needs time. I want to put the crazy premise of it into a real world, which is why I think ''Iron Man'' really works because it's a relatively simple universe; it's relatable.

Wright continued, \"Suddenly becoming a director-for-hire on it, you're sort of less emotionally invested and you start to wonder why you're there, really.\"<ref name=\"WrightJun2017\" /> The majority of Wright's crew also left the project in the wake of his departure.<ref name=\"WrightJun2017\" /><ref name=\"PopePriceLeave\" /> By May 30, [[Adam McKay]] had entered negotiations to replace Wright,<ref name=\"NewDirectorsVariety\" /> but he pulled out of negotiations the next day out of respect for Wright, who he was friends with.<ref name=\"McKayOut\" /><ref name=\"McKayPodcastTHR\" /> On June 7, Marvel announced that [[Peyton Reed]] would direct the film, with McKay contributing to the film's script;<ref name=\"ReedMcKay\" /> McKay felt this was the perfect result since he would not be replacing Wright, but was able to help Rudd, who he was also friends with.<ref name=\"McKayPodcast\" /> Other directors that had been under consideration include [[Ruben Fleischer]], [[Rawson Marshall Thurber]], [[Nicholas Stoller]], [[Michael Dowse]], and [[David Wain]].<ref name=\"NewDirectorsTHR\" /><ref name=\"ThurberOut\" /><ref name=\"NewDirectorsDeadline\" /><ref name=\"ReedWain\" />\n\nLater in June, Feige stated the film was still intended to be released on the July 17, 2015 date, with production slated to begin on August 18, 2014.<ref name=\"FeigeTotalFilm\" /><ref name=\"ProductionAugustStart\" /> Feige elaborated that \"much of the movie will still be based very much on [Wright and Cornish's] draft and the DNA of what Edgar has created up to this point\", with Reed stepping in to direct and McKay reworking only parts of the script. \"[Reed] wanted to be sure that he wasn't just inheriting something or following someone else's lead. Or wasn't inheriting something that the evil studio had watered down to be something bad,\" Feige continued. \"He looked at everything, he talked with us, and he said 'Number one, I agree with the direction you're going in. And number two, I can add to it.'\"<ref name=\"FeigeIGN\" />\n\nMcKay confirmed that Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd \"great with dialogue\", adding \"the two of us holed up in hotel rooms on the east and west coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just enhanced some stuff.\"<ref name=\"McKayRuddRewrite\" /> Rudd elaborated, \"The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of it all, is really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different\u2014but the idea is all theirs.\"<ref name=\"RuddEWWriting\" /> Some additions to the film that had not been featured in Wright's version included Janet van Dyne, the quantum realm, and a fight with an Avenger.<ref name=\"ReedTHRJul2018\" /><ref name=\"McKayPodcastTHR\" /><ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" /> According to Reed, the quantum realm was the MCU's version of the [[microverse]],<ref name=\"Microverse\" /> which could not be called that due to legal reasons. The alternate name was suggested by consultant Spiros Michalakis, a quantum physicist and staff researcher at the [[California Institute of Technology]], to \"inject elements of modern physics into the script\".<ref name=\"QuantumRealmConsultant\" /> Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result.<ref name=\"IGNSetVisit1\" /> One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being \"a crucial part\" of the Ant-Man comics.<ref name=\"ReedNov2015\" /> For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story.<ref name=\"Screenwriters/StoryCredit\" /> Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.<ref name=\"WrightEP\" />\n\nBy the end of July, Wilson left the film because of scheduling conflicts brought on by the filming delay, and characters being played by Gerald and [[Kevin Weisman]] were cut in McKay's revised script.<ref name=\"JulyActorCuts\" /> Also, Reed indicated that in addition to Georgia, filming would take place in San Francisco.<ref name=\"ReedJuly2014\" /> The next month, Reed revealed that [[Cassandra Lang|Scott Lang's daughter]] would appear in the film,<ref name=\"Daughter\" /> and Gabriel Ferrari and Andrew Barrer were hired to make further revisions to the script.<ref name=\"FerrariBarrer\" /> Ferrari and Barrer were hired after Reed read their [[spec script]] ''Die in a Gunfight'' which Reed felt was \"really interesting\".<ref name=\"ReedPolygonJul2018\" /> [[Eric Pearson]], a member of Marvel Studios' writing program who had written the [[Marvel One-Shot]] films, did uncredited work on the film as well,<ref name=\"Pearson\" /> scripting the strip club scene and Stan Lee's cameo.<ref name=\"Pearson2\" /> After reading the revised script, Evangeline Lilly felt that the film was \"pulled\" more into the MCU than Wright's version which \"was much more in the Edgar Wright camp of films.\" She added that, while Wright's version was \"incredible\" and would have been great to film and watch, \"it wouldn't have fit in the Marvel Universe. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb, no matter how good it was. It just would have taken you away from this cohesive universe they're trying to create. And therefore it ruins the suspended disbelief that they've built.\"<ref name=\"Lilly2\" />\n\n[[Arnim Zola]] from ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' and ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' was considered to make an appearance in the film, with concept art created depicting him in his robot body from the comics.<ref name=\"Zola\" />\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] began on August 18, 2014 in San Francisco,<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Bigfoot''.<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\" /> Scenes were shot in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco|Tenderloin]] neighborhood and [[Buena Vista Park]].<ref name=\"SFFilming\" /> By the end of September 2014, production on ''Ant-Man'' moved to Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,<ref name=\"AtlantaMagazine\" /> and [[David Callaham]] completed a rewrite of the film.<ref name=\"CallahamRewrite\" /> Filming also took place at the State Archives building in [[Downtown Atlanta]],<ref name=\"AtlFilming\" /> to double as Pym Technologies, which is located on [[Treasure Island, San Francisco]] in the film.<ref name=\"/Film65Things3\" /> In October 2014, [[Martin Donovan]] was added to the cast,<ref name=\"Donovan\" /> and Feige revealed that ''Ant-Man'' would no longer start Phase Three of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and would instead be the final film of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two|Phase Two]].<ref name=\"NewPhase3\" /> When told by [[/Film]]'s Germain Lussier that this placement between ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' made the film feel like an afterthought, Feige replied,\n{{quote|It's not [an after thought]. The truth is the phases mean a lot to me and some people but...''Civil War'' is the start of Phase Three. It just is. And ''Ant-Man'' is a different kind of culmination of Phase Two because it very much is in the MCU. You meet new characters and you learn about Hank Pym and his lineage with the MCU over the years. But at the same time, it also picks up the thread of ''Age of Ultron'' in terms of heroes\u2014major heroes, Avengers\u2014coming from unexpected places... And in that way it connects a lot. Also, Hank Pym's attitude towards Avengers, towards [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and kind of the cinematic universe in general, is much more informed after the events of ''Age of Ultron'', and in a certain way, before the events of ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"FeigePhase\" />}}\n\n[[File:Peyton Reed (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Reed at the world premiere of ''Ant-Man'' in Hollywood]]\nFeige later expanded on this by saying, \"[W]e put ''Ant-Man'' at the end of Phase Two as opposed to the beginning of Phase Three, because it sets up a lot of the things you're going to see heading into Phase Three, one of which is this mind-bending, reality-altering landscape [in ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]''].\"<ref name=\"AntManFalcon\" /> On December 5, 2014, Reed announced on social media that principal photography on ''Ant-Man'' had been completed.<ref name=\"FilmingComplete\" />\n\nFor the film, cinematographer [[Russell Carpenter]] used a 1.85 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] shot with [[Arri Alexa#Alexa XT|Arri Alexa XT]] and [[Arri Alexa#Alexa M|M]] cameras, using the M for fight sequences and helicopter filming. Camera operator Peter Rosenfeld said, \"Russell and Peyton's decision to shoot in 1.85 was a good call, since at 2.35 there's insufficient height in frame to appreciate the vertical aspects of [Ant-Man] going from standing full-size to falling through a crack in the floor.\" Carpenter and [[Technicolor]] also devised a [[lookup table]] (LUT) to darken the color palette. Carpenter said, \"For a lot of recent comedies I've kept my LUTs kind of '[[Kodak]]' \u2013 saturated and upbeat. But this show needed something different that affected skin tones and the Ant-Man suit, which dates back to the 1980s, so it looks a little run-down. What I loved about this LUT was how it allowed the costume to retain the color but took it from fire-engine red to something a little more weathered.\"<ref name=\"ICG\" />\n\nThe filmmakers made extensive use of [[macro photography]]. Production designer Shepherd Frankel said, \"It's more visually interesting to depict things from Ant-Man's point of view instead of seeing him from a normal perspective. But we wanted a realistic realization, not ''Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' with its oversized set pieces.\"<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Rebecca Baehler served as the director of macro photography, taking cues from Carpenter.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" /> Carpenter said vibration became \"a tremendous problem\" when moving the camera during the macro photography because \"one inch off the ground is like fifteen feet in the air. From an ant's perspective, you move four inches, to a human perspective, that's a football field!\" The filmmakers needed a creative solution, so they turned to Baehler, who had a background in commercial \"tabletop\" photography. In order to add Rudd's performance as Ant-Man when in the macro world, a Centroid facial capture set up was used, with a five-camera array of Alexas surrounding Rudd. Rosenfeld explained, \"One camera was set up vertically while the others were horizontal with overlapping image areas, all set to record at 48 frames per second. This maximized resolution and provided 3D modeling [of] Paul's performance.\" Reed would then call out story moments with Rudd performing \"facial expressions that would later be composited on a [[computer graphics|CG]] Ant-Man.\"<ref name=\"ICG\" /> Entomologist Steven Kutcher provided suggestions to the filmmakers on how to film live ants.<ref name=\"AntFilmingConsultant\" />\n\n===Post-production===\nFollowing the completion of principal photography, Marvel released an updated synopsis revealing that [[Jordi Moll\u00e0]] was included in the cast and the names of several supporting characters.<ref name=\"StitchCast\" /> However, Moll\u00e0 subsequently did not appear in the theatrical release of the film. Reed explained that the film's original opening, which was filmed and cut in the editing process, featured a standalone sequence similar to the opening of a [[James Bond in film|James Bond film]], where an unseen Pym was attempting to retrieve some microfilm from Moll\u00e0's character, Castillo, a Panama army general. Reed stated the scene was going to show Ant-Man's powers, without seeing him, almost \"like an Invisible Man sequence, and it's really, really cool. It started to feel tonally disconnected from the movie we were making and story-wise, and it also kind of like, it set a standalone adventure, but it didn't just connect to the rest of our story...It felt like vestige of those earlier drafts [by Wright and Cornish], which as a standalone thing was really cool.\"<ref name=\"ReedOriginalOpening\" /> Dan Lebental and Colby Parker, Jr. served as [[film editing|film editors]].<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> In March 2015, [[Hayley Atwell]] confirmed that she would reprise her role as [[Peggy Carter]] in the film.<ref name=\"AtwellAntMan\" /> In April 2015, Reed stated that the film was not completed yet and would be undergoing \"a little bit of additional\" filming.<ref name=\"AddtionalFilming\" />\n\nIn June 2015, Feige confirmed that the character of Janet van Dyne would be seen, though the film would not address Pym and Van Dyne's infamous domestic abuse storyline in the comics, saying, \"We hint at a temper in a way that people who know the stories might go, 'Oh, perhaps that's a bit of [Hank's] character,' but not in a way that would ever indicate [he beat his wife].\"<ref name=\"IGNSetVisit3\" /> Also in the month, Reed confirmed there would be a post-credit sequence \"that may tie into the other films.\"<ref name=\"/Film65Things5\" /> Feige revealed the post-credit sequence was footage shot by [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]] for ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', saying the clip would be seen in that film, though it may be \"different takes...different angles.\"<ref name=\"FeigePostCredit\" /><ref name=\"FeigePostCredit2\" /> On June 25, 2015, Reed announced on social media that production of ''Ant-Man'' was officially complete.<ref name=\"AntManComplete\" /> In early July 2015, an international teaser trailer revealed that [[Anthony Mackie]] would appear in the film as [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]].<ref name=\"Mackie\" /> Mackie appears in the post-credit sequence as well, along with [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] and [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers / Captain America]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier]], respectively.<ref name=\"EvansStanAntMan\" /> Stan stated the scene that was used for the post-credit sequence was shot in May 2015, and would appear in the middle of ''Civil War''.<ref name=\"StanCollider\" /> Reed also said that the end of the film originally had a sequence where Ant-Man went after Carson to retrieve the stolen vial of Cross' particles, \"...&nbsp;But then for a couple reasons, it felt like maybe we should leave those particles out there.\"<ref name=\"ReedCinemaBlend\" /> For the title sequences, Marvel again went with design firm Sarofsky, who had done the credits for both ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', with the credits \"intricately connected to the film's overall narrative.\"<ref name=\"Sarofsky\" />\n\n====Visual effects====\n[[File:Corey Stoll as Yellowjacket.jpg|thumb|For Yellowjacket sequences, Stoll wore a [[motion capture]] suit while on set (top), which was replaced by an entirely digital creation built by Double Negative (bottom).<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />]]\nVisual effects for the film were provided by [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM), Lola VFX, [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]], [[Luma Pictures]], and [[Method Studios]], with [[previsualization]] by The Third Floor.<ref name=\"IGNSetVisit1\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"YoungDouglas\" /> Double Negative handled the scenes featuring shrunken characters, incorporating the macro photography and [[motion capture]] performances shot in principal photography with digital models of the characters. Double Negative also worked on Ant-Man's shrinking effect, in coordination with ILM to be used by all vendors, which showed the outline of his body \u2013 an element from the comics. Visual effects supervisor Alex Wuttke said, \"It's like a little time echo. As Ant-Man shrinks in almost a stop motion way he would leave behind outlines of the poses he'd been in as he shrinks down... We'd have two CG cameras rendering the action from different points along the timeline with slightly different framings. One would be the main shot camera, the other would be a utility camera that would provide renders of static poses of Ant-Man at different points along the timeline.\"<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nFor the flashbacks in 1989, Douglas and Donovan appeared [[De-aging in film|de-aged]] via CGI, alongside Atwell as Carter (aged in makeup and with CGI) and [[John Slattery]] as [[Howard Stark]].<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\" /><ref name=\"SHHypeSetVisit\" /><ref name=\"FXGuide\" /><ref name=\"IGNSetVisit3\" /> To de-age Douglas, Lola VFX used a similar process and technology that was used to make Steve Rogers skinny in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' and Carter older in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' as well as footage of Douglas' other films from the late 1980s as reference.<ref name=\"AntManFalcon\" /><ref name=\"YoungDouglas\" /> [[Dax Griffin]] served as Douglas' [[body double]] and an additional reference for Lola, because of his \"striking resemblance of Michael when he was about 40\".<ref name=\"YoungDouglas\" /><ref name=\"Griffin\" /> For Donovan, he only needed to be de-aged about a decade, so no double was used. The work on him focused on his eyes, neck, and chin. Atwell wore a wig on set, along with a fine layer of latex makeup to give the skin a more leathery look, with Lola transposing the facial features of an elderly actress onto her face.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\nMethod and Luma both worked on creating the various ants seen in the film, with Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors. Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in ''The Winter Soldier''. Using practical suit pieces built by [[Legacy Effects]], ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on ''[[Lucy (2014 film)|Lucy]]''.<ref name=\"FXGuide\" />\n\n==Music==\n{{main|Ant-Man (soundtrack)}}\nIn February 2014, Wright announced that [[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]] would [[Film score|score]] the film.<ref name=\"Pope-Price\" /> However, Price left soon after Wright's departure from the project in May 2014.<ref name=\"PopePriceLeave\" /> In January 2015, [[Christophe Beck]], who worked with Reed on ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', was hired to replace Price.<ref name=\"BeckToScore\"/> Describing the film's score, Beck said, \"For ''Ant-Man'', I wanted to write a score in the grand symphonic tradition of my favorite superhero movies, with a sweeping scope and a big, catchy main theme.

It explains Lang's circumstances at the beginning of the film.<ref name=\"SmallTime1\" />\n\nIn January 2015, Disney officially began the film's marketing campaign by releasing a miniature \"ant-sized\" teaser trailer, a full-sized version of the same teaser trailer, a poster, a cover on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and a full-length trailer during the premiere of the television series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]''. Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'', said, \"It was darn-clever for Disney to put out a miniature 'can't see anything without a microscope' version of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little when they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney had just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But nonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days.\" Mendelson went on to say that \"the peppy, witty trailer above is a general audience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but it's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good.\"<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> However, Graeme McMillan of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of ''Agent Carter'', its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, \"The ''Ant-Man'' trailer isn't bad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which almost seems worse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, ''Ant-Man'' has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if not financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much as anything else, doesn't do enough \u2014 or anything, really \u2014 to persuade audiences that that's not the case.\"<ref name=\"THRTrailer\" /> The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind trailers for ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.<ref name=\"EWTrailer\" />\n\nIn April 2015, Marvel debuted a second trailer for ''Ant-Man''. Mendelson said it was \"frankly the ''Ant-Man'' trailer that we've been waiting for. It's not just funny and exciting, it's an 'Ah ha!' moment when we realize just what exactly an ''Ant-Man'' movie has to offer.\"<ref name=\"ForbesAprilTrailer\" /> Also in April, miniature [[billboard]]s promoting ''Ant-Man'' with battery-powered [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] lights began appearing in [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]] and other areas around [[Queensland]], Australia as part of a [[street marketing]] campaign for the film.<ref name=\"billboard\" /> The next month, Marvel, in partnership with [[Dolby Laboratories]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], and [[Raspberry Pi]], announced the \"Ant-Man Micro-Tech Challenge\", aimed at females aged 14 through 18, to create [[Do it yourself|DIY]] projects involving micro technology and readily accessible and found materials. Winners teamed with [[STEM fields|STEM]] (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics education) programs in their areas to lead teams in recreating their projects.<ref name=\"MicroTechChallenge\" /> In June, Marvel released posters featuring Ant-Man juxtaposed with [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|Iron Man's armor]], [[Captain America's shield#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Captain America's shield]], and Thor's hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. Mendelson compared this to Disney's marketing campaign for ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'' that put the [[Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)|protagonist]] into iconic scenes from other Disney cartoons.<ref name=\"AvengersPosters\" /> A six-minute IMAX preview of the film began screeing before showings of ''[[Jurassic World]]'',<ref name=\"IMAXPreview\" /> and scenes from the film were shown at [[Disney California Adventure]]'s [[It's Tough to Be a Bug!|Bug's Life Theater]] in 3D with in-theater effects.<ref name=\"DisneyCalifornia\" />\n\nIn early July 2015, Marvel began a [[viral marketing]] campaign featuring [[Leslie Bibb]], reprising her role from the ''Iron Man'' films as journalist [[Christine Everhart]], reporting for the faux news program ''[[WHIH Newsfront]]''. In the program, Everhart discuses the fallout from the events of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Lang's imprisonment,<ref name=\"Newsfront1\" /><ref name=\"Newsfront2\" /> and events leading to ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name=\"Newsfront3\" /> Also in July, Michael Douglas and executives from [[Marvel Entertainment]] rang the closing bell of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in celebration of the release of ''Ant-Man''.<ref name=\"NYSE\" /> Disney spent $34.8 million on television advertising for the film, more than the $26.9 million spent for ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', since the former was a new property.<ref name=\"TVMoney\" />\n\nIn December 2015, to commemorate the home media release of ''Ant-Man'', [[Marvel UK]] launched a website that offers visitors a view of various London landmarks from the perspective of an ant in a [[Google Street View]]-type experience. The company commissioned photographer Will Pearson to capture ten different locations including [[Tower Bridge]], [[Oxford Circus]], the [[British Museum]], [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and [[Nelson's Column]] using a 360\u00b0 miniature camera that sat centimeters off of the ground.<ref name=\"ant-view\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n[[File:Paul Rudd (cropped) 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Rudd at the world premiere of ''Ant-Man'' in Hollywood]]\n''Ant-Man'' premiered at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Hollywood on June 29, 2015,<ref name=\"WorldPremiere\" /> and opened the 2015 [[Fantasia International Film Festival]] on July 14, 2015, along with ''[[Miss Hokusai]]''.<ref name=\"FantasiaFest\" /> The film was released in France on July 14,<ref name=\"DeadlineRelease\" /> and was released in North America on July 17,<ref name=\"ReleaseChange\" /> in [[3D film|3D]] and [[IMAX 3D]].<ref name=\"IMAX\" /><ref name=\"ForbesAntManPoster\" /> The film was released in the United States in 3,800 theaters, with the breakdown of 3,100 3D screens, 361 IMAX screens, 388 [[Large format (photography)|large format]] screens and 133 [[D-Box Technologies|D-Box]] screens.<ref name=\"DeadlineRelease\" /> ''Ant-Man'' had originally been scheduled for release on November 6, 2015.<ref name=\"collider\" /> In September 2013, the release was moved to July 31, 2015,<ref name=\"Deadline\" /> before changing for a final time to July 17, 2015 in January 2014.<ref name=\"ReleaseChange\" /> An unfinished version of the film was screened on June 24, 2015, at [[CineEurope]].<ref name=\"CineEurope\" />\n\n===Home media===\n''Ant-Man'' was released for [[Digital distribution|digital download]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on November 17, 2015 and released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], [[Blu-ray Disc#Blu-ray 3D|Blu-ray 3D]], and [[DVD]] on December 8, 2015.

These bacteria are extracellular, and made up of non-motile and non-sporing cocci.  It is clinically important for humans.  It is an infrequent, but usually [[Pathogenic bacteria|pathogenic]], part of the [[skin microbiota]].  It is the predominant species harboring the [[Lancefield grouping|Lancefield]] group A [[antigen]], and is often called '''group A ''Streptococcus''''' ('''GAS''').  However, both ''[[Streptococcus dysgalactiae]]'' and the ''[[Streptococcus anginosus]]'' group can possess group A antigen.  [[Group A streptococci]] when grown on blood agar typically produces small zones of [[beta-hemolysis]], a complete [[Lysis|destruction]] of [[red blood cell]]s.  (A zone size of 2\u20133&nbsp;mm is typical.)  It is thus also called '''group A (beta-hemolytic) ''Streptococcus''''' ('''GABHS'''), and it can make colonies greater than 5&nbsp;mm in size.<ref name=PSDS>{{cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/res/psds-ftss/strep-pyogenes-eng.php |title=Streptococcus pyogenes - Pathogen Safety Data Sheets |first=|last=|publisher=Government of Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada|date=2001-09-26 }}</ref>\n\nLike other [[coccus|cocci]], streptococci are round bacteria.  The species name is derived from Greek words meaning 'a chain' ({{lang|el-Latn|streptos}}) of berries ({{lang|la|coccus}} [Latinized from {{lang|el-Latn|kokkos}}]) and pus ({{lang|el-Latn|pyo}})-forming(genes), because streptococcal cells tend to link in chains of round cells (see image) and a number of infections caused by the bacterium produce pus.  The main criterion for differentiation between ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' spp. and ''Streptococcus'' spp. is the catalase test.  Staphylococci are catalase positive whereas streptococci are [[Catalase#Bacterial identification (catalase test)|catalase-negative]].<ref name=Sherris>{{cite book | veditors = Ryan KJ, Ray CG | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-8385-8529-0 }}</ref>  ''S. pyogenes'' can be [[microbiological culture|cultured]] on [[blood agar|fresh blood agar]] plates.

Of healthy individuals, 1% to 5% have throat, vaginal, or rectal carriage. In healthy children, such carriage rate varies from 2% to 17%. There are four methods for the transmission of this bacterium: inhalation of respiratory droplets, skin contact, contact with objects, surface, or dust that is contaminated with bacteria or, less commonly, transmission through food. Such bacteria can cause a variety of diseases such as [[streptococcal pharyngitis]], [[rheumatic fever]], [[rheumatic heart disease]], and [[scarlet fever]]. Although pharyngitis is mostly viral in origin, about 15 to 30% of all pharyngitis cases in children are caused by GAS; meanwhile, 5 to 20% of pharyngitis in adults are streptococcal. The number of pharyngitis cases is higher in children when compared with adults due to exposures in schools, nurseries, and as a consequence of lower host immunity. Such cases Streptococcal pharyngitis occurs more frequently from December to April (later winter to early spring) in seasonal countries, possibly due to changing climate, behavioural changes or predisposing viral infection. Disease cases are the lowest during autumn.<ref name=\"epidemiology\">{{cite book|last1=Androulla|first1=Efstratiou|last2=Theresa|first2=Lamagni|title=Streptococcus pyogenes : Basic Biology to Clinical Manifestations|date=10 February 2016|publisher=University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center|location=Oklahoma City, United States|chapter-url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK343616/|accessdate=24 February 2018|chapter=Epidemiology of Streptococcus pyogenes}}</ref>\n\nMT1 (metabolic type 1) clone is frequently associated with invasive ''Streptococcus pyogenes'' infections among developed countries. The incidence and mortality of ''S. pyognes'' was high during the pre-penicillin era, but had already started to fall prior to the widespread availability of penicillin. Therefore, environmental factors do play a role in the ''S. pyogenes'' infection. Incidence of ''S. pyogenes'' is 2 to 4 per 100,000 population in developed countries and 12 to 83 per 100,000 population in developing countries. ''S. pyogenes'' infection is more frequently found in men than women, with highest rates in the elderly, followed by infants. In people with risk factors such as heart disease, diabetes, malignancy, blunt trauma, surgical incision, virus respiratory infection, including influenza, ''S. pyogenes'' infection happens in 17 to 25% of all cases. GAS secondary infection usually happens within one week of the diagnosis of influenza infection. In 14 to 16% of childhood ''S. pyogenes'' infections, there is a prior [[chickenpox]] infection. Such ''S. pyogenes'' infection in children usually manifests as severe soft tissue infection with onset 4 to 12 days from the chickenpox diagnosis. There is also 40 to 60 times increase in risk of ''S. pyogenes'' infection within the first two weeks of chickenpox infection in children. However, 20 to 30% of ''S. pyogenes'' infection does occur in adults with no identifiable risk factors. The incidence is higher in children (50 to 80% of ''S. pyogenes'' infection) with no known risk factors. The rates of scarlet fever in UK was usually 4 in 100,000 population, however, in 2014, the rates had risen to 49 per 100,000 population. Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) usually occurs at 2 to 3 weeks after the throat infection, which is more common among the impoverished people in developing countries. From 1967 to 1996, the global mean incidence of rheumatic fever and RHD was 19 per 100,000 with the highest incidence at 51 per 100,000.<ref name=\"epidemiology\"/>\n\nMaternal ''S. pyogenes'' infection usually happens in late pregnancy; at more than 30 weeks of gestation to four weeks post partum, which accounts for 2 to 4% of all the ''S. pyogenes'' infections. This represents 20 to 100 times increase in risk for ''S. pyogenes'' infections. Clinical manifestations are: pneumonia, septic arthritis, necrotizing fasciitis, and genital tract sepsis. According to a study done by Queen Charlotte's hospital in London during the 1930s, the vagina was not the common source of such infection. On the contrary, maternal throat infection and close contacts with carriers were the more common sites for maternal ''S. pyogenes'' infection.<ref name=\"epidemiology\"/>\n\n==Bacteriology==\n=== Serotyping ===\n\nIn 1928, [[Rebecca Lancefield]] published a method for serotyping ''S. pyogenes'' based on its cell-wall polysaccharide,<ref name=Pignanelli_2015>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pignanelli S, Brusa S, Pulcrano G, Catania MR, Cocchi E, Lanari M | title = A rare case of infant sepsis due to the emm-89 genotype of Group A Streptococcus within a community-acquired cluster | journal = New Microbiol | volume = 38 | pages = 589\u201392 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26485019 | issue=4}}</ref> a [[virulence]] factor displayed on its surface.<ref name=Lancefield_1928>{{cite journal | author = Lancefield RC| title = The antigenic complex of ''Streptococcus hemolyticus'' | journal = J Exp Med | year = 1928 | volume = 47 | pages = 9\u201310 | doi = 10.1084/jem.47.1.91 | pmid = 19869404 | issue=1| pmc = 2131344}}</ref> Later, in 1946, Lancefield described the serologic classification of ''S. pyogenes'' isolates based on their surface [[T-antigen]].<ref name=Lancefield_1946>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lancefield RC, Dole VP | title = The properties of T antigen extracted from group A hemolytic streptococci | journal = J Exp Med | year = 1946 | volume = 84 | pages = 449\u201371 | doi= 10.1084/jem.84.5.449 | pmid = 19871581 | pmc = 2135665 | issue = 5 }}</ref>  Four of the 20 T-antigens have been revealed to be [[pilus|pili]], which are used by bacteria to attach to host cells.<ref name=Mora_2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mora M, Bensi G, Capo S, Falugi F, Zingaretti C, Manetti AG, Maggi T, Taddei AR, Grandi G, Telford JL | title = Group A Streptococcus produce pilus-like structures containing protective antigens and Lancefield T antigens | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 102 | issue = 43 | pages = 15641\u20136 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16223875 | pmc = 1253647 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0507808102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10215641M }}</ref> As of 2016, a total of 120 M proteins are identified.

It regulates SHP's (short hydrophobic peptides) that are quorum sensing pheromones a.k.a. autoinducers. The SHP's are translated to an immature form of the pheromone and must undergo processing, first by a metalloprotease enzyme inside the cell and then in the extracellular space, to reach their mature active form. The mode of transportation out of the cell and the extracellular processing factor(s) are still unknown. The mature SHP pheromone can then be taken in to nearby cells and the cell it originated from via a transmembrane protein, oligopeptide permease.<ref name=\"Two group A streptococcal peptide p\"/>\nIn the cytosol the pheromones have two functions in the Rgg2/3 pathway. Firstly, they inhibit the activity of Rgg3 which is a transcriptional regulator repressing SHP production. Secondly, they bind another transcriptional regulator, Rgg2, that increases the production of SHP's, having an antagonistic effect to Rgg3. SHP's activating their own transcriptional activator creates a positive feedback loop, which is common for the production for quorum sensing peptides. It enables the rapid production of the pheromones in large quantities. The production of SHP's increases biofilm biogenesis.<ref name=\"Two group A streptococcal peptide p\"/>\nIt has been suggested that GAS switches between biofilm formation and degradation by utilizing to pathways with opposing effects. Whilst Rgg2/3 pathway increases biofilm, the RopB pathway disrupts it. RopB is another Rgg-like protein (Rgg1) that directly activates SpeB (Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B), a cysteine protease that acts as a virulence factor. In the absence of this pathway, biofilm formation is enhanced, possibly due to the lack of the protease degrading pheromones or other Rgg2/3 pathway counteracting effects.<ref name=\"Two group A streptococcal peptide p\"/>\n\n== Disease ==\n{{See also|Group A streptococcal infection}}\n\n''S. pyogenes'' is the cause of many human diseases, ranging from mild superficial skin infections to life-threatening systemic diseases.<ref name=Sherris/> Infections typically begin in the throat or skin. The most striking sign is a strawberry-like rash. Examples of mild ''S. pyogenes'' infections include [[pharyngitis]] (strep throat) and localized skin infection ([[impetigo]]).  [[Erysipelas]] and [[cellulitis]] are characterized by multiplication and lateral spread of ''S. pyogenes'' in deep layers of the skin.

Throat infections associated with release of certain toxins lead to [[scarlet fever]].  Other toxigenic ''S. pyogenes'' infections may lead to streptococcal [[toxic shock syndrome]], which can be life-threatening.<ref name=Sherris/>\n\n''S. pyogenes'' can also cause disease in the form of post-infectious \"non-pyogenic\" (not associated with local bacterial multiplication and pus formation) syndromes. These [[autoimmune]]-mediated complications follow a small percentage of infections and include [[rheumatic fever]] and acute [[Post infectious glomerulonephritis|post-infectious glomerulonephritis]]. Both conditions appear several weeks following the initial streptococcal infection.  Rheumatic fever is characterized by inflammation of the joints and/or heart following an episode of [[streptococcal pharyngitis]].  Acute glomerulonephritis, inflammation of the [[kidney|renal]] [[glomerulus]], can follow streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection.\n\nThis bacterium remains acutely sensitive to [[penicillin]]. Failure of treatment with penicillin is generally attributed to other local commensal organisms producing [[\u03b2-lactamase]], or failure to achieve adequate tissue levels in the pharynx.

Such bacteria can cause a variety of diseases such as [[streptococcal pharyngitis]], [[rheumatic fever]], [[rheumatic heart disease]], and [[scarlet fever]]. Although pharyngitis is mostly viral in origin, about 15 to 30% of all pharyngitis cases in children are caused by GAS; meanwhile, 5 to 20% of pharyngitis in adults are streptococcal. The number of pharyngitis cases is higher in children when compared with adults due to exposures in schools, nurseries, and as a consequence of lower host immunity.

Therefore, environmental factors do play a role in the ''S. pyogenes'' infection. Incidence of ''S. pyogenes'' is 2 to 4 per 100,000 population in developed countries and 12 to 83 per 100,000 population in developing countries. ''S. pyogenes'' infection is more frequently found in men than women, with highest rates in the elderly, followed by infants. In people with risk factors such as heart disease, diabetes, malignancy, blunt trauma, surgical incision, virus respiratory infection, including influenza, ''S. pyogenes'' infection happens in 17 to 25% of all cases. GAS secondary infection usually happens within one week of the diagnosis of influenza infection. In 14 to 16% of childhood ''S. pyogenes'' infections, there is a prior [[chickenpox]] infection. Such ''S. pyogenes'' infection in children usually manifests as severe soft tissue infection with onset 4 to 12 days from the chickenpox diagnosis. There is also 40 to 60 times increase in risk of ''S. pyogenes'' infection within the first two weeks of chickenpox infection in children. However, 20 to 30% of ''S. pyogenes'' infection does occur in adults with no identifiable risk factors. The incidence is higher in children (50 to 80% of ''S. pyogenes'' infection) with no known risk factors. The rates of scarlet fever in UK was usually 4 in 100,000 population, however, in 2014, the rates had risen to 49 per 100,000 population. Rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease (RHD) usually occurs at 2 to 3 weeks after the throat infection, which is more common among the impoverished people in developing countries. From 1967 to 1996, the global mean incidence of rheumatic fever and RHD was 19 per 100,000 with the highest incidence at 51 per 100,000.<ref name=\"epidemiology\"/>\n\nMaternal ''S. pyogenes'' infection usually happens in late pregnancy; at more than 30 weeks of gestation to four weeks post partum, which accounts for 2 to 4% of all the ''S. pyogenes'' infections. This represents 20 to 100 times increase in risk for ''S. pyogenes'' infections. Clinical manifestations are: pneumonia, septic arthritis, necrotizing fasciitis, and genital tract sepsis. According to a study done by Queen Charlotte's hospital in London during the 1930s, the vagina was not the common source of such infection. On the contrary, maternal throat infection and close contacts with carriers were the more common sites for maternal ''S. pyogenes'' infection.<ref name=\"epidemiology\"/>\n\n==Bacteriology==\n=== Serotyping ===\n\nIn 1928, [[Rebecca Lancefield]] published a method for serotyping ''S. pyogenes'' based on its cell-wall polysaccharide,<ref name=Pignanelli_2015>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pignanelli S, Brusa S, Pulcrano G, Catania MR, Cocchi E, Lanari M | title = A rare case of infant sepsis due to the emm-89 genotype of Group A Streptococcus within a community-acquired cluster | journal = New Microbiol | volume = 38 | pages = 589\u201392 | year = 2015 | pmid = 26485019 | issue=4}}</ref> a [[virulence]] factor displayed on its surface.<ref name=Lancefield_1928>{{cite journal | author = Lancefield RC| title = The antigenic complex of ''Streptococcus hemolyticus'' | journal = J Exp Med | year = 1928 | volume = 47 | pages = 9\u201310 | doi = 10.1084/jem.47.1.91 | pmid = 19869404 | issue=1| pmc = 2131344}}</ref> Later, in 1946, Lancefield described the serologic classification of ''S. pyogenes'' isolates based on their surface [[T-antigen]].<ref name=Lancefield_1946>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lancefield RC, Dole VP | title = The properties of T antigen extracted from group A hemolytic streptococci | journal = J Exp Med | year = 1946 | volume = 84 | pages = 449\u201371 | doi= 10.1084/jem.84.5.449 | pmid = 19871581 | pmc = 2135665 | issue = 5 }}</ref>  Four of the 20 T-antigens have been revealed to be [[pilus|pili]], which are used by bacteria to attach to host cells.<ref name=Mora_2005>{{cite journal |vauthors=Mora M, Bensi G, Capo S, Falugi F, Zingaretti C, Manetti AG, Maggi T, Taddei AR, Grandi G, Telford JL | title = Group A Streptococcus produce pilus-like structures containing protective antigens and Lancefield T antigens | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 102 | issue = 43 | pages = 15641\u20136 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16223875 | pmc = 1253647 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0507808102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..10215641M }}</ref> As of 2016, a total of 120 M proteins are identified.

Throat infections associated with release of certain toxins lead to [[scarlet fever]].  Other toxigenic ''S. pyogenes'' infections may lead to streptococcal [[toxic shock syndrome]], which can be life-threatening.<ref name=Sherris/>\n\n''S. pyogenes'' can also cause disease in the form of post-infectious \"non-pyogenic\" (not associated with local bacterial multiplication and pus formation) syndromes. These [[autoimmune]]-mediated complications follow a small percentage of infections and include [[rheumatic fever]] and acute [[Post infectious glomerulonephritis|post-infectious glomerulonephritis]]. Both conditions appear several weeks following the initial streptococcal infection.  Rheumatic fever is characterized by inflammation of the joints and/or heart following an episode of [[streptococcal pharyngitis]].  Acute glomerulonephritis, inflammation of the [[kidney|renal]] [[glomerulus]], can follow streptococcal pharyngitis or skin infection.\n\nThis bacterium remains acutely sensitive to [[penicillin]]. Failure of treatment with penicillin is generally attributed to other local commensal organisms producing [[\u03b2-lactamase]], or failure to achieve adequate tissue levels in the pharynx.
