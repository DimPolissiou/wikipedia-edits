{"title_page": "Community Access Program", "text_new": "The '''Community Access Program''' (CAP, also seen as C@P) was an initiative of the [[Government of Canada]] which aimed to provide Canadians with affordable public access to the Internet and the skills they need to use it effectively. The program was administered by [[Industry Canada]].\n==History of CAP==\nIn 1994 the Community Access Program began. Initially, Industry Canada focused on rural communities, where Internet access was less available. Once the rural communities were equipped with computers and Internet access, Industry Canada focused on what is referred to as the [[digital divide]]. According to Statistics Canada 2001, the following groups were in highest need of services offered by CAP: Aboriginals, older Canadians, Canadians with low income or low education, francophone, new immigrants, and people in rural areas. Therefore, the focus was primarily to assist in 'Bridging the Digital Divide'.\n\nCAP Sites in rural and urban areas were then opened to help reach these people. The program played a crucial role in bridging the Digital Divide; contributing to the foundation for electronic access to government services; encouraging online learning and literacy; fostering the development of community based infrastructure; promoting Canadian e-commerce; and providing training with Assistive Technology. In order to make better use of the computers and equipment funded by CAP, Industry Canada also initiated the Community Access Program - Youth Initiative (CAP YI). CAP Sites could apply for funding to hire Youth Interns to come and work in their CAP Sites to train the public in computer and Internet use and technology.\n\nThe CAP program was terminated on March 31, 2012 as funding for the program was not renewed. Industry Canada stated that the program had reached its objective, and cited challenging fiscal times. Some provinces maintained their program thanks to large financial contributions from the provincial government, municipalities and libraries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Community Access Program|url=http://voices-voix.ca/en/facts/profile/community-access-program|website=Voices-Voix|accessdate=7 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ottawa cuts CAP public web access funding.|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ottawa-cuts-cap-public-web-access-funding-1.1152248|website=CBC News|publisher=CBC|accessdate=7 July 2016}}</ref> The CAP YI (Youth Initiative) program continues to receive funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=What happened to the Community Access Program (CAP)?|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cap-pac.nsf/eng/00023.html|website=Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Cap_logo.png|thumb|right|alt=CAP Logo|<center>Industry Canada Logo</center>]]\n\n==CAP YI==\nThe Community Access Program (CAP) Youth Initiative (YI) was coordinated by Industry Canada's Community Access Program and funded through the Youth Employment Strategy (YES) of Canada -- overseen by Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC). CAP's youth initiative aimed to provide employment opportunities for young Canadians between the ages of 15 and 30 - primarily students, recent graduates, or the under-employed or unemployed.\n\n==Locations==\nIndustry Canada's Community Access Program (CAP) gave thousands of Canadians affordable access to the Internet.

The program was administered by [[Industry Canada]].\n==History of CAP==\nIn 1994 the Community Access Program began. Initially, Industry Canada focused on rural communities, where Internet access was less available. Once the rural communities were equipped with computers and Internet access, Industry Canada focused on what is referred to as the [[digital divide]]. According to Statistics Canada 2001, the following groups were in highest need of services offered by CAP: Aboriginals, older Canadians, Canadians with low income or low education, francophone, new immigrants, and people in rural areas. Therefore, the focus was primarily to assist in 'Bridging the Digital Divide'.\n\nCAP Sites in rural and urban areas were then opened to help reach these people. The program played a crucial role in bridging the Digital Divide; contributing to the foundation for electronic access to government services; encouraging online learning and literacy; fostering the development of community based infrastructure; promoting Canadian e-commerce; and providing training with Assistive Technology. In order to make better use of the computers and equipment funded by CAP, Industry Canada also initiated the Community Access Program - Youth Initiative (CAP YI). CAP Sites could apply for funding to hire Youth Interns to come and work in their CAP Sites to train the public in computer and Internet use and technology.\n\nThe CAP program was terminated on March 31, 2012 as funding for the program was not renewed. Industry Canada stated that the program had reached its objective, and cited challenging fiscal times. Some provinces maintained their program thanks to large financial contributions from the provincial government, municipalities and libraries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Community Access Program|url=http://voices-voix.ca/en/facts/profile/community-access-program|website=Voices-Voix|accessdate=7 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ottawa cuts CAP public web access funding.|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/ottawa-cuts-cap-public-web-access-funding-1.1152248|website=CBC News|publisher=CBC|accessdate=7 July 2016}}</ref> The CAP YI (Youth Initiative) program continues to receive funding.<ref>{{cite web|title=What happened to the Community Access Program (CAP)?|url=http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cap-pac.nsf/eng/00023.html|website=Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Cap_logo.png|thumb|right|alt=CAP Logo|<center>Industry Canada Logo</center>]]\n\n==CAP YI==\nThe Community Access Program (CAP) Youth Initiative (YI) was coordinated by Industry Canada's Community Access Program and funded through the Youth Employment Strategy (YES) of Canada -- overseen by Human Resources and Social Development Canada (HRSDC). CAP's youth initiative aimed to provide employment opportunities for young Canadians between the ages of 15 and 30 - primarily students, recent graduates, or the under-employed or unemployed.\n\n==Locations==\nIndustry Canada's Community Access Program (CAP) gave thousands of Canadians affordable access to the Internet.

The Kabaw town leadership claimed that they would not recognise any decisions made by the new parliament, and also that the town's representative, Ali Al-Asawi, did not, and had never, represented the town. Both towns, in particular, rejected the House's call for foreign intervention in Libya in response to the upsurge in violence. Despite the timing of the announcements, the boycotts were seen as having more to do with the long-standing Amazigh boycott of the parliament over the issue of Amazigh representation, and less to do with the opposition to the parliament from Misrata and Islamist groups. It was immediately unclear whether the representatives from the towns would boycott the parliament.<ref name=\"Amazigh Boycott\">{{cite news|date=19 August 2014|title=Jabal Nefusa towns declare boycott of the House of Representatives|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/19/jabal-nefusa-towns-boycott-the-house-of-representatives-over-tobruk-meetings/#axzz3At6fozMX|newspaper=Libya Herald|location=Tripoli|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe following day leaders in [[Tarhuna]] released a statement announcing their opposition to the House of Representatives and their support for Operation Dawn.

The town leaders also rejected all decisions made by the parliament, especially its recent call for foreign intervention in Libya. The statement denounced the call as a \"flagrant violation of the sovereignty of Libya and a betrayal of the will of the Libyan people,\" and claimed that the airstrikes conducted several days prior against Operation Dawn were the result of the decision. The groups also declared that they had set up a Revolutionary Shura Council of Tarhuna, which they claimed would assume full responsibility for correcting the path of the nation and implementing the principles of and goals of the Libyan Revolution.<ref>{{cite news|date=20 August 2014|title=Tarhouna rejects House of Representatives, declares support for Operation Dawn|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/21/tarhouna-rejects-house-of-representatives-declares-support-for-operation-dawn/#axzz3At6fozMX|newspaper=Libya Herald|location=Tripoli|accessdate=22 August 2014 }}</ref>\n\n====Splits emerge in Benghazi====\nSplits between Islamist groups in Benghazi also began to emerge in mid-August.

The Kabaw town leadership claimed that they would not recognise any decisions made by the new parliament, and also that the town's representative, Ali Al-Asawi, did not, and had never, represented the town. Both towns, in particular, rejected the House's call for foreign intervention in Libya in response to the upsurge in violence. Despite the timing of the announcements, the boycotts were seen as having more to do with the long-standing Amazigh boycott of the parliament over the issue of Amazigh representation, and less to do with the opposition to the parliament from Misrata and Islamist groups. It was immediately unclear whether the representatives from the towns would boycott the parliament.<ref name=\"Amazigh Boycott\">{{cite news|date=19 August 2014|title=Jabal Nefusa towns declare boycott of the House of Representatives|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/19/jabal-nefusa-towns-boycott-the-house-of-representatives-over-tobruk-meetings/#axzz3At6fozMX|newspaper=Libya Herald|location=Tripoli|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe following day leaders in [[Tarhuna]] released a statement announcing their opposition to the House of Representatives and their support for Operation Dawn.

The town leaders also rejected all decisions made by the parliament, especially its recent call for foreign intervention in Libya. The statement denounced the call as a \"flagrant violation of the sovereignty of Libya and a betrayal of the will of the Libyan people,\" and claimed that the airstrikes conducted several days prior against Operation Dawn were the result of the decision. The groups also declared that they had set up a Revolutionary Shura Council of Tarhuna, which they claimed would assume full responsibility for correcting the path of the nation and implementing the principles of and goals of the Libyan Revolution.<ref>{{cite news|date=20 August 2014|title=Tarhouna rejects House of Representatives, declares support for Operation Dawn|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/21/tarhouna-rejects-house-of-representatives-declares-support-for-operation-dawn/#axzz3At6fozMX|newspaper=Libya Herald|location=Tripoli|accessdate=22 August 2014 }}</ref>\n\n====Splits emerge in Benghazi====\nSplits between Islamist groups in Benghazi also began to emerge in mid-August.

(both officially and non-officially), is the only francophone [[secondary school]] in [[Aylmer, Quebec]].  Its total population is over 2000, including 1992 [[students]] and 191 faculty members.  Because it is the only public school central in Aylmer, students from all [[social classes]] attend it, from the poorer suburbs to the richer neighbourhoods.  It is therefore the seat of many different organizations and events, from [[science fair]]s to [[team sport|sports teams]], and a myriad of things in between.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe school is divided into 7 major sectors, each unofficially called by the hundred of its number (example: \"Secteur 400).  The divisions between sections are generally determined by the floor on which they are, and the order in which they were built.\n\nFacilities include a large [[gym]]nasium, [[swimming pool]] (also used for public swimming classes), two symphony practice rooms, a cafeteria, several manual work-related rooms for special education, a small greenhouse, and an extensive laboratory section.\n\n===Flooding===\n\nIn recent years, the school's roof has been known to leak rather severely, occasioning the school's temporary closure at least twice in the past four years, including [[Hurricane Frances (2004)|2004's Hurricane Frances record rainfall]].  Work began on new roofing in 2005, although part of the applied roof is rumoured to be of temporary nature and quality.  The last flood, having happened in autumn of 2005 (''after'' the new roofing was installed), was cause for the school's closure for the second half of the day.  Its aftermath was rife with students poking fun at the school's roofing, and by extension, its budget. In 2019, the school still has some leaking problems, but they are less frequent.\n\n==Programs==\n\n===Standard program===\n\nThis is the standard [[Quebec education system]]'s curriculum.  It involves Secondary years I through V; elective courses include Art/Music options; Regular/Bilingual [[English language|English]] (both for all levels); [[Physics]]; [[Chemistry]]; Twentieth Century [[History]]; Advanced [[Biology]] (for Secondary V students); [[Mathematics]] CST, TS or SN (in Secondary IV and V).

It functions as an IBO supplement to the standard curriculum, the most obvious difference being that it features mandatory [[Spanish language|Spanish]] classes from Secondary II through III, and does not allow students to choose any other courses (they are required to take the most advanced classes in almost all cases).  The subjects of Arts and Music are divided by level: Secondary I-II take Music, and III-IV take Arts.\n\nThere are three or four [[class (education)|classes]] (each of 28-32). Also unlike other programs, students remain in the same class throughout all the subjects - in every class, all the students are the same.  This results in a more tight-knit class than in the other programs, which can both be a treat and an inconvenience to [[teacher]]s.\n\nDespite the fact that it is often viewed as a program for gifted students by the regular students, there are students from all backgrounds, of all types, and of all ambitions in the program.
