It began on 2 March 1986 at [[Amaroo Park]] and ended on 13 July at [[Oran Park Raceway]] after ten rounds. This was the second ATCC to be run to the [[FIA]]'s international [[Group A]] [[Touring car racing|Touring Car]] Regulations.\n\n==Season Summary==\nThe championship was won by [[Auckland]] ([[New Zealand]]) resident [[Robbie Francevic]] driving a [[Volvo Dealer Team]] [[Volvo 240T]], the first time the championship had been won by a non-Australian resident and the first ATCC won by a [[turbocharged]] car. Francevic, who won Rounds 1, 2 and 4, defeated [[George Fury]] driving a [[Nissan Skyline DR30 RS]] who won Rounds 3, 5, 7, 8 and 10 of the series. Francevic's wins in the opening two rounds at [[Amaroo Park]] and [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]] where when the [[Volvo]] team was still run by MPM, [[Mark Petch Motorsport]]. Following Francevic's Amaroo win, Petch and Bob Atkins, head of the Australian Volvo Dealer Council, announced the formation of the AVDT, Australian Volvo Dealer Team, and hired former HDT team manager John Sheppard to run the team on a day-to-day basis from Sheppard's Calder work shop. Contrary to what has been written in the past, Petch stayed involved as \"Team Principle\" until 10 July 1986, when he resigned over a disagreement with how Sheppard was managing the Team. The AVDT purchased MPM original 240T GpA car, and spares, which included a spare 240 GT body shell, which later became the basis for a new Australian built car, with all new parts and technical assistance from VMS. Francevic's [[1985 Australian Endurance Championship|1985 endurance]] co-driver and dual [[Australian Drivers' Championship|Australian Drivers' Champion]] [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]] joining the team full-time for his first ATCC campaign, in the team's new second car, a RHD car ex RAS in Belgium, which arrived just in time for the 4th round of the ATCC at Adelaide International Raceway, were Bowe qualified on pole, and lead the race before engine issue's forced his retirement. Bowe repeated his first Championship Pole position performance at the 5th round of the Champion at Barbagallo Raceway, only to have to retire again from a substantial lead with more engine issues. [[Peter Brock]] won round 6 at [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]] in his new for 1986 [[Holden VK Commodore SS Group A]] (his last ATCC win until [[1989 Australian Touring Car Championship|1989]] and the last race win by a [[Holden Commodore]] until his win in Round 1, Heat 1 of the [[1992 Australian Touring Car Championship|1992 ATCC]]) while defending champion [[Jim Richards (race driver)|Jim Richards]] could only manage one win in his [[JPS Team BMW]] [[BMW E24|635 CSi]], winning Round 9 at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]]. Richards had finished the race in second place behind Nissan team driver Gary Scott, but the Nissan was later disqualified for having oversize brake. Although the paperwork for the Nissan's new brakes had been put through, they had not yet been homologated which led to Scott's DQ.\n\nSeries regular [[Allan Grice]] missed the 1986 ATCC (he had also missed the [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985 championship]]) as he was racing his [[Roadways Racing|Les Small]] prepared Group A Commodore in the [[1986 European Touring Car Championship|1986 FIA Touring Car Championship]] ([[European Touring Car Championship|ETCC]]). Peter Brock missed some early rounds due to also racing his Commodore in Europe.\n\nWith the ATCC consisting of 10 rounds, many of the top level teams including the [[Holden Dealer Team]], [[Dick Johnson Racing]], JPS Team BMW and the [[Gibson Motorsport|Peter Jackson Nissan team]] all made loud noises during the year about the lack of prize money on offer for their efforts as the top drawing motorsport category in the country, especially as Group A racing had proven far more expensive than the old [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] regulations (Peter Brock estimated that his [[Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] winning Group C [[Holden VK Commodore|Commodore]] of [[1984 James Hardie 1000|1984]] had cost around [[Australian dollar|AU$]]36,000 to build while his 1986 Group A Commodore had cost around $200,000, a cost increase of around 550%), with teams and drivers often racing for as little as $1,500 for a round win. Part of the problem for the teams was that due to Australia's size and the vast distance between the major cities where the race tracks were located, the prize money on offer usually did not even cover their transportation costs, let alone the cost of building, maintaining and racing the cars. Pressure was being put on the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] (CAMS) to come up with a series sponsor for future championships or they would risk smaller and smaller grids. CAMS rectified this from [[1987 Australian Touring Car Championship|1987]] by signing a multi-year sponsorship deal with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] who would provide some $275,000 in prize money.\n\n==Teams and drivers==\n[[File:Mustangnelson.jpg|thumb|right|Lawrie Nelson's Ford Mustang]]The following drivers and teams competed in the 1986 [[Australian Touring Car Championship]].

It began on 2 March 1986 at [[Amaroo Park]] and ended on 13 July at [[Oran Park Raceway]] after ten rounds. This was the second ATCC to be run to the [[FIA]]'s international [[Group A]] [[Touring car racing|Touring Car]] Regulations.\n\n==Season Summary==\nThe championship was won by [[Auckland]] ([[New Zealand]]) resident [[Robbie Francevic]] driving a [[Volvo Dealer Team]] [[Volvo 240T]], the first time the championship had been won by a non-Australian resident and the first ATCC won by a [[turbocharged]] car. Francevic, who won Rounds 1, 2 and 4, defeated [[George Fury]] driving a [[Nissan Skyline DR30 RS]] who won Rounds 3, 5, 7, 8 and 10 of the series. Francevic's wins in the opening two rounds at [[Amaroo Park]] and [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]] where when the [[Volvo]] team was still run by MPM, [[Mark Petch Motorsport]]. Following Francevic's Amaroo win, Petch and Bob Atkins, head of the Australian Volvo Dealer Council, announced the formation of the AVDT, Australian Volvo Dealer Team, and hired former HDT team manager John Sheppard to run the team on a day-to-day basis from Sheppard's Calder work shop. Contrary to what has been written in the past, Petch stayed involved as \"Team Principle\" until 10 July 1986, when he resigned over a disagreement with how Sheppard was managing the Team. The AVDT purchased MPM original 240T GpA car, and spares, which included a spare 240 GT body shell, which later became the basis for a new Australian built car, with all new parts and technical assistance from VMS. Francevic's [[1985 Australian Endurance Championship|1985 endurance]] co-driver and dual [[Australian Drivers' Championship|Australian Drivers' Champion]] [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]] joining the team full-time for his first ATCC campaign, in the teams new second car, a RHD car ex RAS in Belgium, which arrived just in time for the 4th round of the ATCC at Adelaide International Raceway, were Bowe qualified on pole, and lead the race before engine issue's forced his retirement. Bowe repeated his first Championship Pole position performance at the 5th round of the Champion at Barbagallo Raceway, only to have to retire again from a substantial lead with more engine issues. [[Peter Brock]] won round 6 at [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]] in his new for 1986 [[Holden VK Commodore SS Group A]] (his last ATCC win until [[1989 Australian Touring Car Championship|1989]] and the last race win by a [[Holden Commodore]] until his win in Round 1, Heat 1 of the [[1992 Australian Touring Car Championship|1992 ATCC]]) while defending champion [[Jim Richards (race driver)|Jim Richards]] could only manage one win in his [[JPS Team BMW]] [[BMW E24|635 CSi]], winning Round 9 at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]]. Richards had finished the race in second place behind Nissan team driver Gary Scott, but the Nissan was later disqualified for having oversize brake. Although the paperwork for the Nissan's new brakes had been put through, they had not yet been homologated which led to Scott's DQ.\n\nSeries regular [[Allan Grice]] missed the 1986 ATCC (he had also missed the [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985 championship]]) as he was racing his [[Roadways Racing|Les Small]] prepared Group A Commodore in the [[1986 European Touring Car Championship|1986 FIA Touring Car Championship]] ([[European Touring Car Championship|ETCC]]). Peter Brock missed some early rounds due to also racing his Commodore in Europe.\n\nWith the ATCC consisting of 10 rounds, many of the top level teams including the [[Holden Dealer Team]], [[Dick Johnson Racing]], JPS Team BMW and the [[Gibson Motorsport|Peter Jackson Nissan team]] all made loud noises during the year about the lack of prize money on offer for their efforts as the top drawing motorsport category in the country, especially as Group A racing had proven far more expensive than the old [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] regulations (Peter Brock estimated that his [[Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] winning Group C [[Holden VK Commodore|Commodore]] of [[1984 James Hardie 1000|1984]] had cost around [[Australian dollar|AU$]]36,000 to build while his 1986 Group A Commodore had cost around $200,000, a cost increase of around 550%), with teams and drivers often racing for as little as $1,500 for a round win. Part of the problem for the teams was that due to Australia's size and the vast distance between the major cities where the race tracks were located, the prize money on offer usually did not even cover their transportation costs, let alone the cost of building, maintaining and racing the cars. Pressure was being put on the [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport]] (CAMS) to come up with a series sponsor for future championships or they would risk smaller and smaller grids. CAMS rectified this from [[1987 Australian Touring Car Championship|1987]] by signing a multi-year sponsorship deal with [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] who would provide some $275,000 in prize money.\n\n==Teams and drivers==\n[[File:Mustangnelson.jpg|thumb|right|Lawrie Nelson's Ford Mustang]]The following drivers and teams competed in the 1986 [[Australian Touring Car Championship]].

Since the mid-1990s there has been significant growth in passenger numbers on the railways and renewed government interest in the role of rail in UK transport. Some closed stations have reopened, and rail passenger services been restored on a few lines where they had been removed.\n\nSome former British Rail lines have become [[heritage railway]]s.\n\n== Completed reopenings ==\n[[File:A train on the Borders Railway.jpg|thumb|Reopened [[Borders Railway]] in Scotland]]\n[[File:Chorlton Metrolink station - 2011-07-16.jpg|thumb|Closed lines now converted to [[light rail]] operation for [[Manchester Metrolink]]]]\n[[File:Stagecoach Huntingdonshire 21224 AE09 GYU.jpg|thumb|Closed line converted into [[guided busway]] - the [[Cambridgeshire Guided Busway]]]]\n[[File:3717 'City of Truro' leaves 50 steps, GCRN.JPG|thumb|Closed line converted [[heritage railway]] at [[Great Central Railway (Nottingham)]]]]\n\n===London===\n* [[Snow Hill Tunnel (London)|Snow Hill tunnel]], south of [[Farringdon station]], was reopened for passengers in 1988 as part of [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]], providing a link between the [[Midland Main Line]] and the former [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] via [[Blackfriars station|London Blackfriars station]].\n*\n\n===South East===\n* [[Chiltern Main Line]] was redoubled in two stages between 1998 and 2002 between [[Princes Risborough railway station|Princes Risborough]] and [[Aynho Junction]]\n* The [[Eastleigh to Romsey Line|Romsey to Eastleigh link]] originally closed to regular passenger services in 1969 reopened in 2003 with the intermediate station at [[Chandler's Ford railway station|Chandler's Ford]] in [[Hampshire]] \n* Part of the [[London to Aylesbury Line]] was extended north along the former [[Great Central Main Line]] to a new station called [[Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station|Aylesbury Vale Parkway]], which opened in December 2008. As part of the East West Rail project, passenger services are to be restored to the section of line from Aylesbury Vale Parkway to as far [[Claydon LNE Junction]], providing direct services from Aylesbury to Milton Keynes and Bedford.\n\n===South West===\n\n* Stations reopened include [[Yate railway station|Yate]], [[Coaley Junction railway station|Cam and Dursley]], [[Ashchurch railway station|Ashchurch]], [[Pinhoe railway station|Pinhoe]], [[Feniton railway station|Feniton]] and [[Templecombe railway station|Templecombe]].\n* The service between Swindon and Trowbridge ceased in 1966 but two passenger trains each way were reinstated in 1985, along with the reopening of [[Melksham railway station|Melksham station]]. Passenger numbers rose rapidly, and the service \u2013 now increased in frequency and known as the [[TransWilts Line]] \u2013 was extended to Westbury.\n* Regular passenger services between Yeovil Junction and Yeovil Pen Mill were withdrawn in 1968 and a limited service reinstated in 2015 which has since slowly increased.\n\n===East Midlands===\n* The [[Robin Hood Line]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], between [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]] and [[Worksop railway station|Worksop]] via [[Mansfield railway station (England)|Mansfield]], reopened in the early 1990s.  Previously Mansfield had been the largest town in Britain without a rail link.\n* [[Peterborough to Lincoln Line|Lincoln to Peterborough line]]. The section between Peterborough and Spalding closed to passengers on 5 October 1970 and reopened on 7 June 1971.\n* North of [[Sleaford railway station|Sleaford]], [[Ruskington railway station|Ruskington station]] reopened on 5 May 1975 and [[Metheringham railway station|Metheringham Station]] reopened on 6 October 1975.\n* Stations at {{rws|Syston}}, {{rws|Sileby}} and {{rws|Barrow-upon-Soar}} between Leicester and Loughborough closed in 1968 reopened in 1994. \n* The [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]] to Melton Mowbray Line via [[Corby railway station|Corby]] and Oakham closed to passengers on 18 April 1966.

The memorial stands in [[West Potomac Park]] slightly off of [[Independence Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Independence Avenue]] in a grove of trees.  Authorized by an act of Congress on June 7, 1924, funds to construct the memorial were provided by the contributions of both organizations and individual citizens of the District.  Construction of the memorial began in the spring of 1931, and the memorial was dedicated by President [[Herbert Hoover]] on November 11, 1931 ([[Armistice Day]]).  It was the first war memorial to be erected in West Potomac Park, part of the National Mall near the Lincoln Memorial, and remains the only local District memorial on the National Mall.\n\nDesigned by Washington architect Frederick H. Brooke, with Horace W. Peaslee and [[Nathan C. Wyeth]] as associate architects, the District of Columbia War Memorial is in the form of a 47-foot (14.3 m) tall circular, domed, [[peristyle]] [[Doric order|Doric]] temple.  Resting on concrete foundations, the 4 foot (1.2 m) high marble base defines a platform, 43 feet 5&nbsp;inches (13.2 m) in diameter, intended for use as a bandstand.  Preserved in the cornerstone of the District of Columbia World War Memorial is a list of 26,000 Washingtonians who served in the Great War.  Inscribed on the base are the names of the 499 District of Columbia citizens who lost their lives in the war, together with medallions representing the branches of the armed forces.  Twelve 22-foot (6.7 m) tall fluted Doric marble columns support the entablature and dome.\n\nIn September 2008,  Rep.

When breaking into the first team under former manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] he was often used as a midfielder. It was with a performance in central midfield during Tottenham's 2\u20131 win over Liverpool in November 2000 that he established himself as a regular in the Spurs side.

Then after breaking his metatarsal again, he did not feature for Spurs from Boxing Day until the [[UEFA Cup]] quarter-final clash with [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in mid-April. Spurs played 59 games in all competitions that season, but King featured in less than half of them. Tottenham only managed 3 clean sheets against top flight opposition without King in the side. In a [[Premier League]] clash with reigning champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[White Hart Lane]], Spurs went on to win the game 2\u20131, meaning King had captained Tottenham to their first league win over Chelsea since 1990, and the first at White Hart Lane since 1987.\n\nKing underwent surgery in the summer, meaning he would miss the start of the season. Manager [[Martin Jol]] had been sacked and replaced by [[Juande Ramos]]. But on [[Boxing Day]] 2007, King made a surprise return to the starting line-up against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], playing 73 minutes before being replaced by [[Adel Taarabt]]. He appeared sporadically for the rest of the season, but captained Tottenham to a 2\u20131 victory over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2008 Football League Cup Final|2008 League Cup final]], the first major honour of his career.\n\nOn 3 April 2008, it was announced that he would be rested for the remainder of the season, Spurs having been knocked out of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and unable to qualify for the Champions League through the League.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7329238.stm |title=King to miss rest of Spurs season |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 April 2008 |accessdate=13 September 2009}}</ref> King had featured in just 10 games all season, with just four Premiership games under his belt.\n\nOn 12 August 2008, King picked up the trophy for the cleanest team in the Premier league for the season. He received the award at the 'Get on with the Game' programme which was shown on [[Sky Sports News]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIt became clear at the start of the 2008\u201309 season that King's injury problems meant that he could not play in every game. Ramos picked him in all five of the cup games he managed the club for that season, but only two of the eight league games. With Spurs rooted to the bottom of the league, having picked up just 2 points from those 8 games, Ramos was sacked and replaced by [[Harry Redknapp]], who chose to prioritise the league and only play King in those games. On 26 October 2008, King made his 200th league appearance for Tottenham Hotspur as they defeated [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 2\u20130. He captained the club in the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]] yet again, this time against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], keeping a clean sheet after 120 minutes of play, but Tottenham lost on penalties.\n\nHarry Redknapp said of King's knee injury:\n\n<blockquote>\"There's no cure. There's no cartilage, nothing to operate on. It's just bone on bone. So it's just a question of managing it. It swells up after games and it normally takes seven days to recover but having played on Monday night he's had less time than usual. He rarely trains, he mostly just goes to the gym to keep himself ticking over. But not running or anything like that.

Exactly three weeks later, on 5 May 2010 King captained Tottenham to a 1\u20130 away victory at Manchester City, thus guaranteeing Tottenham's highest ever finish in the Premier League and securing entry into the qualification round of the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time. King had been a major doubt for the match having played against Bolton just 4 days earlier, however his performance in this game and many other games in early 2010 look to have secured his place in [[Fabio Capello]]'s England squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa. On 16 May 2010 it was reported that King had signed a new two-year contract extension with Spurs which would keep him at the club until 2012. It was rumoured that King had been released by Tottenham after The [[Premier League]] released a list of players who would not be staying at their clubs; with King included on the list.

He attended the Blessed John Roche RC School, which is now closed. King joined Tottenham as a trainee in July 1996 and progressed through the [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.

When breaking into the first team under former manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] he was often used as a midfielder. It was with a performance in central midfield during Tottenham's 2\u20131 win over Liverpool in November 2000 that he established himself as a regular in the Spurs side.

Then after breaking his metatarsal again, he did not feature for Spurs from Boxing Day until the [[UEFA Cup]] quarter-final clash with [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] in mid-April. Spurs played 59 games in all competitions that season, but King featured in less than half of them. Tottenham only managed 3 clean sheets against top flight opposition without King in the side. In a [[Premier League]] clash with reigning champions [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[White Hart Lane]], Spurs went on to win the game 2\u20131, meaning King had captained Tottenham to their first league win over Chelsea since 1990, and the first at White Hart Lane since 1987.\n\nKing underwent surgery in the summer, meaning he would miss the start of the season. Manager [[Martin Jol]] had been sacked and replaced by [[Juande Ramos]]. But on [[Boxing Day]] 2007, King made a surprise return to the starting line-up against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]], playing 73 minutes before being replaced by [[Adel Taarabt]]. He appeared sporadically for the rest of the season, but captained Tottenham to a 2\u20131 victory over [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the [[2008 Football League Cup Final|2008 League Cup final]], the first major honour of his career.\n\nOn 3 April 2008, it was announced that he would be rested for the remainder of the season, Spurs having been knocked out of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup and unable to qualify for the Champions League through the League.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/7329238.stm |title=King to miss rest of Spurs season |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 April 2008 |accessdate=13 September 2009}}</ref> King had featured in just 10 games all season, with just four Premiership games under his belt.\n\nOn 12 August 2008, King picked up the trophy for the cleanest team in the Premier league for the season. He received the award at the 'Get on with the Game' programme which was shown on [[Sky Sports News]]. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIt became clear at the start of the 2008\u201309 season that King's injury problems meant that he could not play in every game. Ramos picked him in all five of the cup games he managed the club for that season, but only two of the eight league games. With Spurs rooted to the bottom of the league, having picked up just 2 points from those 8 games, Ramos was sacked and replaced by [[Harry Redknapp]], who chose to prioritise the league and only play King in those games. On 26 October 2008, King made his 200th league appearance for Tottenham Hotspur as they defeated [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 2\u20130. He captained the club in the [[2009 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]] yet again, this time against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], keeping a clean sheet after 120 minutes of play, but Tottenham lost on penalties.\n\nHarry Redknapp said of King's knee injury:\n\n<blockquote>\"There's no cure. There's no cartilage, nothing to operate on. It's just bone on bone. So it's just a question of managing it. It swells up after games and it normally takes seven days to recover but having played on Monday night he's had less time than usual. He rarely trains, he mostly just goes to the gym to keep himself ticking over. But not running or anything like that. But even if he only plays 20 games a season, he's worth having because he's so good we have a much better chance of winning.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/dec/12/tottenham-hotspur-harry-redknapp |title=Spurs hope King can swing balance against United |publisher=guardian.co.uk |author=Paul Doyle |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=13 September 2009 |location=London}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nKing won his first game ever against Arsenal in the league on 14 April 2010, with a 2\u20131 win, of which he played 90 minutes. Exactly three weeks later, on 5 May 2010 King captained Tottenham to a 1\u20130 away victory at Manchester City, thus guaranteeing Tottenham's highest ever finish in the Premier League and securing entry into the qualification round of the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time. King had been a major doubt for the match having played against Bolton just 4 days earlier, however his performance in this game and many other games in early 2010 look to have secured his place in [[Fabio Capello]]'s England squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in South Africa. On 16 May 2010 it was reported that King had signed a new two-year contract extension with Spurs which would keep him at the club until 2012. It was rumoured that King had been released by Tottenham after The [[Premier League]] released a list of players who would not be staying at their clubs; with King included on the list.
