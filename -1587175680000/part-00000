In 1905, the first building was erected and various courses in trades were introduced. In 1929, a variety of new skills and trades in the curriculum were added, marking the beginning of a revolutionary change to address the needs and aspirations of the nation.\n\nIn 1960, the school changed its main focus as an artisan-oriented institution. The impetus of growth and dynamism in the 1970s and 1980s led to the establishment of two new schools of the [[Commercial Training Institute and Technician Training School]].

In 1905, the first building was erected and various courses in trades were introduced. In 1929, a variety of new skills and trades in the curriculum were added, marking the beginning of a revolutionary change to address the needs and aspirations of the nation.\n\nIn 1960, the school changed its main focus as an artisan-oriented institution. The impetus of growth and dynamism in the 1970s and 1980s led to the establishment of two new schools of the [[Commercial Training Institute and Technician Training School]]. In 1991, the three schools were merged. This amalgamation came to be known as Lerotholi Polytechnic (LP).

The said law institution continues to be the one of the oldest state college of law in the country.<ref name=\"Mariano\"/>\n\nThe ratification of the [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]] paved the way for the establishment of law programs in various private colleges and universities in Manila (schools, at that time, were required to acquire license to operate from the [[Department of Public Instruction]]). At that time, there was hardly any kind of supervision of law schools, especially for private institutions. The [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty of Civil Law]] of the [[University of Santo Tomas]], the [[University of the Philippines College of Law|University of the Philippines\u2013College of Law]], the former Colegio de Ateneo de Manila and the [[Philippine Law School]] were the leading law institutions during those period.

Its office is located at the fourth floor of the IBP Building in Ortigas Center.\n\n== Legal systems==\nThe Philippine legal system is an amalgamation of the world's major systems. These systems include [[Roman law|Roman]] [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] which was inherited from Spain; the [[Law of the United States|Anglo-American]] [[common law]] which were derived from the laws of the United States; and [[Islamic law]], otherwise known as the [[Sharia law]], of the Muslim world. [[Private law]] and [[Philippine legal codes|legal codes]] are substantially patterned after the civil law of Spain, while [[public law]], including [[political law]], is based on the Anglo-American legal system.\n\n==Law degree programs==\nLaw degree programs are considered professional/post-baccalaureate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a [[bachelor's degree]], with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas. Completion of a required course from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement in order to take the [[Philippine Bar Examination]], the national licensure examination as precursor to admission to the practice of law in the country.\n\nLegal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:\n* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)\n* Law school (usually 4 years)\n* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)\n* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education\n\nLaw degrees in the Philippines may be classified into three types\u2014professional, graduate level and honorary.\n\n===Professional law degrees===\nIn order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete the [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) program, which may be either the non-thesis or thesis course. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines.\n\n*'''[[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.)''' \u2013 The LL.B. was the most common law degree offered and conferred by Philippine law schools. It was a standard four-year law program covering all bar exam subjects. Almost all law schools followed a standard LL.B. curriculum, wherein students are exposed to the required bar subjects. Other schools, like the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]], allow students to substitute electives for bar review subjects offered in the fourth year of study.<ref name=\"Law Schools 2006\">Curriculum models, ''Philippine Association of Law Schools'', 2006.</ref>  In December 2018, as mandated by LEB, the LL.B. program was phased out and was migrated to the J.D. non-thesis program; such migration applied retroactively to LL.B. degree holders, meaning all LL.B. degree holders were also conferred of the new migrated degree.\n*'''[[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.)''' - The J.D. degree was developed and first conferred in the Philippines by the [[Ateneo Law School]] in 1991. The J.D. program is a four-year law program. Like the standard LL.B. program, the J.D. curriculum covers the core subjects required for the bar examinations. Unlike the LL.B., the Ateneo J.D. program requires students to finish the core bar subjects in 2{{sfrac|1|2}} years, take elective subjects, undergo an apprenticeship, and prepare and defend a thesis.<ref name=\"clv1\">{{cite web |url=http://ateneolaw.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=93&PHPSESSID=3de3cb420701c7a80495dc7f3ea2679c |title=Philippine Leadership Crisis and the J.D.

It was introduced and is so far offered only by the La Salle-FEU MBA-JD Program, a consortium of [[Far Eastern University Institute of Law]] and [[De La Salle Professional Schools|De La Salle Graduate School of Business]]. Under this program, the requirements of the J.D. and M.B.A. programs are satisfied by the taking of concurrent units of study, allowing students to complete the program in five instead of six years.<ref name=\"Law Schools 2006\"/>\n\n===Graduate law degrees===\nBeyond the J.D. or LL.B., members of the Philippine bar have the option of pursuing graduate degrees in law.\n\n*'''[[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.)''' \u2013 The LL.M. is a graduate law degree offered to holders of basic law degrees (LL.B. and J.D.). It is generally offered to law graduates and lawyers of any nationality. Six Philippine law schools so far conduct the program\u2014the [[Ateneo Law School]], which offers an International Master of Laws program; the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]], which first offered the LL.M.; San Sebastian College - Recoletos Graduate School of Law; [[University of Manila]] College of Law; [[Manuel L. Quezon University]] College of Law; [[Central Philippine University College of Law]] in Consortium with [[San Beda College]]; [[San Beda College of Law|San Beda Graduate School of Law]]; and [[PLM Graduate School of Law]] of the ''Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila'' (University of the City of Manila). LL.M. programs were once offered by  the [[Far Eastern University Institute of Law]], the Escuela de Derecho de Manila (now Manila Law College Foundation), and the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]] but were eventually phased out due to lack of enrollment and funding.<ref name=\"Law Schools 2006\"/>\n*'''[[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.)''' \u2013 The D.C.L. program is a doctoral program in law offered to holders of the LL.M. degree. Candidates who hold only LL.B. degrees may be admitted upon completion of prerequisite LL.M. subjects. The D.C.L. was pioneered by the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]]. Their program structure is highly similar to the D.C.L. offered in the [[Complutense University of Madrid]].<ref>Official Prospectus, Law Department, ''University of Santo Tomas Graduate School'', 2006.</ref> The [[PLM Graduate School of Law]] has already opened its own D.C.L. program.<ref>List of programs, ''Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila'' (University of the City of Manila), 2007.</ref>\n*'''Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D. or J.S.D.)''' \u2013 The S.J.D. or J.S.D. program is currently offered only by the San Beda Graduate School of Law.  While the candidate for the degree is required some academic units, the grant of the degree relies on the candidates research output as well as his or her participation in international symposia, seminars and programs as lecturer, panel presenter or paper presenter. The candidate presents a doctoral dissertation that is argued before a Panel of Oral Examiners and then delivers a 'lectio coram' -- a lecture in the presence of legal luminaries.\n\n===Honorary law degrees===\nSome Philippine universities also confer the [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] (LL.D.) degree. It is given to famous individuals who, in the discretion of the awarding institution, were found to have made significant contributions to a certain field, or to the improvement of society or development of the conditions of mankind in general.\n\n===Ecclesiastical law degrees===\nA few [[Roman Catholic]] seminaries and graduate schools offer degree programs in [[canon law]], an ecclesiastical program that is not required in the [[Philippine Bar Examination]]s. The [[University of Santo Tomas Faculties of Ecclesiastical Studies|University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law]] runs the oldest academic programs of this kind. Its '''[[Licentiate of Canon Law]] (J.C.L.)''' and '''[[Doctor of Canon Law]] (J.C.D.)''' programs are open to priests, nuns, theologians, and even to lay people (i.e., trial court judges, law deans, family lawyers etc.). Judges of the Roman Catholic Marriage Tribunal typically hold academic degrees in the field.<ref>Official prospectus, ''University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law'', 2006.</ref> Degrees in canon law, strictly speaking, are not considered law degrees in the Philippines.\n\n===Developments===\nThere is a move among members of the Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS) to convert their LL.B. programs into J.D. curricula.<ref name=\"clv1\"/> There are currently two possible directions for the change: First, the conversion of LL.B. programs through adopting a model substantially similar to the J.D. curriculum introduced by the Ateneo de Manila Law School (the J.D. Programs of the FEU-La Salle consortium and the University of Batangas Law School are of this mold), and second, simply changing the name of the degree conferred from \"LL.B.\" to \"J.D.\" while essentially retaining the same course offerings as those in the DECS Model Law Curriculum (DECS Order No. 27, series of 1989).<ref name=\"clv1\"/>\n\n==Admission to the practice of law==\nThe 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] has given the Supreme Court the sole power to admit individuals to the practice of law in the [[Philippines]].<ref>Section 5, Article VIII, The Philippine Constitution, 1987.</ref> This power is exercised through a Bar Examination Committee, an ad hoc academic group tasked to formulate questions, administer proceedings, grade examinations, rank candidates, and release the results of the Philippine Bar Examination.\n\nTo be eligible to take the national bar exam, a candidate must be a Filipino citizen, at least twenty-one years of age, and holder of a bachelor's degree and a law degree obtained from a government recognized law school in the Philippines. Graduates of law schools from other countries must obtain a law degree from the Philippines to qualify for the Philippine Bar.<ref>Section 2, 5-6; Rule 138, Revised Rules of Court.</ref> In March 2010 the Supreme court issued Bar matter 1153 allowing Filipino who are foreign law graduates to take the Bar exam provided that applicant complies with the following conditions: \n# completion of all courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent degree; \n# recognition or accreditation of the law school by the proper authority; \n# completion of all fourth year subjects in the Bachelor of Laws academic program in a law school duly recognized by the Philippine Government; and\n# must have completed a separate bachelor's degree.\"\n\n===Bar examinations===\n{{See also|Philippine Bar Examination}}\nThe [[Philippine Bar Examination]]s is the national licensure exam for admission to the practice of law. It is conducted during the four Sundays of September, or October, or November of every year.

The said law institution continues to be the one of the oldest state college of law in the country.<ref name=\"Mariano\"/>\n\nThe ratification of the [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]] paved the way for the establishment of law programs in various private colleges and universities in Manila (schools, at that time, were required to acquire license to operate from the [[Department of Public Instruction]]). At that time, there was hardly any kind of supervision of law schools, especially for private institutions. The [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty of Civil Law]] of the [[University of Santo Tomas]], the [[University of the Philippines College of Law|University of the Philippines\u2013College of Law]], the former Colegio de Ateneo de Manila and the [[Philippine Law School]] were the leading law institutions during those period.

Its office is located at the fourth floor of the IBP Building in Ortigas Center.\n\n== Legal systems==\nThe Philippine legal system is an amalgamation of the world's major systems. These systems include [[Roman law|Roman]] [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] which was inherited from Spain; the [[Law of the United States|Anglo-American]] [[common law]] which were derived from the laws of the United States; and [[Islamic law]], otherwise known as the [[Sharia law]], of the Muslim world. [[Private law]] and [[Philippine legal codes|legal codes]] are substantially patterned after the civil law of Spain, while [[public law]], including [[political law]], is based on the Anglo-American legal system.\n\n==Law degree programs==\nLaw degree programs are considered professional/post-baccalaureate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a [[bachelor's degree]], with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas. Completion of a required course from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement in order to take the [[Philippine Bar Examination]], the national licensure examination as precursor to admission to the practice of law in the country.\n\nLegal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:\n* Undergraduate education (usually 4 years)\n* Law school (usually 4 years)\n* Admission to the bar (usually by taking a Philippine bar exam)\n* Legal practice and mandatory continuing legal education\n\nLaw degrees in the Philippines may be classified into three types\u2014professional, graduate level and honorary.\n\n===Professional law degrees===\nIn order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete the [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) program, which may be either the non-thesis or thesis course. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines.\n\n*'''[[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.)''' \u2013 The LL.B. was the most common law degree offered and conferred by Philippine law schools. It was a standard four-year law program covering all bar exam subjects. Almost all law schools followed a standard LL.B. curriculum, wherein students are exposed to the required bar subjects. Other schools, like the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]], allow students to substitute electives for bar review subjects offered in the fourth year of study.<ref name=\"Law Schools 2006\">Curriculum models, ''Philippine Association of Law Schools'', 2006.</ref>  In December 2018, as mandated by LEB, the LL.B. program was phased out and was migrated to the J.D. non-thesis program; such migration applied retroactively to LL.B. degree holders, meaning all LL.B. degree holders were also conferred of the new migrated degree.\n*'''[[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.)''' - The J.D. degree was developed and first conferred in the Philippines by the [[Ateneo Law School]] in 1991. The J.D. program is a four-year law program. Like the standard LL.B. program, the J.D. curriculum covers the core subjects required for the bar examinations. Unlike the LL.B., the Ateneo J.D. program requires students to finish the core bar subjects in 2{{sfrac|1|2}} years, take elective subjects, undergo an apprenticeship, and prepare and defend a thesis.<ref name=\"clv1\">{{cite web |url=http://ateneolaw.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=93&PHPSESSID=3de3cb420701c7a80495dc7f3ea2679c |title=Philippine Leadership Crisis and the J.D.

It was introduced and is so far offered only by the La Salle-FEU MBA-JD Program, a consortium of [[Far Eastern University Institute of Law]] and [[De La Salle Professional Schools|De La Salle Graduate School of Business]]. Under this program, the requirements of the J.D. and M.B.A. programs are satisfied by the taking of concurrent units of study, allowing students to complete the program in five instead of six years.<ref name=\"Law Schools 2006\"/>\n\n===Graduate law degrees===\nBeyond the J.D. or LL.B., members of the Philippine bar have the option of pursuing graduate degrees in law.\n\n*'''[[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.)''' \u2013 The LL.M. is a graduate law degree offered to holders of basic law degrees (LL.B. and J.D.). It is generally offered to law graduates and lawyers of any nationality. Six Philippine law schools so far conduct the program\u2014the [[Ateneo Law School]], which offers an International Master of Laws program; the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]], which first offered the LL.M.; San Sebastian College - Recoletos Graduate School of Law; [[University of Manila]] College of Law; [[Manuel L. Quezon University]] College of Law; [[Central Philippine University College of Law]] in Consortium with [[San Beda College]]; [[San Beda College of Law|San Beda Graduate School of Law]]; and [[PLM Graduate School of Law]] of the ''Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila'' (University of the City of Manila). LL.M. programs were once offered by  the [[Far Eastern University Institute of Law]], the Escuela de Derecho de Manila (now Manila Law College Foundation), and the [[University of the Philippines College of Law]] but were eventually phased out due to lack of enrollment and funding.<ref name=\"Law Schools 2006\"/>\n*'''[[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.)''' \u2013 The D.C.L. program is a doctoral program in law offered to holders of the LL.M. degree. Candidates who hold only LL.B. degrees may be admitted upon completion of prerequisite LL.M. subjects. The D.C.L. was pioneered by the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law]]. Their program structure is highly similar to the D.C.L. offered in the [[Complutense University of Madrid]].<ref>Official Prospectus, Law Department, ''University of Santo Tomas Graduate School'', 2006.</ref> The [[PLM Graduate School of Law]] has already opened its own D.C.L. program.<ref>List of programs, ''Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila'' (University of the City of Manila), 2007.</ref>\n*'''Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D. or J.S.D.)''' \u2013 The S.J.D. or J.S.D. program is currently offered only by the San Beda Graduate School of Law.  While the candidate for the degree is required some academic units, the grant of the degree relies on the candidates research output as well as his or her participation in international symposia, seminars and programs as lecturer, panel presenter or paper presenter. The candidate presents a doctoral dissertation that is argued before a Panel of Oral Examiners and then delivers a 'lectio coram' -- a lecture in the presence of legal luminaries.\n\n===Honorary law degrees===\nSome Philippine universities also confer the [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Laws]] (LL.D.) degree. It is given to famous individuals who, in the discretion of the awarding institution, were found to have made significant contributions to a certain field, or to the improvement of society or development of the conditions of mankind in general.\n\n===Ecclesiastical law degrees===\nA few [[Roman Catholic]] seminaries and graduate schools offer degree programs in [[canon law]], an ecclesiastical program that is not required in the [[Philippine Bar Examination]]s. The [[University of Santo Tomas Faculties of Ecclesiastical Studies|University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law]] runs the oldest academic programs of this kind. Its '''[[Licentiate of Canon Law]] (J.C.L.)''' and '''[[Doctor of Canon Law]] (J.C.D.)''' programs are open to priests, nuns, theologians, and even to lay people (i.e., trial court judges, law deans, family lawyers etc.). Judges of the Roman Catholic Marriage Tribunal typically hold academic degrees in the field.<ref>Official prospectus, ''University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law'', 2006.</ref> Degrees in canon law, strictly speaking, are not considered law degrees in the Philippines.\n\n===Developments===\nThere is a move among members of the Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS) to convert their LL.B. programs into J.D. curricula.<ref name=\"clv1\"/> There are currently two possible directions for the change: First, the conversion of LL.B. programs through adopting a model substantially similar to the J.D. curriculum introduced by the Ateneo de Manila Law School (the J.D. Programs of the FEU-La Salle consortium and the University of Batangas Law School are of this mold), and second, simply changing the name of the degree conferred from \"LL.B.\" to \"J.D.\" while essentially retaining the same course offerings as those in the DECS Model Law Curriculum (DECS Order No. 27, series of 1989).<ref name=\"clv1\"/>\n\n==Admission to the practice of law==\nThe 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] has given the Supreme Court the sole power to admit individuals to the practice of law in the [[Philippines]].<ref>Section 5, Article VIII, The Philippine Constitution, 1987.</ref> This power is exercised through a Bar Examination Committee, an ad hoc academic group tasked to formulate questions, administer proceedings, grade examinations, rank candidates, and release the results of the Philippine Bar Examination.\n\nTo be eligible to take the national bar exam, a candidate must be a Filipino citizen, at least twenty-one years of age, and holder of a bachelor's degree and a law degree obtained from a government recognized law school in the Philippines. Graduates of law schools from other countries must obtain a law degree from the Philippines to qualify for the Philippine Bar.<ref>Section 2, 5-6; Rule 138, Revised Rules of Court.</ref> In March 2010 the Supreme court issued Bar matter 1153 allowing Filipino who are foreign law graduates to take the Bar exam provided that applicant complies with the following conditions: \n# completion of all courses leading to the degree of Bachelor of Laws or its equivalent degree; \n# recognition or accreditation of the law school by the proper authority; \n# completion of all fourth year subjects in the Bachelor of Laws academic program in a law school duly recognized by the Philippine Government; and\n# must have completed a separate bachelor's degree.\"\n\n===Bar examinations===\n{{See also|Philippine Bar Examination}}\nThe [[Philippine Bar Examination]]s is the national licensure exam for admission to the practice of law. It is conducted during the four Sundays of September, or October, or November of every year. It is arguably the hardest and the most media-covered of all government licensure examinations in the country.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Alexander L.
