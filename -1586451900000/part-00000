Thus, Hanai and Oki have the role of substitute pitchers, while the substitute catcher is Tajima. At the end of practice, the team unanimously voted for Hanai to become captain, and Abe and Sakaeguchi become vice-captains. With finals coming up, the team decides to study altogether to make sure that everyone passes. Taking this opportunity in the guise of studying, Mihashi invites everyone to come to his house on his birthday.

Only Mihashi and Tajima wrote winning the championship because the rest of the team lacked the resolve after losing their last game.  Hanai asks Mihashi to explain what he wrote but Mihashi felt insecure about his reasoning, and says he didn't give it much thought.  Abe sends Mihashi a text after practice is over to reply immediately so they could talk.  The manager admits to Mihashi that she saw his text, and suggests visiting Abe instead.  Tajima and another teammate offer to go with Mihashi. Abe's little brother greets them, excited to recognize Tajima.  Abe believes his knee will just barely recover in time for the newcomers tournament.  Waiting for their food to arrive, Abe's little brother drags Tajima off to have him teach him some pointers.  Abe apologizes to Mihashi when they are alone for getting injured and breaking his promise to catch all his games, and for telling him in the beginning to never shake off his signs.  Mihashi tells Abe about his happiness at feeling like he was relied on by Tajima in his last game when he shook off a sign for the first time, because he felt as if he was being relied on.  He asks Abe to rely on him as well, and Abe agrees.  Mihashi smiles, which shocks Abe, who hadn't seen Mihashi smile yet. Mihashi hands over the practice notes to Abe, who is surprised at Mihashi's goal of \"Koushien Champions.\"  Abe states he will state the same goal. After they eat, Mihashi and Tajima leave. On the way back, Mihashi gets a text from Kanou stating Mihoshi lost their game. Mihashi is fired up, and firmly states to Tajima that he wants to accomplish a national conquest at Koushien.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 14/12.5\n| Title           = Extra\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2011|1|}}\n| ShortSummary    = An extra included in the last DVD collection that takes place before the last episode.\n}}\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Big Windup! characters]]\n* [[List of \u014ckiku Furikabutte chapters]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.oofuri.com/episode/index.html|title=Official website listing of TV episodes from \u014ckiku Furikabutte ~Natsu no Taikai-hen~|publisher=[[A-1 Pictures]]|accessdate=2011-01-21|language=Japanese}}\n{{refend}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime episodes|Big Windup!]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Big Windup!'' episodes}}\n[[File:BigWindupVolume1DVD.jpg|thumb|''Big Windup!'' volume one DVD cover by [[Funimation Entertainment|Funimation]].]]\nThis is a list episodes for the Japanese anime series, ''[[Big Windup!]]''.

Bijou's Kashima is replaced by Takenouchi as pitcher. Moriya replaces Takenouchi in left field. Nishihiro, the reserve player, gets the last at-bat with two outs, but strikes out and the game ends with the ninth inning (4-1). Nishiura loses 11-6.  Although they've lost, Momoe tells them to look forward to the Newcomers Tournament and the Fall Tournament.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 13\n| Title               = We Start Again\n| TranslitTitle       = Mata Hajimaru\n| NativeTitle         = \u307e\u305f\u59cb\u307e\u308b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2010|6|24}}\n| ShortSummary        = The newcomers tournament begins in two weeks.  Captain Hanai suggests the team set goals for themselves. Everyone desires to go to Koushien, but the team lacks a consensus on how far they aim to go in the tournament.  Only Mihashi and Tajima wrote winning the championship because the rest of the team lacked the resolve after losing their last game.  Hanai asks Mihashi to explain what he wrote but Mihashi felt insecure about his reasoning, and says he didn't give it much thought.  Abe sends Mihashi a text after practice is over to reply immediately so they could talk.  The manager admits to Mihashi that she saw his text, and suggests visiting Abe instead.  Tajima and another teammate offer to go with Mihashi. Abe's little brother greets them, excited to recognize Tajima.  Abe believes his knee will just barely recover in time for the newcomers tournament.  Waiting for their food to arrive, Abe's little brother drags Tajima off to have him teach him some pointers.  Abe apologizes to Mihashi when they are alone for getting injured and breaking his promise to catch all his games, and for telling him in the beginning to never shake off his signs.  Mihashi tells Abe about his happiness at feeling like he was relied on by Tajima in his last game when he shook off a sign for the first time, because he felt as if he was being relied on.  He asks Abe to rely on him as well, and Abe agrees.  Mihashi smiles, which shocks Abe, who hadn't seen Mihashi smile yet. Mihashi hands over the practice notes to Abe, who is surprised at Mihashi's goal of \"Koushien Champions.\"  Abe states he will state the same goal. After they eat, Mihashi and Tajima leave. On the way back, Mihashi gets a text from Kanou stating Mihoshi lost their game. Mihashi is fired up, and firmly states to Tajima that he wants to accomplish a national conquest at Koushien.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 14/12.5\n| Title           = Extra\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2011|1|}}\n| ShortSummary    = An extra included in the last DVD collection that takes place before the last episode.\n}}\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Big Windup! characters]]\n* [[List of \u014ckiku Furikabutte chapters]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.oofuri.com/episode/index.html|title=Official website listing of TV episodes from \u014ckiku Furikabutte ~Natsu no Taikai-hen~|publisher=[[A-1 Pictures]]|accessdate=2011-01-21|language=Japanese}}\n{{refend}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime episodes|Big Windup!]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Big_Windup!_episodes"}

If we take 6000&nbsp;K for the temperature of the sun and 300&nbsp;K for ambient conditions on earth, this comes to 95%. In 1981, Alexis de Vos and Herman Pauwels showed that this is achievable with a stack of an infinite number of cells with band gaps ranging from infinity (the first cells encountered by the incoming photons) to zero, with a voltage in each cell very close to the open-circuit voltage, equal to 95% of the band gap of that cell, and with 6000&nbsp;K [[blackbody radiation]] coming from all directions. However, the 95% efficiency thereby achieved means that the electric power is 95% of the '''''net''''' amount of light absorbed \u2013 the stack '''''emits''''' radiation as it has non-zero temperature, and this radiation has to be subtracted from the incoming radiation when calculating the amount of heat being transferred and the efficiency. They also considered the more relevant problem of maximizing the power output for a stack being illuminated from all directions by 6000&nbsp;K blackbody radiation. In this case, the voltages must be lowered to less than 95% of the band gap (the percentage is not constant over all the cells). The maximum theoretical efficiency calculated is 86.8% for a stack of an infinite number of cells, using the incoming concentrated sunlight radiation.<ref name=Vos80>A.

Photons with an energy below the band gap of the absorber material cannot generate an [[Theory of solar cells#Photogeneration of charge carriers|electron-hole pair]], so their energy is not converted to useful output, and only generates heat if absorbed. For photons with an energy above the band gap energy, only a fraction of the energy above the band gap can be converted to useful output. When a photon of greater energy is absorbed, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to kinetic energy of the carrier combination. The excess kinetic energy is converted to heat through [[phonon]] interactions as the kinetic energy of the carriers slows to equilibrium velocity. Traditional single-junction cells with an optimal [[band gap]] for the solar spectrum have a maximum theoretical efficiency of 33.16%, the [[Shockley\u2013Queisser limit]] .<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Tabulated Values of the Shockley\u2013Queisser Limit for Single Junction Solar Cells|journal = Solar Energy|date = 2016-02-08|pages = 139\u2013147|volume = 130|doi = 10.1016/j.solener.2016.02.015 |language = EN|first = Sven|last = R\u00fchle|bibcode = 2016SoEn..130..139R}}</ref>\n\nSolar cells with multiple band gap absorber materials improve efficiency by dividing the solar spectrum into smaller bins where the thermodynamic efficiency limit is higher for each bin.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Limiting efficiencies for multiple energy-gap quantum devices|author1=Cheng-Hsiao Wu  |author2=Richard Williams |lastauthoramp=yes |doi=10.1063/1.331859|journal=J.

One of the carriers may reach the p\u2013n junction and contribute to the current produced by the solar cell; such a carrier is said to be ''collected''. Or, the carriers [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with no net contribution to cell current.\n\nQuantum efficiency refers to the percentage of photons that are converted to electric current (i.e., collected carriers) when the cell is operated under short circuit conditions. The \"external\" quantum efficiency of a [[silicon]] solar cell includes the effect of optical losses such as transmission and reflection.\n\nIn particular, some measures can be taken to reduce these losses. The reflection losses, which can account for up to 10% of the total incident energy, can be dramatically decreased using a technique called texturization, a light trapping method that modifies the average light path.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0927-0248(92)90126-A | volume=26 | issue=1\u20132 | title=The surface texturization of solar cells: A new method using V-grooves with controllable sidewall angles | journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells | pages=71\u201378| date=March 1992 | last1=Verlinden | first1=Pierre | last2=Evrard | first2=Olivier | last3=Mazy | first3=Emmanuel | last4=Crahay | first4=Andr\u00e9 }}</ref>\n\nQuantum efficiency is most usefully expressed as a ''spectral'' measurement (that is, as a function of photon wavelength or energy). Since some wavelengths are absorbed more effectively than others, spectral measurements of quantum efficiency can yield valuable information about the quality of the semiconductor bulk and surfaces. Quantum efficiency alone is not the same as overall energy conversion efficiency, as it does not convey information about the fraction of power that is converted by the solar cell.\n\n===Maximum power point===\nA solar cell may operate over a wide range of [[voltage]]s (V) and [[current (electricity)|currents]] (I). By increasing the resistive load on an irradiated cell continuously from zero (a ''[[short circuit]]'') to a very high value (an ''open circuit'') one can determine the [[maximum power theorem|maximum power]] point, the point that maximizes V&times;I; that is, the load for which the cell can deliver maximum electrical power at that level of irradiation. (The output power is zero in both the short circuit and open circuit extremes).\n\nA high quality, monocrystalline silicon solar cell, at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C cell temperature, may produce 0.60&nbsp;[[volt|V]] open-circuit (''V<sub>OC</sub>''). The cell temperature in full sunlight, even with 25&nbsp;\u00b0C air temperature, will probably be close to 45&nbsp;\u00b0C, reducing the open-circuit voltage to 0.55&nbsp;V per cell. The voltage drops modestly, with this type of cell, until the short-circuit current is approached (''I<sub>SC</sub>''). Maximum power (with 45&nbsp;\u00b0C cell temperature) is typically produced with 75% to 80% of the open-circuit voltage (0.43&nbsp;V in this case) and 90% of the short-circuit current. This output can be up to 70% of the ''V<sub>OC</sub> x I<sub>SC</sub>'' product. The short-circuit current (''I<sub>SC</sub>'') from a cell is nearly proportional to the illumination, while the open-circuit voltage (''V<sub>OC</sub>'') may drop only 10% with an 80% drop in illumination. Lower-quality cells have a more rapid drop in voltage with increasing current and could produce only 1/2&nbsp;''V<sub>OC</sub>'' at 1/2&nbsp;''I<sub>SC</sub>''. The usable power output could thus drop from 70% of the ''V<sub>OC</sub> x I<sub>SC</sub>'' product to 50% or even as little as 25%. Vendors who rate their solar cell \"power\" only as ''V<sub>OC</sub> x I<sub>SC</sub>'', without giving load curves, can be seriously distorting their actual performance.\n\nThe maximum power point of a [[photovoltaic]] varies with incident illumination. For example, accumulation of dust on photovoltaic panels reduces the maximum power point.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=A. Molki|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/45/5/F03|title=Dust affects solar-cell efficiency|journal=Physics Education|volume=45|issue=5|pages=456\u2013458|year=2010|bibcode = 2010PhyEd..45..456M }}</ref> For systems large enough to justify the extra expense, a [[maximum power point tracker]] tracks the instantaneous power by continually measuring the voltage and [[Electric current|current]] (and hence, power transfer), and uses this information to dynamically adjust the load so the maximum power is ''always'' transferred, regardless of the variation in lighting.\n\n===Fill factor===\nAnother defining term in the overall behavior of a solar cell is the '''''fill factor''''' (''FF''). This factor is a measure of quality of a solar cell. This is the  available ''power'' at the ''maximum power point'' (''P<sub>m</sub>'') divided by the ''open circuit voltage'' (''V<sub>OC</sub>'') and the ''short circuit current'' (''I<sub>SC</sub>''):\n\n:<math>FF = \\frac{P_{m}}{V_{OC} \\times I_{SC}} = \\frac{\\eta \\times A_c \\times G}{V_{OC} \\times I_{SC}}.</math>\n\nThe fill factor can be represented graphically by the IV sweep, where it is the ratio of the different rectangular areas.<ref>\u201cPart II \u2013 Photovoltaic Cell I-V Characterization Theory and LabVIEW Analysis Code.\u201d Part II \u2013 Photovoltaic Cell I-V Characterization Theory and LabVIEW Analysis Code - National Instruments, 10 May 2012, ni.com/white-paper/7230/en/.</ref>\n\nThe fill factor is directly affected by the values of the cell's series, [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt resistances]] and diodes losses. Increasing the shunt resistance (R<sub>sh</sub>) and decreasing the [[Equivalent series resistance|series resistance]] (R<sub>s</sub>) lead to a higher fill factor, thus resulting in greater efficiency, and bringing the cell's output power closer to its theoretical maximum.<ref name=nelson>{{Cite book|title = The Physics of Solar Cells|author = Jenny Nelson|publisher = Imperial College Press|year = 2003|isbn = 978-1-86094-340-9|url=http://www.solarfreaks.com/download/file.php?id=281}}</ref>\n\nTypical fill factors range from 50% to 82%. The fill factor for a normal silicon PV cell is 80%.\n\n== Comparison ==\n\n{{Main|Photovoltaics}}\n\nEnergy conversion efficiency is measured by dividing the electrical output by the incident light power. Factors influencing output include spectral distribution, spatial distribution of power, temperature, and resistive load. [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard 61215 is used to compare the performance of cells and is designed around standard (terrestrial, temperate) temperature and conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1&nbsp;kW/m<sup>2</sup>, a spectral distribution close to solar radiation through AM ([[airmass]]) of 1.5 and a cell temperature 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.  The resistive load is varied until the peak or maximum power point (MPP) is achieved.  The power at this point is recorded as [[Watt-peak]] (Wp).  The same standard is used for measuring the power and efficiency of PV modules.\n\nAir mass affects output. In space, where there is no atmosphere, the spectrum of the sun is relatively unfiltered. However, on earth, air filters the incoming light, changing the solar spectrum. The filtering effect ranges from [[air mass (solar energy)|Air Mass]] 0 (AM0) in space, to approximately Air Mass 1.5 on Earth. Multiplying the spectral differences by the quantum efficiency of the solar cell in question yields the efficiency. Terrestrial efficiencies typically are greater than space efficiencies. For example, a silicon solar cell in space might have an efficiency of 14% at AM0, but 16% on earth at AM 1.5. Note, however, that the number of incident photons in space is considerably larger, so the solar cell might produce considerably more power in space, despite the lower efficiency as indicated by reduced percentage of the total incident energy captured.\n\n[[File:cellPVeff(rev200406).png|thumb|upright=1.8|Reported timeline of research [[solar cell]] energy conversion efficiencies since 1976 ([[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]])]]\n\nSolar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction production cells and 44.4% with multiple dies assembled into a hybrid package.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://cleantechnica.com/2012/10/15/solar-junction-powers-up-cpv-with-new-conversion-efficiency-record/|title = Solar Junction Breaks Its Own CPV Conversion Efficiency Record | accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://cleantechnica.com/2013/06/23/solar-cell-efficiency-world-record-set-by-sharp-44-4/\n| title = Solar Cell Efficiency World Record Set By Sharp \u2014 44.4% \n| date = 28 July 2013\n| accessdate = 28 July 2013\n}}</ref> Solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available ''multicrystalline Si'' solar cells are around 14\u201319%.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://publica.fraunhofer.de/documents/N-73521.html|title = Silicon Solar Cells with Screen-Printed Front Side Metallization Exceeding 19% Efficiency}}</ref> The highest efficiency cells have not always been the most economical \u2014 for example a 30% efficient multijunction cell based on exotic materials such as gallium arsenide or indium selenide produced at low volume might well cost one hundred times as much as an 8% efficient amorphous silicon cell in mass production, while delivering only about four times the output.\n\nHowever, there is a way to \"boost\" solar power. By increasing the light intensity, typically photogenerated carriers are increased, increasing efficiency by up to 15%. These so-called \"[[Concentrator photovoltaics|concentrator systems]]\" have only begun to become cost-competitive as a result of the development of high efficiency GaAs cells. The increase in intensity is typically accomplished by using concentrating optics. A typical concentrator system may use a light intensity 6\u2013400 times the sun, and increase the efficiency of a one sun GaAs cell from 31% at AM 1.5 to 35%.\n\nA common method used to express economic costs is to calculate a price per delivered [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh). The solar cell efficiency in combination with the available irradiation has a major influence on the costs, but generally speaking the overall system efficiency is important.

If we take 6000&nbsp;K for the temperature of the sun and 300&nbsp;K for ambient conditions on earth, this comes to 95%. In 1981, Alexis de Vos and Herman Pauwels showed that this is achievable with a stack of an infinite number of cells with band gaps ranging from infinity (the first cells encountered by the incoming photons) to zero, with a voltage in each cell very close to the open-circuit voltage, equal to 95% of the band gap of that cell, and with 6000&nbsp;K [[blackbody radiation]] coming from all directions. However, the 95% efficiency thereby achieved means that the electric power is 95% of the '''''net''''' amount of light absorbed \u2013 the stack '''''emits''''' radiation as it has non-zero temperature, and this radiation has to be subtracted from the incoming radiation when calculating the amount of heat being transferred and the efficiency. They also considered the more relevant problem of maximizing the power output for a stack being illuminated from all directions by 6000&nbsp;K blackbody radiation. In this case, the voltages must be lowered to less than 95% of the band gap (the percentage is not constant over all the cells). The maximum theoretical efficiency calculated is 86.8% for a stack of an infinite number of cells, using the incoming concentrated sunlight radiation.<ref name=Vos80>A.

Photons with an energy below the band gap of the absorber material cannot generate an [[Theory of solar cells#Photogeneration of charge carriers|electron-hole pair]], so their energy is not converted to useful output, and only generates heat if absorbed. For photons with an energy above the band gap energy, only a fraction of the energy above the band gap can be converted to useful output. When a photon of greater energy is absorbed, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to kinetic energy of the carrier combination. The excess kinetic energy is converted to heat through [[phonon]] interactions as the kinetic energy of the carriers slows to equilibrium velocity.

One of the carriers may reach the p\u2013n junction and contribute to the current produced by the solar cell; such a carrier is said to be ''collected''. Or, the carriers [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombine]] with no net contribution to cell current.\n\nQuantum efficiency refers to the percentage of photons that are converted to electric current (i.e., collected carriers) when the cell is operated under short circuit conditions. The \"external\" quantum efficiency of a [[silicon]] solar cell includes the effect of optical losses such as transmission and reflection.\n\nIn particular, some measures can be taken to reduce these losses. The reflection losses, which can account for up to 10% of the total incident energy, can be dramatically decreased using a technique called texturization, a light trapping method that modifies the average light path.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/0927-0248(92)90126-A | volume=26 | issue=1\u20132 | title=The surface texturization of solar cells: A new method using V-grooves with controllable sidewall angles | journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells | pages=71\u201378| date=March 1992 | last1=Verlinden | first1=Pierre | last2=Evrard | first2=Olivier | last3=Mazy | first3=Emmanuel | last4=Crahay | first4=Andr\u00e9 }}</ref>\n\nQuantum efficiency is most usefully expressed as a ''spectral'' measurement (that is, as a function of photon wavelength or energy). Since some wavelengths are absorbed more effectively than others, spectral measurements of quantum efficiency can yield valuable information about the quality of the semiconductor bulk and surfaces. Quantum efficiency alone is not the same as overall energy conversion efficiency, as it does not convey information about the fraction of power that is converted by the solar cell.\n\n===Maximum power point===\nA solar cell may operate over a wide range of [[voltage]]s (V) and [[current (electricity)|currents]] (I). By increasing the resistive load on an irradiated cell continuously from zero (a ''[[short circuit]]'') to a very high value (an ''open circuit'') one can determine the [[maximum power theorem|maximum power]] point, the point that maximizes V&times;I; that is, the load for which the cell can deliver maximum electrical power at that level of irradiation. (The output power is zero in both the short circuit and open circuit extremes).\n\nA high quality, monocrystalline silicon solar cell, at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C cell temperature, may produce 0.60&nbsp;[[volt|V]] open-circuit (''V<sub>OC</sub>''). The cell temperature in full sunlight, even with 25&nbsp;\u00b0C air temperature, will probably be close to 45&nbsp;\u00b0C, reducing the open-circuit voltage to 0.55&nbsp;V per cell. The voltage drops modestly, with this type of cell, until the short-circuit current is approached (''I<sub>SC</sub>''). Maximum power (with 45&nbsp;\u00b0C cell temperature) is typically produced with 75% to 80% of the open-circuit voltage (0.43&nbsp;V in this case) and 90% of the short-circuit current. This output can be up to 70% of the ''V<sub>OC</sub> x I<sub>SC</sub>'' product. The short-circuit current (''I<sub>SC</sub>'') from a cell is nearly proportional to the illumination, while the open-circuit voltage (''V<sub>OC</sub>'') may drop only 10% with an 80% drop in illumination. Lower-quality cells have a more rapid drop in voltage with increasing current and could produce only 1/2&nbsp;''V<sub>OC</sub>'' at 1/2&nbsp;''I<sub>SC</sub>''. The usable power output could thus drop from 70% of the ''V<sub>OC</sub> x I<sub>SC</sub>'' product to 50% or even as little as 25%. Vendors who rate their solar cell \"power\" only as ''V<sub>OC</sub> x I<sub>SC</sub>'', without giving load curves, can be seriously distorting their actual performance.\n\nThe maximum power point of a [[photovoltaic]] varies with incident illumination. For example, accumulation of dust on photovoltaic panels reduces the maximum power point.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=A. Molki|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/45/5/F03|title=Dust affects solar-cell efficiency|journal=Physics Education|volume=45|issue=5|pages=456\u2013458|year=2010|bibcode = 2010PhyEd..45..456M }}</ref> For systems large enough to justify the extra expense, a [[maximum power point tracker]] tracks the instantaneous power by continually measuring the voltage and [[Electric current|current]] (and hence, power transfer), and uses this information to dynamically adjust the load so the maximum power is ''always'' transferred, regardless of the variation in lighting.\n\n===Fill factor===\nAnother defining term in the overall behavior of a solar cell is the '''''fill factor''''' (''FF''). This factor is a measure of quality of a solar cell. This is the  available ''power'' at the ''maximum power point'' (''P<sub>m</sub>'') divided by the ''open circuit voltage'' (''V<sub>OC</sub>'') and the ''short circuit current'' (''I<sub>SC</sub>''):\n\n:<math>FF = \\frac{P_{m}}{V_{OC} \\times I_{SC}} = \\frac{\\eta \\times A_c \\times G}{V_{OC} \\times I_{SC}}.</math>\n\nThe fill factor can be represented graphically by the IV sweep, where it is the ratio of the different rectangular areas.<ref>\u201cPart II \u2013 Photovoltaic Cell I-V Characterization Theory and LabVIEW Analysis Code.\u201d Part II \u2013 Photovoltaic Cell I-V Characterization Theory and LabVIEW Analysis Code - National Instruments, 10 May 2012, ni.com/white-paper/7230/en/.</ref>\n\nThe fill factor is directly affected by the values of the cell's series, [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt resistances]] and diodes losses. Increasing the shunt resistance (R<sub>sh</sub>) and decreasing the [[Equivalent series resistance|series resistance]] (R<sub>s</sub>) lead to a higher fill factor, thus resulting in greater efficiency, and bringing the cell's output power closer to its theoretical maximum.<ref name=nelson>{{Cite book|title = The Physics of Solar Cells|author = Jenny Nelson|publisher = Imperial College Press|year = 2003|isbn = 978-1-86094-340-9|url=http://www.solarfreaks.com/download/file.php?id=281}}</ref>\n\nTypical fill factors range from 50% to 82%. The fill factor for a normal silicon PV cell is 80%.\n\n== Comparison ==\n\n{{Main|Photovoltaics}}\n\nEnergy conversion efficiency is measured by dividing the electrical output by the incident light power. Factors influencing output include spectral distribution, spatial distribution of power, temperature, and resistive load. [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard 61215 is used to compare the performance of cells and is designed around standard (terrestrial, temperate) temperature and conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1&nbsp;kW/m<sup>2</sup>, a spectral distribution close to solar radiation through AM ([[airmass]]) of 1.5 and a cell temperature 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.  The resistive load is varied until the peak or maximum power point (MPP) is achieved.  The power at this point is recorded as [[Watt-peak]] (Wp).  The same standard is used for measuring the power and efficiency of PV modules.\n\nAir mass affects output. In space, where there is no atmosphere, the spectrum of the sun is relatively unfiltered. However, on earth, air filters the incoming light, changing the solar spectrum. The filtering effect ranges from [[air mass (solar energy)|Air Mass]] 0 (AM0) in space, to approximately Air Mass 1.5 on Earth. Multiplying the spectral differences by the quantum efficiency of the solar cell in question yields the efficiency. Terrestrial efficiencies typically are greater than space efficiencies. For example, a silicon solar cell in space might have an efficiency of 14% at AM0, but 16% on earth at AM 1.5. Note, however, that the number of incident photons in space is considerably larger, so the solar cell might produce considerably more power in space, despite the lower efficiency as indicated by reduced percentage of the total incident energy captured.\n\n[[File:cellPVeff(rev200310).png|thumb|upright=1.8|Reported timeline of research [[solar cell]] energy conversion efficiencies since 1976 ([[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]])]]\n\nSolar cell efficiencies vary from 6% for amorphous silicon-based solar cells to 44.0% with multiple-junction production cells and 44.4% with multiple dies assembled into a hybrid package.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://cleantechnica.com/2012/10/15/solar-junction-powers-up-cpv-with-new-conversion-efficiency-record/|title = Solar Junction Breaks Its Own CPV Conversion Efficiency Record | accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://cleantechnica.com/2013/06/23/solar-cell-efficiency-world-record-set-by-sharp-44-4/\n| title = Solar Cell Efficiency World Record Set By Sharp \u2014 44.4% \n| date = 28 July 2013\n| accessdate = 28 July 2013\n}}</ref> Solar cell energy conversion efficiencies for commercially available ''multicrystalline Si'' solar cells are around 14\u201319%.<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://publica.fraunhofer.de/documents/N-73521.html|title = Silicon Solar Cells with Screen-Printed Front Side Metallization Exceeding 19% Efficiency}}</ref> The highest efficiency cells have not always been the most economical \u2014 for example a 30% efficient multijunction cell based on exotic materials such as gallium arsenide or indium selenide produced at low volume might well cost one hundred times as much as an 8% efficient amorphous silicon cell in mass production, while delivering only about four times the output.\n\nHowever, there is a way to \"boost\" solar power. By increasing the light intensity, typically photogenerated carriers are increased, increasing efficiency by up to 15%. These so-called \"[[Concentrator photovoltaics|concentrator systems]]\" have only begun to become cost-competitive as a result of the development of high efficiency GaAs cells. The increase in intensity is typically accomplished by using concentrating optics. A typical concentrator system may use a light intensity 6\u2013400 times the sun, and increase the efficiency of a one sun GaAs cell from 31% at AM 1.5 to 35%.\n\nA common method used to express economic costs is to calculate a price per delivered [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh). The solar cell efficiency in combination with the available irradiation has a major influence on the costs, but generally speaking the overall system efficiency is important. Commercially available solar cells (as of 2006) reached system efficiencies between 5 and 19%.\n\nUndoped crystalline silicon devices are approaching the theoretical limiting efficiency of 29.43%.<ref name=\"Richter2013\">{{Cite journal|author1=A.

Electrical contacts made from [[busbar]]s (the larger silver-colored strips) and fingers (the smaller ones) are printed on the [[silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]].]]\n[[File:Photovoltaic cell.svg|thumb|Symbol of a Photovoltaic cell.]]\nA '''solar cell''', or '''photovoltaic cell''', is an electrical device that converts the energy of [[light]] directly into [[electricity]] by the [[photovoltaic effect]], which is a [[physics|physical]] and [[Chemical substance|chemical]] phenomenon.<ref name=\"chemistryexplained.com\">[http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Ru-Sp/Solar-Cells.html Solar Cells]. chemistryexplained.com</ref> It is a form of photoelectric cell, defined as a device whose electrical characteristics, such as [[Electric current|current]], [[voltage]], or [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]], vary when exposed to light. Individual solar cell devices can be combined to form modules, otherwise known as [[solar panel]]s. The common single junction [[silicon]] solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://solarbotics.net/starting/200202_solar_cells/200202_solar_cell_use.html|title=Solar cells \u2013 performance and use|website=solarbotic s.net}}</ref>\n\nSolar cells are described as being [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]], irrespective of whether the source is [[sunlight]] or an artificial light. In addition to producing energy, they can be used as a [[photodetector]] (for example [[infrared detector]]s), detecting light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.\n\nThe operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires three basic attributes:\n* The absorption of light, generating either [[electron]]-[[Electron hole|hole]] pairs or [[exciton]]s.\n* The separation of [[charge carrier]]s of opposite types.\n* The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.\n\nIn contrast, a [[solar thermal collector]] supplies [[heat]] by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing sunlight]], for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect [[electrical power generation]] from heat. A \"photoelectrolytic cell\" ([[photoelectrochemical cell]]), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by [[Edmond Becquerel]] and modern [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s), or to a device that [[Water splitting|splits water]] directly into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] using only solar illumination.\n{{TOC_limit|3}}\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a solar cell to a PV system. Diagram of the possible components of a [[photovoltaic system]]]]\n\nAssemblies of solar cells are used to make [[Solar panel|solar modules]] that generate electrical power from [[sunlight]], as distinguished from a \"solar thermal module\" or \"solar hot water panel\". A solar array generates [[solar power]] using [[solar energy]].\n\n=== Cells, modules, panels and systems ===\n{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}\nMultiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a [[Solar panel|solar photovoltaic panel or module]]. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. Solar cells are usually connected in [[series and parallel circuits]] or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual [[Electric power conversion|power boxes]] are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs ([[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]]) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt [[diode]]s can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 4px auto 1px auto;\"\n|+ Typical PV system prices in 2013 in selected countries ($/W)\n|-\n!

For Example, [[Explorer 6]], launched in 1959, had four arrays that folded out once in orbit. They provided power for months in space.]]\nSolar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the Vanguard satellite in 1958, as an alternative power source to the [[primary cell|primary battery]] power source. By adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched [[Explorer 6]], featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of 9600 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman solar cells]].\n\nBy the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the [[National Science Foundation]] \"Research Applied to National Needs\" program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.\n\nIn the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to [[gallium arsenide]]-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]] used on spacecraft.\n\nIn recent years, research has moved towards designing and manufacturing lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient solar cells. Terrestrial solar cell technology generally uses photovoltaic cells that are laminated with a layer of glass for strength and protection. Space applications for solar cells require that the cells and arrays are both highly efficient and extremely lightweight. Some newer technology implemented on satellites are multi-junction photovoltaic cells, which are composed of different PN junctions with varying bandgaps in order to utilize a wider spectrum of the sun's energy. Additionally, large satellites require the use of large solar arrays to produce electricity. These solar arrays need to be broken down to fit in the geometric constraints of the launch vehicle the satellite travels on before being injected into orbit. Historically, solar cells on satellites consisted of several small terrestrial panels folded together. These small panels would be unfolded into a large panel after the satellite is deployed in its orbit. Newer satellites aim to use flexible rollable solar arrays that are very lightweight and can be packed into a very small volume. The smaller size and weight of these flexible arrays drastically decreases the overall cost of launching a satellite due to the direct relationship between payload weight and launch cost of a launch vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/solar_arrays.html|title=International Space Station Solar Arrays|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=31 July 2017|website=NASA|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Price reductions ===\nImprovements were gradual over the 1960s. This was also the reason that costs remained high, because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells, leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost, less-efficient solutions. The price was determined largely by the [[semiconductor industry]]; their move to [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s led to the availability of larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] at lower relative prices. As their price fell, the price of the resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p= 50}}\n\nIn late 1969 Elliot Berman joined [[Exxon]]'s task force which was looking for projects 30 years in the future and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}}<ref name=\"williams 2005\">\n{{cite book\n | first = Neville | last = Williams\n | title = Chasing the Sun: Solar Adventures Around the World\n | url = https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will | url-access = registration | year = 2005\n | publisher = [[New Society Publishers]]\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will/page/84 84]\n | isbn = 9781550923124}}\n</ref><ref name=jones>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Geoffrey | last1 = Jones\n | first2 = Loubna | last2 = Bouamane \n | title = \"Power from Sunshine\": A Business History of Solar Energy\n | url = http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/12-105.pdf\n | year = 2012\n | publisher = [[Harvard Business School]]\n | pages = 22\u201323\n }}\n</ref> The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive.

Cell sizes grew as equipment became available on the surplus market; [[ARCO]] Solar's original panels used cells {{convert|2|to|4|in|mm|-1}} in diameter. Panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125&nbsp;mm wafers; since 2008, almost all new panels use 156&nbsp;mm cells. The widespread introduction of [[flat screen television]]s in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to the wide availability of large, high-quality glass sheets to cover the panels.\n\nDuring the 1990s, [[polysilicon]] (\"poly\") cells became increasingly popular. These cells offer less efficiency than their monosilicon (\"mono\") counterparts, but they are grown in large vats that reduce cost. By the mid-2000s, poly was dominant in the low-cost panel market, but more recently the mono returned to widespread use.\n\nManufacturers of wafer-based cells responded to high silicon prices in 2004\u20132008 with rapid reductions in silicon consumption. In 2008, according to Jef Poortmans, director of [[IMEC]]'s organic and solar department, current cells use {{convert|8|-|9|g|oz}} of silicon per watt of power generation, with wafer thicknesses in the neighborhood of 200&nbsp;[[microns]].

These [[List of semiconductor materials|materials]] must have certain characteristics in order to absorb [[sunlight]]. Some cells are designed to handle sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, while others are optimized for [[Solar panels on spacecraft|use in space]]. Solar cells can be made of only one single layer of light-absorbing material ([[p-n junction|single-junction]]) or use multiple physical configurations ([[multi-junction]]s) to take advantage of various absorption and charge separation mechanisms.\n\nSolar cells can be classified into first, second and third generation cells. The first generation cells\u2014also called conventional, traditional or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based cells\u2014are made of [[crystalline silicon]], the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as [[polysilicon]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. Second generation cells are [[thin film solar cells]], that include [[amorphous silicon]], [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS]] cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, [[building integrated photovoltaics]] or in small [[stand-alone power system]]. The [[third-generation photovoltaic cell|third generation of solar cells]] includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics\u2014most of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often [[organometallic]] compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, there is a lot of research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.\n\n=== Crystalline silicon ===\n{{Main|Crystalline silicon}}\nBy far, the most prevalent bulk material for solar cells is [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si), also known as \"solar grade silicon\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting [[ingot]], [[ribbon]] or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]. These cells are entirely based around the concept of a [[p-n junction]].\nSolar cells made of c-Si are made from [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] between 160 and 240&nbsp;micrometers thick.\n\n==== Monocrystalline silicon ====\n{{Main|Monocrystalline silicon}}\n[[File:Sono Sion Front Back.jpg|thumb|The roof, bonnet and large parts of the outer shell of the [[Sion (electric car)|Sion]] are equipped with highly efficient monocrystalline silicon cells]]\n\n[[Monocrystalline silicon]] (mono-Si) solar cells are more efficient and more expensive than most other types of cells. The corners of the cells look clipped, like an octagon, because the wafer material is cut from cylindrical ingots, that are typically grown by the [[Czochralski process]]. Solar panels using mono-Si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds.\n\n====Epitaxial silicon development====\n[[Epitaxial wafer]]s of crystalline silicon can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon \"seed\" wafer by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250&nbsp;\u00b5m) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots.

Based on the previous literature and some theoretical analysis, there are several reasons why GaAs has such high power conversion efficiency. First, GaAs bandgap is 1.43ev which is almost ideal for solar cells. Second, because Gallium is a by-product of the smelting of other metals, GaAs cells are relatively insensitive to heat and it can keep high efficiency when temperature is quite high. Third, GaAs has the wide range of design options. Using GaAs as active layer in solar cell, engineers can have multiple choices of other layers which can better generate electrons and holes in GaAs.\n\n=== Multijunction cells ===\n{{Main|Multi-junction solar cell}}\n[[File:Dawn solar panel.jpg|thumb|[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'s 10&nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]] triple-junction gallium arsenide solar array at full extension]]\n\nMulti-junction cells consist of multiple thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown on top of another, typically using [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]].

It introduces an intermediate band (IB) energy level in between the valence and conduction bands. Theoretically, introducing an IB allows two [[photons]] with energy less than the [[bandgap]] to excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to the [[conduction band]]. This increases the induced photocurrent and thereby efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5014|title=Increasing the Efficiency of Ideal Solar Cells by Photon Induced Transitions at Intermediate Levels|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=78|issue=26|pages=5014\u20135017|year=1997|last1=Luque|first1=Antonio|last2=Mart\u00ed|first2=Antonio|bibcode=1997PhRvL..78.5014L}}</ref>\n\n[[Antonio Luque L\u00f3pez|Luque]] and Marti first derived a theoretical limit for an IB device with one midgap energy level using [[detailed balance]].

Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing [[phosphor]]s exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.\n\nOne upconversion technique is to incorporate [[lanthanide]]-doped materials ([[Erbium|{{chem|Er|3+}}]], [[Ytterbium|{{chem|Yb|3+}}]], [[Holmium|{{chem|Ho|3+}}]] or a combination), taking advantage of their [[luminescence]] to convert [[infrared radiation]] to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two [[infrared]] photons are absorbed by [[rare-earth]] [[ion]]s to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. {{chem|Er|+}} ions have been the most used. {{chem|Er|3+}} ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54&nbsp;\u00b5m. Two {{chem|Er|3+}} ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron\u2013hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low [[phonon]] energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with {{chem|Ho|3+}} ions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez|first=M.A.|author2=Imanieh, M.H. |author3=Mart\u00edn, L.L. |author4= Mart\u00edn, I.R. |title=Experimental enhancement of the photocurrent in a solar cell using upconversion process in fluoroindate glasses exciting at 1480nm|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=September 2013|volume=116|pages=171\u2013175|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.04.023}}</ref>\n\n=== Light-absorbing dyes ===\n{{Main|Dye-sensitized solar cell|l1=Dye-sensitized solar cells}}\n[[Dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSCs) are made of low-cost materials and do not need elaborate manufacturing equipment, so they can be made in a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] fashion. In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] cell designs. DSSC's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its [[conversion efficiency]] is less than the best [[thin film cell]]s, its [[price/performance ratio]] may be high enough to allow them to compete with [[fossil fuel electrical generation]].\n\nTypically a [[ruthenium]] [[Metalorganics|metalorganic]] [[dye]] (Ru-centered) is used as a [[monolayer]] of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[nanoparticulate]] [[titanium dioxide]] to greatly amplify the surface area (200\u2013300 m<sup>2</sup>/g {{chem|TiO|2}}, as compared to approximately 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type {{chem|TiO|2}} and the holes are absorbed by an [[electrolyte]] on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a [[redox]] couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by [[screen printing]] or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] under heat and [[UV]] light and the cell casing is difficult to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] due to the solvents used in assembly.

In addition, these cells could be beneficial for some applications where mechanical flexibility and disposability are important. Current cell efficiencies are, however, very low, and practical devices are essentially non-existent.\n\nEnergy conversion efficiencies achieved to date using conductive polymers are very low compared to inorganic materials. However, [[Konarka]] Power Plastic reached efficiency of 8.3%<ref>[http://www.pv-tech.org/news/nrel_validates_konarkas_8.3_power_plastic_efficiency_record Konarka Power Plastic reaches 8.3% efficiency]. pv-tech.org. Retrieved 7 May 2011.</ref> and organic tandem cells in 2012 reached 11.1%.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe active region of an organic device consists of two materials, one electron donor and one electron acceptor. When a photon is converted into an electron hole pair, typically in the donor material, the charges tend to remain bound in the form of an [[exciton]], separating when the exciton diffuses to the donor-acceptor interface, unlike most other solar cell types. The short exciton diffusion lengths of most polymer systems tend to limit the efficiency of such devices. Nanostructured interfaces, sometimes in the form of bulk heterojunctions, can improve performance.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1369-7021(07)70276-6| title = Polymer-based solar cells| journal = Materials Today| volume = 10| issue = 11| page = 28| year = 2007| last1 = Mayer | first1 = A. | last2 = Scully | first2 = S. | last3 = Hardin | first3 = B. | last4 = Rowell | first4 = M. | last5 = McGehee | first5 = M. }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, MIT and Michigan State researchers developed solar cells with a power efficiency close to 2% with a transparency to the human eye greater than 65%, achieved by selectively absorbing the ultraviolet and near-infrared parts of the spectrum with small-molecule compounds.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.3567516| title = Transparent, near-infrared organic photovoltaic solar cells for window and energy-scavenging applications| journal = Applied Physics Letters| volume = 98| issue = 11| page = 113305| year = 2011| last1 = Lunt | first1 = R.

An adaptive material responds to the intensity and angle of incident light. At the part of the cell where the light is most intense, the cell surface changes from reflective to adaptive, allowing the light to penetrate the cell. The other parts of the cell remain reflective increasing the retention of the absorbed light within the cell.<ref name=tr1407>Bullis, Kevin (30 July 2014) [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/529476/adaptive-material-could-cut-the-cost-of-solar-in-half Adaptive Material Could Cut the Cost of Solar in Half]. ''MIT Technology Review''</ref>\n\nIn 2014, a system was developed that combined an adaptive surface with a glass substrate that redirect the absorbed to a light absorber on the edges of the sheet. The system also includes an array of fixed lenses/mirrors to concentrate light onto the adaptive surface. As the day continues, the concentrated light moves along the surface of the cell. That surface switches from reflective to adaptive when the light is most concentrated and back to reflective after the light moves along.<ref name=tr1407/>\n\n=== Surface texturing ===\n[[File:SolarImpulse HB-SIA landing Brussels Airport 3-crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Solar Impulse]] aircraft are Swiss-designed single-seat monoplanes powered entirely from photovoltaic cells]]\n\nFor the past years, researchers have been trying to reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. [[Thin-film solar cell]] is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Patrick|author2=Green, Martin A. |title=Light Trapping Properties of Pyramidally textured surfaces|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=Feb 1987|volume=62|issue=1| pages=243\u2013249|doi=10.1063/1.339189|bibcode=1987JAP....62..243C}}</ref> Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Jianhua|author2=Wang, Aihua |author3=Green, Martin A.|title=19.8% efficient \"honeycomb\" textured multicrystalline and 24.4% monocrystalline silicon solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=May 1998|volume=73|issue=14| pages=1991\u20131993|doi=10.1063/1.122345|bibcode=1998ApPhL..73.1991Z}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=H.|author2=Michl, B.|author3=Kubler, V.|author4= Schwarzkopf, S.|author5= Muller, C.|author6= Hermle, M.|author7= Blasi, B.|title=Nanoimprint Lithography for Honeycomb Texturing of Multicrystalline Silicon|journal=Energy Procedia|date=2011|volume=8|pages=648\u2013653|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.06.196}}</ref> Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the [[OPTOS formalism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tucher|first=Nico|last2=Eisenlohr|first2=Johannes|last3=Gebrewold|first3=Habtamu|last4=Kiefel|first4=Peter|last5=H\u00f6hn|first5=Oliver|last6=Hauser|first6=Hubert|last7=Goldschmidt|first7=Jan Christoph|last8=Bl\u00e4si|first8=Benedikt|date=11 July 2016|title=Optical simulation of photovoltaic modules with multiple textured interfaces using the matrix-based formalism OPTOS|journal=Optics Express|volume=24|issue=14|pages=A1083\u2013A1093|doi=10.1364/OE.24.0A1083|pmid=27410896|bibcode=2016OExpr..24A1083T}}</ref> In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mavrokefalos|first=Anastassios|author2=Han, Sang Eon. |author3=Yerci, Selcuk |author4= Branham, M.S.|author5= Chen, Gang. |title=Efficient Light Trapping in Inverted Nanopyramid Thin Crystalline Silicon Membranes for Solar Cell Applications|journal=Nano Letters|date=June 2012|volume=12|issue=6| pages=2792\u20132796|doi=10.1021/nl2045777|bibcode=2012NanoL..12.2792M |pmid=22612694|hdl=1721.1/86899}}</ref> In combination with [[anti-reflective coating]], surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell.

The encapsulants are commonly made from [[polyvinyl acetate]] or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light.

However, the strict requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells, lowering costs.\n\n[[Polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]-doped. A surface diffusion of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p\u2013n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.\n\n[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflection coatings]] are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell. [[Silicon nitride]] has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.\n\nA full area metal contact is made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine \"fingers\" and larger \"bus bars\" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a [[silver]] paste. This is an evolution of the so-called \"wet\" process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by [[Bayer AG]].<ref>Fitzky, Hans G. and Ebneth, Harold (24 May 1983) {{US patent|4385102}}, \"Large-area photovoltaic cell\"</ref> The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in [[ohmic contact]] with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into [[photovoltaic module|modules]] or \"solar panels\". Solar panels have a sheet of [[tempered glass]] on the front, and a [[polymer]] encapsulation on the back.\n\n== Manufacturers and certification ==\n{{Further|List of photovoltaics companies}}\n[[File:SolarCellProduction-E.PNG|thumb|right|190px|Solar cell production by region<ref name=\"pvnews\">[http://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/pv-news Pv News November 2012].

Individual solar cell devices can be combined to form modules, otherwise known as [[solar panel]]s. The common single junction [[silicon]] solar cell can produce a maximum open-circuit voltage of approximately 0.5 to 0.6 volts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://solarbotics.net/starting/200202_solar_cells/200202_solar_cell_use.html|title=Solar cells \u2013 performance and use|website=solarbotic s.net}}</ref>\n\nSolar cells are described as being [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]], irrespective of whether the source is [[sunlight]] or an artificial light. In addition to producing energy, they can be used as a [[photodetector]] (for example [[infrared detector]]s), detecting light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]] near the visible range, or measuring light intensity.\n\nThe operation of a photovoltaic (PV) cell requires three basic attributes:\n* The absorption of light, generating either [[electron]]-[[Electron hole|hole]] pairs or [[exciton]]s.\n* The separation of [[charge carrier]]s of opposite types.\n* The separate extraction of those carriers to an external circuit.\n\nIn contrast, a [[solar thermal collector]] supplies [[heat]] by [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbing sunlight]], for the purpose of either direct heating or indirect [[electrical power generation]] from heat. A \"photoelectrolytic cell\" ([[photoelectrochemical cell]]), on the other hand, refers either to a type of photovoltaic cell (like that developed by [[Edmond Becquerel]] and modern [[dye-sensitized solar cell]]s), or to a device that [[Water splitting|splits water]] directly into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] using only solar illumination.\n{{TOC_limit|3}}\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|From a solar cell to a PV system. Diagram of the possible components of a [[photovoltaic system]]]]\n\nAssemblies of solar cells are used to make [[Solar panel|solar modules]] that generate electrical power from [[sunlight]], as distinguished from a \"solar thermal module\" or \"solar hot water panel\". A solar array generates [[solar power]] using [[solar energy]].\n\n=== Cells, modules, panels and systems ===\n{{Main|Photovoltaic system}}\nMultiple solar cells in an integrated group, all oriented in one plane, constitute a [[Solar panel|solar photovoltaic panel or module]]. Photovoltaic modules often have a sheet of glass on the sun-facing side, allowing light to pass while protecting the semiconductor [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]]. Solar cells are usually connected in [[series and parallel circuits]] or series in modules, creating an additive voltage. Connecting cells in parallel yields a higher current; however, problems such as shadow effects can shut down the weaker (less illuminated) parallel string (a number of series connected cells) causing substantial power loss and possible damage because of the reverse bias applied to the shadowed cells by their illuminated partners. Strings of series cells are usually handled independently and not connected in parallel, though as of 2014, individual [[Electric power conversion|power boxes]] are often supplied for each module, and are connected in parallel. Although modules can be interconnected to create an array with the desired peak DC voltage and loading current capacity, using independent MPPTs ([[Maximum power point tracking|maximum power point trackers]]) is preferable. Otherwise, shunt [[diode]]s can reduce shadowing power loss in arrays with series/parallel connected cells.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 4px auto 1px auto;\"\n|+ Typical PV system prices in 2013 in selected countries ($/W)\n|-\n!

For Example, [[Explorer 6]], launched in 1959, had four arrays that folded out once in orbit. They provided power for months in space.]]\nSolar cells were first used in a prominent application when they were proposed and flown on the Vanguard satellite in 1958, as an alternative power source to the [[primary cell|primary battery]] power source. By adding cells to the outside of the body, the mission time could be extended with no major changes to the spacecraft or its power systems. In 1959 the United States launched [[Explorer 6]], featuring large wing-shaped solar arrays, which became a common feature in satellites. These arrays consisted of 9600 [[H. Leslie (Les) Hoffman|Hoffman solar cells]].\n\nBy the 1960s, solar cells were (and still are) the main power source for most Earth orbiting satellites and a number of probes into the solar system, since they offered the best [[power-to-weight ratio]]. However, this success was possible because in the space application, power system costs could be high, because space users had few other power options, and were willing to pay for the best possible cells. The space power market drove the development of higher efficiencies in solar cells up until the [[National Science Foundation]] \"Research Applied to National Needs\" program began to push development of solar cells for terrestrial applications.\n\nIn the early 1990s the technology used for space solar cells diverged from the silicon technology used for terrestrial panels, with the spacecraft application shifting to [[gallium arsenide]]-based III-V semiconductor materials, which then evolved into the modern III-V [[multijunction photovoltaic cell]] used on spacecraft.\n\nIn recent years, research has moved towards designing and manufacturing lightweight, flexible, and highly efficient solar cells. Terrestrial solar cell technology generally uses photovoltaic cells that are laminated with a layer of glass for strength and protection. Space applications for solar cells require that the cells and arrays are both highly efficient and extremely lightweight. Some newer technology implemented on satellites are multi-junction photovoltaic cells, which are composed of different PN junctions with varying bandgaps in order to utilize a wider spectrum of the sun's energy. Additionally, large satellites require the use of large solar arrays to produce electricity. These solar arrays need to be broken down to fit in the geometric constraints of the launch vehicle the satellite travels on before being injected into orbit. Historically, solar cells on satellites consisted of several small terrestrial panels folded together. These small panels would be unfolded into a large panel after the satellite is deployed in its orbit. Newer satellites aim to use flexible rollable solar arrays that are very lightweight and can be packed into a very small volume. The smaller size and weight of these flexible arrays drastically decreases the overall cost of launching a satellite due to the direct relationship between payload weight and launch cost of a launch vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/solar_arrays.html|title=International Space Station Solar Arrays|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=31 July 2017|website=NASA|access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Price reductions ===\nImprovements were gradual over the 1960s. This was also the reason that costs remained high, because space users were willing to pay for the best possible cells, leaving no reason to invest in lower-cost, less-efficient solutions. The price was determined largely by the [[semiconductor industry]]; their move to [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s led to the availability of larger [[Boule (crystal)|boules]] at lower relative prices. As their price fell, the price of the resulting cells did as well. These effects lowered 1971 cell costs to some $100 per watt.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p= 50}}\n\nIn late 1969 Elliot Berman joined [[Exxon]]'s task force which was looking for projects 30 years in the future and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time.{{sfn|Perlin|1999|p=53}}<ref name=\"williams 2005\">\n{{cite book\n | first = Neville | last = Williams\n | title = Chasing the Sun: Solar Adventures Around the World\n | url = https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will | url-access = registration | year = 2005\n | publisher = [[New Society Publishers]]\n | page = [https://archive.org/details/chasingsunsolara0000will/page/84 84]\n | isbn = 9781550923124}}\n</ref><ref name=jones>\n{{cite book\n | first1 = Geoffrey | last1 = Jones\n | first2 = Loubna | last2 = Bouamane \n | title = \"Power from Sunshine\": A Business History of Solar Energy\n | url = http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/12-105.pdf\n | year = 2012\n | publisher = [[Harvard Business School]]\n | pages = 22\u201323\n }}\n</ref> The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive.

Panels in the 1990s and early 2000s generally used 125&nbsp;mm wafers; since 2008, almost all new panels use 156&nbsp;mm cells.

The first generation cells\u2014also called conventional, traditional or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based cells\u2014are made of [[crystalline silicon]], the commercially predominant PV technology, that includes materials such as [[polysilicon]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. Second generation cells are [[thin film solar cells]], that include [[amorphous silicon]], [[Cadmium telluride photovoltaics|CdTe]] and [[Copper indium gallium selenide solar cell|CIGS]] cells and are commercially significant in utility-scale [[photovoltaic power station]]s, [[building integrated photovoltaics]] or in small [[stand-alone power system]]. The [[third-generation photovoltaic cell|third generation of solar cells]] includes a number of thin-film technologies often described as emerging photovoltaics\u2014most of them have not yet been commercially applied and are still in the research or development phase. Many use organic materials, often [[organometallic]] compounds as well as inorganic substances. Despite the fact that their efficiencies had been low and the stability of the absorber material was often too short for commercial applications, there is a lot of research invested into these technologies as they promise to achieve the goal of producing low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.\n\n=== Crystalline silicon ===\n{{Main|Crystalline silicon}}\nBy far, the most prevalent bulk material for solar cells is [[crystalline silicon]] (c-Si), also known as \"solar grade silicon\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Bulk silicon is separated into multiple categories according to crystallinity and crystal size in the resulting [[ingot]], [[ribbon]] or [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]. These cells are entirely based around the concept of a [[p-n junction]].\nSolar cells made of c-Si are made from [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] between 160 and 240&nbsp;micrometers thick.\n\n==== Monocrystalline silicon ====\n{{Main|Monocrystalline silicon}}\n[[File:Sono Sion Front Back.jpg|thumb|The roof, bonnet and large parts of the outer shell of the [[Sion (electric car)|Sion]] are equipped with highly efficient monocrystalline silicon cells]]\n\n[[Monocrystalline silicon]] (mono-Si) solar cells are more efficient and more expensive than most other types of cells. The corners of the cells look clipped, like an octagon, because the wafer material is cut from cylindrical ingots, that are typically grown by the [[Czochralski process]]. Solar panels using mono-Si cells display a distinctive pattern of small white diamonds.\n\n====Epitaxial silicon development====\n[[Epitaxial wafer]]s of crystalline silicon can be grown on a monocrystalline silicon \"seed\" wafer by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), and then detached as self-supporting wafers of some standard thickness (e.g., 250&nbsp;\u00b5m) that can be manipulated by hand, and directly substituted for wafer cells cut from monocrystalline silicon ingots. Solar cells made with this \"[[Saw#Terminology|kerf]]less\" technique can have efficiencies approaching those of wafer-cut cells, but at appreciably lower cost if the CVD can be done at [[atmospheric pressure]] in a high-throughput inline process.<ref name=NexWafe/><ref name=\"Drie\u00dfenAmiri2016\"/> The surface of epitaxial wafers may be textured to enhance light absorption.<ref name=pyramid>{{cite journal| doi=10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b01240 | pmid=27525513 | title=Ultrathin Epitaxial Silicon Solar Cells with Inverted Nanopyramid Arrays for Efficient Light Trapping | first1= Alexandre| last1= Gaucher| first2= Andrea| last2= Cattoni| first3= Christophe| last3= Dupuis| first4= Wanghua| last4= Chen| first5= Romain| last5= Cariou|last6 = Foldyna| first6=Martin | last7=Lalouat | first7=Lo\u0131\u0308c | last8=Drouard | first8=Emmanuel | last9=Seassal | first9=Christian | last10=Roca i Cabarrocas | first10=Pere | last11=Collin | first11=St\u00e9phane | journal= Nano Letters| year= 2016| volume= 16| issue=9 | pages= 5358\u201364| bibcode=2016NanoL..16.5358G }}</ref><ref name=\"ChenCariou2016\">{{cite journal | last1=Chen | first1=Wanghua | last2=Cariou | first2=Romain | last3=Foldyna | first3=Martin | last4=Depauw | first4=Valerie | last5=Trompoukis | first5=Christos | last6=Drouard | first6=Emmanuel | last7=Lalouat | first7=Loic | last8=Harouri | first8=Abdelmounaim | last9=Liu | first9=Jia | last10=Fave | first10=Alain | last11=Orobtchouk | first11=R\u00e9gis | last12=Mandorlo | first12=Fabien | last13=Seassal | first13=Christian | last14=Massiot | first14=In\u00e8s | last15=Dmitriev | first15=Alexandre | last16=Lee | first16=Ki-Dong | last17=Cabarrocas | first17=Pere Roca i | title=Nanophotonics-based low-temperature PECVD epitaxial crystalline silicon solar cells | journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics | volume=49 | issue=12 | year=2016 | pages=125603 | issn=0022-3727 | doi=10.1088/0022-3727/49/12/125603| bibcode=2016JPhD...49l5603C }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, it was reported that [[heterojunction]] solar cells grown epitaxially on n-type monocrystalline silicon wafers had reached an efficiency of 22.5% over a total cell area of 243.4&nbsp;cm<math>^2</math>.<ref name=\"KobayashiWatabe2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Kobayashi|first1=Eiji|last2=Watabe|first2=Yoshimi|last3=Hao|first3=Ruiying|last4=Ravi|first4=T.

Based on the previous literature and some theoretical analysis, there are several reasons why GaAs has such high power conversion efficiency. First, GaAs bandgap is 1.43ev which is almost ideal for solar cells. Second, because Gallium is a by-product of the smelting of other metals, GaAs cells are relatively insensitive to heat and it can keep high efficiency when temperature is quite high. Third, GaAs has the wide range of design options. Using GaAs as active layer in solar cell, engineers can have multiple choices of other layers which can better generate electrons and holes in GaAs.\n\n=== Multijunction cells ===\n{{Main|Multi-junction solar cell}}\n[[File:Dawn solar panel.jpg|thumb|[[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]]'s 10&nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]] triple-junction gallium arsenide solar array at full extension]]\n\nMulti-junction cells consist of multiple thin films, each essentially a solar cell grown on top of another, typically using [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]].

It introduces an intermediate band (IB) energy level in between the valence and conduction bands. Theoretically, introducing an IB allows two [[photons]] with energy less than the [[bandgap]] to excite an electron from the [[valence band]] to the [[conduction band]]. This increases the induced photocurrent and thereby efficiency.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.78.5014|title=Increasing the Efficiency of Ideal Solar Cells by Photon Induced Transitions at Intermediate Levels|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=78|issue=26|pages=5014\u20135017|year=1997|last1=Luque|first1=Antonio|last2=Mart\u00ed|first2=Antonio|bibcode=1997PhRvL..78.5014L}}</ref>\n\n[[Antonio Luque L\u00f3pez|Luque]] and Marti first derived a theoretical limit for an IB device with one midgap energy level using [[detailed balance]].

Either of these techniques could be used to produce higher efficiency solar cells by allowing solar photons to be more efficiently used. The difficulty, however, is that the conversion efficiency of existing [[phosphor]]s exhibiting up- or down-conversion is low, and is typically narrow band.\n\nOne upconversion technique is to incorporate [[lanthanide]]-doped materials ([[Erbium|{{chem|Er|3+}}]], [[Ytterbium|{{chem|Yb|3+}}]], [[Holmium|{{chem|Ho|3+}}]] or a combination), taking advantage of their [[luminescence]] to convert [[infrared radiation]] to visible light. Upconversion process occurs when two [[infrared]] photons are absorbed by [[rare-earth]] [[ion]]s to generate a (high-energy) absorbable photon. As example, the energy transfer upconversion process (ETU), consists in successive transfer processes between excited ions in the near infrared. The upconverter material could be placed below the solar cell to absorb the infrared light that passes through the silicon. Useful ions are most commonly found in the trivalent state. {{chem|Er|+}} ions have been the most used. {{chem|Er|3+}} ions absorb solar radiation around 1.54&nbsp;\u00b5m. Two {{chem|Er|3+}} ions that have absorbed this radiation can interact with each other through an upconversion process. The excited ion emits light above the Si bandgap that is absorbed by the solar cell and creates an additional electron\u2013hole pair that can generate current. However, the increased efficiency was small. In addition, fluoroindate glasses have low [[phonon]] energy and have been proposed as suitable matrix doped with {{chem|Ho|3+}} ions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez|first=M.A.|author2=Imanieh, M.H. |author3=Mart\u00edn, L.L. |author4= Mart\u00edn, I.R. |title=Experimental enhancement of the photocurrent in a solar cell using upconversion process in fluoroindate glasses exciting at 1480nm|journal=Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells|date=September 2013|volume=116|pages=171\u2013175|doi=10.1016/j.solmat.2013.04.023}}</ref>\n\n=== Light-absorbing dyes ===\n{{Main|Dye-sensitized solar cell|l1=Dye-sensitized solar cells}}\n[[Dye-sensitized solar cell]]s (DSSCs) are made of low-cost materials and do not need elaborate manufacturing equipment, so they can be made in a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] fashion. In bulk it should be significantly less expensive than older [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] cell designs. DSSC's can be engineered into flexible sheets and although its [[conversion efficiency]] is less than the best [[thin film cell]]s, its [[price/performance ratio]] may be high enough to allow them to compete with [[fossil fuel electrical generation]].\n\nTypically a [[ruthenium]] [[Metalorganics|metalorganic]] [[dye]] (Ru-centered) is used as a [[monolayer]] of light-absorbing material. The dye-sensitized solar cell depends on a [[mesoporous]] layer of [[nanoparticulate]] [[titanium dioxide]] to greatly amplify the surface area (200\u2013300 m<sup>2</sup>/g {{chem|TiO|2}}, as compared to approximately 10 m<sup>2</sup>/g of flat single crystal). The photogenerated electrons from the light absorbing dye are passed on to the n-type {{chem|TiO|2}} and the holes are absorbed by an [[electrolyte]] on the other side of the dye. The circuit is completed by a [[redox]] couple in the electrolyte, which can be liquid or solid. This type of cell allows more flexible use of materials and is typically manufactured by [[screen printing]] or [[ultrasonic nozzle]]s, with the potential for lower processing costs than those used for bulk solar cells. However, the dyes in these cells also suffer from [[chemical decomposition|degradation]] under heat and [[UV]] light and the cell casing is difficult to [[Seal (mechanical)|seal]] due to the solvents used in assembly.

Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Patrick|author2=Green, Martin A. |title=Light Trapping Properties of Pyramidally textured surfaces|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|date=Feb 1987|volume=62|issue=1| pages=243\u2013249|doi=10.1063/1.339189|bibcode=1987JAP....62..243C}}</ref> Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhao|first=Jianhua|author2=Wang, Aihua |author3=Green, Martin A.|title=19.8% efficient \"honeycomb\" textured multicrystalline and 24.4% monocrystalline silicon solar cells|journal=Applied Physics Letters|date=May 1998|volume=73|issue=14| pages=1991\u20131993|doi=10.1063/1.122345|bibcode=1998ApPhL..73.1991Z}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Hauser|first=H.|author2=Michl, B.|author3=Kubler, V.|author4= Schwarzkopf, S.|author5= Muller, C.|author6= Hermle, M.|author7= Blasi, B.|title=Nanoimprint Lithography for Honeycomb Texturing of Multicrystalline Silicon|journal=Energy Procedia|date=2011|volume=8|pages=648\u2013653|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2011.06.196}}</ref> Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the [[OPTOS formalism]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tucher|first=Nico|last2=Eisenlohr|first2=Johannes|last3=Gebrewold|first3=Habtamu|last4=Kiefel|first4=Peter|last5=H\u00f6hn|first5=Oliver|last6=Hauser|first6=Hubert|last7=Goldschmidt|first7=Jan Christoph|last8=Bl\u00e4si|first8=Benedikt|date=11 July 2016|title=Optical simulation of photovoltaic modules with multiple textured interfaces using the matrix-based formalism OPTOS|journal=Optics Express|volume=24|issue=14|pages=A1083\u2013A1093|doi=10.1364/OE.24.0A1083|pmid=27410896|bibcode=2016OExpr..24A1083T}}</ref> In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mavrokefalos|first=Anastassios|author2=Han, Sang Eon. |author3=Yerci, Selcuk |author4= Branham, M.S.|author5= Chen, Gang. |title=Efficient Light Trapping in Inverted Nanopyramid Thin Crystalline Silicon Membranes for Solar Cell Applications|journal=Nano Letters|date=June 2012|volume=12|issue=6| pages=2792\u20132796|doi=10.1021/nl2045777|bibcode=2012NanoL..12.2792M |pmid=22612694|hdl=1721.1/86899}}</ref> In combination with [[anti-reflective coating]], surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell.

The encapsulants are commonly made from [[polyvinyl acetate]] or glass. Most encapsulants are uniform in structure and composition, which increases light collection owing to light trapping from total internal reflection of light within the resin. Research has been conducted into structuring the encapsulant to provide further collection of light.

However, the strict requirements for cleanliness and quality control of semiconductor fabrication are more relaxed for solar cells, lowering costs.\n\n[[Polycrystalline silicon]] wafers are made by wire-sawing block-cast silicon ingots into 180 to 350 micrometer wafers. The wafers are usually lightly [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]]-doped. A surface diffusion of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] dopants is performed on the front side of the wafer. This forms a p\u2013n junction a few hundred nanometers below the surface.\n\n[[Anti-reflective coating|Anti-reflection coatings]] are then typically applied to increase the amount of light coupled into the solar cell. [[Silicon nitride]] has gradually replaced titanium dioxide as the preferred material, because of its excellent surface passivation qualities. It prevents carrier recombination at the cell surface. A layer several hundred nanometers thick is applied using PECVD. Some solar cells have textured front surfaces that, like anti-reflection coatings, increase the amount of light reaching the wafer. Such surfaces were first applied to single-crystal silicon, followed by multicrystalline silicon somewhat later.\n\nA full area metal contact is made on the back surface, and a grid-like metal contact made up of fine \"fingers\" and larger \"bus bars\" are screen-printed onto the front surface using a [[silver]] paste. This is an evolution of the so-called \"wet\" process for applying electrodes, first described in a US patent filed in 1981 by [[Bayer AG]].<ref>Fitzky, Hans G. and Ebneth, Harold (24 May 1983) {{US patent|4385102}}, \"Large-area photovoltaic cell\"</ref> The rear contact is formed by screen-printing a metal paste, typically aluminium. Usually this contact covers the entire rear, though some designs employ a grid pattern. The paste is then fired at several hundred degrees Celsius to form metal electrodes in [[ohmic contact]] with the silicon. Some companies use an additional electro-plating step to increase efficiency. After the metal contacts are made, the solar cells are interconnected by flat wires or metal ribbons, and assembled into [[photovoltaic module|modules]] or \"solar panels\". Solar panels have a sheet of [[tempered glass]] on the front, and a [[polymer]] encapsulation on the back.\n\n== Manufacturers and certification ==\n{{Further|List of photovoltaics companies}}\n[[File:SolarCellProduction-E.PNG|thumb|right|190px|Solar cell production by region<ref name=\"pvnews\">[http://www.greentechmedia.com/research/report/pv-news Pv News November 2012].
