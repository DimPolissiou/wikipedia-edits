[[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to fund the construction of ten [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], which it did on 4 August 1790 (now celebrated as the Coast Guard's official birthday). Until the re-establishment of the Navy in 1798, these \"revenue cutters\" were the only naval force of the early United States. As such, the cutters and their crews frequently took on additional duties, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1122007,00.html |title=How the Coast Guard Gets it Right |first=Amanda |last=Ripley |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=23 October 2005 |access-date=11 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222051431/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1122007,00.html |archive-date=22 December 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915, when the Revenue Cutter Service merged with the [[United States Life-Saving Service|U.S. Life-Saving Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/h_USLHSchron.asp|title=Historic Light Stations|publisher=U.S. Coast Guard|accessdate=21 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121115043/http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/h_USLHSchron.asp|archive-date=21 January 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service|Lighthouse Service]] was brought under the Coast Guard's purview.

Approximately 200 cadets graduate each year, receiving a [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science degree]] and a commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the Coast Guard. Graduates are obligated to serve a minimum of five years on active duty. Most graduates are assigned to duty aboard Coast Guard cutters immediately after graduation, either as Deck Watch Officers (DWOs) or as Engineer Officers in Training (EOITs). Smaller numbers are assigned directly to flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], Florida or to shore duty at Coast Guard [[United States Coast Guard Sectors|Sector]], District, or Area headquarters units.\n\nIn addition to the Academy, prospective officers, who already hold a college degree, may enter the Coast Guard through [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS), also located at the Coast Guard Academy. OCS is a 17-week course of instruction that prepares candidates to serve effectively as officers in the Coast Guard. In addition to indoctrinating students into a military lifestyle, OCS provides a wide range of highly technical information necessary to perform the duties of a Coast Guard officer.\n\nGraduates of OCS are usually commissioned as ensigns, but some with advanced graduate degrees may enter as [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenants (junior grade)]] or [[lieutenant]]s. Graduating OCS officers entering active duty are required to serve a minimum of three years, while graduating reserve officers are required to serve four years. Graduates may be assigned to a cutter, flight training, a staff job, or an operations ashore billet.\n\nOCS is the primary channel through which the Coast Guard enlisted grades ascend to the commissioned officer corps.\n\nLawyers, engineers, intelligence officers, military aviators holding commissions in other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces requesting interservice transfers to the Coast Guard, graduates of maritime academies, and certain other individuals may also receive an officer's commission in the Coast Guard through the [[Direct Commission Officer]] (DCO) program. Depending on the specific program and the background of the individual, the course is three, four or five weeks long. The first week of the five-week course is an indoctrination week. The DCO program is designed to commission officers with highly specialized professional training or certain kinds of previous military experience.\n\nUnlike the other military services, the Coast Guard does not have a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) program.\n\n====Recruit training====\n[[File:Flags Across America 111105-G-ZR255-029.jpg|thumb|Recruit companies visiting Arlington National Cemetery for their one day of off-base liberty, which is their only break in an eight-week boot camp at the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey]]\nNewly enlisted personnel are sent to eight weeks of [[recruit training]] at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]]. New recruits arrive at [[Charles W. Sexton|Sexton Hall]] and remain there for three days of initial processing which includes haircuts, vaccinations, uniform issue, and other necessary entrance procedures. During this initial processing period, the new recruits are led by temporary company commanders. These temporary company commanders are tasked with teaching the new recruits how to march and preparing them to enter into their designated company. The temporary company commanders typically do not enforce any physical activity such as push ups or crunches. When the initial processing is complete, the new seaman recruits are introduced to their permanent company commanders who will remain with them until the end of training. There is typically a designated lead company commander and two support company commanders. The balance of the eight-week boot camp is spent in learning teamwork and developing physical skills. An introduction of how the Coast Guard operates with special emphasis on the Coast Guard's core values is an important part of the training.\n\nThe current nine Recruit Training Objectives are:\n* [[Self-discipline]]\n* Military skills\n* [[Shooting|Marksmanship]]\n* Vocational skills and academics\n* Military bearing\n* Physical fitness and wellness\n* Water survival and swim qualifications\n* [[Esprit de corps]]\n* [[U.S. Coast Guard#Symbols|Core values]] (Honor, Respect, and Devotion to Duty)\n\n====Service schools====\nFollowing graduation from recruit training, most members are sent to their first unit while they await orders to attend advanced training in [[Class \"A\" Schools]]. At \"A\" schools, Coast Guard enlisted personnel are trained in their chosen [[List of United States Coast Guard ratings|rating]]; rating is a Coast Guard and Navy term for enlisted skills synonymous with the Army's and Marine Corps' [[United States military occupation codes|military occupation codes]] (MOS) and Air Force's [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC). Members who earned high [[ASVAB]] scores or who were otherwise guaranteed an \"A\" School of choice while enlisting may go directly to their \"A\" School upon graduation from Boot Camp.\n\n===Civilian personnel and Specialty rates===\nThe Coast Guard employs over 8,577 civilians in over two hundred different job types including [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]] [[special agents]], lawyers, engineers, technicians, administrative personnel, tradesmen, and federal firefighters.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/civilian/default.asp |title=USCG Civilian Careers |publisher=United States Coast Guard |date=28 June 2013 |access-date=16 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110052727/http://www.uscg.mil/civilian/default.asp |archive-date=10 January 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Civilian employees work at various levels in the Coast Guard to support its various missions.\n\n==Equipment==\n{{main|List of equipment of the United States Coast Guard}}\n\n===Cutters===\n[[File:USCG National Security Cutter BERTHOLF (WMSL-750).jpeg|thumb|right|{{USCGC|Bertholf|WMSL-750}}, the first Legend-class national security cutters]]\nThe Coast Guard operates 243 Cutters,<ref name=\"uscg.mil1\"/> defined as any vessel  more than {{convert|65|ft}} long, that has a permanently assigned crew and accommodations for the extended support of that crew.<ref name=cutterdef>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5000_3B.pdf#page=122 |format=PDF |title=United States Coast Guard Regulations, Chapter 10 \u2013 Classification and Status of Coast Guard Vessels |year=1992 |id=COMDINSTM 5000.3B |access-date=6 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103063017/http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5000_3B.pdf#page=122 |archive-date=3 November 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[National Security Cutter]] (WMSL): Also known as the \"Legend\"-class, these are the Coast Guard's latest class of {{convert|418|ft|m|adj=on}} military defense  maritime ship.

Most of these air stations are tenant activities at civilian airports, several of which are former Air Force Bases and Naval Air Stations, although several are also independent military facilities. Coast Guard Air Stations are also located on active Naval Air Stations, [[Air National Guard]] bases, and Army Air Fields.\n\nCoast Guard aviators receive Primary (fixed-wing) and Advanced (fixed or rotary-wing) flight training with their Navy and Marine Corps counterparts at [[NAS Whiting Field]], Florida, and [[NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas, and are considered [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviators]]. After receiving [[Naval Aviator insignia|Naval Aviator Wings]], Coast Guard pilots, with the exception of those slated to fly the HC-130, report to [[Coast Guard Aviation Training Center|U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center, Mobile, Alabama]] to receive 6\u201312 weeks of specialized training in the Coast Guard fleet aircraft they will operate. HC-130 pilots report to [[Little Rock AFB]], Arkansas, for joint C-130 training under the auspices of the [[314th Airlift Wing]] of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].\n\nFixed-wing aircraft operate from Air Stations on long-duration missions. Helicopters operate from Air Stations and can deploy on a number of different cutters. Helicopters can rescue people or intercept vessels smuggling migrants or narcotics. Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Coast Guard has developed a more prominent role in national security and now has armed helicopters operating in high-risk areas for the purpose of maritime law enforcement and anti-terrorism.\n\nThe Coast Guard is now developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) program that will utilize the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper#US Homeland Security|MQ-9 Reaper]] platform for homeland security and search/rescue operations. To support this endeavor, the Coast Guard has partnered with the Navy and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] to study existing/emerging unmanned aerial system (UAS) capabilities within their respective organizations. As these systems mature, research and operational experience gleaned from this joint effort will enable the Coast Guard to develop its own cutter and land-based UAS capabilities.\n\n{{avilisthead|nonstandard}}\n|-\n!

The 3-inch gun's high rate of fire and availability of specialized ammunition make it a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, ground support and short-range anti-missile defense.\n*The MK 110 57mm gun, a radar-guided computer controlled variant of the [[Bofors 57 mm L/70 naval artillery gun|Bofors 57 mm gun]]. It is used on the [[Legend-class cutter|Legend-class cutter, also known as the National Security Cutter (NSC)]]. It is a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, and short-range anti-missile defense. The stealth mount has a reduced radar profile. Also, the gun has a small radar mounted on the gun barrel to measure muzzle velocity for fire control purposes and can change ammunition types instantly due to a dual-feed system. It can also be operated/fired manually using a joystick and video camera (mounted on gun).\n*The [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 0]] weapons system consists of an M242 Bushmaster 25mm chain gun and the Mk 88 Mod 0 machine gun mount. A manned system, its gyro-stabilization compensates for the pitching deck. It provides ships with defensive and offensive gunfire capability for the engagement of a variety of surface targets. Designed primarily as a close-range defensive measure, it provides protection against patrol boats, floating mines, and various shore-based targets.\n*The [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 2]] weapons system is a remotely operated Mk 38 with an electronic optical sight, laser range-finder, [[FLIR]], a more reliable feeding system, all of which enhance the weapon systems capabilities and accuracy.\n*The [[Phalanx CIWS]] (pronounced \"sea-wiz\") is a close-in weapon system for defense against aircraft and anti-ship missiles. it can also be used against a variety of surface targets. Consisting of a radar-guided 20&nbsp;mm 6-barreled [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon mounted on a swiveling base, it is used on the Coast Guard's High Endurance Cutters. This system can operate autonomously against airborne threats or may be manually operated with the use of electronic optical sight, laser range-finder and FLIR systems against surface targets.\n*The [[CROWS|Sea PROTECTOR MK50]] is a remotely controlled gyro-stabilized [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun]]. The sight package includes a daylight video camera, a thermal camera and an eye-safe laser rangefinder operated by a joystick. It is also furnished with a fully integrated fire control system that provides ballistic correction. The Mk50s are used on only four [[Marine Protector-class patrol boat|Marine Protector-class]] Cutters, the {{USCGC|Sea Fox|WPB-87374}}, {{USCGC|Sea Devil|WPB-87368}}, {{USCGC|Sea Dragon|WPB-87367}} and {{USCGC|Sea Dog|WPB-87373}}\n\n====Small arms and light weapons====\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard uses a wide variety of small arms and light weapons.

The emblem is a blue eagle from the coat of arms of the United States on a white field.

Conversely, black-hulled cutters (such as buoy tenders and inland construction tenders) use the standard racing stripe. Auxiliary vessels maintained by the Coast Guard also carry the Racing Stripe, but in inverted colors (i.e., broad blue stripe with narrow white and CG red stripes) and the Auxiliary shield.\n\nThe Racing Stripe, officially known as the Service Mark, was designed in 1964 by the industrial design office of [[Raymond Loewy]] Associates to give the Coast Guard a distinctive, modern image. Loewy had designed the colors for the Air Force One fleet for [[Jackie Kennedy]]. President [[John F.

These were minor, primarily consisting of distinctive cap devices for officers and chief petty officers, incorporation of the Coast Guard shield in lieu of line or staff corps insignia for officers, and different buttons on dress uniforms.\n\nIn 1974, the current Coast Guard Service Dress Blue \"Bravo\" uniform was introduced for wear by both officers and enlisted personnel; the transition was completed during 1974. The uniform consists of a blue four-pocket single breasted jacket and trousers, a light-blue button-up shirt with a pointed collar, two front button-flap pockets, and shoulder loops, along with a tie of the same shade as the jacket are worn with the uniform.

Additionally, a sword may be prescribed for officers, and white gloves may be required. A white belt may be worn for [[honor guard]]s.\n\nThe Tropical Blue uniform, worn in warm weather, omits the jacket and tie, and features a short-sleeved, light blue shirt (identical to that worn by the [[U.S. Air Force]]) with rank insignia on shoulder boards for officers, and pin-on collar insignia for petty officers. The Tropical Blue uniform may be worn year-round for general office wear and for visits between commands. It may be worn in lieu of the SDB uniform, but not to functions where civilian dress is coat and tie.<ref name=\"UniformRegs\" />\n\nDespite the transition to distinctive \"Bender's blues\" uniforms in the 1970s, some Navy-style dress uniforms were retained. The Service Dress White and Full Dress White \"choker\" uniforms for officers are identical to those worn by U.S. Navy officers (aside from service-specific buttons, insignia and sword design). These are typically used for formal parade and [[Change of command|change-of-command]] ceremonies. For similar occasions the enlisted members wear Tropical Blue, Service Dress Blue or Full Dress Blue. The [[mess dress|dinner dress]] uniforms worn for formal (black tie) evening ceremonies are also identical to those of the Navy, aside from Coast Guard-specific insignia. As in the Navy, these uniforms are required for officers, but optional for enlisted members. Due to the expense of these uniforms and the fact that they are rarely called-for, few junior enlisted members purchase them.\n\n[[File:Members of the U.S. Coast Guard Pipe Band march up Fifth Avenue in the 250th St. Patrick's Day Parade, Manhattan, N.Y., March 17, 2010.jpg|thumb|The U.S. Coast Guard Pipe Band in New York during the 2010 [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States#New York City|St. Patrick's Day Parade]]]]\n\nThe current working uniform of the Coast Guard is the [[Operational Dress Uniform]] (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round primarily as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an office environment where appropriate. The ODU is similar to the old-style [[Battle Dress Uniform]] previously worn by all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn with the blouse tucked into the trousers. The second generation ODU is worn with the blouse untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the right breast pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style ball cap is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with \"U.S. Coast Guard.\" Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] and the [[NOAA Corps]] to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular [[Navy Working Uniform]] Type I.\n\nCoast Guard personnel serving in expeditionary combat units such as [[Port Security Unit]]s or Law Enforcement Detachments, and Coast Guard personnel deployed overseas (e.g. [[PATFORSWA]]) wear the [[Navy Working Uniform]] Type III with distinctive Coast Guard insignia, and generally follow Navy Uniform Regulations.\n\n[[File:USCG Cadet Fall Parade Uniform.jpg|thumb|left|Coast Guard cadets wearing Full Dress Blue (B) uniforms]]\nAll Coast Guardsmen wear the [[Peaked cap|combination cap]] with all uniforms except the ODU and CUU.

Coast Guard reservists possess the same training and qualifications as their active duty counterparts, and as such, can be found augmenting active duty Coast Guard units every day.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] and shortly thereafter, the Coast Guard considered abandoning the reserve program, but the force was instead reoriented into force augmentation, where its principal focus was not just reserve operations, but to add to the readiness and mission execution of every-day active duty personnel.\n\nSince 11 September 2001, reservists have been activated and served on tours of active duty, to include deployments to the [[Persian Gulf]] and also as parts of Department of Defense combatant commands such as the [[United States Northern Command|U.S. Northern]] and [[United States Central Command|Central]] Commands. Coast Guard Port Security Units are entirely staffed with reservists, except for five to seven active duty personnel.

[[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to fund the construction of ten [[Cutter (boat)|cutters]], which it did on 4 August 1790 (now celebrated as the Coast Guard's official birthday). Until the re-establishment of the Navy in 1798, these \"revenue cutters\" were the only naval force of the early United States.

Approximately 200 cadets graduate each year, receiving a [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science degree]] and a commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] in the Coast Guard. Graduates are obligated to serve a minimum of five years on active duty. Most graduates are assigned to duty aboard Coast Guard cutters immediately after graduation, either as Deck Watch Officers (DWOs) or as Engineer Officers in Training (EOITs). Smaller numbers are assigned directly to flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], Florida or to shore duty at Coast Guard [[United States Coast Guard Sectors|Sector]], District, or Area headquarters units.\n\nIn addition to the Academy, prospective officers, who already hold a college degree, may enter the Coast Guard through [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS), also located at the Coast Guard Academy. OCS is a 17-week course of instruction that prepares candidates to serve effectively as officers in the Coast Guard. In addition to indoctrinating students into a military lifestyle, OCS provides a wide range of highly technical information necessary to perform the duties of a Coast Guard officer.\n\nGraduates of OCS are usually commissioned as ensigns, but some with advanced graduate degrees may enter as [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenants (junior grade)]] or [[lieutenant]]s. Graduating OCS officers entering active duty are required to serve a minimum of three years, while graduating reserve officers are required to serve four years. Graduates may be assigned to a cutter, flight training, a staff job, or an operations ashore billet.\n\nOCS is the primary channel through which the Coast Guard enlisted grades ascend to the commissioned officer corps.\n\nLawyers, engineers, intelligence officers, military aviators holding commissions in other branches of the U.S. Armed Forces requesting interservice transfers to the Coast Guard, graduates of maritime academies, and certain other individuals may also receive an officer's commission in the Coast Guard through the [[Direct Commission Officer]] (DCO) program. Depending on the specific program and the background of the individual, the course is three, four or five weeks long. The first week of the five-week course is an indoctrination week. The DCO program is designed to commission officers with highly specialized professional training or certain kinds of previous military experience.\n\nUnlike the other military services, the Coast Guard does not have a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) program.\n\n====Recruit training====\n[[File:Flags Across America 111105-G-ZR255-029.jpg|thumb|Recruit companies visiting Arlington National Cemetery for their one day of off-base liberty, which is their only break in an eight-week boot camp at the Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey]]\nNewly enlisted personnel are sent to eight weeks of [[recruit training]] at [[United States Coast Guard Training Center Cape May|Coast Guard Training Center Cape May]] in [[Cape May, New Jersey]]. New recruits arrive at [[Charles W. Sexton|Sexton Hall]] and remain there for three days of initial processing which includes haircuts, vaccinations, uniform issue, and other necessary entrance procedures. During this initial processing period, the new recruits are led by temporary company commanders. These temporary company commanders are tasked with teaching the new recruits how to march and preparing them to enter into their designated company. The temporary company commanders typically do not enforce any physical activity such as push ups or crunches. When the initial processing is complete, the new seaman recruits are introduced to their permanent company commanders who will remain with them until the end of training. There is typically a designated lead company commander and two support company commanders. The balance of the eight-week boot camp is spent in learning teamwork and developing physical skills. An introduction of how the Coast Guard operates with special emphasis on the Coast Guard's core values is an important part of the training.\n\nThe current nine Recruit Training Objectives are:\n* [[Self-discipline]]\n* Military skills\n* [[Shooting|Marksmanship]]\n* Vocational skills and academics\n* Military bearing\n* Physical fitness and wellness\n* Water survival and swim qualifications\n* [[Esprit de corps]]\n* [[U.S. Coast Guard#Symbols|Core values]] (Honor, Respect, and Devotion to Duty)\n\n====Service schools====\nFollowing graduation from recruit training, most members are sent to their first unit while they await orders to attend advanced training in [[Class \"A\" Schools]]. At \"A\" schools, Coast Guard enlisted personnel are trained in their chosen [[List of United States Coast Guard ratings|rating]]; rating is a Coast Guard and Navy term for enlisted skills synonymous with the Army's and Marine Corps' [[United States military occupation codes|military occupation codes]] (MOS) and Air Force's [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC). Members who earned high [[ASVAB]] scores or who were otherwise guaranteed an \"A\" School of choice while enlisting may go directly to their \"A\" School upon graduation from Boot Camp.\n\n===Civilian personnel and Specialty rates===\nThe Coast Guard employs over 8,577 civilians in over two hundred different job types including [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]] [[special agents]], lawyers, engineers, technicians, administrative personnel, tradesmen, and federal firefighters.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/civilian/default.asp |title=USCG Civilian Careers |publisher=United States Coast Guard |date=28 June 2013 |access-date=16 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110052727/http://www.uscg.mil/civilian/default.asp |archive-date=10 January 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Civilian employees work at various levels in the Coast Guard to support its various missions.\n\n==Equipment==\n{{main|List of equipment of the United States Coast Guard}}\n\n===Cutters===\n[[File:USCG National Security Cutter BERTHOLF (WMSL-750).jpeg|thumb|right|{{USCGC|Bertholf|WMSL-750}}, the first Legend-class national security cutters]]\nThe Coast Guard operates 243 Cutters,<ref name=\"uscg.mil1\"/> defined as any vessel  more than {{convert|65|ft}} long, that has a permanently assigned crew and accommodations for the extended support of that crew.<ref name=cutterdef>{{cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5000_3B.pdf#page=122 |format=PDF |title=United States Coast Guard Regulations, Chapter 10 \u2013 Classification and Status of Coast Guard Vessels |year=1992 |id=COMDINSTM 5000.3B |access-date=6 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103063017/http://www.uscg.mil/directives/cim/5000-5999/CIM_5000_3B.pdf#page=122 |archive-date=3 November 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* [[National Security Cutter]] (WMSL): Also known as the \"Legend\"-class, these are the Coast Guard's latest class of {{convert|418|ft|m|adj=on}} military defense  maritime ship.

Most of these air stations are tenant activities at civilian airports, several of which are former Air Force Bases and Naval Air Stations, although several are also independent military facilities. Coast Guard Air Stations are also located on active Naval Air Stations, [[Air National Guard]] bases, and Army Air Fields.\n\nCoast Guard aviators receive Primary (fixed-wing) and Advanced (fixed or rotary-wing) flight training with their Navy and Marine Corps counterparts at [[NAS Whiting Field]], Florida, and [[NAS Corpus Christi]], Texas, and are considered [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviators]]. After receiving [[Naval Aviator insignia|Naval Aviator Wings]], Coast Guard pilots, with the exception of those slated to fly the HC-130, report to [[Coast Guard Aviation Training Center|U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center, Mobile, Alabama]] to receive 6\u201312 weeks of specialized training in the Coast Guard fleet aircraft they will operate. HC-130 pilots report to [[Little Rock AFB]], Arkansas, for joint C-130 training under the auspices of the [[314th Airlift Wing]] of the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].\n\nFixed-wing aircraft operate from Air Stations on long-duration missions. Helicopters operate from Air Stations and can deploy on a number of different cutters. Helicopters can rescue people or intercept vessels smuggling migrants or narcotics. Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the Coast Guard has developed a more prominent role in national security and now has armed helicopters operating in high-risk areas for the purpose of maritime law enforcement and anti-terrorism.\n\nThe Coast Guard is now developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) program that will utilize the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper#US Homeland Security|MQ-9 Reaper]] platform for homeland security and search/rescue operations. To support this endeavor, the Coast Guard has partnered with the Navy and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] to study existing/emerging unmanned aerial system (UAS) capabilities within their respective organizations. As these systems mature, research and operational experience gleaned from this joint effort will enable the Coast Guard to develop its own cutter and land-based UAS capabilities.\n\n{{avilisthead|nonstandard}}\n|-\n!

The 3-inch gun's high rate of fire and availability of specialized ammunition make it a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, ground support and short-range anti-missile defense.\n*The MK 110 57mm gun, a radar-guided computer controlled variant of the [[Bofors 57 mm L/70 naval artillery gun|Bofors 57 mm gun]]. It is used on the [[Legend-class cutter|Legend-class cutter, also known as the National Security Cutter (NSC)]]. It is a multi-purpose gun capable of anti-shipping, anti-aircraft, and short-range anti-missile defense. The stealth mount has a reduced radar profile. Also, the gun has a small radar mounted on the gun barrel to measure muzzle velocity for fire control purposes and can change ammunition types instantly due to a dual-feed system. It can also be operated/fired manually using a joystick and video camera (mounted on gun).\n*The [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 0]] weapons system consists of an M242 Bushmaster 25mm chain gun and the Mk 88 Mod 0 machine gun mount. A manned system, its gyro-stabilization compensates for the pitching deck. It provides ships with defensive and offensive gunfire capability for the engagement of a variety of surface targets. Designed primarily as a close-range defensive measure, it provides protection against patrol boats, floating mines, and various shore-based targets.\n*The [[M242 Bushmaster|Mk 38 Mod 2]] weapons system is a remotely operated Mk 38 with an electronic optical sight, laser range-finder, [[FLIR]], a more reliable feeding system, all of which enhance the weapon systems capabilities and accuracy.\n*The [[Phalanx CIWS]] (pronounced \"sea-wiz\") is a close-in weapon system for defense against aircraft and anti-ship missiles. it can also be used against a variety of surface targets. Consisting of a radar-guided 20&nbsp;mm 6-barreled [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon mounted on a swiveling base, it is used on the Coast Guard's High Endurance Cutters. This system can operate autonomously against airborne threats or may be manually operated with the use of electronic optical sight, laser range-finder and FLIR systems against surface targets.\n*The [[CROWS|Sea PROTECTOR MK50]] is a remotely controlled gyro-stabilized [[M2 Browning machine gun|M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun]]. The sight package includes a daylight video camera, a thermal camera and an eye-safe laser rangefinder operated by a joystick. It is also furnished with a fully integrated fire control system that provides ballistic correction. The Mk50s are used on only four [[Marine Protector-class patrol boat|Marine Protector-class]] Cutters, the {{USCGC|Sea Fox|WPB-87374}}, {{USCGC|Sea Devil|WPB-87368}}, {{USCGC|Sea Dragon|WPB-87367}} and {{USCGC|Sea Dog|WPB-87373}}\n\n====Small arms and light weapons====\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard uses a wide variety of small arms and light weapons.

The ensign was originally intended to be flown only on revenue cutters and boats connected with the Customs Service but over the years it was found flying atop custom houses as well, and the practice became a requirement in 1874. On 7 June 1910, President [[William Howard Taft]] issued an Executive Order adding an emblem to (or \"[[Defacement (flag)|defacing]]\") the ensign flown by the Revenue cutters to distinguish it from what is now called the [[:File:Flag of the United States Customs Service.svg|Customs Ensign]] flown from the custom houses.

Conversely, black-hulled cutters (such as buoy tenders and inland construction tenders) use the standard racing stripe. Auxiliary vessels maintained by the Coast Guard also carry the Racing Stripe, but in inverted colors (i.e., broad blue stripe with narrow white and CG red stripes) and the Auxiliary shield.\n\nThe Racing Stripe, officially known as the Service Mark, was designed in 1964 by the industrial design office of [[Raymond Loewy]] Associates to give the Coast Guard a distinctive, modern image. Loewy had designed the colors for the Air Force One fleet for [[Jackie Kennedy]]. President [[John F.

These were minor, primarily consisting of distinctive cap devices for officers and chief petty officers, incorporation of the Coast Guard shield in lieu of line or staff corps insignia for officers, and different buttons on dress uniforms.\n\nIn 1974, the current Coast Guard Service Dress Blue \"Bravo\" uniform was introduced for wear by both officers and enlisted personnel; the transition was completed during 1974. The uniform consists of a blue four-pocket single breasted jacket and trousers, a light-blue button-up shirt with a pointed collar, two front button-flap pockets, and shoulder loops, along with a tie of the same shade as the jacket are worn with the uniform. Either the [[garrison cap]] or [[combination cap]] may be worn.

Enlisted personnel do not wear collar devices with the white shirt.\n\nFull Dress Blue is essentially the same as Service Dress Blue \"Alpha,\" except that it is worn with a full-size medals instead of ribbons. Additionally, a sword may be prescribed for officers, and white gloves may be required. A white belt may be worn for [[honor guard]]s.\n\nThe Tropical Blue uniform, worn in warm weather, omits the jacket and tie, and features a short-sleeved, light blue shirt (identical to that worn by the [[U.S. Air Force]]) with rank insignia on shoulder boards for officers, and pin-on collar insignia for petty officers. The Tropical Blue uniform may be worn year-round for general office wear and for visits between commands. It may be worn in lieu of the SDB uniform, but not to functions where civilian dress is coat and tie.<ref name=\"UniformRegs\" />\n\nDespite the transition to distinctive \"Bender's blues\" uniforms in the 1970s, some Navy-style dress uniforms were retained. The Service Dress White and Full Dress White \"choker\" uniforms for officers are identical to those worn by U.S. Navy officers (aside from service-specific buttons, insignia and sword design). These are typically used for formal parade and [[Change of command|change-of-command]] ceremonies. For similar occasions the enlisted members wear Tropical Blue, Service Dress Blue or Full Dress Blue. The [[mess dress|dinner dress]] uniforms worn for formal (black tie) evening ceremonies are also identical to those of the Navy, aside from Coast Guard-specific insignia. As in the Navy, these uniforms are required for officers, but optional for enlisted members. Due to the expense of these uniforms and the fact that they are rarely called-for, few junior enlisted members purchase them.\n\n[[File:Members of the U.S. Coast Guard Pipe Band march up Fifth Avenue in the 250th St. Patrick's Day Parade, Manhattan, N.Y., March 17, 2010.jpg|thumb|The U.S. Coast Guard Pipe Band in New York during the 2010 [[Saint Patrick's Day in the United States#New York City|St. Patrick's Day Parade]]]]\n\nThe current working uniform of the Coast Guard is the [[Operational Dress Uniform]] (ODU). The ODU may be worn year-round primarily as a field utility and watchstanding uniform, but may also be worn in an office environment where appropriate. The ODU is similar to the old-style [[Battle Dress Uniform]] previously worn by all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, both in function and style. However, the ODU is in a solid dark blue with no camouflage pattern and does not have lower pockets on the blouse. The first generation ODU, in service from 2004 to 2012, was worn with the blouse tucked into the trousers. The second generation ODU is worn with the blouse untucked and has black Coast Guard insignia embroidered on the right breast pocket as well as the side pockets of the trousers. The ODU is worn with composite-toed boots in most circumstances, but low-cut brown boat shoes may be prescribed for certain vessel boarding operations. A standard baseball-style ball cap is worn, embroidered in gold block lettering with \"U.S. Coast Guard.\" Units may also additionally authorize ball caps with the unit name embroidered for wear while on the unit. A foul weather parka is the outerwear worn with the ODU. The ODU's success and practicality as a working uniform has led the [[U.S. Public Health Service]] and the [[NOAA Corps]] to adopt ODU variants as standard working uniforms. Some Navy personnel also advocated adoption of the ODU as a standard shipboard uniform for the Navy, rather than the unpopular [[Navy Working Uniform]] Type I.\n\nCoast Guard personnel serving in expeditionary combat units such as [[Port Security Unit]]s or Law Enforcement Detachments, and Coast Guard personnel deployed overseas (e.g. [[PATFORSWA]]) wear the [[Navy Working Uniform]] Type III with distinctive Coast Guard insignia, and generally follow Navy Uniform Regulations.\n\n[[File:USCG Cadet Fall Parade Uniform.jpg|thumb|left|Coast Guard cadets wearing Full Dress Blue (B) uniforms]]\nAll Coast Guardsmen wear the [[Peaked cap|combination cap]] with all uniforms except the ODU and CUU. Company commanders (the Coast Guard's equivalent of [[drill sergeant]]s) at Training Center Cape May wear the traditional Smokey Bear-style [[campaign hat]].\n\nThe Coast Guard Pipe Band, a special musical unit composed of active, reserve and auxiliary members, wears a modified form of [[highland dress]], including [[kilt]] and [[sporran]]. It is, along with the [[Uniforms of the United States Air Force#Highland dress|Band of the Air Force Reserve Pipe Band]], one of only two kilted units in the United States military, excluding those maintained by [[state guard|state defense forces]] and service academies. The band's kilt is patterned in the official U.S. Coast Guard [[tartan]], which is registered with the [[Scottish Register of Tartans]] and based on the Hamilton tartan (in honor of the founder of the Revenue-Marine, [[Alexander Hamilton]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails.aspx?ref=4184|title=Tartan Details - The Scottish Register of Tartans|first=National Records of|last=Scotland|access-date=11 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601015132/https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails.aspx?ref=4184|archive-date=1 June 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCadets at the [[U.S. Coast Guard Academy]] wear standard Coast Guard uniforms, but also wear two different styles of parade dress uniforms, similar to those worn by [[Midshipman#United States Navy and Merchant Marine Academy|Midshipmen]] at the [[U.S. Naval Academy]].

Coast Guard reservists possess the same training and qualifications as their active duty counterparts, and as such, can be found augmenting active duty Coast Guard units every day.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]] and shortly thereafter, the Coast Guard considered abandoning the reserve program, but the force was instead reoriented into force augmentation, where its principal focus was not just reserve operations, but to add to the readiness and mission execution of every-day active duty personnel.\n\nSince 11 September 2001, reservists have been activated and served on tours of active duty, to include deployments to the [[Persian Gulf]] and also as parts of Department of Defense combatant commands such as the [[United States Northern Command|U.S. Northern]] and [[United States Central Command|Central]] Commands. Coast Guard Port Security Units are entirely staffed with reservists, except for five to seven active duty personnel.

Meier had created ''Civilization'' but had moved on to other projects.  MicroProse wanted to make a sequel and asked Reynolds to design it. MicroProse put Meier on retainer for consultational advice and for the use of his name, but Meier only had peripheral involvement in the design of this game.

First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the [[Berthier rifle|Berthier]] and [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel]] series of [[service rifle]]s, it saw service long past the [[World War II]] period. It was manufactured from late 1937 onward by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Only 250,000 MAS-36 rifles were available to equip the French [[infantry]] during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the [[First Indochina War]], the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Altogether, about 1.1 million MAS-36 rifles had been manufactured when production ceased in 1952.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:MAS36 crop.jpg|thumb|Pre World War II produced MAS-36]]\n\nThe MAS-36 is a short carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern rimless [[7.5\u00d754mm French]] cartridge; a shortened version of the [[7.5\u00d757mm MAS|7.5\u00d757mm MAS mod. 1924]] cartridge that had been introduced in 1924 (then modified in 1929), for France's [[FM 24/29 light machine gun]]. The rifle was developed based on French experience in World War I and combines various features of other rifles like the two rear locking lugs of the British [[Lee-Enfield|SMLE]] rifle (easy to clean and resistant to dirt), the ''dog leg'' shaped bolt handle of the British [[Pattern 1914 Enfield|P14]]/U.S. [[M1917 Enfield]] rifle that places the bolt knob at a favorable ergonomic position in relation to the trigger and [[peep sight]], and the five-round box magazine (claw extractor) of the German [[Gewehr 98]] which stored 5 rounds in a staggered column and fed by 5-round [[stripper clips]]), to produce an \"ugly, roughly made, but immensely strong and reliable\" service rifle.<ref>Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, Harper Collins Publishers, 2005, page 238</ref>\n\nThere are just five user removable parts: a Lebel-type cruciform bayonet inserted into a guard tube under the barrel (taken out by the stopper and turned by snap-fastening the stopper in the tube to fix), the bolt body, the bolt rear cap, the firing pin and the spring of the firing pin. The metal parts of the rifle were black baked in an oven.\n\nThe MAS-36 bolt handle was bent forward in an \"awkward fashion\" to bring it into a convenient position for the soldier's hand. Some have since been found bent backwards into a facing-downwards position like that of many other bolt-action rifles.<ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, Kruse Publications, 2000, page 182</ref> The MAS-36 had a relatively short barrel and was fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. Typical for French rifles of the period, the MAS-36 had no manual [[Safety (firearms)|safety]].<ref name=\"ESAA\">{{cite book\n  | last = Bishop | first = Chris\n  | title = The Encyclopedia of Small Arms and Artillery\n  | publisher = Grange Books\n  | year = 2006\n  | isbn = 978-1-84013-910-5\n  | page = 47\n}}</ref>\n\nThe rifle was designed with an [[iron sight]] line consisting of a rear a tangent-type aperture sight element that was calibrated for 7.5\u00d754mm French mle1929 C ammunition for {{convert|100|-|1200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments. The original front sighting element was milled and consisted of a front post that was protected by two open 'ears'.\nThere were 25 rear aperture elements available for the sight line to optimize it horizontally and laterally  in 2.32 [[Minute and second of arc|MOA]] increments during assembly at the arsenal. These arsenal mounted rear aperture elements shifted to point of aim {{convert|13.5|or|27|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} left or right or up or down at a range of {{convert|200|m|yd|0}}.\nIt is worth noting that the front stock fittings are a major component of setting the sights on a MAS-36. To discourage disassembling the front stock non-standard screws with a spanner head were used on the barrel band and nose caps. Only armorers were issued with the appropriate screw drivers to remove the front stock. If removed the front stock will probably face quite a bit of trial and error in getting the screws set back to their exact positions again.\n\nIt was normally carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier was engaged in combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike [[bayonet]], reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle. The initial implementation of this bayonet design has a distinct (although, uncommonly<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> encountered) disadvantage: with a bayonet stored in one rifle and the other empty, the top of the stored bayonet could be locked into the empty bayonet tube of the second rifle. This obscures the release button on the bayonet and results in permanently (at least up to destructive disassembly) mated rifles. In post-war use the French updated the bayonet storage design by drilling a hole in the bayonet, which allowed the locking catch to be depressed through an already-dilled hole in the bayonet cap.<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> Like the Lebel model 1886 rifle, the MAS-36 featured a stacking hook offset to the right side of the barrel for standing a number of the rifles (usually a trio) upright.\n\n==Background==\nThe MAS-36 was intended as an economical simple bolt action rifle to serve with rear echelon, colonial and reserve troops alongside and meant to share machining and pave the way for a new standard [[semi-automatic rifle]] before the next big conflict. The first French [[semi-automatic rifle]] evolved from the prototype MAS-38/39. A limited number of MAS-40 semi-automatic rifles entered trail service in March 1940. The [[Battle of France]] and following German occupation of France prevented large scale introduction of semi-automatic service rifles amongst French front line troops. During the 1950s the French military adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49 rifle]] as their standard service rifle.\n\nThough intended to replace the [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel Model 1886]] and Berthier rifles as well as [[Berthier carbine]]s, budget constraints limited MAS-36 production, and it served along with the former rifles in many French army and colonial units.  During World War II, the MAS-36 was used alongside the Lebel 1886 and Berthiers during the Battle of France. After the [[Battle of France]], the Germans took over a large number of MAS-36s, which were given the designation ''Gewehr 242(f)'' and put into service with their own garrison units based in occupied France and later the [[Volkssturm]].<ref name=\"ESAA\" />\n\n==Further development==\nPost World War II produced rifles feature production simplifications like stamped nose caps with a hooded front sight element, stamped magazine floor plates, a stamped front sling attachment featuring a ring, a protective measure to prevent dirt ingress in the trigger area and a side-mounted cam track and button to dial and lock the selected firing range on the rear sight element. The hooded front sight element reduced [[glare (vision)|glare]] under unfavorable light conditions and added extra protection for the post. The bolt of post World War II produced rifles can not be closed on an empty chamber, indicating the rifle needs to be reloaded. Later post war batches feature [[phosphate conversion coating|phosphating]]/[[Parkerizing]] introduced as a more effective metal surface treatment against rust. The \"second model\" is the most produced version with its derivative, the MAS 36/51.\n\n==Postwar usage==\n[[File:Crs larzac2.jpg|thumb|In service with the French Police [[Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9]] during the [[fight for the Larzac]] in 1978.]]\nThe MAS-36 was extensively used by French Army and colonial defense forces during France's postwar counter-insurgency operations in the [[First Indochina War]] and the [[Algerian War]],<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-12-13-texte-integral}}</ref> as well as in the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |last=McNab |first=Chris|title=20th Century Military Uniforms |year=2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|page=85}}</ref> During the Suez Crisis, French paratroop marksmen of the ''2\u00e8me RPC'' (''R\u00e9giment de Parachutistes Coloniaux''), employed telescope-sighted MAS-36 rifles to eliminate enemy snipers.<ref>Leuliette, Pierre, ''St. Michael and the Dragon: Memoirs of a Paratrooper'', Houghton Mifflin (1964)</ref>  The MAS-36 remained in service into the early 1960s as an infantry rifle, often serving with indigenous colonial units.

These half-stocked rifles were chambered for the [[7\u00d754mm Fournier]] (common, 7.5x54mm necked down to 7mm), [[7\u00d757mm Mauser]] (very rare), [[8\u00d760mm S]] (less common), and [[10.75\u00d768mm]] (rare). Hunting rifles in the two latter calibers had integral muzzle brakes. Also imported into the United States were a few military surplus MAS-36 rifles, converted to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO from 7.5\u00d754mm. These rifles were modified to chamber the NATO round and also had an [[SKS]] type trigger safety fitted to them.\n\nIn [[Comoros]], the French had a decent amount of MAS-36 rifles in storage during WWII and the [[Post-war]] era. When Comoros became in independent nation in 1975, the rifles were given to the new [[Military of the Comoros|Comoros Army]]. The MAS-36 was widely used during many of the coups and attempted coups that took place on the island nation from 1975 to 1989. After a reformation of the Comoros Army in 1990, the MAS-36 was replaced with newer weapons such as the [[AK-47]].<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>\n\nIn 1941, Britain and [[Free France]] occupied Syria, bringing thousands of MAS-36 rifles with them. When French forces departed from Syria in 1946, the rifles were given to the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] in order to arm their own [[Syrian Army|army]] and militias, as the Syrian government at the time was perceived as pro-western. The MAS-36 was widely used by Syrian forces in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. The Israeli victory and later, a coup in Syria led to Syria's loyalty shifting towards the [[Soviet Union]] instead of western countries. After purchasing large quantities of Soviet weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, the MAS-36 became obsolete with thousands of units being sent into government storage facilities. In 2011 during the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Syrian opposition]] forces captured thousands of the stored rifles. With nearly all of the rifles being still operational, the [[Free Syrian Army]] widely used the MAS-36 from 2011 to 2015. From 2015 onward, the Free Syrian Army is decreasing the use of the MAS-36 due to scarcity of the rifle's needed 7.5mm ammunition.<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>\n\n===FR F1 and FR F2 sniper rifles===\nThe French [[FR F1]] and [[FR F2]] sniper rifles utilize the same basic bolt design as the MAS-36 infantry rifle.

First adopted in 1936 by France and intended to replace the [[Berthier rifle|Berthier]] and [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel]] series of [[service rifle]]s, it saw service long past the [[World War II]] period. It was manufactured from late 1937 onward by Manufacture d'Armes de Saint-\u00c9tienne (MAS), one of several government-owned arms factories in France. Only 250,000 MAS-36 rifles were available to equip the French [[infantry]] during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940. Mass production finally caught up after World War II and MAS-36 rifles became widely used in service during the [[First Indochina War]], the [[Algerian War]] and the [[Suez Crisis]]. Altogether, about 1.1 million MAS-36 rifles had been manufactured when production ceased in 1952.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:MAS36 crop.jpg|thumb|Pre World War II produced MAS-36]]\n\nThe MAS-36 is a short carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern rimless [[7.5\u00d754mm French]] cartridge; a shortened version of the [[7.5\u00d757mm MAS|7.5\u00d757mm MAS mod. 1924]] cartridge that had been introduced in 1924 (then modified in 1929), for France's [[FM 24/29 light machine gun]]. The rifle was developed based on French experience in World War I and combines various features of other rifles like the two rear locking lugs of the British [[Lee-Enfield|SMLE]] rifle (easy to clean and resistant to dirt), the ''dog leg'' shaped bolt handle of the British [[Pattern 1914 Enfield|P14]]/U.S. [[M1917 Enfield]] rifle that places the bolt knob at a favorable ergonomic position in relation to the trigger and [[peep sight]], and the five-round box magazine (claw extractor) of the German [[Gewehr 98]] which stored 5 rounds in a staggered column and fed by 5-round [[stripper clips]]), to produce an \"ugly, roughly made, but immensely strong and reliable\" service rifle.<ref>Jane's Guns Recognition Guide, Ian Hogg & Terry Gander, Harper Collins Publishers, 2005, page 238</ref>\n\nThere are just five user removable parts: a Lebel-type cruciform bayonet inserted into a guard tube under the barrel (taken out by the stopper and turned by snap-fastening the stopper in the tube to fix), the bolt body, the bolt rear cap, the firing pin and the spring of the firing pin. The metal parts of the rifle were black baked in an oven.\n\nThe MAS-36 bolt handle was bent forward in an \"awkward fashion\" to bring it into a convenient position for the soldier's hand. Some have since been found bent backwards into a facing-downwards position like that of many other bolt-action rifles.<ref>Military Small Arms Of The 20th Century, 7th Edition, Ian V. Hogg & John S. Weeks, Kruse Publications, 2000, page 182</ref> The MAS-36 had a relatively short barrel and was fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. Typical for French rifles of the period, the MAS-36 had no manual [[Safety (firearms)|safety]].<ref name=\"ESAA\">{{cite book\n  | last = Bishop | first = Chris\n  | title = The Encyclopedia of Small Arms and Artillery\n  | publisher = Grange Books\n  | year = 2006\n  | isbn = 978-1-84013-910-5\n  | page = 47\n}}</ref>\n\nThe rifle was designed with an [[iron sight]] line consisting of a rear a tangent-type aperture sight element that was calibrated for 7.5\u00d754mm French mle1929 C ammunition for {{convert|100|-|1200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments. The original front sighting element was milled and consisted of a front post that was protected by two open 'ears'.\nThere were 25 rear aperture elements available for the sight line to optimize it horizontally and laterally  in 2.32 [[Minute and second of arc|MOA]] increments during assembly at the arsenal. These arsenal mounted rear aperture elements shifted to point of aim {{convert|13.5|or|27|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} left or right or up or down at a range of {{convert|200|m|yd|0}}.\nIt is worth noting that the front stock fittings are a major component of setting the sights on a MAS-36. To discourage disassembling the front stock non-standard screws with a spanner head were used on the barrel band and nose caps. Only armorers were issued with the appropriate screw drivers to remove the front stock. If removed the front stock will probably face quite a bit of trial and error in getting the screws set back to their exact positions again.\n\nIt was normally carried with a loaded magazine and empty chamber until the soldier was engaged in combat, though the rifle's firing mechanism could be blocked by raising the bolt handle. The MAS-36 carried a 17-inch spike [[bayonet]], reversed in a tube below the barrel. To use the bayonet, a spring plunger was pressed to release the bayonet. It was then free to be pulled out, turned around, and fitted back into its receptacle. The initial implementation of this bayonet design has a distinct (although, uncommonly<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> encountered) disadvantage: with a bayonet stored in one rifle and the other empty, the top of the stored bayonet could be locked into the empty bayonet tube of the second rifle. This obscures the release button on the bayonet and results in permanently (at least up to destructive disassembly) mated rifles. In post-war use the French updated the bayonet storage design by drilling a hole in the bayonet, which allowed the locking catch to be depressed through an already-dilled hole in the bayonet cap.<ref>{{Citation|title=The French Finger Trap: MAS-36 Bayonet Shenanigans|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DA3VsMteAxk|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> Like the Lebel model 1886 rifle, the MAS-36 featured a stacking hook offset to the right side of the barrel for standing a number of the rifles (usually a trio) upright.\n\n==Background==\nThe MAS-36 was intended as an economical simple bolt action rifle to serve with rear echelon, colonial and reserve troops alongside and meant to share machining and pave the way for a new standard [[semi-automatic rifle]] before the next big conflict. The first French [[semi-automatic rifle]] evolved from the prototype MAS-38/39. A limited number of MAS-40 semi-automatic rifles entered trail service in March 1940. The [[Battle of France]] and following German occupation of France prevented large scale introduction of semi-automatic service rifles amongst French front line troops. During the 1950s the French military adopted the semi-automatic [[MAS-49 rifle]] as their standard service rifle.\n\nThough intended to replace the [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel Model 1886]] and Berthier rifles as well as [[Berthier carbine]]s, budget constraints limited MAS-36 production, and it served along with the former rifles in many French army and colonial units.  During World War II, the MAS-36 was used alongside the Lebel 1886 and Berthiers during the Battle of France. After the [[Battle of France]], the Germans took over a large number of MAS-36s, which were given the designation ''Gewehr 242(f)'' and put into service with their own garrison units based in occupied France and later the [[Volkssturm]].<ref name=\"ESAA\" />\n\n==Further development==\nPost World War II produced rifles feature production simplifications like stamped nose caps with a hooded front sight element, stamped magazine floor plates, a stamped front sling attachment featuring a ring, a protective measure to prevent dirt ingress in the trigger area and a side-mounted cam track and button to dial and lock the selected firing range on the rear sight element. The hooded front sight element reduced [[glare (vision)|glare]] under unfavorable light conditions and added extra protection for the post. The bolt of post World War II produced rifles can not be closed on an empty chamber, indicating the rifle needs to be reloaded. Later post war batches feature [[phosphate conversion coating|phosphating]]/[[Parkerizing]] introduced as a more effective metal surface treatment against rust. The \"second model\" is the most produced version with its derivative, the MAS 36/51.\n\n==Postwar usage==\n[[File:Crs larzac2.jpg|thumb|In service with the French Police [[Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9]] during the [[fight for the Larzac]] in 1978.]]\nThe MAS-36 was extensively used by French Army and colonial defense forces during France's postwar counter-insurgency operations in the [[First Indochina War]] and the [[Algerian War]],<ref name =\"Algeria\">{{cite magazine|language=fr|magazine=Gazette des Armes |issue=220 |date=March 1992|title=L'armement fran\u00e7ais en A.F.N.|pages=12\u201316|url=http://fr.1001mags.com/parution/gazette-des-armes/numero-220-mars-1992/page-12-13-texte-integral}}</ref> as well as in the [[Suez Crisis]].<ref name=\"mcnab2002\">{{cite book |last=McNab |first=Chris|title=20th Century Military Uniforms |year=2002 |edition=2nd |publisher=Grange Books |location=Kent |isbn=1-84013-476-3|page=85}}</ref> During the Suez Crisis, French paratroop marksmen of the ''2\u00e8me RPC'' (''R\u00e9giment de Parachutistes Coloniaux''), employed telescope-sighted MAS-36 rifles to eliminate enemy snipers.<ref>Leuliette, Pierre, ''St. Michael and the Dragon: Memoirs of a Paratrooper'', Houghton Mifflin (1964)</ref>  The MAS-36 remained in service into the early 1960s as an infantry rifle, often serving with indigenous colonial units.

Also imported into the United States were a few military surplus MAS-36 rifles, converted to 7.62\u00d751mm NATO from 7.5\u00d754mm. These rifles were modified to chamber the NATO round and also had an [[SKS]] type trigger safety fitted to them.\n\nIn [[Comoros]], the French had a decent amount of MAS-36 rifles in storage during WWII and the [[Post-war]] era. When Comoros became in independent nation in 1975, the rifles were given to the new [[Military of the Comoros|Comoros Army]]. The MAS-36 was widely used during many of the coups and attempted coups that took place on the island nation from 1975 to 1989. After a reformation of the Comoros Army in 1990, the MAS-36 was replaced with newer assault weapons such as the [[AK-47]].<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>\n\nIn 1941, Britain and [[Free France]] occupied Syria, bringing thousands of MAS-36 rifles with them. When French forces departed from Syria in 1946, the rifles were given to the [[Syrian Armed Forces]] in order to arm their own [[Syrian Army|army]] and militias, as the Syrian government at the time was perceived as pro-western. The MAS-36 was widely used by Syrian forces in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]]. The Israeli victory and later, a coup in Syria led to Syria's loyalty shifting towards the [[Soviet Union]] instead of western countries. After purchasing large quantities of Soviet weapons in the 1950s and 1960s, the MAS-36 became obsolete with thousands of units being sent into government storage facilities. In 2011 during the [[Syrian Civil War]], [[Syrian opposition]] forces captured thousands of the stored rifles. With nearly all of the rifles being still operational, the [[Free Syrian Army]] widely used the MAS-36 from 2011 to 2015. From 2015 onward, the Free Syrian Army is decreasing the use of the MAS-36 due to scarcity of the rifle's needed 7.5mm ammunition.<ref name=\"wwii equipment used after the war\"/>\n\n===FR F1 and FR F2 sniper rifles===\nThe French [[FR F1]] and [[FR F2]] sniper rifles utilize the same basic bolt design as the MAS-36 infantry rifle. The MAS-36 bolt action was however extensively modified and strengthened to reduce accuracy inhibiting flex in these sniper rifles.\n\n==Variants==\n* '''MAS 36 CR39''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a folding hollow aluminum stock designed for use by airborne forces.\n* '''MAS 36 LG48''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and 48&nbsp;mm [[rifle grenade]] [[Grenade launcher#Muzzle-fired grenades|launcher]] used in the First Indochina War.\n* '''MAS 36/51''' - An MAS 36 equipped with a strengthened barrel and [[22 mm grenade|22 mm]] [[NATO]] standard rifle grenade launcher.\n* '''Fusil mod\u00e8le FR-G2''' - A highly modified MAS-36 rifle action equipped with a match barrel with harmonic compensator and telescopic sight for use by designated marksmen, used as a stopgap while the FR F1 rifles were being rebuilt into the FR F2.\n\n==Users==\n[[File:Combattants sahraouis du Front Polisario.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Polisario Front]] with a MAS-36 in 1980.]]\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.
