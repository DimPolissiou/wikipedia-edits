It is covered by the [[clitoral hood]]. \n\nAny type of motion can increase [[blood flow]] to this organ and this results in increased [[Vaginal lubrication|secretions which lubricate]] the [[vagina]]. There are many ways to stimulate the clitoris.\n\nClitoral erection occurs when the [[Corpus cavernosum clitoridis|corpora cavernosa]], two expandable [[erectile]] structures, become engorged with blood. This may result from any of various [[physiology|physiological]] stimuli, including [[sexual arousal]]. During sexual arousal, arterial blood flow to the clitoris is increased, and trabecular [[smooth muscle]] within the clitoris relaxes allowing blood to engorge the erectile tissues.  The [[ischiocavernosus]] and [[bulbocavernosus muscle]]s contract to compress the dorsal vein of the clitoris to stop drainage of the clitoris, trapping the blood. More specifically, the clitoris has two adjoining erectile tissues corpus cavernosa (corpus cavernosa clitoridis) that form a main body that connects to the glans clitoridis.

The \"test\" aspect arose because there was an assumption that if relatively large numbers of people took the offer, that indicated that famine conditions were prevalent.{{sfn|J. Mukherjee |2015 |p=29 }}  Agricultural loans offered no assistance to the large numbers of rural poor who had little or no land.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=553}} Grain relief was divided between cheap grain shops and the open market, with far more going to the markets. Supplying grain to the markets was intended to lower grain prices,{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=545}} but in practice gave little help to the rural poor, instead placing them into direct purchasing competition with wealthier Bengalis at greatly inflated prices.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=559}} Thus from the beginning of the crisis until around August 1943, private charity was the principal form of relief available to the very poor.{{sfn|A.

Moreover, the urban middle-class were their overriding concern, not the rural poor. They were also expecting the Government of India to rescue Bengal by bringing food in from outside the province (350,000 tons had been promised but not delivered). And finally, they had long stood by a public propaganda campaign declaring \"sufficiency\" in Bengal's rice supply, and were afraid that speaking of scarcity rather than sufficiency would lead to increased [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] and speculation.{{sfn|Greenough |1982 |p=127}}\n\nThere was also rampant corruption and nepotism in the distribution of government aid; often as much as half of the goods disappeared into the black market or into the hands of friends or relatives.{{sfnm|1a1=Brennan|1y=1988|1pp=555, 557 |2a1=Greenough |2y=1982 |2p=169|3a1= J.

Nevertheless, food distributed from government gruel kitchens immediately became the main source of aid for the rural poor.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\nThe rails had been repaired in August and pressure from the Government of India brought substantial supplies into Calcutta during September,{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=136}} Linlithgow's final month as Viceroy. However, a second problem emerged: the Civil Supplies Department of Bengal was undermanned and under-equipped to distribute the supplies, and the resulting transportation bottleneck left very large piles of grain accumulating in the open air in several locations, including Calcutta's Botanical Garden.{{sfnm|1a1=Famine Inquiry Commission |1y=1945a |1pp=61\u201362|ps=, as cited in {{harvnb|Schneer|1947|p=176}} |2a1=Greenough |2y=1980|2p=214}} [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] Archibald Wavell replaced Linlithgow that October, within two weeks he had requested military support for the transport and distribution of crucial supplies.

A key source of impoverishment was the widespread coping strategy of selling assets, including land.  In 1943 alone in one village in east Bengal, for example,  54 out of a total of 168 families sold all or part of their landholdings; among these, 39 (or very nearly 3 out of 4) did so as a coping strategy in reaction to the scarcity of food.{{sfn| \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2009|p=172}} As the famine wore on across Bengal, nearly 1.6 million families&nbsp;\u2013 roughly one-quarter of all landholders&nbsp;\u2013 sold or mortgaged their paddy lands in whole or in part. Some did so to profit from skyrocketing prices, but many others were trying to save themselves from crisis-driven distress.

The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

Attempting to determine culpability, research and analysis has covered complex issues such as the impacts of natural forces, market failures, failed policies or even malfeasance by governmental institutions, and war profiteering or other unscrupulous acts by private business. The questionable accuracy of much of the available contemporary statistical and anecdotal data is a complicating factor,{{sfn|Tauger |2009 |pp=173\u2013174}} as is the fact that the analyses and their conclusions are political and politicised.{{sfnm|1a1=Tauger |1y=2009 |1p=175 |2a1=Siegel|2y=2018|2p=43| 3a1=Devereux |3y=2000|3p=23 |4a1=Devereux|4y=2003|4p=256}}\n\nThe degree of crop shortfall in late 1942 and its impact in 1943 has dominated the [[historiography]] of the famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015 |p=12}}{{efn-ua|See for example {{harvtxt|A.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1977|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1981a}} in describing the Bengal famine of 1943 as an \"entitlements famine\". On this view, the prelude to the famine was generalised war-time inflation, and the problem was exacerbated by prioritised distribution and abortive attempts at price control,{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough|1y=1982|1pp=127\u2013138|2a1=A. Sen|2y=1977}} but the death blow was devastating leaps in the inflation rate due to heavy speculative buying and panic-driven hoarding.{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1976|1p= 1280|2a1=A. Sen |2y=1977|2p= 50 |3a1= A. Sen|3y=1981a|3p=76}} This in turn caused a fatal decline in the [[real wage]]s of landless agricultural workers,{{sfn|Aykroyd|1975|p=74}} transforming what should have been a local shortage into a horrific famine.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2015|pp=39\u201340}}\n\nMore recent analyses often stress political factors.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=21\u201323|ps=&nbsp;\"The conclusion is inescapable: famines are ''always'' political.\"}} Discussions of the government's role split into two broad camps: those which suggest that the government unwittingly caused or was unable to respond to the crisis,{{sfn|Brennan|Heathcote|Lucas|1984|p=18}} and those which assert that the government wilfully caused or ignored the plight of starving Indians. The former see the problem as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and \"panicky responses\"{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2002b|p=102}} from a government that was spectacularly inept,{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen |1y=1977|1p=50|2a1=S. Bose|2y=1990|2p=717}} overwhelmed{{sfn|Famine Inquiry Commission|1945a|p=195}} and in disarray; the latter as a conscious miscarriage of justice by the \"ruling colonial elite\"{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015|p=91}} who abandoned the poor of Bengal.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=10}}\n\n[[File:Churchill V sign HU 55521.jpg|alt=A jowly, well-dressed man, obviously Winston Churchill, standing outside a doorway. He is smiling and making a \"V for victory\" gesture.|thumb |upright=0.9 |British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1943]]\n\nSen, for example, does not deny that British mis-government contributed to the crisis, but sees the policy failure as a complete misunderstanding of the cause of the famine. This misunderstanding led to a wholly misguided emphasis on measuring non-existent food shortages rather than addressing the very real and devastating inflation-driven imbalances in exchange entitlements.{{sfn|A. Sen|1977|pp=52\u201353}} In stark contrast, though Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da notes that the exchange entitlements view of this famine is generally accepted,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015|p=90|quote=The 1943\u201344 famine has become paradigmatic as an 'entitlements famine,' whereby speculation born of greed and panic produced an 'artificial' shortage of rice, the staple food.}} he lends greater weight to the importance of a crop shortfall than does Sen, and goes on to largely reject Sen's emphasis on hoarding and speculation.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1y=2008|1pp=25\u201328|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2015|2p=90}} He does not stop there, however, but emphasises a \"lack of political will\" and the pressure of wartime priorities that drove the British government and the provincial government of Bengal to make fateful decisions: the \"denial policies\", the use of heavy shipping for war supplies rather than food, the refusal to officially declare a state of famine, and the [[Balkanization|Balkanisation]] of grain markets through inter-provincial trade barriers.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |1y=2015|1p=90|1ps=&nbsp;\"...the lack of political will to divert foodstuffs from the war effort rather than [market] speculation... was mainly responsible for the famine\"|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008|2pp=20, 33}} On this view, these policies were designed to serve British military goals at the expense of Indian interests,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|pp=190\u2013191}} reflecting the War Cabinet's willingness to \"supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wavell|1y=1973|1pp= 68, 122|2a1=S. Bose|2y=1990|2pp=716\u2013717}} Far from being accidental, these dislocations were fully recognised beforehand as fatal for identifiable Indian groups whose economic activities did not directly, actively, or adequately advance British military goals.{{sfn|J. Mukherjee |2015|pp=251\u2013252}} The policies may have met their intended wartime goals, but only at the cost of large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.

They sought the truth rather than evidence in favour of their [own] hypotheses.

In his account, Bengal was at base susceptible to famine because of population pressures and market inefficiencies, and these were exacerbated by a dire combination of war, political strife, and natural causes.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=138}} Above all else, however, direct blame should be laid on a series of government interventions that disrupted the wholesale rice market.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=262}} Once the crisis began, morbidity rates were driven by a series of cultural decisions, as dependents were abandoned by their providers at every level of society: male heads of peasant households abandoned weaker family members; landholders abandoned the various forms of patronage that (according to Greenough) had traditionally been maintained, and the government abandoned the rural poor. These abandoned groups had been socially and politically selected for death.{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough |1y=1982 | 1pp=261\u2013275|2a1=S.

The \"test\" aspect arose because there was an assumption that if relatively large numbers of people took the offer, that indicated that famine conditions were prevalent.{{sfn|J. Mukherjee |2015 |p=29 }}  Agricultural loans offered no assistance to the large numbers of rural poor who had little or no land.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=553}} Grain relief was divided between cheap grain shops and the open market, with far more going to the markets. Supplying grain to the markets was intended to lower grain prices,{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=545}} but in practice gave little help to the rural poor, instead placing them into direct purchasing competition with wealthier Bengalis at greatly inflated prices.{{sfn|Brennan|1988|p=559}} Thus from the beginning of the crisis until around August 1943, private charity was the principal form of relief available to the very poor.{{sfn|A.

Moreover, the urban middle-class were their overriding concern, not the rural poor. They were also expecting the Government of India to rescue Bengal by bringing food in from outside the province (350,000 tons had been promised but not delivered). And finally, they had long stood by a public propaganda campaign declaring \"sufficiency\" in Bengal's rice supply, and were afraid that speaking of scarcity rather than sufficiency would lead to increased [[Hoarding (economics)|hoarding]] and speculation.{{sfn|Greenough |1982 |p=127}}\n\nThere was also rampant corruption and nepotism in the distribution of government aid; often as much as half of the goods disappeared into the black market or into the hands of friends or relatives.{{sfnm|1a1=Brennan|1y=1988|1pp=555, 557 |2a1=Greenough |2y=1982 |2p=169|3a1= J.

A key source of impoverishment was the widespread coping strategy of selling assets, including land.  In 1943 alone in one village in east Bengal, for example,  54 out of a total of 168 families sold all or part of their landholdings; among these, 39 (or very nearly 3 out of 4) did so as a coping strategy in reaction to the scarcity of food.{{sfn| \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2009|p=172}} As the famine wore on across Bengal, nearly 1.6 million families&nbsp;\u2013 roughly one-quarter of all landholders&nbsp;\u2013 sold or mortgaged their paddy lands in whole or in part. Some did so to profit from skyrocketing prices, but many others were trying to save themselves from crisis-driven distress.

The denial of boats alarmed the public; the resulting dispute was one point that helped to shape the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942 and harden the War Cabinet's response. An Indian National Congress (INC) resolution sharply decrying the destruction of boats and seizure of homes was considered treasonous by Churchill's War Cabinet, and was instrumental in the later arrest of the INC's top leadership.{{sfn|J.

The FAD explanation blames famine on crop failures brought on principally by crises such as drought, flood, or man-made devastation from war. The FEE account agrees that such external factors are in some cases important, but holds that famine is primarily the interaction between pre-existing \"structural vulnerability\" (such as poverty) and a shock event (such as war or political interference in markets) that disrupts the economic market for food. When these interact, some groups within society can become unable to purchase or acquire food even though sufficient supplies are available.{{sfn|Devereux|2000|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nBoth the FAD and FEE perspectives would agree that Bengal experienced at least some grain shortage in 1943 due to the loss of imports from Burma, damage from the cyclone, and brown-spot infestation. However, FEE analyses do not consider shortage the main factor,{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=424}} while FAD-oriented scholars such Peter Bowbrick hold that a sharp drop in the food supply was the pivotal determining factor.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1986|pp=111\u2013114}} S.Y.{{nbsp}}Padmanabhan and later Mark Tauger, in particular, argue that the impact of brown-spot disease was vastly underestimated, both during the famine and in later analyses.{{sfnm|1a1=Padmanabhan|1y=1973|1pp=11, 23|2a1=Tauger|2y=2003|2pp=65\u201367}} The signs of crop infestation by the fungus are subtle; given the social and administrative conditions at the time, local officials would very likely have overlooked them.{{sfn|Tauger |2009|pp=178\u2013179}}\n\nAcademic consensus generally follows the FEE account, as formulated by Amartya Sen,{{sfnm|1a1=A.

Sen|2y=1977}} but the death blow was devastating leaps in the inflation rate due to heavy speculative buying and panic-driven hoarding.{{sfnm|1a1=A. Sen|1y=1976|1p= 1280|2a1=A. Sen |2y=1977|2p= 50 |3a1= A.

The former see the problem as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and \"panicky responses\"{{sfn|Bhattacharya|2002b|p=102}} from a government that was spectacularly inept,{{sfnm|1a1=A.

He is smiling and making a \"V for victory\" gesture.|thumb |upright=0.9 |British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in 1943]]\n\nSen, for example, does not deny that British mis-government contributed to the crisis, but sees the policy failure as a complete misunderstanding of the cause of the famine. This misunderstanding led to a wholly misguided emphasis on measuring non-existent food shortages rather than addressing the very real and devastating inflation-driven imbalances in exchange entitlements.{{sfn|A. Sen|1977|pp=52\u201353}} In stark contrast, though Cormac \u00d3 Gr\u00e1da notes that the exchange entitlements view of this famine is generally accepted,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2015|p=90|quote=The 1943\u201344 famine has become paradigmatic as an 'entitlements famine,' whereby speculation born of greed and panic produced an 'artificial' shortage of rice, the staple food.}} he lends greater weight to the importance of a crop shortfall than does Sen, and goes on to largely reject Sen's emphasis on hoarding and speculation.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|1y=2008|1pp=25\u201328|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2015|2p=90}} He does not stop there, however, but emphasises a \"lack of political will\" and the pressure of wartime priorities that drove the British government and the provincial government of Bengal to make fateful decisions: the \"denial policies\", the use of heavy shipping for war supplies rather than food, the refusal to officially declare a state of famine, and the [[Balkanization|Balkanisation]] of grain markets through inter-provincial trade barriers.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |1y=2015|1p=90|1ps=&nbsp;\"...the lack of political will to divert foodstuffs from the war effort rather than [market] speculation... was mainly responsible for the famine\"|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008|2pp=20, 33}} On this view, these policies were designed to serve British military goals at the expense of Indian interests,{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|pp=190\u2013191}} reflecting the War Cabinet's willingness to \"supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary\".{{sfnm|1a1=Wavell|1y=1973|1pp= 68, 122|2a1=S.

Mukherjee |2015|pp=251\u2013252}} The policies may have met their intended wartime goals, but only at the cost of large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. The British government, this argument maintains, thus bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths.{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2010 |p=39}} Auriol Law-Smith's discussion of contributing causes of the famine also lays blame on the British Government of India, primarily emphasising Viceroy Linlithgow's lack of political will to \"infringe provincial autonomy\" by using his authority to remove interprovincial barriers, which would have ensured the free movement of life-saving grain.{{sfn|Law-Smith|1989|p=64}}\n\nA related argument, present since the days of the famine{{sfn|Greenough|1983|p=375}} but expressed at length by Madhusree Mukerjee, accuses key figures in the British government (particularly Prime Minister Winston Churchill){{sfn|Hickman|2008|pp=238\u2013240}} of genuine antipathy toward Indians and [[Winston Churchill#Indian independence|Indian independence]] \u2013 an antipathy arising mainly from a desire to protect [[imperialism|imperialist]] privilege, but tinged also with [[racism|racist]] undertones.{{sfn|Mukerjee|2010|pp=274\u2013275}} This is attributed to British anger over widespread Bengali nationalist sentiment and the perceived treachery of the violent [[Quit India]] uprising.{{sfnm|1a1=Mukerjee|1y=2010|1p=273|2a1=Bayly|2a2=Harper|2y=2005|2p=286|3a1=Collingham |3y=2012|3pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nFor its part, the report of the Famine Commission&nbsp;\u2013 its members appointed in 1944 by the British Government of India{{sfn|Islam|2007a|p=423}} and chaired by Sir John Woodhead, a former Indian Civil Service (ICS) official in Bengal{{sfn|\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da|2009|p=161}}&nbsp; \u2013 absolved the British government from all major blame.{{sfnm|1a1=Siegel|1y=2018|1p=43|2a1=\u00d3 Gr\u00e1da |2y=2008 |2p=24 ''note 78''}} It acknowledge some failures in its price controls and transportation efforts{{sfn|Siegel|2018|p=43}} and laid additional responsibility at the feet of unavoidable fate, but reserved its broadest and most forceful finger-pointing for local politicians in the (largely Muslim){{sfn|J.

Meanwhile, he repeatedly and rather forcefully favors its analyses over Sen's.{{sfn|Bowbrick|1985|pp= 18, 53, 57 |quote=In my opinion the Famine Commission wrote an excellent report. They sought the truth rather than evidence in favour of their [own] hypotheses.

In his account, Bengal was at base susceptible to famine because of population pressures and market inefficiencies, and these were exacerbated by a dire combination of war, political strife, and natural causes.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=138}} Above all else, however, direct blame should be laid on a series of government interventions that disrupted the wholesale rice market.{{sfn|Greenough|1982|p=262}} Once the crisis began, morbidity rates were driven by a series of cultural decisions, as dependents were abandoned by their providers at every level of society: male heads of peasant households abandoned weaker family members; landholders abandoned the various forms of patronage that (according to Greenough) had traditionally been maintained, and the government abandoned the rural poor. These abandoned groups had been socially and politically selected for death.{{sfnm|1a1=Greenough |1y=1982 | 1pp=261\u2013275|2a1=S. Bose |2y=1990 |2pp=721\u2013724}}\n\nA final line of blaming holds that major industrialists either caused or at least significantly exacerbated the famine through speculation, war profiteering, hoarding, and corruption \u2013 \"unscrupulous, heartless grain traders forcing up prices based on false rumors\".{{sfnm|1a1=Tauger|1y=2009|1p=185|2a1=J.

Their [[Curtis P-40 Warhawk|Curtis P-40B Warhawk]] aircraft, marked with Chinese colors, flew under American control. Their mission was to bomb Japan and defend China but many delays meant the AVG flew in combat after the US and Japan declared war.\n\nThe group consisted of three [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] of around 30 aircraft each that trained in [[Burma]] before the American entry into World War II to defend China against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces. The AVG were officially members of the Chinese Air Force. The group had contracts with salaries ranging from $250 a month for a mechanic to $750 for a squadron commander, roughly three times what they had been making in the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. forces]]. While it accepted some civilian volunteers for its headquarters and ground crew, the AVG recruited most of its staff from the U.S. military.\n\nThe group first saw combat on 20 December 1941, 12 days after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] (local time). It demonstrated innovative tactical victories when the news in the U.S. was filled with little more than stories of defeat at the hands of the Japanese forces and achieved such notable success during the lowest period of the war for both the U.S. and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] as to give hope to America that it might eventually defeat Japan.  AVG pilots earned official credit and received combat bonuses for destroying 296 enemy aircraft, while losing only 14 pilots in combat.<ref name=\"Ford pp. 30\u201334\">Ford 1991, pp. 30\u201334.</ref> The combat records of the AVG still exist and researchers have found them credible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/american-volunteer-group-claire-l-chennault-and-the-flying-tigers.htm|title=American Volunteer Group: Claire L.

The 23rd FG went on to achieve similar combat success, while retaining the [[nose art]] on the left-over [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]]<nowiki/>s.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Chennaultcic.jpg|thumb|Chennault in his Kunming office, May 1942. He wears a US Army brigadier general's star on his left shoulder but Chinese insignia otherwise.]]\nThe [[American Volunteer Group]] was largely the creation of [[Claire Chennault|Claire L. Chennault]], a retired [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] officer who had worked in [[Republic of China#History|China]] since August 1937, first as [[military aviation]] advisor to [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in the early months of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945)|Sino-Japanese War]], then as director of a [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] flight school centered in [[Kunming]]. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union supplied fighter and bomber squadrons to China, but these units were mostly withdrawn by the summer of 1940. Chiang then asked for American combat aircraft and pilots, sending Chennault to Washington as an adviser to China's ambassador and Chiang's brother-in-law, [[T. V. Soong]].<ref>{{citation|jstor=2712474|title=American Air Strategy in China, 1939\u20131941: The Origins of Clandestine Air Warfare|journal=American Quarterly|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|last1=Schaller|first1=Michael|year=1976|doi=10.2307/2712474}}</ref>\n\nChennault spent the winter of 1940\u20131941 in Washington, supervising the purchase of 100 [[Curtiss P-40]] fighters and the recruiting of 100 pilots and some 200 ground crew and administrative personnel that would constitute the 1st AVG. He also laid the groundwork for [[American Volunteer Group|a follow-on bomber group and a second fighter group]], though these would be aborted after the [[Pearl Harbor attack]].\n\n===Original American volunteer group===\n[[File:Hells Angels, Flying Tigers 1942.jpg|thumb|3rd Squadron Hell's Angels, Flying Tigers, over China, photographed in 1942 by AVG pilot [[Robert T. Smith]]]]\n[[File:Curtis P40.jpg|thumb|right|P-40 Warhawk painted with Flying Tigers shark face at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]]]]\n\nOf the pilots, 60 came from the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Marines|Marine Corps]] and 40 from the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]]. (One army pilot was refused a passport because he had earlier flown as a mercenary in Spain, so only 99 actually sailed for Asia. Ten more army flight instructors were hired as check pilots for Chinese cadets, and several of these would ultimately join the AVG's combat squadrons.) The volunteers were discharged from the armed services, to be employed for \"training and instruction\" by a [[private military contractor]], the [[Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company]] (CAMCO), which paid them $600 a month for pilot officers, $675 a month for flight leaders, $750 for squadron leaders (no pilot was recruited at this level), and about $250 for skilled ground crewmen.<ref>Ford 2007, pp. 45\u201345.</ref>\nSome of the pilots were also orally promised a bounty of $500 for each enemy aircraft shot down, but no one knew if that would actually happen until they returned home and found the funds deposited in their bank.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Letter of resignation from the U.S. Marine Corps, to accept a position with the Central Aircraft Manufacturing... - NARA - 299719.jpg|left|thumb|Resignation letter from the U.S. Marine Corps, used to accept a position with the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Co.]]\n\nDuring the summer and fall 1941, some 300 men carrying civilian passports boarded ships destined for Burma. They were initially based at a British airfield in [[Toungoo]] for training while their aircraft were assembled and test flown by CAMCO personnel at [[Yangon International Airport|Mingaladon Airport]] outside Rangoon. Chennault set up a schoolhouse that was made necessary because many pilots had \"lied about their flying experience, claiming pursuit experience when they had flown only bombers and sometimes much less powerful aeroplanes.\"<ref name=\"AP24\">Feltus, Pamela.

All 9 were trained at Allison Engineworks in Indianapolis, Indiana: all were P-40 mechanics.  Upon arrival in Kunming, 2 other Chinese-Americans were hired, a Ford Motor truck specialist and a doctor.  Total original Chinese-Americans were 11.  Prior to 4 July 1942, 3 of the P-40 mechanics resigned.  The official AVG roster lists the original 8.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe AVG was created by an executive order of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. He did not speak English, however, and Chennault never learned to speak Chinese. As a result, all communications between the two men were routed through [[Soong Mei-ling]], \"Madame Chiang\" as she was known to Americans, and she was designated the group's \"honorary commander.\"\n\n===Chennault fighter doctrine===\nChennault preached a radically different approach to air combat based on his study of Japanese tactics and equipment, his observation of the tactics used by [[Polikarpov I-16#The Far East and battles at Khalkhin Gol|Soviet pilots in China]], and his judgment of the strengths and weaknesses of his own aircraft and pilots. The actual average strength of the AVG was never more than 62 combat-ready pilots and fighters. Chennault faced serious obstacles since many AVG pilots were inexperienced and a few quit at the first opportunity. However, he made a virtue out of these disadvantages, shifting unsuitable pilots to staff jobs and always ensuring that he had a squadron or two in reserve. (The AVG had [[flat hierarchy|no ranks]], so no division between officers and enlisted soldiers existed.<ref name=\"life19420820\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Life|last=Belden|first=Jack|title=Chennault Fights to Hold the China Front|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sk4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70|date=10 August 1942|publisher=Time Inc|page=70}}</ref>)\n\nChennault and the Flying Tigers benefited from the country's warning network, called \"the best air-raid warning system in existence\":<ref name=\"life19420820\" />\n\n{{quote|Starting from areas in Free China, in hundreds of small villages, in lonely outposts, in hills and caves, stretching from near Canton through all Free China to the capital in [[Chungking]] and to [[Lanchow]], far northwest, are a maze of alarm stations equipped with radios and telephones that give instant warning of the approach of Japanese planes.<ref name=\"life19420820\" />}}\n\nWhen Japanese aircraft attacked, Chennault's doctrine called for pilots to take on enemy aircraft in teams from an altitude advantage, since their aircraft were not as maneuverable or as numerous as the Japanese fighters they would encounter. He prohibited his pilots from entering into a turning fight with the nimble Japanese fighters, telling them to execute a diving or slashing attack and to dive away to set up for another attack.

The Tomahawk IIB was similar to the U.S. Army's earlier P-40B model, and there is some evidence that Curtiss actually used leftover components from that model in building the fighters intended for China.<ref>Ford 2007, p. 36.</ref> The fighters were purchased without \"government-furnished equipment\" such as [[Reflector sight|reflector gunsights]], radios and wing guns; the lack of these items caused continual difficulties for the AVG in Burma and China.\n\nThe 100 P-40 aircraft were crated and sent to Burma on third country freighters during spring 1941. At Rangoon, they were unloaded, assembled and test flown by personnel of [[Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company]] (CAMCO) before being delivered to the AVG training unit at Toungoo.<ref>Howard 1991, p. 65.</ref> One crate was dropped into the water and a wing assembly was ruined by salt water immersion, so CAMCO was able to deliver only 99 Tomahawks before war broke out. (Many of those were destroyed in training accidents.) The 100th fuselage was trucked to a CAMCO plant in Loiwing, China, and later made whole with parts from damaged aircraft. Shortages in equipment with spare parts almost impossible to obtain in Burma along with the slow introduction of replacement fighter aircraft were continual impediments although the AVG did receive 50 replacement P-40E fighters from [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] stocks toward the end of its combat tour.\n\nAVG fighter aircraft were painted with a large [[Nose art#History|shark face]] on the front of the aircraft.

Eastern China was under Japanese occupation, so all military supplies for China arrived via the Burma route. By November 1941, when the pilots were trained and most of the P-40s had arrived in Asia, the Flying Tigers were divided into three squadrons: 1st Squadron (\"Adam & Eves\"); 2nd Squadron (\"Panda Bears\") and 3rd Squadron (\"Hell's Angels\").<ref name=\"AP24\"/> They were assigned to opposite ends of the Burma Road to protect this vital line of communications. Two squadrons were based at [[Kunming]] in China, and a third at [[Yangon International Airport|Mingaladon Airport]] near Rangoon. When the United States officially entered the war, the AVG had 82 pilots and 79 aircraft, although not all were combat-ready.  Tiger Erik Shilling, part of the third squadron commented:. \"This was the beginning of the greatest adventure I would ever hope to experience. It wasn't until years later that I fully realized the magnitude and significance of this first step, to be a lifelong adventure in the mystic Far East.\"<ref name=\"Tigers History\"/>\n\nThe AVG's first combat mission was on 20 December 1941, when aircraft of the 1st and 2nd squadrons intercepted 10 unescorted [[Kawasaki Ki-48]] \"Lily\" bombers of the 21st ''Hik\u014dtai'' attacking Kunming. The bombers jettisoned their loads before reaching Kunming. Three of the Japanese bombers were shot down near Kunming and a fourth was damaged so severely that it crashed before returning to its airfield at [[Hanoi]]. Later, Chinese intelligence intercepted Japanese communications indicating that only 1 out of the 10 bombers ultimately returned to base. Furthermore, the Japanese discontinued their raids on Kunming while the AVG was based there. One P-40 crash-landed; it was salvaged for parts. This mission was one of the earliest American aerial victories in the Pacific War.\n\n===Defense of Rangoon===\n[[File:Flying Tigers blood chit from ROC National Government, provided courtesy of Robert Baldwin.jpg|thumb|A \"[[blood chit]]\" issued to the American Volunteer Group ''Flying Tigers''.

The 3rd Squadron \u2013 18 aircraft strong \u2013 defended Rangoon from 23\u201325 December. On 23 December, [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]] \"Sally\" heavy bombers of the 60th, 62nd and 98th ''Sentai'', along with single-engined [[Mitsubishi Ki-30]] \"Ann\" attack bombers of the 31st ''Sentai'', sortied against Rangoon. They were escorted by [[Nakajima Ki-27]] \"Nate\" fighters of 77th ''Sentai''. The [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] (JAAF) formation was intercepted by the AVG and RAF [[Brewster Buffalo]]s of [[No. 67 Squadron RAF|67 Squadron]]. Eight Ki-21s were shot down for the loss of three AVG P-40s. The 60th ''Sentai'' was particularly hard hit \u2013 it lost five out of the 15 bombers it had dispatched. Nevertheless, Rangoon and Mingaladon airfield were successfully bombed, with the city suffering more than 1,000 dead. Two Buffalos and two P-40s were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 crashed when it attempted to land on a bomb-damaged runway.\n\nOn 25 December, the JAAF returned, reinforced by Ki-21s of 12th ''Sentai'' and [[Nakajima Ki-43]] ''Hayabusa''s (Oscars) of the 64th ''Sentai'' (Colonel [[Tateo Kat\u014d]]'s Flying Squadron). A total of 63 bombers escorted by 25 fighters were committed. These were intercepted by 14 P-40s of the AVG's 3rd Squadron and 15 Buffalos of 67 Squadron. In the two encounters, 35 Japanese bombers and fighters were shot down. The Allies lost two pilots and five P-40s.<ref name=\"Tigers History\">[http://www.usshawkbill.com/tigers/ \"History of the Flying Tigers.\"]  Retrieved: 26 April 2015.</ref> Mingaladon airfield was once again damaged, and eight Buffalos were destroyed on the ground.\n\nAfter its losses in the 23\u201325 December battles, the 3rd Squadron was relieved by the 2nd Squadron \"Panda Bears\", which carried out a series of raids on JAAF airbases in [[Thailand]]. The Japanese had moved aircraft to [[British Malaya|Malaya]] to finish off [[Singapore]], and its remaining aircraft in the area (the 77th, 31st and 62nd ''Sentai'') launched fighter sweeps and counter raids on the Allied airfield at Mingaladon.\n\nOn 12 January, the Japanese launched their [[Burma Campaign]]. Significantly outnumbered, the AVG was gradually reduced through attrition, but often exacted a disproportionate toll of their attackers. On 24 January, six Ki-21s of the 14th Sentai escorted by Ki-27s attacked Mingaladon. All the Ki-21s were shot down by the AVG and RAF defenders. On 28 January, a fighter sweep of 37 Ki-27s was engaged by 16 AVG P-40s and two RAF fighters. Three \"Nates\" were shot down for the loss of two P-40s. The next day, another sweep of 20 Ki-27s of the 70th ''Sentai'' was met by 10 Allied fighters (eight P-40s and two [[Hawker Hurricane]]s). Four were shot down for the loss of no Allied aircraft.\n\nDespite these minor victories and Chennault's reinforcement of the \"Panda Bears\" with pilots from the \"Adam and Eves\", by mid-February, only 10 P-40s were still operational at Mingaladon. Commonwealth troops retreated before the Japanese onslaught, and the AVG was pressed into the ground attack role to support them. One unfortunate result of these missions was a prolonged air attack on a suspected Japanese column on 21 February that turned out to consist of Commonwealth troops. More than 100 Allied lives were lost in this [[friendly fire]] incident. On 27 February, after hearing that the RAF was retreating and pulling out its radar equipment, the AVG withdrew to bases in northern Burma.\n\nBy 24 January, the Flying Tigers had destroyed 73 Japanese aircraft while losing only five themselves \u2013 a notable performance, considering the AVG was outnumbered and faced experienced and fully trained Japanese pilots. The main disadvantage of JAAF fighter pilots of this period was the near-obsolescence of their predominant fighter type in the theater, the Ki-27. Though more maneuverable than the P-40, its armament and performance was inferior. Lightly constructed and armed, it could not withstand frontal attacks nor could it out-dive Allied fighters such as the P-40; if it attempted to, it often came apart in the air. In fact, its cruising speed was less than that of the Ki-21 bombers it was intended to escort.<ref name=\"Sherman\"/>\n\n===Retreat into China===\nAfter Rangoon was lost to the Japanese at the end of February, the AVG relocated to [[Magwe, Burma|Magwe]], a small British airfield more than 300 miles north of Rangoon. Chennault started moving elements of the now reconstituted 3rd Squadron to Magwe as reinforcement to his worn down 1st and 2nd squadrons. Aircraft attrition became so high that at this point, individual squadron distinctions became meaningless, and all three squadrons had elements based there, along with a number of RAF aircraft. In total, the Allies had 38 aircraft, including eight P-40s and 15 [[Hawker Hurricanes]]. Opposing them were 271 Japanese aircraft, including 115 fighters. Although the AVG and the RAF scored some successes against the JAAF, Magwe was continuously bombed, including a very heavy raid on 21 March by 151 bombers and fighters. On 23 March with only four aircraft left, the AVG was forced to relocate to Loiwing, just across the Chinese border. The Tigers crossed into China on a rickety suspension bridge over a deep gorge. A few months later, they came back to destroy the bridge so no Japanese soldiers could come across that way into China.<ref>Wambold Jr., Donald A.. \"A Flying Tiger's War.\" World War II 20, no. 2, 2005, pp. 22\u201325.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nakajima Ki-43-II.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Nakajima Ki-43]] Hayabusa was a single-engined land-based fighter used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force in World War II]]\n\nReinforced by new P-40E \"Kittyhawks\" and by repaired aircraft from the AVG's excellent maintenance group, 12 P-40s were based at Loiwing on 8 April. Despite the long retreats, their losses and incessant air combat, the AVG still retained their abilities. That day, 12 Oscars from the 64th ''Sentai'' raided the base. In the ensuing series of dogfights, four Ki-43s were downed in exchange for one P-40E destroyed on the ground. During this period, Chinese and American commanders pressured Chennault to order his pilots to undertake so-called \"morale missions\". These were overflights and ground attacks intended to raise the morale of hard-pressed Chinese soldiers by showing they were getting air support. The AVG's pilots seethed with resentment at these dangerous missions (which some considered useless), a feeling which culminated in the so-called \"Pilot's Revolt\" of mid-April. Chennault suppressed the \"revolt\" and ordered the ground attack missions to continue. But despite their efforts, the Allied situation in Burma continued to deteriorate. On 29 April the AVG was ordered to evacuate Loiwing and relocate to [[Baoshan City|Baoshan]] in China.\n\nLike the AVG's other bases, Baoshan was repeatedly bombed by the Japanese Army Air Force. Still, the AVG scored against their JAAF tormentors, bringing down four \"Nates\" of the 11th Sentai on 5 May and two \"Anns\". By 4 May, the successful Japanese Burma offensive was winding down, except for mopping up actions. One of these was an attempt by a regiment of the Japanese 56th Division to drive for Kunming, an effort that was stopped by the Chinese army operating with strong air support from the AVG. On 7 May the Japanese Army began building a pontoon bridge across the upper Salween River, which would allow them to move troops and supplies into China and drive towards Kunming. To stem this tide, 2nd Squadron Leader [[David Lee \"Tex\" Hill]] led a flight of four new P-40Es bombing and strafing into the mile deep Salween River Gorge. During the next four days, the AVG pilots flew continuous missions into the gorge, effectively neutralizing the Japanese forces. This prevented a Japanese advance on Kunming and Chungking; the Japanese never advanced farther than the west bank of the upper Salween. Claire Chennault later wrote of these critical missions, \"The American Volunteer Group had staved off China's collapse on the Salween.\" Despite being on the defensive thereafter, the AVG continued to harass the JAAF with raids on their Vietnamese bases.\n\nWith the Burma campaign over, Chennault redeployed his squadrons to provide air protection for China. The [[Doolittle Raid]] had prompted the Japanese to launch an offensive to seize AVG air bases that could be used for attacks on the Japanese homeland. By 1 June, personnel that would form the nucleus of the new USAAF 23rd Fighter Group (the AVG's replacement) were beginning to trickle into the theater. Some of the last missions the AVG flew were defending Guilin against raids by JAAF Nates, Lilys, and new [[Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu]] (\"Nick\") heavy fighters. The AVG's last combat was over Hengyang on the day it was disbanded, 4 July 1942. In this final action, the AVG shot down four [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]]<nowiki/>s with no AVG losses.\n\n==Assessment of the AVG==\n[[File:Flying tigers pilot.jpg|right|thumb|Flight leader and fighter ace [[Robert T.

Despite its location in areas with [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], it had only \"four doctors, three nurses and a bottle of iodine.\" Pilots found the food disgusting, and the slow mail from home and lack of women hurt morale. A squadron had 45 maintenance personnel compared to the normal more than 100, and only one base could perform major repairs.<ref name=\"life19420820\" /> Nonetheless, the AVG was officially credited with 297 enemy aircraft destroyed, including 229 in the air.<ref name=\"Olynyk\">Olynk 1986 {{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref> Fourteen AVG pilots were killed in action, captured, or disappeared on combat missions. Two died of wounds sustained in bombing raids, and six were killed in accidents during the Flying Tigers' existence as a combat force.\n\nThe AVG's kill ratio was superior to that of contemporary Allied air groups in Malaya, the Philippines, and elsewhere in the Pacific theater. The AVG's success is all the more remarkable since they were outnumbered by Japanese fighters in almost all their engagements. The AVG's P-40s were superior to the JAAF's Ki-27s, but the group's kill ratio against modern Ki-43s was still in its favor. In ''Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941\u20131942'', Daniel Ford attributes the AVG's success to morale and group ''esprit de corps''. He notes that its pilots were \"triple volunteers\" who had volunteered for service with the U.S. military, the AVG, and brutal fighting in Burma. The result was a corps of experienced and skilled volunteer pilots who wanted to fight.\n\nDuring their service with the Nationalist Chinese air force, 33 AVG pilots and three ground crew received the [[Order of the Cloud and Banner]], and many AVG pilots received the Chinese Air Force Medal. Each AVG ace and double ace was awarded the Five Star or Ten Star Wing Medal.\n\n==Members of the AVG==\n* [[Pappy Boyington|Gregory \"Pappy\" Boyington]] broke his contract with the AVG<ref>Rossi, J.

Chennault was reinstated as a colonel and immediately promoted to brigadier general commanding U.S. Army air units in China (initially designated [[China Air Task Force]] and later the [[Fourteenth Air Force|14th Air Force]]), while continuing to command the AVG by virtue of his position in the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]]. On 4 July 1942, the AVG was replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group. Most AVG pilots refused to remain with the unit as a result of the strong arm tactics by the USAAF general sent to negotiate with them. However, five pilots accepted commissions in China including \"Tex\" Hill, one of Chennault's most loyal devotees, with others remaining for a two-week transition period. (U.S. airmen and the press continued to use the \"Flying Tiger\" name to refer to USAAF units in China to the end of the war, and the name continues to be applied to certain air force and army aviation squadrons.) Most AVG pilots became transport pilots in China, went back to America into civilian jobs, or rejoined the military services and fought elsewhere in the war.<ref>Ford 2007, ch. 17.</ref>\n\nOne of the pilots drawn to the success of the AVG was [[Robert Lee Scott, Jr.]] who was flying supplies into Kunming over [[the Hump]] from India. He convinced Chennault to loan him a P-40 which he flew to protect the supply route; his aggressiveness led to Chennault's recruiting him as commander of the 23rd Fighter Group. Scott brought recognition to his exploits and those of the Flying Tigers with his 1943 bestselling autobiography ''God is My Co-Pilot'' that was then made by [[Warner Bros.]] into a [[God is My Co-Pilot (film)|popular film]] in 1945.\n\n===Tributes and memorials===\n[[File:Flying Tigers Monument.jpg|thumb|Flying Tigers Monument [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], Florida Memorial Park]]\n[[File:16 26 076 WWII museum.jpg|thumb|Restored P-40 on display at the [[National World War II Museum]]]]\n\nThere are several museum displays in the United States honoring the Flying Tigers.

The [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]] in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], Florida also has a Flying Tiger display. The Chennault Aviation Museum in Monroe, Louisiana has an extensive collection of Flying Tigers and AVG memorabilia. The AVG monument in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] Memorial Garden features a marble sculpture of a [[pagoda]] crowned with a brass model of a P-40; the monument stands nearly 14 feet tall.  The Palm Springs Air Museum has a display of memorabilia inside a mockup of AVG ground facilities, with a P-40N painted in AVG markings.  Finally, a memorial to the AVG and 14th AF is located at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California, depicting a P-40 in AVG markings with a bronze plaque describing the unit's history and Vandenberg's role as headquarters for the 14th AF.\n\nThere are also several memorials to the AVG in Asia. In [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand, a [[marble]] [[obelisk]] was dedicated on 11 November 2003, inscribed to Chennault; to Jack Newkirk, who was killed in North [[Thailand]] on 24 March 1942; and to Charles Mott and William McGarry, who were shot down and captured in Thailand. In Taiwan, Madame Chiang Kai-Shek requested a statue of Chennault in the New Park of Taipei to commemorate this wartime friend after his death (the statue has since been relocated to Hualian AFB). A Flying Tigers Memorial is located in the village of [[Zhijiang Dong Autonomous County|Zhijiang]], [[Hunan|Hunan Province]], China and there is a museum dedicated exclusively to the Flying Tigers. The building is a steel and marble structure, with wide sweeping steps leading up to a platform with columns holding up the memorial's sweeping roof; on its back wall, etched in black marble, are the names of all members of the AVG, 75th Fighter Squadron, and 14th Air Force who died in China. In 2005, the city of Kunming held a ceremony memorializing the history of the Flying Tigers in China, and on 20 December 2012, the Flying Tigers Museum opened in Kunming. The date is the 71st anniversary of the first combat from Kunming of the Flying Tigers. The Memorial Cemetery to Anti-Japanese Aviator Martyrs in Nanjing, China features a wall listing the names of Flying Tiger pilots and other pilots who defended China in World War II, and has several unmarked graves for such American pilots.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/139639.htm ''Former 'Flying Tigers' Visit Nanjing Memorial Cemetery''.] ''china.org (Xinhua News Agency)'', 25 August 2005.

In March 1998, they contacted the China Expedition Association about conducting the recovery operation. Over 300 aircraft are believed to have crashed into Lake Dianchi (including a second AVG P-40) so locating the aircraft proved difficult. In 2003, an aircraft believed to be Blackburn's was found embedded in nine feet of bottom silt. An effort was made in September 2005 to raise the aircraft, but the recovery was plagued with difficulties and it remains deep under the lake bottom. Since the aircraft was complete and relatively undamaged when John Blackburn's body was removed from it in 1942, it is hoped that the aircraft will be in good condition and capable of being restored, possibly to flying condition.\n\n===Recognition by the United States===\nJust before their 50th reunion in 1992, the AVG veterans were retroactively recognized as members of the U.S. military services during the seven months the group was in combat against the Japanese. The AVG was then awarded a [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] for \"professionalism, dedication to duty, and extraordinary heroism.\" In 1996, the U.S. Air Force awarded the pilots the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and the ground crew were all awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]].<ref>Ford 2007, p. 349.</ref>\n\n===Popular culture===\nA number of feature films have referenced the AVG directly or indirectly, the most famous being ''[[Flying Tigers (film)|Flying Tigers]]'', a 1942 black-and-white film from Republic, starring [[John Wayne]] and [[John Carroll (actor)|John Carroll]] as fighter pilots. Other wartime films with an AVG angle included ''[[The Sky's the Limit (1943 film)|The Sky's the Limit]]'' (1943, starring [[Fred Astaire]] as a Flying Tiger ace on leave); ''[[Hers to Hold]]'' (1943, with [[Joseph Cotten]]); ''[[God is My Co-Pilot (film)|God is My Co-Pilot]]'', (1945, with [[Dennis Morgan]] as [[Robert Lee Scott]], [[Raymond Massey]] as Chennault, and [[John Ridgely]] as Tex Hill); and ''[[China's Little Devils]]'' (1945).\n\nSimilarly, the Flying Tigers have been the focus of several novels, including ''Tonya'', by [[Pappy Boyington]]; ''Remains'', by [[Daniel Ford]]; ''Spies in the Garden'', by Bob Bergin,''Tiger Ten'' by William D.

Their [[Curtis P-40 Warhawk|Curtis P-40B Warhawk]] aircraft, marked with Chinese colors, flew under American control. Their mission was to bomb Japan and defend China but many delays meant the AVG flew in combat after the US and Japan declared war.\n\nThe group consisted of three [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] [[Squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] of around 30 aircraft each that trained in [[Burma]] before the American entry into World War II to defend China against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces. The AVG were officially members of the Chinese Air Force. The group had contracts with salaries ranging from $250 a month for a mechanic to $750 for a squadron commander, roughly three times what they had been making in the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. forces]]. While it accepted some civilian volunteers for its headquarters and ground crew, the AVG recruited most of its staff from the U.S. military.\n\nThe group first saw combat on 20 December 1941, 12 days after [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] (local time). It demonstrated innovative tactical victories when the news in the U.S. was filled with little more than stories of defeat at the hands of the Japanese forces and achieved such notable success during the lowest period of the war for both the U.S. and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] as to give hope to America that it might eventually defeat Japan.  AVG pilots earned official credit and received combat bonuses for destroying 296 enemy aircraft, while losing only 14 pilots in combat.<ref name=\"Ford pp. 30\u201334\">Ford 1991, pp. 30\u201334.</ref> The combat records of the AVG still exist and researchers have found them credible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/american-volunteer-group-claire-l-chennault-and-the-flying-tigers.htm|title=American Volunteer Group: Claire L.

The 23rd FG went on to achieve similar combat success, while retaining the [[nose art]] on the left-over [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]]<nowiki/>s.\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Chennaultcic.jpg|thumb|Chennault in his Kunming office, May 1942. He wears a US Army brigadier general's star on his left shoulder but Chinese insignia otherwise.]]\nThe [[American Volunteer Group]] was largely the creation of [[Claire Chennault|Claire L. Chennault]], a retired [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] officer who had worked in [[Republic of China#History|China]] since August 1937, first as [[military aviation]] advisor to [[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in the early months of the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945)|Sino-Japanese War]], then as director of a [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]] flight school centered in [[Kunming]]. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union supplied fighter and bomber squadrons to China, but these units were mostly withdrawn by the summer of 1940. Chiang then asked for American combat aircraft and pilots, sending Chennault to Washington as an adviser to China's ambassador and Chiang's brother-in-law, [[T. V. Soong]].<ref>{{citation|jstor=2712474|title=American Air Strategy in China, 1939\u20131941: The Origins of Clandestine Air Warfare|journal=American Quarterly|volume=28|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|last1=Schaller|first1=Michael|year=1976|doi=10.2307/2712474}}</ref>\n\nChennault spent the winter of 1940\u20131941 in Washington, supervising the purchase of 100 [[Curtiss P-40]] fighters and the recruiting of 100 pilots and some 200 ground crew and administrative personnel that would constitute the 1st AVG. He also laid the groundwork for [[American Volunteer Group|a follow-on bomber group and a second fighter group]], though these would be aborted after the [[Pearl Harbor attack]].\n\n===Original American volunteer group===\n[[File:Hells Angels, Flying Tigers 1942.jpg|thumb|3rd Squadron Hell's Angels, Flying Tigers, over China, photographed in 1942 by AVG pilot [[Robert T. Smith]]]]\n[[File:Curtis P40.jpg|thumb|right|P-40 Warhawk painted with Flying Tigers shark face at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]]]]\n\nOf the pilots, 60 came from the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[United States Marines|Marine Corps]] and 40 from the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]]. (One army pilot was refused a passport because he had earlier flown as a mercenary in Spain, so only 99 actually sailed for Asia. Ten more army flight instructors were hired as check pilots for Chinese cadets, and several of these would ultimately join the AVG's combat squadrons.) The volunteers were discharged from the armed services, to be employed for \"training and instruction\" by a [[private military contractor]], the [[Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company]] (CAMCO), which paid them $600 a month for pilot officers, $675 a month for flight leaders, $750 for squadron leaders (no pilot was recruited at this level), and about $250 for skilled ground crewmen.<ref>Ford 2007, pp. 45\u201345.</ref>\nSome of the pilots were also orally promised a bounty of $500 for each enemy aircraft shot down, but no one knew if that would actually happen until they returned home and found the funds deposited in their bank.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Letter of resignation from the U.S. Marine Corps, to accept a position with the Central Aircraft Manufacturing... - NARA - 299719.jpg|left|thumb|Resignation letter from the U.S. Marine Corps, used to accept a position with the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Co.]]\n\nDuring the summer and fall 1941, some 300 men carrying civilian passports boarded ships destined for Burma. They were initially based at a British airfield in [[Toungoo]] for training while their aircraft were assembled and test flown by CAMCO personnel at [[Yangon International Airport|Mingaladon Airport]] outside Rangoon. Chennault set up a schoolhouse that was made necessary because many pilots had \"lied about their flying experience, claiming pursuit experience when they had flown only bombers and sometimes much less powerful aeroplanes.\"<ref name=\"AP24\">Feltus, Pamela.

All 9 were trained at Allison Engineworks in Indianapolis, Indiana: all were P-40 mechanics.  Upon arrival in Kunming, 2 other Chinese-Americans were hired, a Ford Motor truck specialist and a doctor.  Total original Chinese-Americans were 11.  Prior to 4 July 1942, 3 of the P-40 mechanics resigned.  The official AVG roster lists the original 8.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nThe AVG was created by an executive order of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. He did not speak English, however, and Chennault never learned to speak Chinese. As a result, all communications between the two men were routed through [[Soong Mei-ling]], \"Madame Chiang\" as she was known to Americans, and she was designated the group's \"honorary commander.\"\n\n===Chennault fighter doctrine===\nChennault preached a radically different approach to air combat based on his study of Japanese tactics and equipment, his observation of the tactics used by [[Polikarpov I-16#The Far East and battles at Khalkhin Gol|Soviet pilots in China]], and his judgment of the strengths and weaknesses of his own aircraft and pilots. The actual average strength of the AVG was never more than 62 combat-ready pilots and fighters. Chennault faced serious obstacles since many AVG pilots were inexperienced and a few quit at the first opportunity. However, he made a virtue out of these disadvantages, shifting unsuitable pilots to staff jobs and always ensuring that he had a squadron or two in reserve. (The AVG had [[flat hierarchy|no ranks]], so no division between officers and enlisted soldiers existed.<ref name=\"life19420820\">{{cite magazine|magazine=Life|last=Belden|first=Jack|title=Chennault Fights to Hold the China Front|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sk4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA70|date=10 August 1942|publisher=Time Inc|page=70}}</ref>)\n\nChennault and the Flying Tigers benefited from the country's warning network, called \"the best air-raid warning system in existence\":<ref name=\"life19420820\" />\n\n{{quote|Starting from areas in Free China, in hundreds of small villages, in lonely outposts, in hills and caves, stretching from near Canton through all Free China to the capital in [[Chungking]] and to [[Lanchow]], far northwest, are a maze of alarm stations equipped with radios and telephones that give instant warning of the approach of Japanese planes.<ref name=\"life19420820\" />}}\n\nWhen Japanese aircraft attacked, Chennault's doctrine called for pilots to take on enemy aircraft in teams from an altitude advantage, since their aircraft were not as maneuverable or as numerous as the Japanese fighters they would encounter. He prohibited his pilots from entering into a turning fight with the nimble Japanese fighters, telling them to execute a diving or slashing attack and to dive away to set up for another attack. This \"dive-and-zoom\" technique was contrary to what the men had learned in U.S. service as well as what the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) pilots in Burma had been taught; it had been used successfully, however, by Soviet units serving with the Chinese Air Force.<ref>[[#refScott1973|Scott 1973]], p. 21.</ref>\n\n===Curtiss P-40===\n{{main|Curtiss P-40}}\n\n[[File:TR 000978 kittyhawk.jpg|200px|thumb|left|1943: A [[Curtiss P-40|Kittyhawk Mark III]] of 112 Squadron, taxiing through scrub at [[Medenine]], Tunisia.

The Tomahawk IIB was similar to the U.S. Army's earlier P-40B model, and there is some evidence that Curtiss actually used leftover components from that model in building the fighters intended for China.<ref>Ford 2007, p. 36.</ref> The fighters were purchased without \"government-furnished equipment\" such as [[Reflector sight|reflector gunsights]], radios and wing guns; the lack of these items caused continual difficulties for the AVG in Burma and China.\n\nThe 100 P-40 aircraft were crated and sent to Burma on third country freighters during spring 1941. At Rangoon, they were unloaded, assembled and test flown by personnel of [[Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company]] (CAMCO) before being delivered to the AVG training unit at Toungoo.<ref>Howard 1991, p. 65.</ref> One crate was dropped into the water and a wing assembly was ruined by salt water immersion, so CAMCO was able to deliver only 99 Tomahawks before war broke out. (Many of those were destroyed in training accidents.) The 100th fuselage was trucked to a CAMCO plant in Loiwing, China, and later made whole with parts from damaged aircraft. Shortages in equipment with spare parts almost impossible to obtain in Burma along with the slow introduction of replacement fighter aircraft were continual impediments although the AVG did receive 50 replacement P-40E fighters from [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] stocks toward the end of its combat tour.\n\nAVG fighter aircraft were painted with a large [[Nose art#History|shark face]] on the front of the aircraft.

Eastern China was under Japanese occupation, so all military supplies for China arrived via the Burma route. By November 1941, when the pilots were trained and most of the P-40s had arrived in Asia, the Flying Tigers were divided into three squadrons: 1st Squadron (\"Adam & Eves\"); 2nd Squadron (\"Panda Bears\") and 3rd Squadron (\"Hell's Angels\").<ref name=\"AP24\"/> They were assigned to opposite ends of the Burma Road to protect this vital line of communications. Two squadrons were based at [[Kunming]] in China, and a third at [[Yangon International Airport|Mingaladon Airport]] near Rangoon. When the United States officially entered the war, the AVG had 82 pilots and 79 aircraft, although not all were combat-ready.  Tiger Erik Shilling, part of the third squadron commented:. \"This was the beginning of the greatest adventure I would ever hope to experience. It wasn't until years later that I fully realized the magnitude and significance of this first step, to be a lifelong adventure in the mystic Far East.\"<ref name=\"Tigers History\"/>\n\nThe AVG's first combat mission was on 20 December 1941, when aircraft of the 1st and 2nd squadrons intercepted 10 unescorted [[Kawasaki Ki-48]] \"Lily\" bombers of the 21st ''Hik\u014dtai'' attacking Kunming. The bombers jettisoned their loads before reaching Kunming. Three of the Japanese bombers were shot down near Kunming and a fourth was damaged so severely that it crashed before returning to its airfield at [[Hanoi]]. Later, Chinese intelligence intercepted Japanese communications indicating that only 1 out of the 10 bombers ultimately returned to base. Furthermore, the Japanese discontinued their raids on Kunming while the AVG was based there. One P-40 crash-landed; it was salvaged for parts. This mission was one of the earliest American aerial victories in the Pacific War.\n\n===Defense of Rangoon===\n[[File:Flying Tigers blood chit from ROC National Government, provided courtesy of Robert Baldwin.jpg|thumb|A \"[[blood chit]]\" issued to the American Volunteer Group ''Flying Tigers''.

Baldwin Collection)]]\n\nThe first squadron had flown up to Kunming to defend the terminus of the Burma Road and saw some combat action on 20 December 1941 while defending Rangoon from Japanese bombers, taking down four of them and disrupting their attack on the Burma Road.<ref name=\"Sherman\">Sherman, Steven.

The 3rd Squadron \u2013 18 aircraft strong \u2013 defended Rangoon from 23\u201325 December. On 23 December, [[Mitsubishi Ki-21]] \"Sally\" heavy bombers of the 60th, 62nd and 98th ''Sentai'', along with single-engined [[Mitsubishi Ki-30]] \"Ann\" attack bombers of the 31st ''Sentai'', sortied against Rangoon. They were escorted by [[Nakajima Ki-27]] \"Nate\" fighters of 77th ''Sentai''. The [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]] (JAAF) formation was intercepted by the AVG and RAF [[Brewster Buffalo]]s of [[No. 67 Squadron RAF|67 Squadron]]. Eight Ki-21s were shot down for the loss of three AVG P-40s. The 60th ''Sentai'' was particularly hard hit \u2013 it lost five out of the 15 bombers it had dispatched. Nevertheless, Rangoon and Mingaladon airfield were successfully bombed, with the city suffering more than 1,000 dead. Two Buffalos and two P-40s were destroyed on the ground, and one P-40 crashed when it attempted to land on a bomb-damaged runway.\n\nOn 25 December, the JAAF returned, reinforced by Ki-21s of 12th ''Sentai'' and [[Nakajima Ki-43]] ''Hayabusa''s (Oscars) of the 64th ''Sentai'' (Colonel [[Tateo Kat\u014d]]'s Flying Squadron). A total of 63 bombers escorted by 25 fighters were committed. These were intercepted by 14 P-40s of the AVG's 3rd Squadron and 15 Buffalos of 67 Squadron. In the two encounters, 35 Japanese bombers and fighters were shot down. The Allies lost two pilots and five P-40s.<ref name=\"Tigers History\">[http://www.usshawkbill.com/tigers/ \"History of the Flying Tigers.\"]  Retrieved: 26 April 2015.</ref> Mingaladon airfield was once again damaged, and eight Buffalos were destroyed on the ground.\n\nAfter its losses in the 23\u201325 December battles, the 3rd Squadron was relieved by the 2nd Squadron \"Panda Bears\", which carried out a series of raids on JAAF airbases in [[Thailand]]. The Japanese had moved aircraft to [[British Malaya|Malaya]] to finish off [[Singapore]], and its remaining aircraft in the area (the 77th, 31st and 62nd ''Sentai'') launched fighter sweeps and counter raids on the Allied airfield at Mingaladon.\n\nOn 12 January, the Japanese launched their [[Burma Campaign]]. Significantly outnumbered, the AVG was gradually reduced through attrition, but often exacted a disproportionate toll of their attackers. On 24 January, six Ki-21s of the 14th Sentai escorted by Ki-27s attacked Mingaladon. All the Ki-21s were shot down by the AVG and RAF defenders. On 28 January, a fighter sweep of 37 Ki-27s was engaged by 16 AVG P-40s and two RAF fighters. Three \"Nates\" were shot down for the loss of two P-40s. The next day, another sweep of 20 Ki-27s of the 70th ''Sentai'' was met by 10 Allied fighters (eight P-40s and two [[Hawker Hurricane]]s). Four were shot down for the loss of no Allied aircraft.\n\nDespite these minor victories and Chennault's reinforcement of the \"Panda Bears\" with pilots from the \"Adam and Eves\", by mid-February, only 10 P-40s were still operational at Mingaladon. Commonwealth troops retreated before the Japanese onslaught, and the AVG was pressed into the ground attack role to support them. One unfortunate result of these missions was a prolonged air attack on a suspected Japanese column on 21 February that turned out to consist of Commonwealth troops. More than 100 Allied lives were lost in this [[friendly fire]] incident. On 27 February, after hearing that the RAF was retreating and pulling out its radar equipment, the AVG withdrew to bases in northern Burma.\n\nBy 24 January, the Flying Tigers had destroyed 73 Japanese aircraft while losing only five themselves \u2013 a notable performance, considering the AVG was outnumbered and faced experienced and fully trained Japanese pilots. The main disadvantage of JAAF fighter pilots of this period was the near-obsolescence of their predominant fighter type in the theater, the Ki-27. Though more maneuverable than the P-40, its armament and performance was inferior. Lightly constructed and armed, it could not withstand frontal attacks nor could it out-dive Allied fighters such as the P-40; if it attempted to, it often came apart in the air. In fact, its cruising speed was less than that of the Ki-21 bombers it was intended to escort.<ref name=\"Sherman\"/>\n\n===Retreat into China===\nAfter Rangoon was lost to the Japanese at the end of February, the AVG relocated to [[Magwe, Burma|Magwe]], a small British airfield more than 300 miles north of Rangoon. Chennault started moving elements of the now reconstituted 3rd Squadron to Magwe as reinforcement to his worn down 1st and 2nd squadrons. Aircraft attrition became so high that at this point, individual squadron distinctions became meaningless, and all three squadrons had elements based there, along with a number of RAF aircraft. In total, the Allies had 38 aircraft, including eight P-40s and 15 [[Hawker Hurricanes]]. Opposing them were 271 Japanese aircraft, including 115 fighters. Although the AVG and the RAF scored some successes against the JAAF, Magwe was continuously bombed, including a very heavy raid on 21 March by 151 bombers and fighters. On 23 March with only four aircraft left, the AVG was forced to relocate to Loiwing, just across the Chinese border. The Tigers crossed into China on a rickety suspension bridge over a deep gorge. A few months later, they came back to destroy the bridge so no Japanese soldiers could come across that way into China.<ref>Wambold Jr., Donald A.. \"A Flying Tiger's War.\" World War II 20, no. 2, 2005, pp. 22\u201325.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nakajima Ki-43-II.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Nakajima Ki-43]] Hayabusa was a single-engined land-based fighter used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force in World War II]]\n\nReinforced by new P-40E \"Kittyhawks\" and by repaired aircraft from the AVG's excellent maintenance group, 12 P-40s were based at Loiwing on 8 April. Despite the long retreats, their losses and incessant air combat, the AVG still retained their abilities. That day, 12 Oscars from the 64th ''Sentai'' raided the base. In the ensuing series of dogfights, four Ki-43s were downed in exchange for one P-40E destroyed on the ground. During this period, Chinese and American commanders pressured Chennault to order his pilots to undertake so-called \"morale missions\". These were overflights and ground attacks intended to raise the morale of hard-pressed Chinese soldiers by showing they were getting air support. The AVG's pilots seethed with resentment at these dangerous missions (which some considered useless), a feeling which culminated in the so-called \"Pilot's Revolt\" of mid-April. Chennault suppressed the \"revolt\" and ordered the ground attack missions to continue. But despite their efforts, the Allied situation in Burma continued to deteriorate. On 29 April the AVG was ordered to evacuate Loiwing and relocate to [[Baoshan City|Baoshan]] in China.\n\nLike the AVG's other bases, Baoshan was repeatedly bombed by the Japanese Army Air Force. Still, the AVG scored against their JAAF tormentors, bringing down four \"Nates\" of the 11th Sentai on 5 May and two \"Anns\". By 4 May, the successful Japanese Burma offensive was winding down, except for mopping up actions. One of these was an attempt by a regiment of the Japanese 56th Division to drive for Kunming, an effort that was stopped by the Chinese army operating with strong air support from the AVG. On 7 May the Japanese Army began building a pontoon bridge across the upper Salween River, which would allow them to move troops and supplies into China and drive towards Kunming. To stem this tide, 2nd Squadron Leader [[David Lee \"Tex\" Hill]] led a flight of four new P-40Es bombing and strafing into the mile deep Salween River Gorge. During the next four days, the AVG pilots flew continuous missions into the gorge, effectively neutralizing the Japanese forces. This prevented a Japanese advance on Kunming and Chungking; the Japanese never advanced farther than the west bank of the upper Salween. Claire Chennault later wrote of these critical missions, \"The American Volunteer Group had staved off China's collapse on the Salween.\" Despite being on the defensive thereafter, the AVG continued to harass the JAAF with raids on their Vietnamese bases.\n\nWith the Burma campaign over, Chennault redeployed his squadrons to provide air protection for China. The [[Doolittle Raid]] had prompted the Japanese to launch an offensive to seize AVG air bases that could be used for attacks on the Japanese homeland. By 1 June, personnel that would form the nucleus of the new USAAF 23rd Fighter Group (the AVG's replacement) were beginning to trickle into the theater. Some of the last missions the AVG flew were defending Guilin against raids by JAAF Nates, Lilys, and new [[Kawasaki Ki-45 Toryu]] (\"Nick\") heavy fighters. The AVG's last combat was over Hengyang on the day it was disbanded, 4 July 1942. In this final action, the AVG shot down four [[Nakajima Ki-27|Ki-27]]<nowiki/>s with no AVG losses.\n\n==Assessment of the AVG==\n[[File:Flying tigers pilot.jpg|right|thumb|Flight leader and fighter ace [[Robert T.

Retrieved: 5 July 2011.</ref>]]\nThe AVG lacked many resources. Despite its location in areas with [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], it had only \"four doctors, three nurses and a bottle of iodine.\" Pilots found the food disgusting, and the slow mail from home and lack of women hurt morale. A squadron had 45 maintenance personnel compared to the normal more than 100, and only one base could perform major repairs.<ref name=\"life19420820\" /> Nonetheless, the AVG was officially credited with 297 enemy aircraft destroyed, including 229 in the air.<ref name=\"Olynyk\">Olynk 1986 {{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref> Fourteen AVG pilots were killed in action, captured, or disappeared on combat missions. Two died of wounds sustained in bombing raids, and six were killed in accidents during the Flying Tigers' existence as a combat force.\n\nThe AVG's kill ratio was superior to that of contemporary Allied air groups in Malaya, the Philippines, and elsewhere in the Pacific theater. The AVG's success is all the more remarkable since they were outnumbered by Japanese fighters in almost all their engagements. The AVG's P-40s were superior to the JAAF's Ki-27s, but the group's kill ratio against modern Ki-43s was still in its favor. In ''Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941\u20131942'', Daniel Ford attributes the AVG's success to morale and group ''esprit de corps''. He notes that its pilots were \"triple volunteers\" who had volunteered for service with the U.S. military, the AVG, and brutal fighting in Burma. The result was a corps of experienced and skilled volunteer pilots who wanted to fight.\n\nDuring their service with the Nationalist Chinese air force, 33 AVG pilots and three ground crew received the [[Order of the Cloud and Banner]], and many AVG pilots received the Chinese Air Force Medal. Each AVG ace and double ace was awarded the Five Star or Ten Star Wing Medal.\n\n==Members of the AVG==\n* [[Pappy Boyington|Gregory \"Pappy\" Boyington]] broke his contract with the AVG<ref>Rossi, J.

Chennault was reinstated as a colonel and immediately promoted to brigadier general commanding U.S. Army air units in China (initially designated [[China Air Task Force]] and later the [[Fourteenth Air Force|14th Air Force]]), while continuing to command the AVG by virtue of his position in the [[Republic of China Air Force|Chinese Air Force]]. On 4 July 1942, the AVG was replaced by the 23rd Fighter Group. Most AVG pilots refused to remain with the unit as a result of the strong arm tactics by the USAAF general sent to negotiate with them. However, five pilots accepted commissions in China including \"Tex\" Hill, one of Chennault's most loyal devotees, with others remaining for a two-week transition period. (U.S. airmen and the press continued to use the \"Flying Tiger\" name to refer to USAAF units in China to the end of the war, and the name continues to be applied to certain air force and army aviation squadrons.) Most AVG pilots became transport pilots in China, went back to America into civilian jobs, or rejoined the military services and fought elsewhere in the war.<ref>Ford 2007, ch. 17.</ref>\n\nOne of the pilots drawn to the success of the AVG was [[Robert Lee Scott, Jr.]] who was flying supplies into Kunming over [[the Hump]] from India. He convinced Chennault to loan him a P-40 which he flew to protect the supply route; his aggressiveness led to Chennault's recruiting him as commander of the 23rd Fighter Group. Scott brought recognition to his exploits and those of the Flying Tigers with his 1943 bestselling autobiography ''God is My Co-Pilot'' that was then made by [[Warner Bros.]] into a [[God is My Co-Pilot (film)|popular film]] in 1945.\n\n===Tributes and memorials===\n[[File:Flying Tigers Monument.jpg|thumb|Flying Tigers Monument [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], Florida Memorial Park]]\n[[File:16 26 076 WWII museum.jpg|thumb|Restored P-40 on display at the [[National World War II Museum]]]]\n\nThere are several museum displays in the United States honoring the Flying Tigers. The [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio, has an extensive display dedicated to the AVG, including an [[A-2 jacket]] worn by an AVG pilot in China, a banner presented to the AAF by the Chinese government, and a P-40E. The [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]] in [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], Florida also has a Flying Tiger display. The Chennault Aviation Museum in Monroe, Louisiana has an extensive collection of Flying Tigers and AVG memorabilia. The AVG monument in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] Memorial Garden features a marble sculpture of a [[pagoda]] crowned with a brass model of a P-40; the monument stands nearly 14 feet tall.  The Palm Springs Air Museum has a display of memorabilia inside a mockup of AVG ground facilities, with a P-40N painted in AVG markings.  Finally, a memorial to the AVG and 14th AF is located at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in California, depicting a P-40 in AVG markings with a bronze plaque describing the unit's history and Vandenberg's role as headquarters for the 14th AF.\n\nThere are also several memorials to the AVG in Asia. In [[Chiang Mai]], Thailand, a [[marble]] [[obelisk]] was dedicated on 11 November 2003, inscribed to Chennault; to Jack Newkirk, who was killed in North [[Thailand]] on 24 March 1942; and to Charles Mott and William McGarry, who were shot down and captured in Thailand. In Taiwan, Madame Chiang Kai-Shek requested a statue of Chennault in the New Park of Taipei to commemorate this wartime friend after his death (the statue has since been relocated to Hualian AFB). A Flying Tigers Memorial is located in the village of [[Zhijiang Dong Autonomous County|Zhijiang]], [[Hunan|Hunan Province]], China and there is a museum dedicated exclusively to the Flying Tigers. The building is a steel and marble structure, with wide sweeping steps leading up to a platform with columns holding up the memorial's sweeping roof; on its back wall, etched in black marble, are the names of all members of the AVG, 75th Fighter Squadron, and 14th Air Force who died in China. In 2005, the city of Kunming held a ceremony memorializing the history of the Flying Tigers in China, and on 20 December 2012, the Flying Tigers Museum opened in Kunming. The date is the 71st anniversary of the first combat from Kunming of the Flying Tigers. The Memorial Cemetery to Anti-Japanese Aviator Martyrs in Nanjing, China features a wall listing the names of Flying Tiger pilots and other pilots who defended China in World War II, and has several unmarked graves for such American pilots.<ref>[http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/139639.htm ''Former 'Flying Tigers' Visit Nanjing Memorial Cemetery''.] ''china.org (Xinhua News Agency)'', 25 August 2005.

The fighter is believed to be a P-40E piloted by John Blackburn when it crashed into the lake on a gunnery training flight on 28 April 1942, killing the pilot. His body was recovered from the aircraft, which was submerged in 20 feet of water. In 1997 a U.S.-Chinese group called the Sino-American Aviation Heritage Foundation was formed to locate the aircraft and possibly raise and restore it. In March 1998, they contacted the China Expedition Association about conducting the recovery operation. Over 300 aircraft are believed to have crashed into Lake Dianchi (including a second AVG P-40) so locating the aircraft proved difficult. In 2003, an aircraft believed to be Blackburn's was found embedded in nine feet of bottom silt. An effort was made in September 2005 to raise the aircraft, but the recovery was plagued with difficulties and it remains deep under the lake bottom. Since the aircraft was complete and relatively undamaged when John Blackburn's body was removed from it in 1942, it is hoped that the aircraft will be in good condition and capable of being restored, possibly to flying condition.\n\n===Recognition by the United States===\nJust before their 50th reunion in 1992, the AVG veterans were retroactively recognized as members of the U.S. military services during the seven months the group was in combat against the Japanese.
