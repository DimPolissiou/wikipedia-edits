Aguadilla is spread over 15 wards and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of [[Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nAccording to sources, a [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] settlement called Amam\u00f3n was located close to the [[Culebrinas River]].<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107001412/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html |date=November 7, 2012 }} on Proyecto Salon Hogar</ref>\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]. In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Hig\u00fcey wards.<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\">[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 Aguadilla: Fundaci\u00f3n e historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161941/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 |date=2013-03-15 }} on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico</ref> This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the [[Strategic Air Command]] [[72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy]] equipped with [[B-52]]s, an important strategic facility during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the [[Rafael Hernandez International Airport]]. The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel.

Centro de Adiestramiento y Bellas Artes (CABA) since 1979 has been the only public school of arts in Puerto Rico (7\u201312).  Ramey is also the site of the new Ramey Skating Park and a new \"mariposario\" (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.\n\nThere is still an active part of the base that hosts the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other, characteristics of a small town. Also, as a characteristic of a town, has a flag and an emblem. The creation of the flag and emblem was done by Roberto Rom\u00e1n Acevedo.\n\n===Tragedy on election day in 1944===\n[[File:Sign for former train station, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Sign for former train station, Aguadilla]]\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the most violent railroad accident in its history in Aguadilla.<ref name=\"endi\">''La Tragedia del 7 de noviembre de 1944'' (The Tragedy of November 7, 1944) by Haydee E.

Oscar Valle, an Aguadilla correspondent to the local [[El Mundo (Puerto Rico)|El Mundo]] newspaper, summarized the scene in a more dramatic way: \"The locomotive suffered a terrible explosion as it derailed, and the impact was so strong that 3 passenger cars were converted into a fantastic mound of wreckage\".<ref name=\"endi\"/> In the end, 16 passengers lost their lives, including the engineer and the boilerman, and 50 were injured in the crash.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|title=Puerto Rico y aquel tren que nunca lleg\u00f3 a destino|language=es|access-date=2019-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928140427/http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|archive-date=2019-09-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nAguadilla is located in the northwest coast of the island of [[Puerto Rico]], in the Western Coastal Plains.

founded in 1775 by Luis de C\u00f3rdova, is a city and [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipality]] located in the northwestern tip of [[Puerto Rico]], bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, north of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]], and [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] and west of [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]]. Aguadilla is spread over 15 wards and Aguadilla Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is a principal city of [[Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebasti\u00e1n Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n\nAccording to sources, a [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] settlement called Amam\u00f3n was located close to the [[Culebrinas River]].<ref>[http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html Caciques y Yucayeques de Puerto Rico] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107001412/http://www.proyectosalonhogar.com/link%20p.r/www.linktopr.com/caciques.html |date=November 7, 2012 }} on Proyecto Salon Hogar</ref>\n\nThe present territory of Aguadilla was originally part of the territory of [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]]. In 1775, the foundation of Aguadilla by Don Luis de C\u00f3rdova was approved.<ref>[http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 Aguadilla] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161913/http://boricuaonline.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=17 |date=2013-03-15 }} on BoricuaOnline.com</ref> But it wasn't until 1780 that the territory was properly segregated, making the founding of the town official. Originally, Aguadilla was constituted by the Victoria and Hig\u00fcey wards.<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\">[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 Aguadilla: Fundaci\u00f3n e historia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315161941/http://www.enciclopediapr.org/esp/article.cfm?ref=08060301&page=2 |date=2013-03-15 }} on Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico</ref> This region was already inhabited and known as Aguadilla before 1770. In 1776, [[Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra]] in his description of the towns of the island, mentioned it as the \"new Town of San Carlos of the Aguadilla.\" Nevertheless, according to Dr. [[Agust\u00edn Stahl]] in his ''Foundation of Aguadilla'', it was not until 1780 that the town was officially founded. The construction of a new church and the proceedings to become an independent village began in the 1775.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n[[Image:Aguadilla Pueblo.jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of downtown Aguadilla.]]\n\nThe population in the Village of Aguadilla continued to increase constantly mainly due to its excellent port and strategic location in the route of the boats. In 1776, when [[Santo Domingo]] became independent for the first time, the Spanish descended loyals  emigrated to Puerto Rico, mainly to Aguadilla, which caused the population to continue increasing significantly. In 1831, according to Don [[Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova]], the party of Aguadilla belonged to Aguada. At this time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla was as follows: Pueblo Norte (North Town), Pueblo Sur (South Town), Ceiba Alta, Ceiba Baja, Monta\u00f1a, Malezas, Aguacate, Dos Palmas, Camaseyes, Plainela, Borinquen, Arenales, Hig\u00fcey, Corrales, Victoria, and Mangual.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nDon Pedro Tom\u00e1s de C\u00f3rdova mentions the road of Aguadilla formed by Punta Borinquen and San Francisco, as the \"fordeadero of the ships that travel from Europe to [[Havana]] and Mexico\". He adds that its \"port is the most frequented in the Island due to the proportions that it offers to refresh all class of ship.\"{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1860, Aguadilla was officially declared a [[village]].<ref name=\"enciclopediapr\"/> Several years later, when the island was territorially organized into seven departments, Aguadilla became the head of the third department that included the municipalities of Aguada, [[Isabela, Puerto Rico|Isabela]], [[Lares, Puerto Rico|Lares]], [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]], [[Rincon, Puerto Rico|Rincon]], and [[San Sebasti\u00e1n, Puerto Rico|San Sebasti\u00e1n]]. In January 1841 a Royal Order transferred the judicial party from Aguada to Aguadilla. In 1878, according to Don Manuel Ebeda y Delgado, the territorial organization of Aguadilla had varied a little. At this time Plainela, Hig\u00fcey, and Mangual wards are not mentioned. The Dos Palmas ward appears as Palmar. Also at this time, three new wards are mentioned: Guerrero, Caimital Alto, and Caimital Bajo. In 1898, even with the change of sovereignty in the island, the territorial organization of Aguadilla is the same to that of 1878. Nevertheless, in the Census of 1899, downtown Aguadilla appears constituted by Hig\u00fcey, Iglesia, Nueva, Santa Barbara, and Tamarindo wards. Malezas ward appears subdivided into Maleza Alta and Maleza Baja. From that time, the territorial organization of Aguadilla did not change, until 1948, when the Puerto Rico Department of Planning prepared the map of the city and its wards, and following instructions of city authorities, Hig\u00fcey and parts of Caimital Alto wards are annexed to Downtown Aguadilla.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Ramey Air Force Base===\n[[File:FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|FAA radar tower in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]]\nAguadilla was the site of the U.S. military's [[Ramey Air Force Base]] for almost five decades. During this period, Aguadilla was home to the [[Strategic Air Command]] [[72d Bombardment Wing, Heavy]] equipped with [[B-52]]s, an important strategic facility during the [[Cold War]].\n\nThough the infrastructure still exists, the airport was handed over to the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]] in 1973. The aerial facilities are now controlled by the Puerto Rico Ports Authority and comprise the [[Rafael Hernandez International Airport]]. The barracks now host the Faro Inn Suites, a 79-room hotel. The Officer's Club now hosts the Faro Conference Center, a {{convert|22000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} meeting facility. The hospital is now the Courtyard by Marriott Punta Borinquen Resort & Casino,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bqncy-courtyard-aguadilla |title=Marriott.com |access-date=2007-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012044552/http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/bqncy-courtyard-aguadilla |archive-date=2007-10-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> a 150-room hotel with a casino and the first Marriott in Puerto Rico out of the [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] Metropolitan Area.\n\nRamey also hosts the [[University of Puerto Rico at Aguadilla|University of Puerto Rico \u2013 Aguadilla Campus]] and the Friedrich Froebel Bilingual School<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.froebelbilingualschool.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827093233/http://www.froebelbilingualschool.com/ |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> (K-9).

Centro de Adiestramiento y Bellas Artes (CABA) since 1979 has been the only public school of arts in Puerto Rico (7\u201312).  Ramey is also the site of the new Ramey Skating Park and a new \"mariposario\" (butterfly farm) and the Ramey Shopping Center.\n\nThere is still an active part of the base that hosts the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Borinquen Air Station. There are also other government agencies based at Ramey. They include the United States [[Department of Homeland Security]], U.S. Customs & Border Protection's [[Office of Air and Marine]] and [[Office of Border Patrol]], the ''Fuerzas Unidas de R\u00e1pida Acci\u00f3n'' (United Forces for Rapid Action) of the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]] and the [[Puerto Rico National Guard]].\n\nThere is also a post office, the ''Centro de Servicios al Conductor'' (Driver's Services Center), a bakery, and a [[Banco Popular de Puerto Rico]] location.\n\n===San Antonio===\n[[File:Aguadilla Plaza, Puerto Rico, 1910.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Aguadilla in 1910]]\nThe beginning of San Antonio Village was back in the mid-19th century. It was composed by 60 families. Originally the place where these families were located was known as Bajura de Vadi, place later to be known as San Antonio.\n\nIn 1918, as a consequence of the [[1918 San Ferm\u00edn earthquake]], the village was totally destroyed by a [[tsunami]]. The families suffered the struggles cause by this natural disaster, due by the proximity of the village to the shore.\n\nThe residents of the village decided re-localize the village in a higher area further from shore. The new location was what today is known as Ramey.\n\nAt this new location prosperity was not to be delayed. Various leaders and commercial owners of the time, took a step to carry the village forward. Most of the poor houses disappeared.\n\nThe village's infrastructure started its evolution. Luis R. Esteves and Juan Garcia established the first two theaters in the area. A new was social club form, known as \"Luz del Porvenir\" (Light of the Future). A new school system was the pride of the village because it offered them the opportunity to give their children an education without having to go {{convert|9|mi|km}} south downtown. There was also a new bakery and a post office, among other facilities. At this time, the village also began its Patron Festival.\n\nThe clothing industry was a major source of employment.\n\nIn September 1939, some {{convert|3796|acre|km2|1}} covered by sugar cane, was expropriated for the military at the cost of $1,215,000, in order to build an air base that came to be known as [[Ramey Air Force Base]].\n\nSince the foundation, the village has suffered three expropriations as a result of expansions to [[Ramey Air Force Base]]. This expropriations delayed and ended the plans to turn San Antonio into a town.\n\nToday, the population of San Antonio consists of approximately ten thousand people. It has a modern square, a Puerto Rico State Police Station, a coliseum, an industrial park, public housing, a baseball park, a public school system, shops, and many other, characteristics of a small town. Also, as a characteristic of a town, has a flag and an emblem. The creation of the flag and emblem was done by Roberto Rom\u00e1n Acevedo.\n\n===Tragedy on election day in 1944===\n[[File:Sign for former train station, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|Sign for former train station, Aguadilla]]\nOn the early morning hours of November 7, 1944, Puerto Rico suffered the most violent railroad accident in its history in Aguadilla.<ref name=\"endi\">''La Tragedia del 7 de noviembre de 1944'' (The Tragedy of November 7, 1944) by Haydee E.

It stopped at the Jimenez Station in Aguadilla for a routine [[Railroad engineer|engineer]] and [[fireman (steam engine)|boilerman]] exchange with Train No. 4 which was heading towards San Juan. The engineer assigned to Train No. 3's ride from Jimenez Station to Ponce was Jose Antonio Roman, an experienced freight train engineer, but who had never worked in passenger travel.<ref name=\"endi\"/> When the train left the station at 2:00 am, it was hauling 6 passenger cars with hundreds of commuters and two freight cars.\n[[File:Cuesta Vieja, street in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico.jpg|thumb|{{lang|es|Cuesta Vieja}} in Aguadilla]]\n\nAt 2:20&nbsp;a.m. the train started to descend a hill section known as ''Cuesta Vieja'' (Old Hill) in Aguadilla at what some witnesses described as an exaggerated speed. When the train reached the leveling-off point at the bottom of the hill it [[Derailment|derailed]]. The steam locomotive crashed into a ditch where it exploded and one of the freight cars crashed into one of the passenger cars, killing many inside. Witnesses described the scene as horrendous, with some accounts stating that parents were throwing their children out the windows to save them from the wreckage.<ref name=\"endi\"/> Chief of Police Guillermo Arroyo stated that the locomotive (No. 72), the express car, and three second class passenger cars were completely destroyed. Oscar Valle, an Aguadilla correspondent to the local [[El Mundo (Puerto Rico)|El Mundo]] newspaper, summarized the scene in a more dramatic way: \"The locomotive suffered a terrible explosion as it derailed, and the impact was so strong that 3 passenger cars were converted into a fantastic mound of wreckage\".<ref name=\"endi\"/> In the end, 16 passengers lost their lives, including the engineer and the boilerman, and 50 were injured in the crash.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|title=Puerto Rico y aquel tren que nunca lleg\u00f3 a destino|language=es|access-date=2019-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928140427/http://www.eleditor.net/medio-ambiente/puerto-rico-y-aquel-tren-que-nunca-llego-a-destino/|archive-date=2019-09-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nAguadilla is located in the northwest coast of the island of [[Puerto Rico]], in the Western Coastal Plains.

Although Trump initially stated that the ban would include all goods and passengers from Europe, the details of the travel ban were later clarified: the ban affects people who are not US citizens who in the past two weeks visited the 26-member [[Schengen Area]], but does not include trade goods and cargo. The travel ban notably excluded the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]], who were added 3 days later. Trump did not consult the [[European Union]] before imposing the travel ban.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Specia|first=Megan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/trump-travel-ban-coronavirus.html|title=What You Need to Know About Trump's European Travel Ban|date=12 March 2020|access-date=12 March 2020|website=[[The New York Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312161301/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/europe/trump-travel-ban-coronavirus.html|archive-date=12 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> \n\nCarmen Reinicke of ''[[Business Insider]]'' wrote that Trump's address to the nation \"failed to calm investors' concerns about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak\".<ref name=\"MarketInsider\">{{Cite web|url=https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-today-index-reaction-coronavirus-trump-travel-ban-2020-3-1028990017|title=Dow slips 2,000 points as Trump coronavirus response disappoints, Fed funding boost fades|last=Reinicke|first=Carmen|date=12 March 2020|website=[[Business Insider|Market Insider]]|access-date=12 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312143739/https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-news-today-index-reaction-coronavirus-trump-travel-ban-2020-3-1028990017|archive-date=12 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> According to one writer for [[Barron's (newspaper)|''Barron's'']], \"Dow futures were up around 300 points before the president\u2019s address began.

The protocol specifies that  each IP packet must have a  which contains (among other things) the IP address of the sender of the packet. The source IP address is normally the address that the packet was sent from, but the sender's address in the header can be altered, so that to the recipient it appears that the packet came from another source. \n\nThe protocol requires the receiving computer to send back a response to the source IP address, so that spoofing is mainly used when the sender can anticipate the network response or does not care about the response.\n\nThe source IP address provides only limited information about the sender. It may provide general information on the region, city and town when on the packet was sent. It does not provide information on the identity of the sender or the computer being used.\n\n==Applications==\nIP address spoofing involving the use of a trusted IP address can be used by network intruders to overcome network security measures, such as  based on IP addresses. This type of attack is most effective where trust relationships exist between machines. For example, it is common on some corporate networks to have internal systems trust each other, so that users can log in without a username or password provided they are connecting from another machine on the internal network (and so must already be logged in). By spoofing a connection from a trusted machine, an attacker on the same network may be able to access the target machine without authentication.\n\nIP address spoofing is most frequently used in , where the objective is to flood the target with an overwhelming volume of traffic, and the attacker does not care about receiving responses to the attack packets. Packets with spoofed IP addresses are more difficult to filter since each spoofed packet appears to come from a different address, and they hide the true source of the attack. Denial of service attacks that use spoofing typically randomly choose addresses from the entire IP address space, though more sophisticated spoofing mechanisms might avoid unroutable addresses or unused portions of the IP address space. The proliferation of large  makes spoofing less important in denial of service attacks, but attackers typically have spoofing available as a tool, if they want to use it, so defenses against denial-of-service attacks that rely on the validity of the source IP address in attack packets might have trouble with spoofed packets.  , a technique used to observe denial-of-service attack activity in the Internet, relies on attackers' use of IP spoofing for its effectiveness.\n\n==Legitimate uses==\nThe use of packets with a false source IP address is not always evidence of malicious intent. For example, in performance testing of websites, hundreds or even thousands of \"vusers\" (virtual users) may be created, each executing a test script against the website under test, in order to simulate what will happen when the system goes \"live\" and a large number of users log in on at once.\n\nSince each user will normally have its own IP address, commercial testing products (such as , , and others) can use IP spoofing, allowing each user its own \"return address\" as well.\n\n==Services vulnerable to IP spoofing==\nConfiguration and services that are vulnerable to IP spoofing:\n\n* RPC ( services)\n* Any service that uses IP address authentication\n<!-- * The [[X Window System]]-->\n* The R services suite (, , etc.)\n\n==Defense against spoofing attacks==\nis one defense against IP .

For example, [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) uses sequence numbers negotiated with the remote machine to ensure that arriving packets are part of an established connection. Since the attacker normally cannot see any reply packets, the sequence number must be guessed in order to hijack the connection. The poor implementation in many older operating systems and network devices, however, means that TCP sequence numbers can be predicted.\n\n== Other definitions ==\nThe term '''''spoofing''''' is also sometimes used to refer to ''header forgery'', the insertion of false or misleading information in [[e-mail spoofing|e-mail]] or [[netnews]] headers.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 9,878.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28/28157.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}</ref> Its [[county seat]] is [[Woodville, Mississippi|Woodville]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The county is named for [[James Wilkinson]], a Revolutionary War military leader and first governor of the [[Louisiana Territory]] after its acquisition by the United States in 1803.\n\n==History==\n[[File:WOODVILLE REPUBLICAN bw sign.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Wilkinson County's ''[[Woodville Republican]]'', begun in 1823, is (as of 2012) the oldest newspaper and the oldest business in continuous operation in Mississippi. The sign, facing Depot Street, is on the exterior west wall of the newspaper offices in [[Woodville, Mississippi|Woodville]].]]\n\nIn the 19th century, this county was developed by European-American settlers as [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] along the [[Mississippi River]], which forms the western border of the county. Much of the bottomlands and interior were undeveloped frontier until after the [[American Civil War]]. The intensive cultivation depended on the labor of numerous [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]; in the early 19th century, more than a million slaves were relocated to the Deep South from the [[Upper South]] in a major [[forced migration]]. The population of this county quickly became majority [[African American|black]] as enslaved workers were brought in.\n\nThe [[West Feliciana Railroad]] was later built to help get the cotton [[commodity crop]] to market. Some planters got wealthy during the [[antebellum era|antebellum years]] and built fine [[mansion]]s in the [[county seat]] of [[Woodville, Mississippi]]. Jane and Samuel Emory Davis family moved here in 1812 with their several children, and lived at a plantation near Woodville. Their youngest son, [[Jefferson Davis]], attended the Wilkinson Academy in Woodville for two years before going to Kentucky to another school.<ref>Strode, Hudson (1955). ''Jefferson Davis, Volume I: American Patriot''. New York: Harcourt, Brace & Company, pp. 11-27</ref>\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[freedmen]] and [[Planter (American South)|planters]] negotiated new working arrangements, and [[sharecropping]] became widespread. Although cotton continued as the commodity crop, a long agricultural depression kept prices low.\n\nFollowing Reconstruction, white violence against blacks increased through the later decades of the 19th century and into the early 20th century. According to 2017 data compiled in ''Lynching in America'' (2015-2017), some nine [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of African Americans]] were recorded in Wilkinson County.<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America'', Supplement: Lynching by County, 3rd edition, 2017, p.7; accessed 07 June 2018]</ref>\n\nThe peak of population in the county was reached in 1900, after which many blacks left in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the North and Midwest, to escape the [[racial segregation]] and violence, and the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement]] suffered in the state since passage by the white Democratic-dominated legislature of a new constitution in 1890 raising barriers to voter registration. More constraints came with [[Jim Crow]] laws.\n\nIn the early 20th century the [[boll weevil]] infestation destroyed much of the cotton crops, and mechanization caused a further loss of agricultural jobs. The exit of many African Americans from the state did not change the state's exclusion of African Americans from politics. They were not enabled to vote until after passage of the federal [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1965. Cotton cultivation was revived, but it is produced on a highly mechanized, industrial scale.\n\nSouthwest Mississippi was an area of white violence against blacks during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. In February 1964, the White Knights of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] officially formed. Clifton Walker, 37, a married father of five and employee of International Paper Company in Natchez, who was not politically active, was killed in an ambush on Poor House Road near his home. The evidence showed there had been a crowd of shooters on both sides of the road.<ref>[http://www.hannapub.com/concordiasentinel/frank_morris_murder/cold-case-ambush-on-poor-house-road-the-murder-of/article_5e19f828-472c-11e3-a484-0019bb30f31a.html Frank Morris, \"Cold Case: Ambush on Poor House Road: The 1964 murder of Clifton Walker\"], ''Concordia Sentinel'', 22 July 2012; accessed 07 June 2018</ref> This lynching cold case has never been solved, although it was among numerous ones that the [[FBI]] was investigating since 2007, before the Donald Trump administration ended the effort in 2018.\n\nTimber has been harvested and processed in the county as a new commodity crop. The population of the rural county has continued to decline because of lack of jobs. Towns have started to develop [[heritage tourism]] to attract more visitors.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|688|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|678|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|9.7|sqmi}} (1.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 8, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074019/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:US 61.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 61]]\n*[[Image:Circle sign 24.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 24]]\n*[[Image:Circle sign 33.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 33]]\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Adams County, Mississippi|Adams County]] (north)\n*[[Franklin County, Mississippi|Franklin County]] (northeast)\n*[[Amite County, Mississippi|Amite County]] (east)\n*[[East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]] (southeast)\n*[[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]] (south)\n*[[Concordia Parish, Louisiana]] (west)\n\n===National protected area===\n*[[Homochitto National Forest]] (part)\n\n===State protected area===\n*[[Clark Creek Natural Area]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Clark Creek|url=https://www.mdwfp.com/parks-destinations/state-parks/clark-creek|website=MDWFP Parks & Destinations|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Clark creek natural area ms.jpg|thumb|left|Waterfall at Clark Creek Natural Area, near Pond, Wilkinson County, Mississippi]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 5068\n|1820= 9718\n|1830= 11686\n|1840= 14193\n|1850= 16914\n|1860= 15933\n|1870= 12705\n|1880= 17815\n|1890= 17592\n|1900= 21453\n|1910= 18075\n|1920= 15319\n|1930= 13957\n|1940= 15955\n|1950= 14116\n|1960= 13235\n|1970= 11099\n|1980= 10021\n|1990= 9678\n|2000= 10312\n|2010= 9878\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8792\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ms190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 9,878.<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/28/28157.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 7, 2013}}</ref> Its [[county seat]] is [[Woodville, Mississippi|Woodville]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The county is named for [[James Wilkinson]], a Revolutionary War military leader and first governor of the [[Louisiana Territory]] after its acquisition by the United States in 1803.\n\n==History==\n[[File:WOODVILLE REPUBLICAN bw sign.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Wilkinson County's ''[[Woodville Republican]]'', begun in 1823, is (as of 2012) the oldest newspaper and the oldest business in continuous operation in Mississippi. The sign, facing Depot Street, is on the exterior west wall of the newspaper offices in [[Woodville, Mississippi|Woodville]].]]\n\nIn the 19th century, this county was developed by European-American settlers as [[cotton]] [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]] along the [[Mississippi River]], which forms the western border of the county. Much of the bottomlands and interior were undeveloped frontier until after the [[American Civil War]]. The intensive cultivation depended on the labor of numerous [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]; in the early 19th century, more than a million slaves were relocated to the Deep South from the [[Upper South]] in a major [[forced migration]]. The population of this county quickly became majority [[African American|black]] as enslaved workers were brought in.\n\nThe [[West Feliciana Railroad]] was later built to help get the cotton [[commodity crop]] to market. Some planters got wealthy during the [[antebellum era|antebellum years]] and built fine [[mansion]]s in the [[county seat]] of [[Woodville, Mississippi]]. Jane and Samuel Emory Davis family moved here in 1812 with their several children, and lived at a plantation near Woodville. Their youngest son, [[Jefferson Davis]], attended the Wilkinson Academy in Woodville for two years before going to Kentucky to another school.<ref>Strode, Hudson (1955). ''Jefferson Davis, Volume I: American Patriot''. New York: Harcourt, Brace & Company, pp. 11-27</ref>\n\nAfter the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[freedmen]] and [[Planter (American South)|planters]] negotiated new working arrangements, and [[sharecropping]] became widespread. Although cotton continued as the commodity crop, a long agricultural depression kept prices low.\n\nFollowing Reconstruction, white violence against blacks increased through the later decades of the 19th century and into the early 20th century. According to 2017 data compiled in ''Lynching in America'' (2015-2017), some nine [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings of African Americans]] were recorded in Wilkinson County.<ref>[https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf ''Lynching in America'', Supplement: Lynching by County, 3rd edition, 2017, p.7; accessed 07 June 2018]</ref>\n\nThe peak of population in the county was reached in 1900, after which many blacks left in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to the North and Midwest, to escape the [[racial segregation]] and violence, and the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement]] suffered in the state since passage by the white Democratic-dominated legislature of a new constitution in 1890 raising barriers to voter registration. More constraints came with [[Jim Crow]] laws.\n\nIn the early 20th century the [[boll weevil]] infestation destroyed much of the cotton crops, and mechanization caused a further loss of agricultural jobs. The exit of many African Americans from the state did not change the state's exclusion of African Americans from politics. They were not enabled to vote until after passage of the federal [[Voting Rights Act]] in 1965. Cotton cultivation was revived, but it is produced on a highly mechanized, industrial scale.\n\nSouthwest Mississippi was an area of white violence against blacks during the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. In February 1964, the White Knights of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] officially formed. Clifton Walker, 37, a married father of five and employee of International Paper Company in Natchez, who was not politically active, was killed in an ambush on Poor House Road near his home. The evidence showed there had been a crowd of shooters on both sides of the road.<ref>[http://www.hannapub.com/concordiasentinel/frank_morris_murder/cold-case-ambush-on-poor-house-road-the-murder-of/article_5e19f828-472c-11e3-a484-0019bb30f31a.html Frank Morris, \"Cold Case: Ambush on Poor House Road: The 1964 murder of Clifton Walker\"], ''Concordia Sentinel'', 22 July 2012; accessed 07 June 2018</ref> This lynching cold case has never been solved, although it was among numerous ones that the [[FBI]] was investigating since 2007, before the Donald Trump administration ended the effort in 2018.\n\nTimber has been harvested and processed in the county as a new commodity crop. The population of the rural county has continued to decline because of lack of jobs. Towns have started to develop [[heritage tourism]] to attract more visitors.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|688|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|678|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|9.7|sqmi}} (1.4%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 8, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074019/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt|archivedate=September 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:US 61.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Highway 61]]\n*[[Image:Circle sign 24.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 24]]\n*[[Image:Circle sign 33.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 33]]\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Adams County, Mississippi|Adams County]] (north)\n*[[Franklin County, Mississippi|Franklin County]] (northeast)\n*[[Amite County, Mississippi|Amite County]] (east)\n*[[East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]] (southeast)\n*[[West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana]] (south)\n*[[Concordia Parish, Louisiana]] (west)\n\n===National protected area===\n*[[Homochitto National Forest]] (part)\n\n===State protected area===\n*[[Clark Creek Natural Area]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Clark Creek|url=https://www.mdwfp.com/parks-destinations/state-parks/clark-creek|website=MDWFP Parks & Destinations|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Clark creek natural area ms.jpg|thumb|left|Waterfall at Clark Creek Natural Area, near Pond, Wilkinson County, Mississippi]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 5068\n|1820= 9718\n|1830= 11686\n|1840= 14193\n|1850= 16914\n|1860= 15933\n|1870= 12705\n|1880= 17815\n|1890= 17592\n|1900= 21453\n|1910= 18075\n|1920= 15319\n|1930= 13957\n|1940= 15955\n|1950= 14116\n|1960= 13235\n|1970= 11099\n|1980= 10021\n|1990= 9678\n|2000= 10312\n|2010= 9878\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=8792\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=November 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ms190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

Allegaert finished each race more than 24 hours ahead of the second-placed rider. During the 2014 race, Allegaert took a ferry across the [[Bay of Kotor]] in Montenegro that was not allowed in the race rules, before climbing up to the checkpoint on [[Lov\u0107en|Mount Lov\u0107en]]. He therefore had to return to the point of the infringement and ride an allowable route, which cost him over 5 hours, but he still maintained a comfortable lead.<ref name=Apidura/>\n\nIn 2015, Allegaert won the supported [http://www.redbull.com/en/bike/events/1331730949594/red-bull-trans-siberian-extreme/ Red Bull Trans Siberian Extreme] race, which is almost 9,200&nbsp;km and divided into stages of between 300 and 1,400&nbsp;km. The total time does not include stops between stages.<ref name=redbull15/>\n\nIn 2017, Allegaert led for most of the 5,500&nbsp;km-long [[Indian Pacific Wheel Race]]. The race was cancelled on the morning of the 14th day due to the second-placed rider, [[Mike Hall (cyclist)|Mike Hall]], being fatally struck by a car.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cyclist in Indian Pacific Wheel Race from Fremantle to Sydney killed in pre-dawn crash outside Canberra|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-31/cyclist-killed-on-road-south-of-canberra/8403812|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref> After being informed of the incident with less than 300&nbsp;km remaining, Allegaert chose to honor the memory of his comrade by riding almost to the finish line at [[Sydney Opera House]], stopping within sight of it but never actually reaching it.<ref name=ipwr17/>\n\nReports often state that Allegaert only stops 1\u20132 hours per day total during unsupported races.<ref name=Apidura/> However, he often turns his tracker off before overnight stops and turns it back on afterwards and these pauses are not recorded by the automated systems.

Allegaert finished each race more than 24 hours ahead of the second-placed rider. During the 2014 race, Allegaert took a ferry across the [[Bay of Kotor]] in Montenegro that was not allowed in the race rules, before climbing up to the checkpoint on [[Lov\u0107en|Mount Lov\u0107en]]. He therefore had to return to the point of the infringement and ride an allowable route, which cost him over 5 hours, but he still maintained a comfortable lead.<ref name=Apidura/>\n\nIn 2015, Allegaert won the supported [http://www.redbull.com/en/bike/events/1331730949594/red-bull-trans-siberian-extreme/ Red Bull Trans Siberian Extreme] race, which is almost 9,200&nbsp;km and divided into stages of between 300 and 1,400&nbsp;km. The total time does not include stops between stages.<ref name=redbull15/>\n\nIn 2017, Allegaert led for most of the 5,500&nbsp;km-long [[Indian Pacific Wheel Race]]. The race was cancelled on the morning of the 14th day due to the second-placed rider, [[Mike Hall (cyclist)|Mike Hall]], being fatally struck by a car.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cyclist in Indian Pacific Wheel Race from Fremantle to Sydney killed in pre-dawn crash outside Canberra|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-31/cyclist-killed-on-road-south-of-canberra/8403812|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref> After being informed of the incident with less than 300&nbsp;km remaining, Allegaert chose to honor the memory of his comrade by riding almost to the finish line at [[Sydney Opera House]], stopping within sight of it but never actually reaching it.<ref name=ipwr17/>\n\nReports often state that Allegaert only stops 1\u20132 hours per day total during unsupported races.<ref name=Apidura/> However, he often turns his tracker off before overnight stops and turns it back on afterwards and these pauses are not recorded by the automated systems. In reality, he typically stops for an average total of 4\u20136 hours per 24 hours during these events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deakin.edu.au/~jbrinkhoff/ipwr/IPWR.html|title=Per day stats|accessdate=3 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n2018, Allegaert is currently riding a [[Curve Cycling]] Belgie Disc Titanium road bike with [[Campagnolo]] gearing.<ref>{{cite web|last1=O\u2019Mahone |first1=Jayson|title=Belgian ultra endurance cycling legend Kristof Allegaert joins Curve Cycling|url=https://bikerumor.com/2018/06/20/belgian-ultra-endurance-cycling-legend-kristof-allegaert-joins-curve-cycling|website=bikerumour.com|accessdate=20 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n2014-2017 Allegaert has been riding a [[Jaegher]] Interceptor steel road bike with [[Campagnolo]] gearing.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brett|first1=Matt|title=Transcontinental 2016: Kristof Allegaert's Jaegher Interceptor|url=http://road.cc/content/tech-news/199727-transcontinental-2016-kristof-allegaerts-jaegher-interceptor|website=road.cc|publisher=Farrelly Atkinson Limited|accessdate=6 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Allegaert, Kristof}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Belgian male cyclists]]\n[[Category:Ultra-distance cyclists]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:1976 births]]\n", "name_user": "Lepricavark", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:added short description", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristof_Allegaert"}
