Internally each character shape was defined on a 5\u00d79 pixel grid, which was then interpolated by smoothing diagonals to give a 10\u00d718 pixel character, with a characteristically angular shape, surrounded to the top and to the left by two pixels of blank space. The algorithm only works on monochrome source data, and assumes the source pixels will be logical true or false depending on whether they are 'on' or 'off'. Pixels 'outside the grid pattern' are assumed to be off.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amigan.yatho.com/saa5050.pdf |title=Mullard SAA5050 Datasheet}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/devices/video/saa5050.cpp#L445 |title=SAA5050 Smoothing source code from the MAME project}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=102137#Post102137 |title=Forum post showing Teletext reference test page on SAA5050 chip}}</ref>\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n<pre>\nA B C --\\ 1 2\nD E F --/ 3 4\n\n1 = B | (A & E & !B & !D)\n2 = B | (C & E & !B & !F)\n3 = E | (!A & !E & B & D)\n4 = E | (!C & !E & B & F) \n</pre>\nNote that this algorithm, like the Eagle algorithm below, has a flaw:\nIf a pattern of 4 pixels in a hollow diamond shape appears, the hollow will be obliterated by the expansion.\nThe SAA5050's internal character ROM carefully avoids ever using this pattern.\n{|role=presentation class=multicol\n|<pre>\nThe degenerate case:\n *\n* *\n *\n</pre>\n|\n<pre>\nbecomes:\n  **  \n **** \n******\n******\n ****\n  **\n</pre>\n|}\n\n=== EPX/Scale2\u00d7/AdvMAME2\u00d7{{anchor|EPX}} ===\nEric's Pixel Expansion (EPX) is an algorithm developed by [[Eric Johnston (engineer)|Eric Johnston]] at [[LucasArts]] around 1992, when porting the [[SCUMM]] engine games from the IBM PC (which ran at 320\u00d7200\u00d7256 colors) to the early color Macintosh computers, which ran at more or less double that resolution.<ref name=\"mactech\">{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Kas |authorlink= | year=1999 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.15/15.06/FastBlitStrategies/index.html |title=Fast Blit Strategies: A Mac Programmer's Guide |work=[[MacTech]] |pages= |publisher= | language= |accessdate= }}</ref>\nThe algorithm works as follows, expanding P into 4 new pixels based on P's surroundings:\n\n[[File:EPX Algorithm Diagram.png|frameless|The EPX algorithm expands pixel P into four new pixels.]]\n\n<pre>\n 1=P; 2=P; 3=P; 4=P;\n IF C==A => 1=A\n IF A==B => 2=B\n IF D==C => 3=C\n IF B==D => 4=D\n IF of A, B, C, D, three or more are identical: 1=2=3=4=P\n</pre>\nLater implementations of this same algorithm (as AdvMAME2\u00d7 and Scale2\u00d7, developed around 2001) have a slightly more efficient but functionally identical implementation:\n<pre>\n 1=P; 2=P; 3=P; 4=P;\n IF C==A AND C!=D AND A!=B => 1=A\n IF A==B AND A!=C AND B!=D => 2=B\n IF D==C AND D!=B AND C!=A => 3=C\n IF B==D AND B!=A AND D!=C => 4=D\n</pre>\nAdvMAME2\u00d7 is available in [[DOSBox]] via the <code>scaler=advmame2x</code> [[configuration file|dosbox.conf]] option.\n\nThe AdvMAME4\u00d7/Scale4\u00d7 algorithm is just EPX applied twice to get 4\u00d7 resolution.\n\n==== Scale3\u00d7/AdvMAME3\u00d7 and ScaleFX ====\n[[File:EPX-neep.png|thumb|right|270px|EPX can be used to scale bitmap fonts.

It was designed by Derek Liauw Kie Fa, also known as Kreed, primarily for use in console and computer [[emulator]]s, and it has remained fairly popular in this niche. Many of the most popular emulators, including [[ZSNES]] and [[VisualBoyAdvance]], offer this scaling algorithm as a feature.\n\nSince Kreed released<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vdnoort.home.xs4all.nl/emulation/2xsai/|title=Kreed's Homepage: 2xSaI|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref> the source code under the [[GNU General Public License]], it is freely available to anyone wishing to utilize it in a project released under that license.

Each works by comparing the color value of each pixel to those of its eight immediate neighbours, marking the neighbours as close or distant, and using a pregenerated lookup table to find the proper proportion of input pixels' values for each of the 4, 9 or 16 corresponding output pixels. The hq3x family will perfectly smooth any diagonal line whose slope is \u00b10.5, \u00b11, or \u00b12 and which is not anti-aliased in the input; one with any other slope will alternate between two slopes in the output. It will also smooth very tight curves.

Scaled background textures keep the sharp characteristics of the original image, rather than becoming blurred like HQx (often ScaleHQ in practice) tends to do. Newest xBR versions are multi-pass and can preserve small details better.

It then calculates what rotation offset to use by favoring sampled points which are not boundary pixels.  Next, the rotated image is created with a nearest-neighbor scaling and rotation algorithm that simultaneously shrinks the big image back to its original size and rotates the image.  Finally, overlooked single-pixel details are restored if the corresponding pixel in the source image is different and the destination pixel has three identical neighbors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?showtopic=8848&st=15&p=159754&#entry159754|title=Sprite Rotation Utility|work=Sonic and Sega Retro Message Board|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Fast RotSprite ===\nFast RotSprite is a fast rotation algorithm for pixel art developed by Oleg Mekekechko for [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.PixelStudio Pixel Studio] app. It's based on [[Pixel-art scaling algorithms#RotSprite|RotSprite]] algorithm but has significantly better performance with slight quality loss.

Many work only on specific scale factors: 2\u00d7 is the most common, with 3\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 5\u00d7 and 6\u00d7 also present.\n\n[[File:Pixel-Art_Scaling_Comparison.png|thumb|right|260px|Comparison of common pixel-art scaling algorithms.

Internally each character shape was defined on a 5\u00d79 pixel grid, which was then interpolated by smoothing diagonals to give a 10\u00d718 pixel character, with a characteristically angular shape, surrounded to the top and to the left by two pixels of blank space. The algorithm only works on monochrome source data, and assumes the source pixels will be logical true or false depending on whether they are 'on' or 'off'. Pixels 'outside the grid pattern' are assumed to be off.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://amigan.yatho.com/saa5050.pdf |title=Mullard SAA5050 Datasheet}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/mamedev/mame/blob/master/src/devices/video/saa5050.cpp#L445 |title=SAA5050 Smoothing source code from the MAME project}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=102137#Post102137 |title=Forum post showing Teletext reference test page on SAA5050 chip}}</ref>\n\nThe algorithm works as follows:\n<pre>\nA B C --\\ 1 2\nD E F --/ 3 4\n\n1 = B | (A & E & !B & !D)\n2 = B | (C & E & !B & !F)\n3 = E | (!A & !E & B & D)\n4 = E | (!C & !E & B & F) \n</pre>\nNote that this algorithm, like the Eagle algorithm below, has a flaw:\nIf a pattern of 4 pixels in a hollow diamond shape appears, the hollow will be obliterated by the expansion.\nThe SAA5050's internal character ROM carefully avoids ever using this pattern.\n{|role=presentation class=multicol\n|<pre>\nThe degenerate case:\n *\n* *\n *\n</pre>\n|\n<pre>\nbecomes:\n  **  \n **** \n******\n******\n ****\n  **\n</pre>\n|}\n\n=== EPX/Scale2\u00d7/AdvMAME2\u00d7{{anchor|EPX}} ===\nEric's Pixel Expansion (EPX) is an algorithm developed by [[Eric Johnston (engineer)|Eric Johnston]] at [[LucasArts]] around 1992, when porting the [[SCUMM]] engine games from the IBM PC (which ran at 320\u00d7200\u00d7256 colors) to the early color Macintosh computers, which ran at more or less double that resolution.<ref name=\"mactech\">{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Kas |authorlink= | year=1999 |url=http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.15/15.06/FastBlitStrategies/index.html |title=Fast Blit Strategies: A Mac Programmer's Guide |work=[[MacTech]] |pages= |publisher= | language= |accessdate= }}</ref>\nThe algorithm works as follows, expanding P into 4 new pixels based on P's surroundings:\n\n[[File:EPX Algorithm Diagram.png|frameless|The EPX algorithm expands pixel P into four new pixels.]]\n\n<pre>\n 1=P; 2=P; 3=P; 4=P;\n IF C==A => 1=A\n IF A==B => 2=B\n IF D==C => 3=C\n IF B==D => 4=D\n IF of A, B, C, D, three or more are identical: 1=2=3=4=P\n</pre>\nLater implementations of this same algorithm (as AdvMAME2\u00d7 and Scale2\u00d7, developed around 2001) have a slightly more efficient but functionally identical implementation:\n<pre>\n 1=P; 2=P; 3=P; 4=P;\n IF C==A AND C!=D AND A!=B => 1=A\n IF A==B AND A!=C AND B!=D => 2=B\n IF D==C AND D!=B AND C!=A => 3=C\n IF B==D AND B!=A AND D!=C => 4=D\n</pre>\nAdvMAME2\u00d7 is available in [[DOSBox]] via the <code>scaler=advmame2x</code> [[configuration file|dosbox.conf]] option.\n\nThe AdvMAME4\u00d7/Scale4\u00d7 algorithm is just EPX applied twice to get 4\u00d7 resolution.\n\n==== Scale3\u00d7/AdvMAME3\u00d7 and ScaleFX ====\n[[File:EPX-neep.png|thumb|right|270px|EPX can be used to scale bitmap fonts.

The hq3x family will perfectly smooth any diagonal line whose slope is \u00b10.5, \u00b11, or \u00b12 and which is not anti-aliased in the input; one with any other slope will alternate between two slopes in the output.
