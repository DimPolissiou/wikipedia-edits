Reports varied over whether she was fired because American audiences had trouble understanding her accent, because of a lack of chemistry between her and Abdul, because Cole is unknown to American audiences, because Cole was confused with [[Sheryl Crow]] by American audiences, or that she had stepped down herself due to homesickness.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13558288 |title=Cheryl Cole is 'dropped by US X Factor' |author= |date=May 26, 2011 |work= |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Cheryl-Cole-Reports-Singer-Is-Replaced-By-Nicole-Scherzinger-As-US-X-Factor-Judge-Over-Thick-Accent/Article/201105415999828?DCMP=News-search-sslc&lid=ARTICLE_15999828_CherylCole:ReportsSingerIsReplacedByNicoleScherzingerAsUSXFactorJudgeOverThickAccent&lpos=searchresults |title=Singer Cheryl Cole 'Dropped By US X Factor' |author= |date=May 26, 2011 |publisher=Sky News |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}</ref> Cole's departure was officially confirmed on June 6 in a statement from Fox, which also confirmed Scherzinger as her replacement.

After all of them performed, the acts were brought in front of the judges as part of one of three groups. Two of these groups made it through and one was eliminated, leaving 100 acts still in the competition. The judges threw a party for the remaining acts that for many lasted late into the night.\n\nDay two started with everyone getting woken up at 6:00am and heading to meet Reid. He informed them that they would be put into \"ensembles\" and groups, and would be working with stylists, choreographers, and vocal coaches. They were given five hours to learn the songs they were given. One third of the acts would be eliminated by the end of the second day. Several of the ensembles performances were aired. The first ensemble performed \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", the second ensemble performed \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\", the third ensemble performed \"[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]\", the fourth ensemble performed \"[[Wishing on a Star (Jay-Z song)|Wishing on a Star]]\", the fifth ensemble performed \"[[Superman (It's Not Easy)]]\", the sixth ensemble performed \"[[Feeling Good]]\", the seventh ensemble performed \"[[I Have Nothing]]\" and the eighth ensemble performed \"[[Run (Leona Lewis song)|Run]]\".\n\nDay two continued with more ensembles performing for the judges. The ninth ensemble performed \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\". Next, they showed a couple of quick shots of some ensembles, presumably consisting of all people that would not make it through to the end. The tenth ensemble that was covered in detail performed \"[[I Won't Let Go (Rascal Flatts song)|I Won't Let Go]]\". The eleventh (and final) ensemble performed \"[[Chasing Cars]]\". Next, the judges deliberated, and decided on which a third of the acts would be eliminated. Once again, three groups were brought in. Group 1 was eliminated, meaning groups 2 and 3 made it through to the next round of boot camp.\n\nDay three had all 64 acts perform for the judges. They were given a list of 35 songs at the end of the day two and were told to choose one that best represented them. At the end of this final boot camp round, 32 acts would go through to judges' houses. This final performance was done in front of a crowd of 3,000 people. After each of the performances, the judges gave no feedback.\n\nThe first boot camp episode aired on October 5, 2011 and covered the first two days of boot camp.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/> The second bootcamp episode aired on October 6 and covered the rest of day two and the remainder of bootcamp. By the end of bootcamp, 162 acts were cut to 32, 8 acts in each category. The judges later found out which category they would mentor and their acts joined them at their house.\n\n===Judges' houses===\n[[Enrique Iglesias]] helped Scherzinger to pick her finalists in [[Malibu, California]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] acted as a guest judge helping Abdul to pick her finalists in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. [[Rihanna]] helped Reid choose his finalists in [[The Hamptons|The Hamptons, New York]].

Her vote either meant that if she would eliminate Canty, Canty would be eliminated or if she voted against Crow, the result would go to deadlock and the public vote would determine the result. While Scherzinger was deliberating, she wanted the public vote to decide the outcome that week and sent the result to deadlock. Following this, Crow was voted out which led to Crow breaking down on stage and Scherzinger was booed off the stage and her future on the show was put in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dean Piper |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2011/12/11/nicole-scherzinger-faces-the-axe-after-us-x-factor-backlash-115875-23626040/ |title=Nicole Scherzinger faces the axe after US X Factor backlash \u2013 3am & Mirror Online |publisher=Mirror.co.uk |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> She subsequently received death threats from some viewers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Geno |url=http://www.genogenogeno.com/2011/12/nicole-scherzinger-on-receiving-death.html |title=Geno's World: Nicole Scherzinger On Receiving Death Threats Over Rachel Crow's 'X Factor' Elimination |publisher=Genogenogeno.com |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}</ref> Scherzinger was let go at the end of the season and later relocated to [[London]] to be a judge on the [[The X Factor (British series 9)|2012 series of the UK show]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.thexfactorusa.com Official website]\n\n{{The X Factor U.S.}}\n{{The X Factor (U.S.) contestants}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X Factor (American season 1)}}\n[[Category:The X Factor (American TV series)|Season 1]]\n[[Category:2011 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:The X Factor seasons|United States 01]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use American English|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox reality music competition\n|series        = The X Factor (U.S.){{!}}The X Factor\n|season        = 1\n|first_aired   = {{start date|2011|9|21}}\n|last_aired    = {{start date|2011|12|22}}\n|image         = [[File:Melanie Amaro 2013.jpg|200px]]\n|judges        = [[Paula Abdul]]<br/>[[Simon Cowell]]<br>[[L.A.

After all of them performed, the acts were brought in front of the judges as part of one of three groups. Two of these groups made it through and one was eliminated, leaving 100 acts still in the competition. The judges threw a party for the remaining acts that for many lasted late into the night.\n\nDay two started with everyone getting woken up at 6:00am and heading to meet Reid. He informed them that they would be put into \"ensembles\" and groups, and would be working with stylists, choreographers, and vocal coaches. They were given five hours to learn the songs they were given. One third of the acts would be eliminated by the end of the second day. Several of the ensembles performances were aired. The first ensemble performed \"[[Creep (Radiohead song)|Creep]]\", the second ensemble performed \"[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]\", the third ensemble performed \"[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]\", the fourth ensemble performed \"[[Wishing on a Star (Jay-Z song)|Wishing on a Star]]\", the fifth ensemble performed \"[[Superman (It's Not Easy)]]\", the sixth ensemble performed \"[[Feeling Good]]\", the seventh ensemble performed \"[[I Have Nothing]]\" and the eighth ensemble performed \"[[Run (Leona Lewis song)|Run]]\".\n\nDay two continued with more ensembles performing for the judges. The ninth ensemble performed \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\". Next, they showed a couple of quick shots of some ensembles, presumably consisting of all people that would not make it through to the end. The tenth ensemble that was covered in detail performed \"[[I Won't Let Go (Rascal Flatts song)|I Won't Let Go]]\". The eleventh (and final) ensemble performed \"[[Chasing Cars]]\". Next, the judges deliberated, and decided on which a third of the acts would be eliminated. Once again, three groups were brought in. Group 1 was eliminated, meaning groups 2 and 3 made it through to the next round of boot camp.\n\nDay three had all 64 acts perform for the judges. They were given a list of 35 songs at the end of the day two and were told to choose one that best represented them. At the end of this final boot camp round, 32 acts would go through to judges' houses. This final performance was done in front of a crowd of 3,000 people. After each of the performances, the judges gave no feedback.\n\nThe first boot camp episode aired on October 5, 2011 and covered the first two days of boot camp.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/> The second bootcamp episode aired on October 6 and covered the rest of day two and the remainder of bootcamp. By the end of bootcamp, 162 acts were cut to 32, 8 acts in each category. The judges later found out which category they would mentor and their acts joined them at their house.\n\n===Judges' houses===\n[[Enrique Iglesias]] helped Scherzinger to pick her finalists in [[Malibu, California]] and [[Pharrell Williams]] acted as a guest judge helping Abdul to pick her finalists in [[Santa Barbara, California]].

While Scherzinger was deliberating, she wanted the public vote to decide the outcome that week and sent the result to deadlock.

In addition to the general features of the seal described above, he also saw the central figure as a male deity; as three-faced, with a possible fourth face towards the back; and, as [[ithyphallic]], while conceding that what appeared to be the exposed phallus could instead be a tassel hanging from the waistband. Most significantly he identified the seal as an early prototype of the [[Hindu]] god [[Shiva]] (or, his Vedic predecessor, [[Rudra]]), who also was known by the title [[Pashupati]] ('lord or father of all the animals') in historic times.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=52-57}} In a 1928\u201329 publication, Marshall summarized his reasons for the identification as follows:\n{{quote|My reasons for the identification are four. In the first place the figure has three faces and that Siva was portrayed with three as well as with more usual five faces, there are abundant examples to prove. Secondly, the head is crowned with the horns of a bull and the ''[[trishul (weapon)|trisula]]'' are characteristic emblems of Siva. Thirdly, the figure is in a typical yoga attitude, and Siva was and still is, regarded as a ''mahayogi''\u2014the prince of ''[[Yogi]]s''. Fourthly, he is surrounded by animals, and Siva is par excellence the \"Lord of Animals\" (''Pasupati'')\u2014of the wild animals of the jungle, according to the Vedic meaning of the word ''pashu'', no less than that of domesticated cattle.{{sfn|Mackay|1928\u201329|pp=74-75}}}}\n\nLater, in 1931, he expanded his reasons to include the fact that Shiva is associated with the phallus in the form of ''[[linga]]'', and that in medieval art he is shown with deer or ibexes, as are seen below the throne on the seal.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=52-57}}{{sfn|McEvilley|1981|pp=45-46}} Marshall's analysis of the Indus Valley religion, and the Pashupati seal in particular, was very influential and widely accepted for at least the next two generations. For instance, Herbert Sullivan, wrote in 1964 that Marshall's analysis \"has been accepted almost universally and has greatly influenced scholarly understanding of the historical development of Hinduism\".{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}} Writing in 1976, [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] introduced an article otherwise critical of Marshall's interpretation by observing that \"no matter what position is taken regarding the seal's iconography, it is always prefaced by Marshall's interpretation. On balance the proto-{{IAST|\u015aiva}} character of the seal has been accepted.\"{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975\u201376|p=47}} Thomas McEvilley noted, in line with Marshall, that the central figure was in the [[hatha yoga|yoga]] pose [[Mulabandhasana]]<!--pose desc & illus BKS Iyengar Light on Yoga 1979 [1966] pp. 344-346-->, quoting the ''[[Kalpa Sutra]]''{{'}}s description \"a [[squatting position]] with joined heels\" used with meditation and fasting to attain infinite knowledge (''kevala'').{{sfn|McEvilley|1981|pp=47-51}}\nAnd [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] noted in 2011 that, following Marshall's analysis, \"nearly all efforts at interpreting the [Indus Valley] religion have centered discussion around [the Pashupati seal] figure\".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|p=399}}\n\n===Objections and alternate interpretations===\nA lot of discussion has taken place about this seal.<ref name=\"Bryant, Edwin, p.163\">Bryant, Edwin, p.163</ref> While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections.<ref>See e. g. James G. Lochtefeld, ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', vol. 2: N\u2013Z. The Rosen Publishing Group, New York 2002, p. 633, who doubts the connection of the seal to Shiva, given the supposedly late age of the god.</ref> [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in [[Vedas|Vedic literature]]  Rudra was not a protector of wild animals.{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975\u201376}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|p=180-181}} Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with ''Mahisha'', the buffalo-god and the surrounding animals with [[vahana]]s (vehicles, mounts) of deities for the four cardinal directions.{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}}{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|pp=399-432}} Various interpretations have been connected to the seal, some relating it to the  Vedic deities: [[Rudra]], [[Agni]], Mahisha, [[Varuna]], Yogi, Yogi with Trident as head dress, [[Rishyasringa|\u1e5a\u1e63ya\u015b\u1e5b\u1e45ga]] (sage with horns) who was a contemporary of [[Dasharatha]] {{fact|date=June 2017}}; and  some non-aryan deities, including of Dravidian origin, sitting in yoga posture.<ref name=\"Bryant, Edwin, p.163\"/> Writing in 2002, [[Gregory L.

Fourthly, he is surrounded by animals, and Siva is par excellence the \"Lord of Animals\" (''Pasupati'')\u2014of the wild animals of the jungle, according to the Vedic meaning of the word ''pashu'', no less than that of domesticated cattle.{{sfn|Mackay|1928\u201329|pp=74-75}}}}\n\nLater, in 1931, he expanded his reasons to include the fact that Shiva is associated with the phallus in the form of ''[[linga]]'', and that in medieval art he is shown with deer or ibexes, as are seen below the throne on the seal.{{sfn|Marshall|1931|pp=52-57}}{{sfn|McEvilley|1981|pp=45-46}} Marshall's analysis of the Indus Valley religion, and the Pashupati seal in particular, was very influential and widely accepted for at least the next two generations. For instance, Herbert Sullivan, wrote in 1964 that Marshall's analysis \"has been accepted almost universally and has greatly influenced scholarly understanding of the historical development of Hinduism\".{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}} Writing in 1976, [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] introduced an article otherwise critical of Marshall's interpretation by observing that \"no matter what position is taken regarding the seal's iconography, it is always prefaced by Marshall's interpretation. On balance the proto-{{IAST|\u015aiva}} character of the seal has been accepted.\"{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975\u201376|p=47}} Thomas McEvilley noted, in line with Marshall, that the central figure was in the [[hatha yoga|yoga]] pose [[Mulabandhasana]]<!--pose desc & illus BKS Iyengar Light on Yoga 1979 [1966] pp. 344-346-->, quoting the ''[[Kalpa Sutra]]''{{'}}s description \"a [[squatting position]] with joined heels\" used with meditation and fasting to attain infinite knowledge (''kevala'').{{sfn|McEvilley|1981|pp=47-51}}\nAnd [[Alf Hiltebeitel]] noted in 2011 that, following Marshall's analysis, \"nearly all efforts at interpreting the [Indus Valley] religion have centered discussion around [the Pashupati seal] figure\".{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|p=399}}\n\n===Objections and alternate interpretations===\nA lot of discussion has taken place about this seal.<ref name=\"Bryant, Edwin, p.163\">Bryant, Edwin, p.163</ref> While Marshall's work has earned some support, many critics and even supporters have raised several objections.<ref>See e. g. James G. Lochtefeld, ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism'', vol. 2: N\u2013Z. The Rosen Publishing Group, New York 2002, p. 633, who doubts the connection of the seal to Shiva, given the supposedly late age of the god.</ref> [[Doris Meth Srinivasan|Doris Srinivasan]] has argued that the figure does not have three faces, or yogic posture, and that in [[Vedas|Vedic literature]]  Rudra was not a protector of wild animals.{{sfn|Srinivasan|1975\u201376}}{{sfn|Srinivasan|1997|p=180-181}} Herbert Sullivan and Alf Hiltebeitel also rejected Marshall's conclusions, with the former claiming that the figure was female, while the latter associated the figure with ''Mahisha'', the buffalo-god and the surrounding animals with [[vahana]]s (vehicles, mounts) of deities for the four cardinal directions.{{sfn|Sullivan|1964}}{{sfn|Hiltebeitel|2011|pp=399-432}} Various interpretations have been connected to the seal, some relating it to the  Vedic deities: [[Rudra]], [[Agni]], Mahisha, [[Varuna]], Yogi, Yogi with Trident as head dress, [[Rishyasringa|\u1e5a\u1e63ya\u015b\u1e5b\u1e45ga]] (sage with horns) who was a contemporary of [[Dasharatha]] {{fact|date=June 2017}}; and  some non-aryan deities, including of Dravidian origin, sitting in yoga posture.<ref name=\"Bryant, Edwin, p.163\"/> Writing in 2002, [[Gregory L. Possehl]] concluded that while it would be appropriate to recognize the figure as a deity, its association with the water buffalo, and its posture as one of ritual discipline, regarding it as a proto-[[Shiva]] \"would go to far\".{{sfn|Possehl|2002|pp=141-144}}\n\n==See also==\n[[Gundestrup cauldron]]]\n[[Cernunnos]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hiltebeitel|first=Alf |authorlink=Alf Hiltebeitel |editor=Adluri, Vishwa |editor2=Bagchee, Joydeep|title=When the Goddess was a Woman: Mahabharata Ethnographies - Essays by Alf Hiltebeitel| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZupXwid01CoC|year=2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-19380-2 |chapter=The Indus Valley \"Proto-\u015aiva\", Reexamined through Reflections on the Goddess, the Buffalo, and the Symbolism of v\u0101hanas}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Ernest John Henry|title=Excavations at Mohenjodaro|journal=Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India|year=1928\u201329|pages=67\u201375|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Mackay|first=Earnest John Henry|title=Further excavations at Mohenjo-Daro : being an official account of archaeological excavations at Mohenjo-Daro carried out by the Government of India between the years 1927 and 1931|url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.9954|year=1937\u201338|publisher=Government of India|location=Delhi|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=McEvilley|first=Thomas|title=An Archaeology of Yoga|journal=RES: Anthropology and Aesthetics|year=1981|volume=1|pages=44\u201377|authorlink=Thomas McEvilley|jstor=20166655|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=John|authorlink=John Marshall (archaeologist)|title=Mohenjo-Daro and the Indus Civilization: Being an Official Account of Archaeological Excavations at Mohenjo-Daro Carried Out by the Government of India Between the Years 1922 and 1927|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tpc7FjVk0BMC|year=1931|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1179-5|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Possehl|first=Gregory L. |authorlink=Gregory Possehl|title=The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XVgeAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA154|year=2002|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=978-0-7591-1642-9|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Doris|title=The So-Called Proto-\u015biva Seal from Mohenjo-Daro: An Iconological Assessment|journal=Archives of Asian Art|year=1975\u201376|volume=29|pages=47\u201358|authorlink=Doris Meth Srinivasan|jstor=20062578|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Srinivasan|first=Doris Meth|title=Many Heads, Arms and Eyes: Origin, Meaning and Form in Multiplicity in Indian Art|year=1997|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004107588|authorlink=Doris Meth Srinivasan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZheP9dIX9wC&|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Herbert P.|title=A Re-Examination of the Religion of the Indus Civilization|journal=History of Religions|year=1964|volume=4|issue=1|pages=115\u2013125|jstor=1061875|doi=10.1086/462498|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Bryant|first1=Edwin|title=The quest for the origins of vedic culture the Indo-Aryan migration debate.|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195137774|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Grpz1tmcSMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Quest+for+the+Origins+of+Vedic+Culture:+The+Indo-Aryan+Migration+Debate&hl=en&sa=X&ei=exFqVLH4JYG9uAS73oDICQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=indus%20valley&f=false|accessdate=18 November 2014}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|title=A Peaceful Realm: The Rise And Fall of the Indus Civilization|location=Boulder|publisher=Westview Press|year=2001|isbn=0-8133-3532-9|url=https://archive.org/details/peacefulrealmri00mcin}}\n*{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Jane |title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&pg=FA275|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-907-2|chapter=Religion and ideology}}\n*{{cite book|last=Thapar|first=Romila|authorlink=Romila Thapar|title=Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5irrXX0apQC&pg=FA85|year=2004|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24225-8}}\n*{{cite journal|journal=Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies |authorlink=Michael Witzel|last=Witzel|first=Michael|title=The Languages of Harappa|date=February 2000|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/IndusLang.pdf}}\n*{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Rita P.|authorlink=Rita P.

He was also managing director of [[Persepolis F.C.]] from 2005 until 2007. and also managing director of [[Rah Ahan F.C.]] from 2007 to 2012. He is the younger brother of [[Abbas Ansarifard]].\n\n==Playing career==\nHe started his football career before the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian revolution]], playing with ''Homayoun F.C.''. After the revolution he played for [[Shahin F.C.]] and ''Takavar F.C.''. In 1985, he moved to Persepolis F.C. and stayed there until 1992. He was a member of the Iranian national team during the same time.\n\n==Honours==\n===Club===\n;Persepolis\n*[[Hazfi Cup]] (2): 1987\u201388, 1991\u201392\n*[[Tehran Province League]] (4): 1987\u201388, 1988\u201389, 1989\u201390, 1990\u201391\n*[[Asian Cup Winners' Cup]] (1): [[1990\u201391 Asian Cup Winners' Cup|1990\u201391]]\n\n===National===\n;Iran\n*[[Football at the Asian Games|Asian Games Gold Medal]] (1): [[Football at the 1990 Asian Games|1990]]\n\n==Coaching career==\nHe began his coaching career in ''Fath F.C.'', soon moving to ''Payanehaye [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]]''. He also had a brief coaching stint in [[Mashhad]], coaching ''Partsazan''. He then was asked to coach the Iranian national [[futsal]] team. He was very successful there, winning numerous Asian Championships and helping the team qualify to the World Cup of Futsal. He left the team after three years, and became head coach of [[Persepolis FSC|Persepolis' futsal club]].

It aims not at the reduction of everything to particle physics, but rather mutual support among [[multiversal]], computational, epistemological, and evolutionary principles. His theory of everything is somewhat [[emergence|emergentist]] rather than [[reductionism|reductive]]. There are four strands to his theory:\n\n# [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]], \"the first and most important of the four strands.\"\n# [[Karl Popper]]'s [[epistemology]], especially its anti-inductivism and requiring a [[scientific realism|realist]] (non-instrumental) interpretation of scientific theories, as well as its emphasis on taking seriously those bold conjectures that resist falsification.\n# [[Alan Turing]]'s theory of computation, especially as developed in Deutsch's [[Turing principle]], in which the [[Universal Turing machine]] is replaced by Deutsch's [[universal quantum computer]]. (\"''The'' theory of computation is now the quantum theory of computation.\")\n# [[Richard Dawkins]]' refinement of [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolutionary theory and the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]], especially the ideas of replicator and meme as they integrate with Popperian problem-solving (the [[epistemological]] strand).\n\n===''The Beginning of Infinity''===\n{{Main article|The Beginning of Infinity }}\n\nDeutsch's second book, ''The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World'', was published on 31 March 2011. In this book, Deutsch views the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the 18th century as near the beginning of a potentially  unending sequence of purposeful knowledge creation.

It aims not at the reduction of everything to particle physics, but rather mutual support among [[multiversal]], computational, epistemological, and evolutionary principles. His theory of everything is somewhat [[emergence|emergentist]] rather than [[reductionism|reductive]]. There are four strands to his theory:\n\n# [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]], \"the first and most important of the four strands.\"\n# [[Karl Popper]]'s [[epistemology]], especially its anti-inductivism and requiring a [[scientific realism|realist]] (non-instrumental) interpretation of scientific theories, as well as its emphasis on taking seriously those bold conjectures that resist falsification.\n# [[Alan Turing]]'s theory of computation, especially as developed in Deutsch's [[Turing principle]], in which the [[Universal Turing machine]] is replaced by Deutsch's [[universal quantum computer]]. (\"''The'' theory of computation is now the quantum theory of computation.\")\n# [[Richard Dawkins]]' refinement of [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] evolutionary theory and the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]], especially the ideas of replicator and meme as they integrate with Popperian problem-solving (the [[epistemological]] strand).\n\n===''The Beginning of Infinity''===\n{{Main article|The Beginning of Infinity }}\n\nDeutsch's second book, ''The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform the World'', was published on 31 March 2011. In this book, Deutsch views the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the 18th century as near the beginning of a potentially  unending sequence of purposeful knowledge creation. He examines the nature of [[meme]]s and how and why [[creativity]] evolved in humans.<ref>{{TED speaker}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and honours===\n''The Fabric of Reality'' was shortlisted for the [[Royal Society Prizes for Science Books|Rhone-Poulenc science book award]] in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/books/the-fabric-of-reality/|title=The Fabric of Reality|last=Deutsch|first=David|website=daviddeutsch.org.uk|access-date=7 December 2016}}</ref> \nDeutsch was awarded the [[Dirac Prize]] of the [[Institute of Physics]] in 1998,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.daviddeutsch.org.uk/about-me/|title=About Me|last=Deutsch|year=2016|first=David|website=daviddeutsch.org.uk|access-date=7 December 2016}}</ref> and the Edge of Computation Science Prize in 2005.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>[http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/al/prizes.htm Edge of Computation Science Prize] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209230404/http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/al/prizes.htm |date=9 December 2006 }}</ref> In 2017, he received the [[Dirac_Medal#Dirac_Medal_of_the_ICTP|Dirac Medal]] of the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ictp.it/about-ictp/prizes-awards/the-dirac-medal/the-medallists/dirac-medallists-2017.aspx|title=Dirac Medal of ICTP 2017|website=www.ictp.it}}</ref> Deutsch is related to [[Paul Dirac]] through his doctoral advisor Dennis Sciama, whose doctoral advisor was Dirac.
