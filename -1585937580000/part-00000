The Lions had a promising start to the season with a 2\u20130\u20131 record. However, they lost 12 of their last 13 games and were mathematically eliminated from postseason contention following a [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] loss to the [[2019 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in week 13. The Lions failed to improve on their 6\u201310 record from last season, finishing the season with a 3\u201312\u20131 record and nine consecutive losses. This resulted in the 3rd pick of the 2020 NFL Draft. They also posted consecutive losing seasons for the first time since [[2012 Detroit Lions season|2012]]\u2013[[2013 Detroit Lions season|2013]]. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Offseason==\n===Coaching

The first of the kind, the [[Royal Navy]]'s {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2}}, had such an impact when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built after her were referred to as \"dreadnoughts,\" and earlier battleships became known as [[pre-dreadnought]]s. Her design had two revolutionary features: an \"all-big-gun\" armament scheme, with an unprecedented number of heavy-calibre guns, and [[steam turbine]] propulsion.{{efn|name=biggun}} As dreadnoughts became a crucial symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships renewed the [[Causes of World War I#Arms race|naval arms race]] between the [[Anglo&ndash;German naval arms race|United Kingdom and Germany]]. Dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including [[South American dreadnought race|in South America]], lasting up to the beginning of World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armor, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships outclassed ''Dreadnought'' herself. These more powerful vessels were known as \"[[#Super-dreadnoughts|super-dreadnoughts]]\". Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued serving throughout World War II.\n\nWhile dreadnought-building consumed vast resources in the early 20th century, there was only one battle between large dreadnought fleets. At the [[Battle of Jutland]], the British and German navies clashed with no decisive result. The term \"dreadnought\" gradually dropped from use after World War I, especially after the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], as virtually all remaining battleships shared dreadnought characteristics; it can also be used to describe [[battlecruiser]]s, the other type of ship resulting from the dreadnought revolution.{{sfn|Mackay|1973|p=326, for instance}}\n\n==Origins==\nThe distinctive all-big-gun armament of the dreadnought was developed in the first years of the 20th century as navies sought to increase the range and power of the armament of their battleships. The typical battleship of the 1890s, now known as the \"[[pre-dreadnought]]\", had a main armament of four heavy guns of 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) [[calibre]], a secondary armament of six to eighteen [[quick-firing gun]]s of between {{convert|4.7|in|mm|sigfig=3}} and {{convert|7.5|in|mm|sigfig=3}} calibre, and other smaller weapons. This was in keeping with the prevailing theory of naval combat that battles would initially be fought at some distance, but the ships would then approach to close range for the final blows, when the shorter-range, faster-firing guns would prove most useful. Some designs had an intermediate battery of 8-inch guns. Serious proposals for an all-big-gun armament were circulated in several countries by 1903.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=52}}\n\nAll-big-gun designs commenced almost simultaneously in three navies. In 1904, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] authorized construction of {{ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}}, originally designed with twelve {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns. Work began on her construction in May 1905.{{sfn|Jentschura|Jung|Mickel|1977|pp=22\u201323}}{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=159}} The [[Royal Navy]] began the design of HMS ''Dreadnought'' in January 1905, and she was [[laid down]] in October of the same year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=15}} Finally, the US Navy gained authorization for {{USS|Michigan|BB-27|6}}, carrying eight 12-inch guns, in March 1905,{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=15}} with construction commencing in December 1906.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=419}}\n\nThe move to all-big-gun designs was accomplished because a uniform, heavy-calibre armament offered advantages in both firepower and fire control, and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905 showed that naval battles could, and likely would, be fought at long distances. The newest 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns had longer range and fired heavier shells than a gun of {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} or {{convert|9.2|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} calibre.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=98}} Another possible advantage was fire control; at long ranges guns were aimed by observing the splashes caused by shells fired in salvoes, and it was difficult to interpret different splashes caused by different calibres of gun. There is still debate as to whether this feature was important.{{sfn|Fairbanks|1991}}\n\n===Long-range gunnery===\nIn naval battles of the 1890s the decisive weapon was the medium-calibre, typically {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}, quick-firing gun firing at relatively short range; at [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)|the Battle of the Yalu River]] in 1894, the victorious Japanese did not commence firing until the range had closed to {{convert|3900|m|yd}} and most of the fighting occurred at {{convert|2000|m|yd}}.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=170\u2013171}} At these ranges, lighter guns had good accuracy, and their high rate of fire delivered high volumes of [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] on the target, known as the \"hail of fire\". Naval gunnery was too inaccurate to hit targets at a longer range.{{efn|name=trajectory}}\n\nBy the early 20th century, British and American admirals expected future battleships would engage at longer distances. Newer models of [[torpedo]] had longer ranges.{{sfn|Lambert|1999|p=77}} For instance, in 1903, the US Navy ordered a design of torpedo effective to {{convert|4000|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=53}} Both British and American admirals concluded that they needed to engage the enemy at longer ranges.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=53}}{{sfn|Lambert|1999|p=78}} In 1900, Admiral Fisher, commanding the Royal Navy Mediterranean Fleet, ordered gunnery practice with 6-inch guns at {{convert|6000|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Lambert|1999|p=78}} By 1904 the US [[Naval War College]] was considering the effects on battleship tactics of torpedoes with a range of {{convert|7000|yd|m}} to {{convert|8000|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=53}}\n\nThe range of light and medium-calibre guns was limited, and accuracy declined badly at longer range.{{efn|name=velocity}} At longer ranges the advantage of a high rate of fire decreased; accurate shooting depended on spotting the shell-splashes of the previous salvo, which limited the optimum rate of fire.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=52}}\n\nOn 10 August 1904 the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and the Imperial Japanese Navy had one of the longest-range gunnery duels to date\u2014over {{cvt|13|km}}\u2014during the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]].{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|pp=50, 72}} The Russian battleships were equipped with Liuzhol [[range finder]]s with an effective range of {{cvt|4|km|yd}} and the Japanese ships had [[Barr & Stroud]] range finders that reached out to {{cvt|6|km|yd}}, but both sides still managed to hit each other with 12-inch fire at {{cvt|13|km|yd}}.{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|pp=50, 56\u201357, 72}} Naval architects and strategists around the world took notice.\n\n===All-big-gun mixed-calibre ships===<!--[[Semi-dreadnought]] redirects here, please retarget redirect if this section is renamed-->\n[[File:HMS Agamemnon (1908) profile drawing.png|thumb|{{HMS|Agamemnon|1906|6}}, an all-big-gun mixed-calibre ship of the {{sclass-|Lord Nelson|battleship|4}}. It carried four {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} and ten {{convert|9.2|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}.]]\n\nAn evolutionary step was to reduce the quick-firing secondary battery and substitute additional heavy guns, typically 9.2-inch or 10-inch. Ships designed in this way have been described as 'all-big-gun mixed-calibre' or later 'semi-dreadnoughts'. Semi-dreadnought ships had many heavy secondary guns in wing turrets near the center of the ship, instead of the small guns mounted in barbettes of earlier pre-dreadnought ships.\n\nSemi-dreadnoughts classes included the British {{sclass-|King Edward VII|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Lord Nelson|battleship|5}}; Russian {{sclass-|Andrei Pervozvanny|battleship|5}}; Japanese {{sclass-|Katori|battleship|5}}, {{sclass-|Satsuma|battleship|5}}, and {{sclass-|Kawachi|battleship|5}};{{sfn|Gardiner|Lambert|2001|pp=125\u2013126}} American {{sclass-|Connecticut|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Mississippi|battleship|5}}; French {{sclass-|Danton|battleship|5}}; Italian {{sclass-|Regina Elena|battleship|5}}; and Austro-Hungarian {{sclass-|Radetzky|battleship|4}}.\n\nThe design process for these ships often included discussion of an 'all-big-gun one-calibre' alternative.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=113, 331\u2013332, 418}}{{efn|name=Mississippi}} The June 1902 issue of ''Proceedings of the US Naval Institute'' contained comments by the US Navy's leading gunnery expert, P.R Alger, proposing a main battery of eight 12-inch guns in twin turrets.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=51}} In May 1902, the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] submitted a design for the battleship with twelve 10-inch guns in twin turrets, two at the ends and four in the wings.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=51}} Lt. Cdr. H. C. Poundstone submitted a paper to [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] in December 1902 arguing the case for larger battleships. In an appendix to his paper, Poundstone suggested a greater number of {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} and {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns was preferable to a smaller number of 12-inch and 9-inch.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=52}} The Naval War College and Bureau of Construction and Repair developed these ideas in studies between 1903 and 1905. War-game studies begun in July 1903 \"showed that a battleship armed with twelve 11-inch or 12-inch guns hexagonally arranged would be equal to three or more of the conventional type.\"{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=53\u201358}}\n\nThe Royal Navy was thinking along similar lines. A design had been circulated in 1902\u20131903 for \"a powerful 'all big-gun' armament of two calibres, viz. four 12-inch and twelve 9.2-inch guns.\"{{sfn|Parkes|1990|p=426, quoting an INA paper of 9 April 1919 by [[Philip Watts (naval architect)|Sir Philip Watts]]}} The Admiralty decided to build three more ''King Edward VII''s (with a mixture of 12-inch, 9.2-inch and 6-inch) in the 1903\u20131904 naval construction programme instead.{{sfn|Parkes|1990|p=426}} The all-big-gun concept was revived for the 1904\u20131905 programme, the ''Lord Nelson'' class. Restrictions on length and [[beam (nautical)|beam]] meant the midships 9.2-inch turrets became single instead of twin, thus giving an armament of four 12-inch, ten 9.2-inch and no 6-inch. The constructor for this design, J.H. Narbeth, submitted an alternative drawing showing an armament of twelve 12-inch guns, but the Admiralty was not prepared to accept this.{{sfn|Parkes|1990|pp=451\u2013452}} Part of the rationale for the decision to retain mixed-calibre guns was the need to begin the building of the ships quickly because of the tense situation produced by the Russo-Japanese War.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=113}}\n\n===Switch to all-big-gun designs===\nThe replacement of the 6-inch or {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns with weapons of 9.2-inch or 10-inch calibre improved the striking power of a battleship, particularly at longer ranges. Uniform heavy-gun armament offered many other advantages. One advantage was logistical simplicity. When the US was considering whether to have a mixed-calibre main armament for the {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|4}}, for example, [[William Sims]] and Homer Poundstone stressed the advantages of homogeneity in terms of ammunition supply and the transfer of crews from the disengaged guns to replace gunners wounded in action.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=55}}\n\nA uniform calibre of gun also helped streamline fire control. The designers of ''Dreadnought'' preferred an all-big-gun design because it would mean only one set of calculations about adjustments to the range of the guns.{{efn|name=uniform armament}} Some historians today hold that a uniform calibre was particularly important because the risk of confusion between shell-splashes of 12-inch and lighter guns made accurate ranging difficult. This viewpoint is controversial, as fire control in 1905 was not advanced enough to use the salvo-firing technique where this confusion might be important,{{sfn|Fairbanks|1991|p=250}} and confusion of shell-splashes does not seem to have been a concern of those working on all-big-gun designs.{{efn|name=salvoes}} Nevertheless, the likelihood of engagements at longer ranges was important in deciding that the heaviest possible guns should become standard, hence 12-inch rather than 10-inch.{{efn|name=accuracy}}\n\nThe newer designs of 12-inch gun mounting had a considerably higher rate of fire, removing the advantage previously enjoyed by smaller calibres. In 1895, a 12-inch gun might have fired one round every four minutes; by 1902, two rounds per minute was usual.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=98}} In October 1903, the Italian [[naval architect]] [[Vittorio Cuniberti]] published a paper in ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]'' entitled \"An Ideal Battleship for the British Navy\", which called for a 17,000 ton ship carrying a main armament of twelve 12-inch guns, protected by armour 12&nbsp;inches thick, and having a speed of 24 knots (28&nbsp;mph/44&nbsp;km/h).{{sfn|Cuniberti|1903|pp=407\u2013409}} Cuniberti's idea\u2014which he had already proposed to his own navy, the ''[[Regia Marina]]''\u2014was to make use of the high rate of fire of new 12-inch guns to produce devastating rapid-fire from heavy guns to replace the 'hail of fire' from lighter weapons.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=98}} Something similar lay behind the Japanese move towards heavier guns; at [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]], Japanese shells contained a higher than normal proportion of high explosive, and were fused to explode on contact, starting fires rather than piercing armour.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=63}} The increased rate of fire laid the foundations for future advances in fire control.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=98}}\n\n===Building the first dreadnoughts===\n[[File:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|A plan of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, showing the revolutionary design]]\nIn Japan, the two battleships of the 1903\u20131904 programme were the first in the world to be laid down as all-big-gun ships, with eight 12-inch guns. The armour of their design was considered too thin, demanding a substantial redesign.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=331}} The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns\u2014which had to be imported from the United Kingdom\u2014meant these ships were completed with a mixture of 12-inch and 10-inch armament. The 1903\u20131904 design retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines, unlike ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=159}}\n\nThe dreadnought breakthrough occurred in the United Kingdom in October 1905. Fisher, now the [[First Sea Lord]], had long been an advocate of new technology in the Royal Navy and had recently been convinced of the idea of an all-big-gun battleship.{{efn|name=Fisher}} Fisher is often credited as the creator of the dreadnought and the father of the United Kingdom's great dreadnought battleship fleet, an impression he himself did much to reinforce. It has been suggested Fisher's main focus was on the arguably even more revolutionary [[battlecruiser]] and not the battleship.{{sfn|Sumida|1995|pp=619\u2013621}}\n\nShortly after taking office, Fisher set up a Committee on Designs to consider future battleships and armoured cruisers.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=15}} The Committee's first task was to consider a new battleship. The specification for the new ship was a 12-inch main battery and anti-torpedo-boat guns but no intermediate calibres, and a speed of {{convert|21|knot|km/h|abbr=on}} which was two or three knots faster than existing battleships.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=115}} The initial designs intended twelve 12-inch guns, though difficulties in positioning these guns led the chief constructor at one stage to propose a return to four 12-inch guns with sixteen or eighteen of 9.2-inch. After a full evaluation of reports of the action at Tsushima compiled by an official observer, [[William Christopher Pakenham|Captain Pakenham]], the Committee settled on a main battery of ten 12-inch guns, along with twenty-two [[QF 12 pounder 18 cwt naval gun|12 pounders]] as secondary armament.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=115}} The Committee also gave ''Dreadnought'' [[steam turbine]] propulsion, which was unprecedented in a large warship. The greater power and lighter weight of turbines meant the 21-knot (24&nbsp;mph/39&nbsp;km/h) design speed could be achieved in a smaller and less costly ship than if [[reciprocating engine]]s had been used.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=46, 115}} Construction took place quickly; the keel was laid on 2 October 1905, the ship was launched on 10 February 1906, and completed on 3 October 1906\u2014an impressive demonstration of British industrial might.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=15}}\n\nThe first US dreadnoughts were the two ''South Carolina''-class ships. Detailed plans for these were worked out in July\u2013November 1905, and approved by the Board of Construction on 23 November 1905.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=62}} Building was slow; specifications for bidders were issued on 21 March 1906, the contracts awarded on 21 July 1906{{sfn|Marder|1964|p=542}} and the two ships were laid down in December 1906, after the completion of the ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=63}}\n\n==Design==\nThe designers of dreadnoughts sought to provide as much protection, speed, and firepower as possible in a ship of a realistic size and cost. The hallmark of dreadnought battleships was an \"all-big-gun\" armament, but they also had heavy armour concentrated mainly in a thick belt at the waterline and in one or more armoured decks. Secondary armament, fire control, command equipment, and protection against torpedoes also had to be crammed into the hull.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nThe inevitable consequence of demands for ever greater speed, striking power, and endurance meant that [[displacement (ship)|displacement]], and hence cost, of dreadnoughts tended to increase. The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 imposed a limit of 35,000 tons on the displacement of capital ships. In subsequent years [[treaty battleship]]s were commissioned to build up to this limit. Japan's decision to leave the Treaty in the 1930s, and the arrival of the Second World War, eventually made this limit irrelevant.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=85}}\n[[File:Battleship building scatter graph 1905 onwards.png|thumb|center|700px|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Growth in size of battleship designs from 1905 onwards, showing the dreadnought's rapid growth between 1905 and 1920, prior to the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922</div>]]\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:HMS Bellerophon Plan.jpg|thumb|A plan of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1907|3}} showing the armament distribution of early British dreadnoughts. The [[main battery]] is in twin turrets, with two on the \"wings\"; the light secondary battery is clustered around the superstructure.]]\n\nDreadnoughts mounted a uniform [[main battery]] of heavy-calibre guns; the number, size, and arrangement differed between designs. ''Dreadnought'' mounted ten 12-inch guns. 12-inch guns had been standard for most navies in the [[pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought era]] and this continued in the first generation of dreadnought battleships. The [[Imperial German Navy]] was an exception, continuing to use 11-inch guns in its first class of dreadnoughts, the {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|4}}.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=54, 266}}\n\nDreadnoughts also carried lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a secondary armament of very light guns designed to fend off enemy [[motor torpedo boat|torpedo boats]]. The calibre and weight of secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the torpedo boats and [[destroyer]]s expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=141\u2013151}}\n\nDreadnoughts frequently carried [[torpedo tube]]s themselves. In theory, a line of battleships so equipped could unleash a devastating volley of torpedoes on an enemy line steaming a parallel course. In practice, torpedoes fired from battleships scored very few hits, and there was a risk that a stored torpedo would cause a dangerous explosion if hit by enemy fire.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=151\u2013153}} And in fact, the only documented instance of one battleship successfully torpedoing another came during the [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|Action of 27 May 1941]], where the British battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|6}} claimed to have torpedoed the crippled {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} at close range.{{sfn|Kennedy|1991|p=246}}\n\n====Position of main armament====\nThe effectiveness of the guns depended in part on the layout of the turrets. ''Dreadnought'', and the British ships which immediately followed it, carried five turrets: one forward, one aft and one amidships on the centreline of the ship, and two in the 'wings' next to the [[superstructure]]. This allowed three turrets to fire ahead and four on the broadside. The ''Nassau'' and {{sclass-|Helgoland|battleship|5}} classes of German dreadnoughts adopted a 'hexagonal' layout, with one turret each fore and aft and four wing turrets; this meant more guns were mounted in total, but the same number could fire ahead or broadside as with ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=263}}\n\nDreadnought designs experimented with different layouts. The British [[HMS Neptune (1909)|''Neptune''-class battleship]] staggered the wing turrets, so all ten guns could fire on the broadside, a feature also used by the German {{sclass-|Kaiser|battleship|4}}. This risked blast damage to parts of the ship over which the guns fired, and put great stress on the ship's frames.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=134}}\n\nIf all turrets were on the centreline of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames were relatively low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=132}} For these reasons, {{HMS|Agincourt|1913|6}}, which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=138}}\n\nA [[superfire|superfiring]] layout was eventually adopted as standard. This involved raising one or two turrets so they could fire over a turret immediately forward or astern of them. The US Navy adopted this feature with their first dreadnoughts in 1906, but others were slower to do so. As with other layouts there were drawbacks. Initially, there were concerns about the impact of the blast of the raised guns on the lower turret. Raised turrets raised the centre of gravity of the ship, and might reduce the stability of the ship. Nevertheless, this layout made the best of the firepower available from a fixed number of guns, and was eventually adopted generally.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=134}} The US Navy used superfiring on the ''South Carolina'' class, and the layout was adopted in the Royal Navy with the {{sclass-|Orion|battleship|4}} of 1910. By World War II, superfiring was entirely standard.\n\nInitially, all dreadnoughts had two guns to a turret. One solution to the problem of turret layout was to put three or even four guns in each turret. Fewer turrets meant the ship could be shorter, or could devote more space to machinery. On the other hand, it meant that in the event of an enemy shell destroying one turret, a higher proportion of the main armament would be out of action. The risk of the blast waves from each gun barrel interfering with others in the same turret reduced the rate of fire from the guns somewhat. The first nation to adopt the triple turret was Italy, in the {{ship|Italian battleship|Dante Alighieri||2}}, soon followed by Russia with the {{sclass-|Gangut|battleship|4}},{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=393\u2013396}} the Austro-Hungarian {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|4}}, and the US {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|4}}. British Royal Navy battleships did not adopt triple turrets until after the First World War, with the {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship|4}}. Several later designs used quadruple turrets, including the British {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|4}} and French {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|4}}.\n\n====Main armament power and calibre====\nRather than try to fit more guns onto a ship, it was possible to increase the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase [[muzzle velocity]]. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=130\u2013131}}\n\n[[File:Animated gun turret.gif|thumb|Animated diagram of gun turret loading and firing, based on the [[BL 15 inch /42 naval gun|British 15-inch gun]] used on super-dreadnoughts]]\n\nBoth methods offered advantages and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 because of the wear on the barrels.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=129}} The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells have the advantage of being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=130}}\n\nDifferent navies approached the issue of calibre in different ways. The German navy, for instance, generally used a lighter calibre than the equivalent British ships, e.g. 12-inch calibre when the British standard was {{convert|13.5|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}. Because German metallurgy was superior, the German 12-inch gun had better shell weight and muzzle velocity than the British 12-inch; and German ships could afford more armour for the same vessel weight because the German 12\" guns were lighter than the 13.5\" guns the British required for comparable effect.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=130}}\n\nOver time the calibre of guns tended to increase. In the Royal Navy, the ''Orion'' class, launched 1910, had ten 13.5-inch guns, all on the centreline; the ''Queen Elizabeth'' class, launched 1913, had eight {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns. In all navies, fewer guns of larger calibre came to be used. The smaller number of guns simplified their distribution, and centreline turrets became the norm.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=135}}\n\nA further step change was planned for battleships designed and laid down at the end of World War I. The Japanese {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|2}}s in 1917 carried {{convert|410|mm|in|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns, which was quickly matched by the US Navy's {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|4}}. Both the United Kingdom and Japan were planning battleships with {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} armament, in the British case the {{sclass2-|N3|battleship|4}}. The Washington Naval Treaty concluded on 6 February 1922 and ratified later limited battleship guns to not more than {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} calibre,{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=72}} and these heavier guns were not produced.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=71}}\n\n[[File:British 14in Naval Gun 1930s Model.png|thumb|left|A 14-inch naval gun, as fitted to the ''King George V''-class [[treaty battleship]]s]]\nThe only battleships to break the limit were the Japanese {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|4}}, begun in 1937 (after the treaty expired), which carried 460&nbsp;mm (18.1&nbsp;in) main guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=84}} By the middle of World War II, the United Kingdom was making use of 15-inch guns kept as spares for the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|4}} to arm the last British battleship, {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}}.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=82}}\n\nSome World War II-era designs were drawn up proposing another move towards gigantic armament. The German [[H-class battleship proposals|H-43 and H-44 designs]] proposed {{convert|508|mm|in|adj=on|sigfig=2}} guns, and there is evidence Hitler wanted calibres as high as {{convert|609|mm|in|adj=on|sigfig=2}};{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=214}} the Japanese '[[Design A-150 battleship|Super ''Yamato'']]' design also called for 508&nbsp;mm guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=367}} None of these proposals went further than very preliminary design work.\n\n====Secondary armament====\nThe first dreadnoughts tended to have a very light secondary armament intended to protect them from [[torpedo boat]]s. ''Dreadnought'' carried 12-pounder guns; each of her twenty-two 12-pounders could fire at least 15 rounds a minute at any torpedo boat making an attack.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=107, 115}} The ''South Carolina''s and other early American dreadnoughts were similarly equipped.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=196}} At this stage, torpedo boats were expected to attack separately from any fleet actions. Therefore, there was no need to armour the secondary gun armament, or to protect the crews from the blast effects of the main guns. In this context, the light guns tended to be mounted in unarmoured positions high on the ship to minimize weight and maximize field of fire.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n[[File:QF12pdr18cwtGunsXTurretHMSDreadnought.jpg|thumb|[[QF 12 pounder 18 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] anti-torpedo boat guns mounted on the roof of a turret on {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|3}}]]\n\nWithin a few years, the principal threat was from the destroyer\u2014larger, more heavily armed, and harder to destroy than the torpedo boat. Since the risk from destroyers was very serious, it was considered that one shell from a battleship's secondary armament should sink (rather than merely damage) any attacking destroyer. Destroyers, in contrast to torpedo boats, were expected to attack as part of a general fleet engagement, so it was necessary for the secondary armament to be protected against shell splinters from heavy guns, and the blast of the main armament. This philosophy of secondary armament was adopted by the German navy from the start; ''Nassau'', for instance, carried twelve 150-mm (5.9&nbsp;in) and sixteen 88-mm (3.45&nbsp;in) guns, and subsequent German dreadnought classes followed this lead.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=263}} These heavier guns tended to be mounted in armoured [[barbette]]s or [[Casemate#Single casemates (1889 onwards)|casemates]] on the main deck. The Royal Navy increased its secondary armament from 12-pounder to first {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} and then 6-inch guns, which were standard at the start of World War I;{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=106\u2013107}} the US standardized on {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} calibre for the war but planned 6-inch guns for the ships designed just afterwards.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=159}}\n\nThe secondary battery served several other roles. It was hoped that a medium-calibre shell might be able to score a hit on an enemy dreadnought's sensitive fire control systems. It was also felt that the secondary armament could play an important role in driving off enemy cruisers from attacking a crippled battleship.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=113\u2013116}}\n\nThe secondary armament of dreadnoughts was, on the whole, unsatisfactory. A hit from a light gun could not be relied on to stop a destroyer. Heavier guns could not be relied on to hit a destroyer, as experience at the Battle of Jutland showed. The casemate mountings of heavier guns proved problematic; being low in the hull, they proved liable to flooding, and on several classes, some were removed and plated over. The only sure way to protect a dreadnought from destroyer or torpedo boat attack was to provide a destroyer squadron as an escort. After World War I the secondary armament tended to be mounted in turrets on the upper deck and around the superstructure. This allowed a wide field of fire and good protection without the negative points of casemates. Increasingly through the 1920s and 1930s, the secondary guns were seen as a major part of the anti-aircraft battery, with high-angle, [[dual-purpose gun]]s increasingly adopted.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=116\u2013122}}\n\n===Armour===\n[[File:SMS-Bayern-protection-scheme-EN.svg|thumb|This section of {{SMS|Bayern}} shows a typical dreadnought protection scheme, with very thick armour protecting the turrets, magazines and engine spaces tapering away in less vital areas]]\n\nMuch of the displacement of a dreadnought was taken up by the steel plating of the armour. Designers spent much time and effort to provide the best possible protection for their ships against the various weapons with which they would be faced. Only so much weight could be devoted to protection, without compromising speed, firepower or seakeeping.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=7\u20138}}\n\n====Central citadel====\nThe bulk of a dreadnought's armour was concentrated around the \"armoured citadel\". This was a box, with four armoured walls and an armoured roof, around the most important parts of the ship. The sides of the citadel were the \"armoured belt\" of the ship, which started on the hull just in front of the forward turret and ran to just behind the aft turret. The ends of the citadel were two armoured bulkheads, fore and aft, which stretched between the ends of the armour belt. The \"roof\" of the citadel was an armoured deck. Within the citadel were the boilers, engines, and the magazines for the main armament. A hit to any of these systems could cripple or destroy the ship. The \"floor\" of the box was the bottom of the ship's hull, and was unarmoured, although it was, in fact, a \"triple bottom\".{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=54\u201361}}\n\nThe earliest dreadnoughts were intended to take part in a pitched battle against other battleships at ranges of up to {{convert|10000|yard|m|abbr=on}}. In such an encounter, shells would fly on a relatively flat trajectory, and a shell would have to hit at or just about the waterline to damage the vitals of the ship. For this reason, the early dreadnoughts' armour was concentrated in a thick belt around the waterline; this was {{convert|11|in|mm}} thick in ''Dreadnought''. Behind this belt were arranged the ship's coal bunkers, to further protect the engineering spaces.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=9}} In an engagement of this sort, there was also a lesser threat of indirect damage to the vital parts of the ship. A shell which struck above the belt armour and exploded could send fragments flying in all directions. These fragments were dangerous but could be stopped by much thinner armour than what would be necessary to stop an unexploded armour-piercing shell. To protect the innards of the ship from fragments of shells which detonated on the superstructure, much thinner steel armour was applied to the decks of the ship.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=9}}\n\nThe thickest protection was reserved for the central citadel in all battleships. Some navies extended a thinner armoured belt and armoured deck to cover the ends of the ship, or extended a thinner armoured belt up the outside of the hull. This \"tapered\" armour was used by the major European navies\u2014the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. This arrangement gave some armour to a larger part of the ship; for the very first dreadnoughts, when high-explosive shellfire was still considered a significant threat, this was useful. It tended to result in the main belt being very short, only protecting a thin strip above the waterline; some navies found that when their dreadnoughts were heavily laden, the armoured belt was entirely submerged.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=65\u201366}} The alternative was an [[All or nothing (armor)|\"all or nothing\" protection scheme]], developed by the US Navy. The armour belt was tall and thick, but no side protection at all was provided to the ends of the ship or the upper decks. The armoured deck was also thickened. The \"all-or-nothing\" system provided more effective protection against the very-long-range engagements of dreadnought fleets and was adopted outside the US Navy after World War I.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=67}}\n\nThe design of the dreadnought changed to meet new challenges. For example, armour schemes were changed to reflect the greater risk of plunging shells from long-range gunfire, and the increasing threat from armour-piercing bombs dropped by aircraft. Later designs carried a greater thickness of steel on the armoured deck;{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=66\u201367}} [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] carried a {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} main belt, but a deck {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on}} thick.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=360}}\n\n====Underwater protection and subdivision====\nThe final element of the protection scheme of the first dreadnoughts was the subdivision of the ship below the waterline into several watertight compartments. If the hull were holed\u2014by shellfire, [[naval mine|mine]], torpedo, or collision\u2014then, in theory, only one area would flood and the ship could survive. To make this precaution even more effective, many dreadnoughts had no doors between different underwater sections, so that even a surprise hole below the waterline need not sink the ship. There were still several instances where flooding spread between underwater compartments.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=77\u201379}}\n\nThe greatest evolution in dreadnought protection came with the development of the [[anti-torpedo bulge]] and [[torpedo belt]], both attempts to protect against underwater damage by mines and torpedoes. The purpose of underwater protection was to absorb the force of a detonating mine or torpedo well away from the final watertight hull. This meant an inner bulkhead along the side of the hull, which was generally lightly armoured to capture splinters, separated from the outer hull by one or more compartments. The compartments in between were either left empty, or filled with coal, water or fuel oil.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=79\u201383}}\n\n===Propulsion===\n[[File:Battleship Paris.png|thumb|{{ship|French battleship|Paris||2}} on speed trials]]\nDreadnoughts were propelled by two to four [[screw propeller]]s.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=95}} ''Dreadnought'' herself, and all British dreadnoughts, had screw shafts driven by steam turbines. The first generation of dreadnoughts built in other nations used the slower [[triple-expansion steam engine]] which had been standard in pre-dreadnoughts.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nTurbines offered more [[power (physics)|power]] than reciprocating engines for the same volume of machinery.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=91}}{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=46}} This, along with a guarantee on the new machinery from the inventor, [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]], persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=46}} It is often said that turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and more reliable than reciprocating engines.{{sfn|Massie|2004|p=474}} By 1905, new designs of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and more reliable than previous models.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=91}}\n\nTurbines also had disadvantages. At cruising speeds much slower than maximum speed, turbines were markedly less [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficient]] than reciprocating engines. This was particularly important for navies which required a long range at cruising speeds\u2014and hence for the US Navy, which was planning in the event of war to cruise across the Pacific and engage the Japanese in the Philippines.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nThe US Navy experimented with turbine engines from 1908 in the {{USS|North Dakota|BB-29|2}}, but was not fully committed to turbines until the ''Pennsylvania'' class in 1916. In the preceding ''Nevada'' class, one ship, the ''Oklahoma'', received reciprocating engines, while the ''Nevada'' received geared turbines. The two ''New York''-class ships of 1914 both received reciprocating engines, but all four ships of the ''Florida'' (1911) and ''Wyoming'' (1912) classes received turbines.\n\nThe disadvantages of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the [[geared turbine]], where gearing reduced the rotation rate of the propellers and hence increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the gears and hence was difficult to implement.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nOne alternative was the [[turbo-electric]] drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which used it for all dreadnoughts from late 1915\u20131922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.{{efn|name=power loss}}\n\nTurbines were never replaced in battleship design. [[Diesel engine]]s were eventually considered by some powers, as they offered very good endurance and an engineering space taking up less of the length of the ship. They were also heavier, however, took up a greater vertical space, offered less power, and were considered unreliable.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=292, 295}}{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=213}}\n\n====Fuel====\nThe first generation of dreadnoughts used coal to fire the boilers which fed steam to the turbines. Coal had been in use since the very first steam warships. One advantage of coal was that it is quite inert (in lump form) and thus could be used as part of the ship's protection scheme.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=93}} Coal also had many disadvantages. It was labor-intensive to pack coal into the ship's bunkers and then feed it into the boilers. The boilers became clogged with ash. Airborne coal dust and related vapors were highly explosive, possibly evidenced by the explosion of {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}}. Burning coal as fuel also produced thick black smoke which gave away the position of a fleet and interfered with visibility, signaling, and fire control. In addition, coal was very bulky and had comparatively low [[thermal efficiency]].\n\n[[Fuel Oil|Oil]]-fired propulsion had many advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of [[stoker (occupation)|stokers]] to do it by hand. Oil has roughly twice the [[thermal energy|thermal content]] of coal. This meant that the boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=93}}\n\nThese benefits meant that, as early as 1901, Fisher was pressing the advantages of oil fuel.{{sfn|Mackay|1973|p=269}} There were technical problems with oil-firing, connected with the different distribution of the weight of oil fuel compared to coal,{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=93}} and the problems of pumping viscous oil.{{sfn|Brown|2003|pp=22\u201323}} The main problem with using oil for the battle fleet was that, with the exception of the United States, every major navy would have to import its oil. As a result, some navies adopted 'dual-firing' boilers which could use coal sprayed with oil; British ships so equipped, which included dreadnoughts, could even use oil alone at up to 60% power.{{sfn|Brown|2003|p=23}}\n\nThe US had large reserves of oil, and the US Navy was the first to wholeheartedly adopt oil-firing, deciding to do so in 1910 and ordering oil-fired boilers for the ''Nevada'' class, in 1911.{{efn|name=engines}} The United Kingdom was not far behind, deciding in 1912 to use oil on its own in the ''Queen Elizabeth'' class;{{sfn|Brown|2003|p=23}} shorter British design and building times meant that ''Queen Elizabeth'' was commissioned before either of the ''Nevada''-class vessels. The United Kingdom planned to revert to mixed firing with the subsequent {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|4}}, at the cost of some speed\u2014but Fisher, who returned to office in 1914, insisted that all the boilers should be oil-fired.{{sfn|Parkes|1990|pp=582\u2013583}} Other major navies retained mixed coal-and-oil firing until the end of World War I.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=94}}\n\n==Dreadnought building==\nDreadnoughts developed as a move in an international battleship arms-race which had begun in the 1890s. The British Royal Navy had a big lead in the number of pre-dreadnought battleships, but a lead of only one dreadnought in 1906.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=198}} This has led to criticism that the British, by launching HMS ''Dreadnought'', threw away a strategic advantage.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|p=218}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=201}} Most of the United Kingdom's naval rivals had already contemplated or even built warships that featured a uniform battery of heavy guns. Both the Japanese Navy and the US Navy ordered \"all-big-gun\" ships in 1904\u20131905, with ''Satsuma'' and ''South Carolina'', respectively. Germany's Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] had advocated a fast warship armed only with heavy guns since the 1890s. By securing a head start in dreadnought construction, the United Kingdom ensured its dominance of the seas continued.{{sfn|Herwig|1980|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nThe battleship race soon accelerated once more, placing a great burden on the finances of the governments which engaged in it. The first dreadnoughts were not much more expensive than the last pre-dreadnoughts, but the cost per ship continued to grow thereafter.{{efn|name=costs}} Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power in spite of their price. Each battleship signalled national power and prestige, in a manner similar to the nuclear weapons of today.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp= 227\u2013228}} Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers -including the Ottoman Empire, Greece, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile - commissioned British, French, German, and American yards to build dreadnoughts for them.{{sfn|Keegan|1999|p=281}}\n\n===Anglo-German arms race===\n{{See also|Anglo-German naval arms race{{!}}World War I naval arms race|Causes of World War I}}\n\n[[File:George V and Admiral Callaghan onboard HMS Iron Duke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] (''left'') inspects {{HMS|Neptune|1909|6}}]]\nThe construction of ''Dreadnought'' coincided with increasing tension between the United Kingdom and Germany. Germany had begun building a large battlefleet in the 1890s, as part of a deliberate policy to challenge British naval supremacy. With the signing of the [[Entente Cordiale]] in April 1904, it became increasingly clear the United Kingdom's principal naval enemy would be Germany, which was building up a large, modern fleet under the [[German Naval Laws|\"Tirpitz\" laws]]. This rivalry gave rise to the two largest dreadnought fleets of the pre-1914 period.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=59}}\n\nThe first German response to ''Dreadnought'' was the ''Nassau'' class, laid down in 1907, followed by the ''Helgoland'' class in 1909. Together with two battlecruisers\u2014a type for which the Germans had less admiration than Fisher, but which could be built under the authorization for armoured cruisers, rather than for capital ships\u2014these classes gave Germany a total of ten modern capital ships built or building in 1909. The British ships were faster and more powerful than their German equivalents, but a 12:10 ratio fell far short of the 2:1 superiority the Royal Navy wanted to maintain.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=203}}\n\nIn 1909, the British Parliament authorized an additional four capital ships, holding out hope Germany would be willing to negotiate a treaty limiting battleship numbers. If no such solution could be found, an additional four ships would be laid down in 1910. Even this compromise meant, when taken together with some social reforms, raising taxes enough to prompt a [[People's Budget|constitutional crisis]] in the United Kingdom in 1909\u20131910. In 1910, the British eight-ship construction plan went ahead, including four ''Orion''-class super-dreadnoughts, augmented by battlecruisers purchased by Australia and New Zealand. In the same period, Germany laid down only three ships, giving the United Kingdom a superiority of 22 ships to 13. The British resolve, as demonstrated by their construction programme, led the Germans to seek a negotiated end to the arms race. The Admiralty's new target of a 60% lead over Germany was near enough to Tirpitz's goal of cutting the British lead to 50%, but talks foundered on the question on whether to include British colonial battlecruisers in the count, as well as on non-naval matters like the German demands for recognition of ownership of [[Alsace-Lorraine]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\nThe dreadnought race stepped up in 1910 and 1911, with Germany laying down four capital ships each year and the United Kingdom five. Tension came to a head following the [[Fleet Acts|German Naval Law of 1912]]. This proposed a fleet of 33 German battleships and battlecruisers, outnumbering the Royal Navy in home waters. To make matters worse for the United Kingdom, the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial Austro-Hungarian Navy]] was building four dreadnoughts, while the Italians had four and were building two more. Against such threats, the Royal Navy could no longer guarantee vital British interests. The United Kingdom was faced with a choice between building more battleships, withdrawing from the Mediterranean, or seeking an alliance with France. Further naval construction was unacceptably expensive at a time when [[social welfare]] provision was making calls on the budget. Withdrawing from the Mediterranean would mean a huge loss of influence, weakening British diplomacy in the region and shaking the stability of the [[British Empire]]. The only acceptable option, and the one recommended by [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]], was to break with the policies of the past and to make an arrangement with France. The French would assume responsibility for checking Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Mediterranean, while the British would protect the north coast of France. In spite of some opposition from British politicians, the Royal Navy organised itself on this basis in 1912.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=224\u2013228}}\n\nIn spite of these important strategic consequences, the 1912 Naval Law had little bearing on the battleship-force ratios. The United Kingdom responded by laying down ten new super-dreadnoughts in its 1912 and 1913 budgets\u2014ships of the ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Revenge'' classes, which introduced a further step-change in armament, speed and protection\u2014while Germany laid down only five, concentrating resources on its army.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n===United States===\n[[File:USS New York-1.jpg|thumb|{{USS|New York|BB-34|6}} making full steam in 1915]]\nThe American ''South Carolina''-class battleships were the first all-big-gun ships completed by one of the United Kingdom's rivals. The planning for the type had begun before ''Dreadnought'' was launched. There is some speculation that informal contacts with sympathetic Royal Navy officials influenced the US Navy design,{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=216}} but the American ship was very different.\n\nThe [[United States Congress|US Congress]] authorized the Navy to build two battleships, but of only 16,000&nbsp;tons or lower displacement. As a result, the ''South Carolina'' class were built to much tighter limits than ''Dreadnought''. To make the best use of the weight available for armament, all eight 12-inch guns were mounted along the centreline, in superfiring pairs fore and aft. This arrangement gave a broadside equal to ''Dreadnought'', but with fewer guns; this was the most efficient distribution of weapons and proved a precursor of the standard practice of future generations of battleships. The principal economy of displacement compared to ''Dreadnought'' was in propulsion; ''South Carolina'' retained triple-expansion steam engines, and could manage only {{convert|18.5|knot|km/h|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|21|knot|km/h|abbr=on}} for ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=115, 196}} For this reason the later {{sclass-|Delaware|battleship|4}} were described by some as the US Navy's first dreadnoughts;{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=69}}{{sfn|''The New York Times'', 26 October 1915}} only a few years after their commissioning, the ''South Carolina'' class could not operate tactically with the newer dreadnoughts due to their low speed, and were forced to operate with the older pre-dreadnoughts.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=57}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=112}}\n\nThe two 10-gun, 20,500&nbsp;ton ships of the ''Delaware'' class were the first US battleships to match the speed of British dreadnoughts, but their secondary battery was \"wet\" (suffering from spray) and their bow was low in the water. An alternative 12-gun 24,000&nbsp;ton design had many disadvantages as well; the extra two guns and a lower casemate had \"hidden costs\"\u2014the two wing turrets planned would weaken the upper deck, be almost impossible to adequately protect against underwater attack, and force magazines to be located too close to the sides of the ship.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=69}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=113}}\n\nThe US Navy continued to expand its battlefleet, laying down two ships in most subsequent years until 1920. The US continued to use reciprocating engines as an alternative to turbines until the ''Nevada'', laid down in 1912. In part, this reflected a cautious approach to battleship-building, and in part a preference for long endurance over high maximum speed owing to the US Navy's need to operate in the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Settsu.jpg|thumb|The Japanese battleship ''Settsu'']]\n\nWith their victory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, the Japanese became concerned about the potential for conflict with the US. The theorist [[Sat\u014d Tetsutar\u014d]] developed the doctrine that Japan should have a battlefleet at least 70% the size of that of the US. This would enable the Japanese navy to win two decisive battles: the first early in a prospective war against the US Pacific Fleet, and the second against the US Atlantic Fleet which would inevitably be dispatched as reinforcements.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\nJapan's first priorities were to refit the pre-dreadnoughts captured from Russia and to complete ''Satsuma'' and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Aki||2}}. The ''Satsuma''s were designed before ''Dreadnought'', but financial shortages resulting from the Russo-Japanese War delayed completion and resulted in their carrying a mixed armament, so they were known as \"semi-dreadnoughts\". These were followed by a modified ''Aki''-type: {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kawachi||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Settsu||2}}. These two ships were laid down in 1909 and completed in 1912. They were armed with twelve 12-inch guns, but they were of two different models with differing barrel-lengths, meaning that they would have had difficulty controlling their fire at long ranges.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=333}}\n\n===In other countries===\n{{see also|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[File:Provence-3.jpg|thumb|{{ship|French battleship|Provence||2}}, a {{sclass-|Bretagne|battleship|2}}]]\n\nCompared to the other major naval powers, France was slow to start building dreadnoughts, instead finishing the planned ''Danton'' class of pre-dreadnoughts, laying down five in 1907 and 1908. In September 1910 the first of the {{sclass-|Courbet|battleship|4}} was laid down, making France the eleventh nation to enter the dreadnought race.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp= 214\u2013215}} In the Navy Estimates of 1911, [[Paul B\u00e9nazet]] asserted that from 1896 to 1911, France dropped from being the world's second-largest naval power to fourth; he attributed this to problems in maintenance routines and neglect.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=190}} The closer alliance with the United Kingdom made these reduced forces more than adequate for French needs.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=214\u2013215}}\n\nThe Italian navy had received proposals for an all-big-gun battleship from Cuniberti well before ''Dreadnought'' was launched, but it took until 1909 for Italy to lay down one of its own. The construction of ''Dante Alighieri'' was prompted by rumours of Austro-Hungarian dreadnought-building. A further five dreadnoughts of the {{sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship|4}} and {{sclass-|Andrea Doria|battleship|4}} class followed as Italy sought to maintain its lead over Austria-Hungary. These ships remained the core of Italian naval strength until World War II.

Two were completed for Brazil: {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}} was laid down on by Armstrong ([[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]]) on 17&nbsp;April 1907, and its [[sister ship|sister]], {{ship|Brazilian battleship|S\u00e3o Paulo||2}}, followed thirteen days later at Vickers ([[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]]). Although many naval journals in Europe and the US speculated that Brazil was really acting as a proxy for one of the naval powers and would hand the ships over to them as soon as they were complete, both ships were commissioned into the [[Brazilian Navy]] in 1910.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p= 216}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|pp= 403\u2013404}}{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=320}} The third ship, ''Rio de Janeiro'', was nearly complete when [[rubber]] prices collapsed and Brazil could not afford her. She was sold to [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]] in 1913.\n\nThe Netherlands intended by 1912 to replace its fleet of pre-dreadnought [[Coastal defence ship|armoured ships]] with a modern fleet composed of dreadnoughts. After a Royal Commission [[Dutch 1913 battleship proposal|proposed the purchase of nine dreadnoughts]] in August 1913, there were extensive debates over the need for such ships and - if they were necessary - over the actual number needed. These lasted into August 1914, when a bill authorizing funding for four dreadnoughts was finalized, but the outbreak of World War I halted the ambitious plan.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp= 450\u2013455}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|pp= 363\u2013364, 366}}\n\nThe Ottoman Empire ordered two dreadnoughts from British yards, ''Reshadiye'' in 1911 and ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed'' in 1914. ''Reshadiye'' was completed, and in 1913, Turkey also acquired a nearly-completed dreadnought from Brazil, which became ''Sultan Osman I''. At the start of World War I, Britain seized the two completed ships for the Royal Navy. ''Reshadiye'' and ''Sultan Osman I'' became {{HMS|Erin}} and ''Agincourt'' respectively. (''Fatih Sultan Mehmed'' was scrapped.) This greatly offended the Ottoman Empire. When two German warships, the battlecruiser {{SMS|Goeben||6}} and the cruiser {{SMS|Breslau}}, became trapped in Ottoman territory after the start of the war, Germany \"gave\" them to the Ottomans. (They remained German-crewed and under German orders.) The British seizure and the German gift proved important factors in the Ottoman Empire joining the [[Central Powers]] in October 1914.{{sfn|Greger|1993|p=252}}\n\nGreece had ordered a dreadnought from Germany, but work stopped on the outbreak of war. The main armament for the Greek ship had been ordered in the United States, and the guns consequently equipped a class of British [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]]. In 1914 Greece purchased two pre-dreadnoughts from the United States Navy, renaming them {{ship|Greek battleship|Kilkis||2}} and {{ship|Greek battleship|Lemnos||2}} in [[Royal Hellenic Navy]] service.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=220}}\n\n===Super-dreadnoughts===<!--[[Super-dreadnought]] redirects to this section. Any editor who changes in the section header should also change the redirect-->\n[[File:2nd Battle Squadron.jpg|thumb|The {{sclass-|Orion|battleship|1}}s in line]]\n\nWithin five years of the commissioning of ''Dreadnought'', a new generation of more powerful \"super-dreadnoughts\" was being built. The British ''Orion'' class jumped an unprecedented 2,000-tons in displacement, introduced the heavier [[BL 13.5 inch /45 naval gun|13.5-inch]] (343&nbsp;mm) gun, and placed all the main armament on the centreline (hence with some turrets [[superfiring]] over others). In the four years between ''Dreadnought'' and ''Orion'', displacement had increased by 25%, and weight of broadside (the weight of ammunition that can be fired on a single bearing in one salvo) had doubled.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=126}}\n\nBritish super-dreadnoughts were joined by those built by other nations. The US Navy {{sclass-|New York|battleship|4}}, laid down in 1911, carried 14-inch (356&nbsp;mm) guns in response to the British move and this calibre became standard. In Japan, two {{sclass-|Fus\u014d|battleship|4}} super-dreadnoughts were laid down in 1912, followed by the two {{sclass-|Ise|battleship|4}} in 1914, with both classes carrying twelve 14-inch (356&nbsp;mm) guns. In 1917, the {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|4}} was ordered, the first super-dreadnoughts to mount 16-inch guns, making them arguably the most powerful warships in the world. All were increasingly built from Japanese rather than from imported components. In France, the ''Courbet''s were followed by three super-dreadnoughts of the {{sclass-|Bretagne|battleship|4}}, carrying 340&nbsp;mm (13.4&nbsp;in) guns; another five {{sclass-|Normandie|battleship|5}}s were canceled on the outbreak of World War I.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p= 214}} The aforementioned Brazilian dreadnoughts sparked a small-scale [[South American dreadnought race|arms race in South America]], as Argentina and Chile each ordered two super-dreadnoughts from the US and the United Kingdom, respectively. Argentina's {{ship|ARA|Rivadavia||2}} and {{ship|ARA|Moreno||2}} had a main armament equaling that of their Brazilian counterparts, but were much heavier and carried thicker armour. The British purchased both of Chile's battleships on the outbreak of the First World War. One, {{ship|Chilean battleship|Almirante Latorre||2}}, was later repurchased by Chile.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=214\u2013216}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|pp=401, 408}}\n\n[[File:Argentine Rivadavia Class Battleship 1912.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Argentine {{ship|ARA|Rivadavia||2}}, first of [[Rivadavia-class battleship|its class]], under construction]]\n\nLater British super-dreadnoughts, principally the ''Queen Elizabeth'' class, dispensed with the midships turret, freeing weight and volume for larger, oil-fired boilers. The new [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch (381-mm) gun]] gave greater firepower in spite of the loss of a turret, and there were a thicker armour belt and improved underwater protection. The class had a {{convert|25|knot|adj=on}} design speed, and they were considered the first [[fast battleship]]s.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=140\u2013144}}\n\nThe design weakness of super-dreadnoughts, which distinguished them from post-1918 vessels, was armour disposition. Their design emphasized the vertical armour protection needed in short-range battles, where shells would strike the sides of the ship, and assumed that an outer plate of armour would detonate any incoming shells so that crucial internal structures such as turret bases needed only light protection against splinters. This was in spite of the fact that these ships could engage the enemy at {{convert|20000|yard|m|abbr= on}}, ranges where the shells would descend at angles of up to thirty degrees (\"plunging fire\") and so could drop behind the outer plate and strike the internal structures directly. Post-war designs typically had 5 to 6&nbsp;inches (130 to 150&nbsp;mm) of deck armour laid across the top of single, much thicker vertical plates to defend against this. The concept of [[zone of immunity]] became a major part of the thinking behind battleship design. Lack of underwater protection was also a weakness of these pre-World War I designs, which originated before the use of torpedoes became widespread.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=75\u201379}}\n\nThe United States Navy designed its '[[Standard type battleship]]s', beginning with the ''Nevada'' class, with long-range engagements and plunging fire in mind; the first of these was laid down in 1912, four years before the [[Battle of Jutland]] taught the dangers of long-range fire to European navies. Important features of the standard battleships were \"all or nothing\" armour and \"raft\" construction\u2014based on a design philosophy which held that only those parts of the ship worth giving the thickest possible protection were worth armouring at all, and that the resulting armoured \"raft\" should contain enough reserve buoyancy to keep the entire ship afloat in the event the unarmoured bow and stern were thoroughly punctured and flooded. This design proved its worth in the 1942 [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], when an ill-timed turn by {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} silhouetted her to Japanese guns. In spite of receiving 26 hits, her armoured raft remained untouched and she remained both afloat and operational at the end of action.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp= 202\u2013203}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==In action==\n[[File:HMS Audacious crew take to lifeboats.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Audacious|1912|6}} sinks after hitting a [[naval mine|mine]], October 1914]]\n{{Main|Naval Warfare of World War I}}\n\nThe First World War saw no decisive engagements between battlefleets to compare with Tsushima. The role of battleships was marginal to the land fighting in France and Russia; it was equally marginal to the German war on commerce (''[[Handelskrieg]]'') and the Allied [[Blockade of Germany|blockade]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=250\u2013251}}\n\nBy virtue of geography, the Royal Navy could keep the German [[High Seas Fleet]] confined to the [[North Sea]] with relative ease, but was unable to break the German superiority in the Baltic Sea. Both sides were aware, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, that a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory. The German strategy was, therefore, to try to provoke an engagement on favourable terms: either inducing a part of the [[Grand Fleet]] to enter battle alone, or to fight a pitched battle near the German coast, where friendly minefields, torpedo boats, and submarines could even the odds.{{sfn|Keegan|1999|p=289}}\n\nThe first two years of war saw conflict in the North Sea limited to skirmishes by battlecruisers at the [[Battle of Heligoland (1914)|Battle of Heligoland Bight]] and [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]], and raids on the English coast. In May 1916, a further attempt to draw British ships into battle on favourable terms resulted in a clash of the battlefleets on 31 May to 1 June in the indecisive Battle of Jutland.{{sfn|Ireland|Grove|1997|pp=88\u201395}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 134-C2280, Szent Istv\u00e1n, Sinkendes Linienschiff.jpg|thumb|left|{{SMS|Szent Istv\u00e1n||6}} begins to roll over after being torpedoed in 1918]]\n\nIn the other naval theatres, there were no decisive pitched battles. In the [[Black Sea]], Russian and Turkish battleships skirmished, but nothing more. In the [[Baltic Sea]], action was largely limited to convoy raiding and the laying of defensive minefields.{{sfn|Keegan|1999|pp=234\u2013235}} The [[Adriatic]] was in a sense the mirror of the North Sea: the [[Austro-Hungarian]] dreadnought fleet was confined to the Adriatic by the British and French blockade but bombarded the Italians on several occasions, notably at [[Bombardment of Ancona|Ancona]] in 1915.{{sfn|Phillips|2013|page={{page needed|date=January 2017}}}} And in the Mediterranean, the most important use of battleships was in support of the amphibious assault at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]].{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=256\u2013257}}\n\nThe course of the war illustrated the vulnerability of battleships to cheaper weapons. In September 1914, the [[U-boat]] threat to [[capital ship]]s was demonstrated by successful attacks on British cruisers, including the [[Action of 22 September 1914|sinking of three elderly British armoured cruisers]] by the German submarine {{SMU|U-9||2}} in less than an hour. Mines continued to prove a threat when a month later the recently commissioned British super-dreadnought {{HMS|Audacious|1912|6}} struck one and sank in 1914. By the end of October, British strategy and tactics in the North Sea had changed to reduce the risk of U-boat attack.{{sfn|Massie|2005|pp=127\u2013145}} Jutland was the only major clash of dreadnought battleship fleets in history, and the German plan for the battle relied on U-boat attacks on the British fleet; and the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers closing on British battleships, causing them to turn away to avoid the threat of torpedo attack. Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships led to growing concern in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=245\u2013248}}\n\nFor the German part, the High Seas Fleet determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines, and since submarines were more needed for commerce raiding, the fleet stayed in port for much of the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=247\u2013249}} Other theatres showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts. The two Austrian dreadnoughts lost in November 1918 were casualties of Italian torpedo boats and [[frogmen]].\n\n==Battleship building from 1914 onwards==\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Hamburg port NARA-68155073 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Unfinished {{sclass-|Bayern|battleship|1}} ''W\u00fcrttemberg'' (right) and the {{sclass-|Mackensen|battlecruiser|1}} ''Prinz Eitel Friedrich'' in Hamburg after the war, in about 1920]]\n\nThe outbreak of World War I largely halted the dreadnought arms race as funds and technical resources were diverted to more pressing priorities. The foundries which produced battleship guns were dedicated instead to the production of land-based artillery, and shipyards were flooded with orders for small ships. The weaker naval powers engaged in the Great War\u2014France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia\u2014suspended their battleship programmes entirely. The United Kingdom and Germany continued building battleships and battlecruisers but at a reduced pace.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=61}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Fisher returned to his old post as First Sea Lord; he had been created 1st Baron Fisher in 1909, taking the motto ''Fear God and dread nought''. This, combined with a government moratorium on battleship building, meant a renewed focus on the battlecruiser. Fisher resigned in 1915 following arguments about the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.\n\nThe final units of the ''Revenge'' and ''Queen Elizabeth'' classes were completed, though the last two battleships of the ''Revenge'' class were re-ordered as battlecruisers of the {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|4}}. Fisher followed these ships with the even more extreme [[Courageous-class battlecruiser|''Courageous'' class]]; very fast and heavily armed ships with minimal, {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=2}} armour, called 'large light cruisers' to get around a Cabinet ruling against new capital ships. Fisher's mania for speed culminated in his suggestion for {{HMS|Incomparable}}, a mammoth, lightly armoured battlecruiser.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nIn Germany, two units of the pre-war {{sclass-|Bayern|battleship|4}} were gradually completed, but the other two laid down were still unfinished by the end of the War. [[SMS Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']], also laid down before the start of the war, was completed in 1917. The {{sclass-|Mackensen|battlecruiser|4}}, designed in 1914\u20131915, were begun but never finished.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=277\u2013284}}\n\n===Post-war===\n{{see also|List of battleships of the Second World War}}\nIn spite of the lull in battleship building during the World War, the years 1919\u20131922 saw the threat of a renewed naval arms race between the United Kingdom, Japan, and the US. The Battle of Jutland exerted a huge influence over the designs produced in this period. The first ships which fit into this picture are the British {{sclass2-|Admiral|battlecruiser|4}}, designed in 1916. Jutland finally persuaded the Admiralty that lightly armoured battlecruisers were too vulnerable, and therefore the final design of the Admirals incorporated much-increased armour, increasing displacement to 42,000 tons. The initiative in creating the new arms race lay with the Japanese and United States navies. The United States [[Naval Act of 1916|Naval Appropriations Act of 1916]] authorized the construction of 156 new ships, including ten battleships and six battlecruisers. For the first time, the United States Navy was threatening the British global lead.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=62\u201363}} This programme was started slowly (in part because of a desire to learn lessons from Jutland), and never fulfilled entirely. The new American ships (the ''Colorado''-class battleships, ''South'' ''Dakota''-class battleships  and {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|2}}<nowiki/>s), took a qualitative step beyond the British ''Queen Elizabeth'' class and ''Admiral'' classes by mounting 16-inch guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=63}}\n\n[[File:USS California (BB-44) - NH 82114.jpg|thumb|left|The American {{USS|California|BB-44|2}}, one of two {{sclass-|Tennessee|battleship|0}} battleships, steaming at high speed in 1921]]\nAt the same time, the Imperial Japanese Navy was finally gaining authorization for its [[eight-eight fleet|'eight-eight battlefleet']]. The ''Nagato'' class, authorized in 1916, carried eight 16-inch guns like their American counterparts. The next year's naval bill authorized two more battleships and two more battlecruisers. The battleships, which became the {{sclass-|Tosa|battleship|4}}, were to carry ten 16-inch guns. The battlecruisers, the {{sclass-|Amagi|battlecruiser|4}}, also carried ten 16-inch guns and were designed to be capable of 30 knots, capable of beating both the British Admiral- and the US&nbsp;Navy's ''Lexington''-class battlecruisers.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=171}}\n\nMatters took a further turn for the worse in 1919 when [[Woodrow Wilson]] proposed a further expansion of the United States Navy, asking for funds for an additional ten battleships and six battlecruisers in addition to the completion of the 1916 programme (the {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|4}} not yet started). In response, the [[Diet of Japan]] finally agreed to the completion of the 'eight-eight fleet', incorporating a further four battleships.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=174}} These ships, the {{sclass-|Kii|battleship|4}} would displace 43,000 tons; the next design, the {{sclass2-|Number 13|battleship|4}}, would have carried {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=356}} Many in the Japanese navy were still dissatisfied, calling for an 'eight-eight-eight' fleet with 24 modern battleships and battlecruisers.\n\nThe British, impoverished by World War I, faced the prospect of slipping behind the US and Japan. No ships had been begun since the Admiral class, and of those only {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} had been completed. A June 1919 Admiralty plan outlined a post-war fleet with 33 battleships and eight battlecruisers, which could be built and sustained for \u00a3171&nbsp;million a year (approximately \u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|171000000|1919|r=-4}}|0}} today); only \u00a384&nbsp;million was available. The Admiralty then demanded, as an absolute minimum, a further eight battleships.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=274\u2013275}} These would have been the [[G3 battlecruiser]]s, with 16-inch guns and high speed, and the N3-class battleships, with {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=173\u2013174}} Its navy severely limited by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany did not participate in this three-way naval building competition. Most of the German dreadnought fleet was scuttled at [[Scapa Flow]] by its crews in 1919; the remainder were handed over as war prizes.{{efn|name=war prizes}}{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1990|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}}\n\nThe major naval powers avoided the cripplingly expensive expansion programmes by negotiating the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922. The Treaty laid out a list of ships, including most of the older dreadnoughts and almost all the newer ships under construction, which were to be scrapped or otherwise put out of use. It furthermore declared a 'building holiday' during which no new battleships or battlecruisers were to be laid down, save for the British ''Nelson'' class. The ships which survived the treaty, including the most modern super-dreadnoughts of all three navies, formed the bulk of international capital ship strength through the 1920s and 1930s and, with some modernisation, into World War II. The ships built under the terms of the Washington Treaty (and subsequently the London Treaties in 1930 and 1936) to replace outdated vessels were known as treaty battleships.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nFrom this point on, the term 'dreadnought' became less widely used.

The first of the kind, the [[Royal Navy]]'s {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2}}, had such an impact when launched in 1906 that similar battleships built after her were referred to as \"dreadnoughts,\" and earlier battleships became known as [[pre-dreadnought]]s. Her design had two revolutionary features: an \"all-big-gun\" armament scheme, with an unprecedented number of heavy-calibre guns, and [[steam turbine]] propulsion.{{efn|name=biggun}} As dreadnoughts became a crucial symbol of national power, the arrival of these new warships renewed the [[Causes of World War I#Arms_race|naval arms race]] between the [[Anglo&ndash;German naval arms race|United Kingdom and Germany]]. Dreadnought races sprang up around the world, including [[South American dreadnought race|in South America]], lasting up to the beginning of World War I. Successive designs increased rapidly in size and made use of improvements in armament, armor, and propulsion throughout the dreadnought era. Within five years, new battleships outclassed ''Dreadnought'' herself. These more powerful vessels were known as \"[[#Super-dreadnoughts|super-dreadnoughts]]\". Most of the original dreadnoughts were scrapped after the end of World War I under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], but many of the newer super-dreadnoughts continued serving throughout World War II.\n\nWhile dreadnought-building consumed vast resources in the early 20th century, there was only one battle between large dreadnought fleets. At the [[Battle of Jutland]], the British and German navies clashed with no decisive result. The term \"dreadnought\" gradually dropped from use after World War I, especially after the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], as virtually all remaining battleships shared dreadnought characteristics; it can also be used to describe [[battlecruiser]]s, the other type of ship resulting from the dreadnought revolution.{{sfn|Mackay|1973|p=326, for instance}}\n\n==Origins==\nThe distinctive all-big-gun armament of the dreadnought was developed in the first years of the 20th century as navies sought to increase the range and power of the armament of their battleships. The typical battleship of the 1890s, now known as the \"[[pre-dreadnought]]\", had a main armament of four heavy guns of 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) [[calibre]], a secondary armament of six to eighteen [[quick-firing gun]]s of between {{convert|4.7|in|mm|sigfig=3}} and {{convert|7.5|in|mm|sigfig=3}} calibre, and other smaller weapons. This was in keeping with the prevailing theory of naval combat that battles would initially be fought at some distance, but the ships would then approach to close range for the final blows, when the shorter-range, faster-firing guns would prove most useful. Some designs had an intermediate battery of 8-inch guns. Serious proposals for an all-big-gun armament were circulated in several countries by 1903.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=52}}\n\nAll-big-gun designs commenced almost simultaneously in three navies. In 1904, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] authorized construction of {{ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}}, originally designed with twelve {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns. Work began on her construction in May 1905.{{sfn|Jentschura|Jung|Mickel|1977|pp=22\u201323}}{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=159}} The [[Royal Navy]] began the design of HMS ''Dreadnought'' in January 1905, and she was [[laid down]] in October of the same year.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=15}} Finally, the US Navy gained authorization for {{USS|Michigan|BB-27|6}}, carrying eight 12-inch guns, in March 1905,{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=15}} with construction commencing in December 1906.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=419}}\n\nThe move to all-big-gun designs was accomplished because a uniform, heavy-calibre armament offered advantages in both firepower and fire control, and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905 showed that naval battles could, and likely would, be fought at long distances. The newest 12-inch (305&nbsp;mm) guns had longer range and fired heavier shells than a gun of {{convert|10|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} or {{convert|9.2|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} calibre.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=98}} Another possible advantage was fire control; at long ranges guns were aimed by observing the splashes caused by shells fired in salvoes, and it was difficult to interpret different splashes caused by different calibres of gun. There is still debate as to whether this feature was important.{{sfn|Fairbanks|1991}}\n\n===Long-range gunnery===\nIn naval battles of the 1890s the decisive weapon was the medium-calibre, typically {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}, quick-firing gun firing at relatively short range; at [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)|the Battle of the Yalu River]] in 1894, the victorious Japanese did not commence firing until the range had closed to {{convert|3900|m|yd}} and most of the fighting occurred at {{convert|2000|m|yd}}.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=170\u2013171}} At these ranges, lighter guns had good accuracy, and their high rate of fire delivered high volumes of [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] on the target, known as the \"hail of fire\". Naval gunnery was too inaccurate to hit targets at a longer range.{{efn|name=trajectory}}\n\nBy the early 20th century, British and American admirals expected future battleships would engage at longer distances. Newer models of [[torpedo]] had longer ranges.{{sfn|Lambert|1999|p=77}} For instance, in 1903, the US Navy ordered a design of torpedo effective to {{convert|4000|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=53}} Both British and American admirals concluded that they needed to engage the enemy at longer ranges.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=53}}{{sfn|Lambert|1999|p=78}} In 1900, Admiral Fisher, commanding the Royal Navy Mediterranean Fleet, ordered gunnery practice with 6-inch guns at {{convert|6000|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Lambert|1999|p=78}} By 1904 the US [[Naval War College]] was considering the effects on battleship tactics of torpedoes with a range of {{convert|7000|yd|m}} to {{convert|8000|yd|m}}.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=53}}\n\nThe range of light and medium-calibre guns was limited, and accuracy declined badly at longer range.{{efn|name=velocity}} At longer ranges the advantage of a high rate of fire decreased; accurate shooting depended on spotting the shell-splashes of the previous salvo, which limited the optimum rate of fire.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=52}}\n\nOn 10 August 1904 the [[Imperial Russian Navy]] and the Imperial Japanese Navy had one of the longest-range gunnery duels to date \u2013 over 13km (8 miles) \u2013 during the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea]].{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|pp=50, 72}} The Russian battleships were equipped with Liuzhol [[range finder]]s with an effective range of 4&nbsp;km (4400&nbsp;yd) and the Japanese ships had [[Barr & Stroud]] range finders that reached out to 6&nbsp;km (6550&nbsp;yd), but both sides still managed to hit each other with 12-inch fire at {{cvt|13|km|yd}}.{{sfn|Forczyk|2009|pp=50, 56\u201357, 72}} Naval architects and strategists around the world took notice.\n\n===All-big-gun mixed-calibre ships===<!--[[Semi-dreadnought]] redirects here, please retarget redirect if this section is renamed-->\n[[File:HMS Agamemnon (1908) profile drawing.png|thumb|{{HMS|Agamemnon|1906|6}}, an all-big-gun mixed-calibre ship of the {{sclass-|Lord Nelson|battleship|4}}. It carried four {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} and ten {{convert|9.2|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}.]]\n\nAn evolutionary step was to reduce the quick-firing secondary battery and substitute additional heavy guns, typically 9.2-inch or 10-inch. Ships designed in this way have been described as 'all-big-gun mixed-calibre' or later 'semi-dreadnoughts'. Semi-dreadnought ships had many heavy secondary guns in wing turrets near the center of the ship, instead of the small guns mounted in barbettes of earlier pre-dreadnought ships.\n\nSemi-dreadnoughts classes included the British {{sclass-|King Edward VII|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Lord Nelson|battleship|5}}; Russian {{sclass-|Andrei Pervozvanny|battleship|5}}; Japanese {{sclass-|Katori|battleship|5}}, {{sclass-|Satsuma|battleship|5}}, and {{sclass-|Kawachi|battleship|5}};{{sfn|Gardiner|Lambert|2001|pp=125\u2013126}} American {{sclass-|Connecticut|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Mississippi|battleship|5}}; French {{sclass-|Danton|battleship|5}}; Italian {{sclass-|Regina Elena|battleship|5}}; and Austro-Hungarian {{sclass-|Radetzky|battleship|4}}.\n\nThe design process for these ships often included discussion of an 'all-big-gun one-calibre' alternative.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=113, 331\u2013332, 418}}{{efn|name=Mississippi}} The June 1902 issue of ''Proceedings of the US Naval Institute'' contained comments by the US Navy's leading gunnery expert, P.R Alger, proposing a main battery of eight 12-inch guns in twin turrets.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=51}} In May 1902, the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]] submitted a design for the battleship with twelve 10-inch guns in twin turrets, two at the ends and four in the wings.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=51}} Lt. Cdr. H. C. Poundstone submitted a paper to [[Theodore Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] in December 1902 arguing the case for larger battleships. In an appendix to his paper, Poundstone suggested a greater number of {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} and {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns was preferable to a smaller number of 12-inch and 9-inch.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=52}} The Naval War College and Bureau of Construction and Repair developed these ideas in studies between 1903 and 1905. War-game studies begun in July 1903 \"showed that a battleship armed with twelve 11-inch or 12-inch guns hexagonally arranged would be equal to three or more of the conventional type.\"{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=53\u201358}}\n\nThe Royal Navy was thinking along similar lines. A design had been circulated in 1902\u20131903 for \"a powerful 'all big-gun' armament of two calibres, viz. four 12-inch and twelve 9.2-inch guns.\"{{sfn|Parkes|1990|p=426, quoting an INA paper of 9 April 1919 by [[Philip Watts (naval architect)|Sir Philip Watts]]}} The Admiralty decided to build three more ''King Edward VII''s (with a mixture of 12-inch, 9.2-inch and 6-inch) in the 1903\u20131904 naval construction programme instead.{{sfn|Parkes|1990|p=426}} The all-big-gun concept was revived for the 1904\u20131905 programme, the ''Lord Nelson'' class. Restrictions on length and [[beam (nautical)|beam]] meant the midships 9.2-inch turrets became single instead of twin, thus giving an armament of four 12-inch, ten 9.2-inch and no 6-inch. The constructor for this design, J.H. Narbeth, submitted an alternative drawing showing an armament of twelve 12-inch guns, but the Admiralty was not prepared to accept this.{{sfn|Parkes|1990|pp=451\u2013452}} Part of the rationale for the decision to retain mixed-calibre guns was the need to begin the building of the ships quickly because of the tense situation produced by the Russo-Japanese War.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=113}}\n\n===Switch to all-big-gun designs===\nThe replacement of the 6-inch or {{convert|8|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns with weapons of 9.2-inch or 10-inch calibre improved the striking power of a battleship, particularly at longer ranges. Uniform heavy-gun armament offered many other advantages. One advantage was logistical simplicity. When the US was considering whether to have a mixed-calibre main armament for the {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|4}}, for example, [[William Sims]] and Homer Poundstone stressed the advantages of homogeneity in terms of ammunition supply and the transfer of crews from the disengaged guns to replace gunners wounded in action.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=55}}\n\nA uniform calibre of gun also helped streamline fire control. The designers of ''Dreadnought'' preferred an all-big-gun design because it would mean only one set of calculations about adjustments to the range of the guns.{{efn|name=uniform armament}} Some historians today hold that a uniform calibre was particularly important because the risk of confusion between shell-splashes of 12-inch and lighter guns made accurate ranging difficult. This viewpoint is controversial, as fire control in 1905 was not advanced enough to use the salvo-firing technique where this confusion might be important,{{sfn|Fairbanks|1991|p=250}} and confusion of shell-splashes does not seem to have been a concern of those working on all-big-gun designs.{{efn|name=salvoes}} Nevertheless, the likelihood of engagements at longer ranges was important in deciding that the heaviest possible guns should become standard, hence 12-inch rather than 10-inch.{{efn|name=accuracy}}\n\nThe newer designs of 12-inch gun mounting had a considerably higher rate of fire, removing the advantage previously enjoyed by smaller calibres. In 1895, a 12-inch gun might have fired one round every four minutes; by 1902, two rounds per minute was usual.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=98}} In October 1903, the Italian [[naval architect]] [[Vittorio Cuniberti]] published a paper in ''[[Jane's Fighting Ships]]'' entitled \"An Ideal Battleship for the British Navy\", which called for a 17,000 ton ship carrying a main armament of twelve 12-inch guns, protected by armour 12&nbsp;inches thick, and having a speed of 24 knots (28&nbsp;mph/44&nbsp;km/h).{{sfn|Cuniberti|1903|pp=407\u2013409}} Cuniberti's idea\u2014which he had already proposed to his own navy, the ''[[Regia Marina]]''\u2014was to make use of the high rate of fire of new 12-inch guns to produce devastating rapid-fire from heavy guns to replace the 'hail of fire' from lighter weapons.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=98}} Something similar lay behind the Japanese move towards heavier guns; at [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima]], Japanese shells contained a higher than normal proportion of high explosive, and were fused to explode on contact, starting fires rather than piercing armour.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=63}} The increased rate of fire laid the foundations for future advances in fire control.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=98}}\n\n===Building the first dreadnoughts===\n[[File:HMS Dreadnought (1911) profile drawing.png|thumb|A plan of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}, showing the revolutionary design]]\nIn Japan, the two battleships of the 1903\u20131904 programme were the first in the world to be laid down as all-big-gun ships, with eight 12-inch guns. The armour of their design was considered too thin, demanding a substantial redesign.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=331}} The financial pressures of the Russo-Japanese War and the short supply of 12-inch guns\u2014which had to be imported from the United Kingdom\u2014meant these ships were completed with a mixture of 12-inch and 10-inch armament. The 1903\u20131904 design retained traditional triple-expansion steam engines, unlike ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=159}}\n\nThe dreadnought breakthrough occurred in the United Kingdom in October 1905. Fisher, now the [[First Sea Lord]], had long been an advocate of new technology in the Royal Navy and had recently been convinced of the idea of an all-big-gun battleship.{{efn|name=Fisher}} Fisher is often credited as the creator of the dreadnought and the father of the United Kingdom's great dreadnought battleship fleet, an impression he himself did much to reinforce. It has been suggested Fisher's main focus was on the arguably even more revolutionary [[battlecruiser]] and not the battleship.{{sfn|Sumida|1995|pp=619\u2013621}}\n\nShortly after taking office, Fisher set up a Committee on Designs to consider future battleships and armoured cruisers.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=15}} The Committee's first task was to consider a new battleship. The specification for the new ship was a 12-inch main battery and anti-torpedo-boat guns but no intermediate calibres, and a speed of {{convert|21|knot|km/h|abbr=on}} which was two or three knots faster than existing battleships.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=115}} The initial designs intended twelve 12-inch guns, though difficulties in positioning these guns led the chief constructor at one stage to propose a return to four 12-inch guns with sixteen or eighteen of 9.2-inch. After a full evaluation of reports of the action at Tsushima compiled by an official observer, [[William Christopher Pakenham|Captain Pakenham]], the Committee settled on a main battery of ten 12-inch guns, along with twenty-two [[QF 12 pounder 18 cwt naval gun|12 pounders]] as secondary armament.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=115}} The Committee also gave ''Dreadnought'' [[steam turbine]] propulsion, which was unprecedented in a large warship. The greater power and lighter weight of turbines meant the 21-knot (24&nbsp;mph/39&nbsp;km/h) design speed could be achieved in a smaller and less costly ship than if [[reciprocating engine]]s had been used.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=46, 115}} Construction took place quickly; the keel was laid on 2 October 1905, the ship was launched on 10 February 1906, and completed on 3 October 1906\u2014an impressive demonstration of British industrial might.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=15}}\n\nThe first US dreadnoughts were the two ''South Carolina''-class ships. Detailed plans for these were worked out in July\u2013November 1905, and approved by the Board of Construction on 23 November 1905.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=62}} Building was slow; specifications for bidders were issued on 21 March 1906, the contracts awarded on 21 July 1906{{sfn|Marder|1964|p=542}} and the two ships were laid down in December 1906, after the completion of the ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=63}}\n\n==Design==\nThe designers of dreadnoughts sought to provide as much protection, speed, and firepower as possible in a ship of a realistic size and cost. The hallmark of dreadnought battleships was an \"all-big-gun\" armament, but they also had heavy armour concentrated mainly in a thick belt at the waterline and in one or more armoured decks. Secondary armament, fire control, command equipment, and protection against torpedoes also had to be crammed into the hull.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=19\u201321}}\n\nThe inevitable consequence of demands for ever greater speed, striking power, and endurance meant that [[displacement (ship)|displacement]], and hence cost, of dreadnoughts tended to increase. The [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922 imposed a limit of 35,000 tons on the displacement of capital ships. In subsequent years [[treaty battleship]]s were commissioned to build up to this limit. Japan's decision to leave the Treaty in the 1930s, and the arrival of the Second World War, eventually made this limit irrelevant.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=85}}\n[[File:Battleship building scatter graph 1905 onwards.png|thumb|center|700px|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">Growth in size of battleship designs from 1905 onwards, showing the dreadnought's rapid growth between 1905 and 1920, prior to the [[Washington Naval Treaty]] of 1922</div>]]\n\n===Armament===\n[[File:HMS Bellerophon Plan.jpg|thumb|A plan of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1907|3}} showing the armament distribution of early British dreadnoughts. The [[main battery]] is in twin turrets, with two on the \"wings\"; the light secondary battery is clustered around the superstructure.]]\n\nDreadnoughts mounted a uniform [[main battery]] of heavy-calibre guns; the number, size, and arrangement differed between designs. ''Dreadnought'' mounted ten 12-inch guns. 12-inch guns had been standard for most navies in the [[pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought era]] and this continued in the first generation of dreadnought battleships. The [[Imperial German Navy]] was an exception, continuing to use 11-inch guns in its first class of dreadnoughts, the {{sclass-|Nassau|battleship|4}}.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=54, 266}}\n\nDreadnoughts also carried lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a secondary armament of very light guns designed to fend off enemy [[motor torpedo boat|torpedo boats]]. The calibre and weight of secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the torpedo boats and [[destroyer]]s expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=141\u2013151}}\n\nDreadnoughts frequently carried [[torpedo tube]]s themselves. In theory, a line of battleships so equipped could unleash a devastating volley of torpedoes on an enemy line steaming a parallel course. In practice, torpedoes fired from battleships scored very few hits, and there was a risk that a stored torpedo would cause a dangerous explosion if hit by enemy fire.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=151\u2013153}} And in fact, the only documented instance of one battleship successfully torpedoing another came during the [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|Action of 27 May 1941]], where the British battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|6}} claimed to have torpedoed the crippled {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} at close range.{{sfn|Kennedy|1991|p=246}}\n\n====Position of main armament====\nThe effectiveness of the guns depended in part on the layout of the turrets. ''Dreadnought'', and the British ships which immediately followed it, carried five turrets: one forward, one aft and one amidships on the centreline of the ship, and two in the 'wings' next to the [[superstructure]]. This allowed three turrets to fire ahead and four on the broadside. The ''Nassau'' and {{sclass-|Helgoland|battleship|5}} classes of German dreadnoughts adopted a 'hexagonal' layout, with one turret each fore and aft and four wing turrets; this meant more guns were mounted in total, but the same number could fire ahead or broadside as with ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=263}}\n\nDreadnought designs experimented with different layouts. The British [[HMS Neptune (1909)|''Neptune''-class battleship]] staggered the wing turrets, so all ten guns could fire on the broadside, a feature also used by the German {{sclass-|Kaiser|battleship|4}}. This risked blast damage to parts of the ship over which the guns fired, and put great stress on the ship's frames.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=134}}\n\nIf all turrets were on the centreline of the vessel, stresses on the ship's frames were relatively low. This layout meant the entire main battery could fire on the broadside, though fewer could fire end-on. It meant the hull would be longer, which posed some challenges for the designers; a longer ship needed to devote more weight to armour to get equivalent protection, and the magazines which served each turret interfered with the distribution of boilers and engines.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=132}} For these reasons, {{HMS|Agincourt|1913|6}}, which carried a record fourteen 12-inch guns in seven centreline turrets, was not considered a success.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=138}}\n\nA [[superfire|superfiring]] layout was eventually adopted as standard. This involved raising one or two turrets so they could fire over a turret immediately forward or astern of them. The US Navy adopted this feature with their first dreadnoughts in 1906, but others were slower to do so. As with other layouts there were drawbacks. Initially, there were concerns about the impact of the blast of the raised guns on the lower turret. Raised turrets raised the centre of gravity of the ship, and might reduce the stability of the ship. Nevertheless, this layout made the best of the firepower available from a fixed number of guns, and was eventually adopted generally.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=134}} The US Navy used superfiring on the ''South Carolina'' class, and the layout was adopted in the Royal Navy with the {{sclass-|Orion|battleship|4}} of 1910. By World War II, superfiring was entirely standard.\n\nInitially, all dreadnoughts had two guns to a turret. One solution to the problem of turret layout was to put three or even four guns in each turret. Fewer turrets meant the ship could be shorter, or could devote more space to machinery. On the other hand, it meant that in the event of an enemy shell destroying one turret, a higher proportion of the main armament would be out of action. The risk of the blast waves from each gun barrel interfering with others in the same turret reduced the rate of fire from the guns somewhat. The first nation to adopt the triple turret was Italy, in the {{ship|Italian battleship|Dante Alighieri||2}}, soon followed by Russia with the {{sclass-|Gangut|battleship|4}},{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=393\u2013396}} the Austro-Hungarian {{sclass-|Tegetthoff|battleship|4}}, and the US {{sclass-|Nevada|battleship|4}}. British Royal Navy battleships did not adopt triple turrets until after the First World War, with the {{sclass-|Nelson|battleship|4}}. Several later designs used quadruple turrets, including the British {{sclass-|King George V|battleship (1939)|4}} and French {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|4}}.\n\n====Main armament power and calibre====\nRather than try to fit more guns onto a ship, it was possible to increase the power of each gun. This could be done by increasing either the calibre of the weapon and hence the weight of shell, or by lengthening the barrel to increase [[muzzle velocity]]. Either of these offered the chance to increase range and armour penetration.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=130\u2013131}}\n\n[[File:Animated gun turret.gif|thumb|Animated diagram of gun turret loading and firing, based on the [[BL 15 inch /42 naval gun|British 15-inch gun]] used on super-dreadnoughts]]\n\nBoth methods offered advantages and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 because of the wear on the barrels.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=129}} The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; and heavier shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells have the advantage of being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=130}}\n\nDifferent navies approached the issue of calibre in different ways. The German navy, for instance, generally used a lighter calibre than the equivalent British ships, e.g. 12-inch calibre when the British standard was {{convert|13.5|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}}. Because German metallurgy was superior, the German 12-inch gun had better shell weight and muzzle velocity than the British 12-inch; and German ships could afford more armour for the same vessel weight because the German 12\" guns were lighter than the 13.5\" guns the British required for comparable effect.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=130}}\n\nOver time the calibre of guns tended to increase. In the Royal Navy, the ''Orion'' class, launched 1910, had ten 13.5-inch guns, all on the centreline; the ''Queen Elizabeth'' class, launched 1913, had eight {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns. In all navies, fewer guns of larger calibre came to be used. The smaller number of guns simplified their distribution, and centreline turrets became the norm.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=135}}\n\nA further step change was planned for battleships designed and laid down at the end of World War I. The Japanese {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|2}}s in 1917 carried {{convert|410|mm|in|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns, which was quickly matched by the US Navy's {{sclass-|Colorado|battleship|4}}. Both the United Kingdom and Japan were planning battleships with {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} armament, in the British case the {{sclass2-|N3|battleship|4}}. The Washington Naval Treaty concluded on 6 February 1922 and ratified later limited battleship guns to not more than {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} calibre,{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=72}} and these heavier guns were not produced.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=71}}\n\n[[File:British 14in Naval Gun 1930s Model.png|thumb|left|A 14-inch naval gun, as fitted to the ''King George V''-class [[treaty battleship]]s]]\nThe only battleships to break the limit were the Japanese {{sclass-|Yamato|battleship|4}}, begun in 1937 (after the treaty expired), which carried 460&nbsp;mm (18.1&nbsp;in) main guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=84}} By the middle of World War II, the United Kingdom was making use of 15-inch guns kept as spares for the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|4}} to arm the last British battleship, {{HMS|Vanguard|23|6}}.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=82}}\n\nSome World War II-era designs were drawn up proposing another move towards gigantic armament. The German [[H-class battleship proposals|H-43 and H-44 designs]] proposed {{convert|508|mm|in|adj=on|sigfig=2}} guns, and there is evidence Hitler wanted calibres as high as {{convert|609|mm|in|adj=on|sigfig=2}};{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=214}} the Japanese '[[Design A-150 battleship|Super ''Yamato'']]' design also called for 508&nbsp;mm guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=367}} None of these proposals went further than very preliminary design work.\n\n====Secondary armament====\nThe first dreadnoughts tended to have a very light secondary armament intended to protect them from [[torpedo boat]]s. ''Dreadnought'' carried 12-pounder guns; each of her twenty-two 12-pounders could fire at least 15 rounds a minute at any torpedo boat making an attack.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=107, 115}} The ''South Carolina''s and other early American dreadnoughts were similarly equipped.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=196}} At this stage, torpedo boats were expected to attack separately from any fleet actions. Therefore, there was no need to armour the secondary gun armament, or to protect the crews from the blast effects of the main guns. In this context, the light guns tended to be mounted in unarmoured positions high on the ship to minimize weight and maximize field of fire.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=135\u2013136}}\n\n[[File:QF12pdr18cwtGunsXTurretHMSDreadnought.jpg|thumb|[[QF 12 pounder 18 cwt naval gun|12-pounder]] anti-torpedo boat guns mounted on the roof of a turret on {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|3}}]]\n\nWithin a few years, the principal threat was from the destroyer\u2014larger, more heavily armed, and harder to destroy than the torpedo boat. Since the risk from destroyers was very serious, it was considered that one shell from a battleship's secondary armament should sink (rather than merely damage) any attacking destroyer. Destroyers, in contrast to torpedo boats, were expected to attack as part of a general fleet engagement, so it was necessary for the secondary armament to be protected against shell splinters from heavy guns, and the blast of the main armament. This philosophy of secondary armament was adopted by the German navy from the start; ''Nassau'', for instance, carried twelve 150-mm (5.9&nbsp;in) and sixteen 88-mm (3.45&nbsp;in) guns, and subsequent German dreadnought classes followed this lead.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=263}} These heavier guns tended to be mounted in armoured [[barbette]]s or [[Casemate#Single casemates (1889 onwards)|casemates]] on the main deck. The Royal Navy increased its secondary armament from 12-pounder to first {{convert|4|in|mm|adj=on}} and then 6-inch guns, which were standard at the start of World War I;{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=106\u2013107}} the US standardized on {{convert|5|in|mm|adj=on}} calibre for the war but planned 6-inch guns for the ships designed just afterwards.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=159}}\n\nThe secondary battery served several other roles. It was hoped that a medium-calibre shell might be able to score a hit on an enemy dreadnought's sensitive fire control systems. It was also felt that the secondary armament could play an important role in driving off enemy cruisers from attacking a crippled battleship.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=113\u2013116}}\n\nThe secondary armament of dreadnoughts was, on the whole, unsatisfactory. A hit from a light gun could not be relied on to stop a destroyer. Heavier guns could not be relied on to hit a destroyer, as experience at the Battle of Jutland showed. The casemate mountings of heavier guns proved problematic; being low in the hull, they proved liable to flooding, and on several classes, some were removed and plated over. The only sure way to protect a dreadnought from destroyer or torpedo boat attack was to provide a destroyer squadron as an escort. After World War I the secondary armament tended to be mounted in turrets on the upper deck and around the superstructure. This allowed a wide field of fire and good protection without the negative points of casemates. Increasingly through the 1920s and 1930s, the secondary guns were seen as a major part of the anti-aircraft battery, with high-angle, [[dual-purpose gun]]s increasingly adopted.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=116\u2013122}}\n\n===Armour===\n[[File:SMS-Bayern-protection-scheme-EN.svg|thumb|This section of {{SMS|Bayern}} shows a typical dreadnought protection scheme, with very thick armour protecting the turrets, magazines and engine spaces tapering away in less vital areas]]\n\nMuch of the displacement of a dreadnought was taken up by the steel plating of the armour. Designers spent much time and effort to provide the best possible protection for their ships against the various weapons with which they would be faced. Only so much weight could be devoted to protection, without compromising speed, firepower or seakeeping.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=7\u20138}}\n\n====Central citadel====\nThe bulk of a dreadnought's armour was concentrated around the \"armoured citadel\". This was a box, with four armoured walls and an armoured roof, around the most important parts of the ship. The sides of the citadel were the \"armoured belt\" of the ship, which started on the hull just in front of the forward turret and ran to just behind the aft turret. The ends of the citadel were two armoured bulkheads, fore and aft, which stretched between the ends of the armour belt. The \"roof\" of the citadel was an armoured deck. Within the citadel were the boilers, engines, and the magazines for the main armament. A hit to any of these systems could cripple or destroy the ship. The \"floor\" of the box was the bottom of the ship's hull, and was unarmoured, although it was, in fact, a \"triple bottom\".{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=54\u201361}}\n\nThe earliest dreadnoughts were intended to take part in a pitched battle against other battleships at ranges of up to {{convert|10000|yard|m|abbr=on}}. In such an encounter, shells would fly on a relatively flat trajectory, and a shell would have to hit at or just about the waterline to damage the vitals of the ship. For this reason, the early dreadnoughts' armour was concentrated in a thick belt around the waterline; this was {{convert|11|in|mm}} thick in ''Dreadnought''. Behind this belt were arranged the ship's coal bunkers, to further protect the engineering spaces.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=9}} In an engagement of this sort, there was also a lesser threat of indirect damage to the vital parts of the ship. A shell which struck above the belt armour and exploded could send fragments flying in all directions. These fragments were dangerous but could be stopped by much thinner armour than what would be necessary to stop an unexploded armour-piercing shell. To protect the innards of the ship from fragments of shells which detonated on the superstructure, much thinner steel armour was applied to the decks of the ship.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|p=9}}\n\nThe thickest protection was reserved for the central citadel in all battleships. Some navies extended a thinner armoured belt and armoured deck to cover the ends of the ship, or extended a thinner armoured belt up the outside of the hull. This \"tapered\" armour was used by the major European navies\u2014the United Kingdom, Germany, and France. This arrangement gave some armour to a larger part of the ship; for the very first dreadnoughts, when high-explosive shellfire was still considered a significant threat, this was useful. It tended to result in the main belt being very short, only protecting a thin strip above the waterline; some navies found that when their dreadnoughts were heavily laden, the armoured belt was entirely submerged.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=65\u201366}} The alternative was an [[All or nothing (armor)|\"all or nothing\" protection scheme]], developed by the US Navy. The armour belt was tall and thick, but no side protection at all was provided to the ends of the ship or the upper decks. The armoured deck was also thickened. The \"all-or-nothing\" system provided more effective protection against the very-long-range engagements of dreadnought fleets and was adopted outside the US Navy after World War I.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=67}}\n\nThe design of the dreadnought changed to meet new challenges. For example, armour schemes were changed to reflect the greater risk of plunging shells from long-range gunfire, and the increasing threat from armour-piercing bombs dropped by aircraft. Later designs carried a greater thickness of steel on the armoured deck;{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=66\u201367}} [[Japanese battleship Yamato|''Yamato'']] carried a {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} main belt, but a deck {{convert|9|in|mm|adj=on}} thick.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=360}}\n\n====Underwater protection and subdivision====\nThe final element of the protection scheme of the first dreadnoughts was the subdivision of the ship below the waterline into several watertight compartments. If the hull were holed\u2014by shellfire, [[naval mine|mine]], torpedo, or collision\u2014then, in theory, only one area would flood and the ship could survive. To make this precaution even more effective, many dreadnoughts had no doors between different underwater sections, so that even a surprise hole below the waterline need not sink the ship. There were still several instances where flooding spread between underwater compartments.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=77\u201379}}\n\nThe greatest evolution in dreadnought protection came with the development of the [[anti-torpedo bulge]] and [[torpedo belt]], both attempts to protect against underwater damage by mines and torpedoes. The purpose of underwater protection was to absorb the force of a detonating mine or torpedo well away from the final watertight hull. This meant an inner bulkhead along the side of the hull, which was generally lightly armoured to capture splinters, separated from the outer hull by one or more compartments. The compartments in between were either left empty, or filled with coal, water or fuel oil.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=79\u201383}}\n\n===Propulsion===\n[[File:Battleship Paris.png|thumb|{{ship|French battleship|Paris||2}} on speed trials]]\nDreadnoughts were propelled by two to four [[screw propeller]]s.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=95}} ''Dreadnought'' herself, and all British dreadnoughts, had screw shafts driven by steam turbines. The first generation of dreadnoughts built in other nations used the slower [[triple-expansion steam engine]] which had been standard in pre-dreadnoughts.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nTurbines offered more [[power (physics)|power]] than reciprocating engines for the same volume of machinery.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=91}}{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=46}} This, along with a guarantee on the new machinery from the inventor, [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]], persuaded the Royal Navy to use turbines in ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=46}} It is often said that turbines had the additional benefits of being cleaner and more reliable than reciprocating engines.{{sfn|Massie|2004|p=474}} By 1905, new designs of reciprocating engine were available which were cleaner and more reliable than previous models.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=91}}\n\nTurbines also had disadvantages. At cruising speeds much slower than maximum speed, turbines were markedly less [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficient]] than reciprocating engines. This was particularly important for navies which required a long range at cruising speeds\u2014and hence for the US Navy, which was planning in the event of war to cruise across the Pacific and engage the Japanese in the Philippines.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nThe US Navy experimented with turbine engines from 1908 in the {{USS|North Dakota|BB-29|2}}, but was not fully committed to turbines until the ''Pennsylvania'' class in 1916. In the preceding ''Nevada'' class, one ship, the ''Oklahoma'', received reciprocating engines, while the ''Nevada'' received geared turbines. The two ''New York''-class ships of 1914 both received reciprocating engines, but all four ships of the ''Florida'' (1911) and ''Wyoming'' (1912) classes received turbines.\n\nThe disadvantages of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the [[geared turbine]], where gearing reduced the rotation rate of the propellers and hence increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the gears and hence was difficult to implement.{{sfn|Gardiner|1992|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nOne alternative was the [[turbo-electric]] drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which used it for all dreadnoughts from late 1915\u20131922. The advantages of this method were its low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.{{efn|name=power loss}}\n\nTurbines were never replaced in battleship design. [[Diesel engine]]s were eventually considered by some powers, as they offered very good endurance and an engineering space taking up less of the length of the ship. They were also heavier, however, took up a greater vertical space, offered less power, and were considered unreliable.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=292, 295}}{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=213}}\n\n====Fuel====\nThe first generation of dreadnoughts used coal to fire the boilers which fed steam to the turbines. Coal had been in use since the very first steam warships. One advantage of coal was that it is quite inert (in lump form) and thus could be used as part of the ship's protection scheme.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=93}} Coal also had many disadvantages. It was labor-intensive to pack coal into the ship's bunkers and then feed it into the boilers. The boilers became clogged with ash. Airborne coal dust and related vapors were highly explosive, possibly evidenced by the explosion of {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}}. Burning coal as fuel also produced thick black smoke which gave away the position of a fleet and interfered with visibility, signaling, and fire control. In addition, coal was very bulky and had comparatively low [[thermal efficiency]].\n\n[[Fuel Oil|Oil]]-fired propulsion had many advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of [[stoker (occupation)|stokers]] to do it by hand. Oil has roughly twice the [[thermal energy|thermal content]] of coal. This meant that the boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=93}}\n\nThese benefits meant that, as early as 1901, Fisher was pressing the advantages of oil fuel.{{sfn|Mackay|1973|p=269}} There were technical problems with oil-firing, connected with the different distribution of the weight of oil fuel compared to coal,{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=93}} and the problems of pumping viscous oil.{{sfn|Brown|2003|pp=22\u201323}} The main problem with using oil for the battle fleet was that, with the exception of the United States, every major navy would have to import its oil. As a result, some navies adopted 'dual-firing' boilers which could use coal sprayed with oil; British ships so equipped, which included dreadnoughts, could even use oil alone at up to 60% power.{{sfn|Brown|2003|p=23}}\n\nThe US had large reserves of oil, and the US Navy was the first to wholeheartedly adopt oil-firing, deciding to do so in 1910 and ordering oil-fired boilers for the ''Nevada'' class, in 1911.{{efn|name=engines}} The United Kingdom was not far behind, deciding in 1912 to use oil on its own in the ''Queen Elizabeth'' class;{{sfn|Brown|2003|p=23}} shorter British design and building times meant that ''Queen Elizabeth'' was commissioned before either of the ''Nevada''-class vessels. The United Kingdom planned to revert to mixed firing with the subsequent {{sclass-|Revenge|battleship|4}}, at the cost of some speed\u2014but Fisher, who returned to office in 1914, insisted that all the boilers should be oil-fired.{{sfn|Parkes|1990|pp=582\u2013583}} Other major navies retained mixed coal-and-oil firing until the end of World War I.{{sfn|Friedman|1978|p=94}}\n\n==Dreadnought building==\nDreadnoughts developed as a move in an international battleship arms-race which had begun in the 1890s. The British Royal Navy had a big lead in the number of pre-dreadnought battleships, but a lead of only one dreadnought in 1906.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=198}} This has led to criticism that the British, by launching HMS ''Dreadnought'', threw away a strategic advantage.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|p=218}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=201}} Most of the United Kingdom's naval rivals had already contemplated or even built warships that featured a uniform battery of heavy guns. Both the Japanese Navy and the US Navy ordered \"all-big-gun\" ships in 1904\u20131905, with ''Satsuma'' and ''South Carolina'', respectively. Germany's Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] had advocated a fast warship armed only with heavy guns since the 1890s. By securing a head start in dreadnought construction, the United Kingdom ensured its dominance of the seas continued.{{sfn|Herwig|1980|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nThe battleship race soon accelerated once more, placing a great burden on the finances of the governments which engaged in it. The first dreadnoughts were not much more expensive than the last pre-dreadnoughts, but the cost per ship continued to grow thereafter.{{efn|name=costs}} Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power in spite of their price. Each battleship signalled national power and prestige, in a manner similar to the nuclear weapons of today.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp= 227\u2013228}} Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers -including the Ottoman Empire, Greece, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile - commissioned British, French, German, and American yards to build dreadnoughts for them.{{sfn|Keegan|1999|p=281}}\n\n===Anglo-German arms race===\n{{See also|Anglo-German naval arms race{{!}}World War I naval arms race|Causes of World War I}}\n\n[[File:George V and Admiral Callaghan onboard HMS Iron Duke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] (''left'') inspects {{HMS|Neptune|1909|6}}]]\nThe construction of ''Dreadnought'' coincided with increasing tension between the United Kingdom and Germany. Germany had begun building a large battlefleet in the 1890s, as part of a deliberate policy to challenge British naval supremacy. With the signing of the [[Entente Cordiale]] in April 1904, it became increasingly clear the United Kingdom's principal naval enemy would be Germany, which was building up a large, modern fleet under the [[German Naval Laws|\"Tirpitz\" laws]]. This rivalry gave rise to the two largest dreadnought fleets of the pre-1914 period.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=59}}\n\nThe first German response to ''Dreadnought'' was the ''Nassau'' class, laid down in 1907, followed by the ''Helgoland'' class in 1909. Together with two battlecruisers\u2014a type for which the Germans had less admiration than Fisher, but which could be built under the authorization for armoured cruisers, rather than for capital ships\u2014these classes gave Germany a total of ten modern capital ships built or building in 1909. The British ships were faster and more powerful than their German equivalents, but a 12:10 ratio fell far short of the 2:1 superiority the Royal Navy wanted to maintain.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=203}}\n\nIn 1909, the British Parliament authorized an additional four capital ships, holding out hope Germany would be willing to negotiate a treaty limiting battleship numbers. If no such solution could be found, an additional four ships would be laid down in 1910. Even this compromise meant, when taken together with some social reforms, raising taxes enough to prompt a [[People's Budget|constitutional crisis]] in the United Kingdom in 1909\u20131910. In 1910, the British eight-ship construction plan went ahead, including four ''Orion''-class super-dreadnoughts, augmented by battlecruisers purchased by Australia and New Zealand. In the same period, Germany laid down only three ships, giving the United Kingdom a superiority of 22 ships to 13. The British resolve, as demonstrated by their construction programme, led the Germans to seek a negotiated end to the arms race. The Admiralty's new target of a 60% lead over Germany was near enough to Tirpitz's goal of cutting the British lead to 50%, but talks foundered on the question on whether to include British colonial battlecruisers in the count, as well as on non-naval matters like the German demands for recognition of ownership of [[Alsace-Lorraine]].{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=203\u2013204}}\n\nThe dreadnought race stepped up in 1910 and 1911, with Germany laying down four capital ships each year and the United Kingdom five. Tension came to a head following the [[Fleet Acts|German Naval Law of 1912]]. This proposed a fleet of 33 German battleships and battlecruisers, outnumbering the Royal Navy in home waters. To make matters worse for the United Kingdom, the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|Imperial Austro-Hungarian Navy]] was building four dreadnoughts, while the Italians had four and were building two more. Against such threats, the Royal Navy could no longer guarantee vital British interests. The United Kingdom was faced with a choice between building more battleships, withdrawing from the Mediterranean, or seeking an alliance with France. Further naval construction was unacceptably expensive at a time when [[social welfare]] provision was making calls on the budget. Withdrawing from the Mediterranean would mean a huge loss of influence, weakening British diplomacy in the region and shaking the stability of the [[British Empire]]. The only acceptable option, and the one recommended by [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]], was to break with the policies of the past and to make an arrangement with France. The French would assume responsibility for checking Italy and Austria-Hungary in the Mediterranean, while the British would protect the north coast of France. In spite of some opposition from British politicians, the Royal Navy organised itself on this basis in 1912.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=224\u2013228}}\n\nIn spite of these important strategic consequences, the 1912 Naval Law had little bearing on the battleship-force ratios. The United Kingdom responded by laying down ten new super-dreadnoughts in its 1912 and 1913 budgets\u2014ships of the ''Queen Elizabeth'' and ''Revenge'' classes, which introduced a further step-change in armament, speed and protection\u2014while Germany laid down only five, concentrating resources on its army.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n===United States===\n[[File:USS New York-1.jpg|thumb|{{USS|New York|BB-34|6}} making full steam in 1915]]\nThe American ''South Carolina''-class battleships were the first all-big-gun ships completed by one of the United Kingdom's rivals. The planning for the type had begun before ''Dreadnought'' was launched. There is some speculation that informal contacts with sympathetic Royal Navy officials influenced the US Navy design,{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=216}} but the American ship was very different.\n\nThe [[United States Congress|US Congress]] authorized the Navy to build two battleships, but of only 16,000&nbsp;tons or lower displacement. As a result, the ''South Carolina'' class were built to much tighter limits than ''Dreadnought''. To make the best use of the weight available for armament, all eight 12-inch guns were mounted along the centreline, in superfiring pairs fore and aft. This arrangement gave a broadside equal to ''Dreadnought'', but with fewer guns; this was the most efficient distribution of weapons and proved a precursor of the standard practice of future generations of battleships. The principal economy of displacement compared to ''Dreadnought'' was in propulsion; ''South Carolina'' retained triple-expansion steam engines, and could manage only {{convert|18.5|knot|km/h|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|21|knot|km/h|abbr=on}} for ''Dreadnought''.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=115, 196}} For this reason the later {{sclass-|Delaware|battleship|4}} were described by some as the US Navy's first dreadnoughts;{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=69}}{{sfn|''The New York Times'', 26 October 1915}} only a few years after their commissioning, the ''South Carolina'' class could not operate tactically with the newer dreadnoughts due to their low speed, and were forced to operate with the older pre-dreadnoughts.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=57}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=112}}\n\nThe two 10-gun, 20,500&nbsp;ton ships of the ''Delaware'' class were the first US battleships to match the speed of British dreadnoughts, but their secondary battery was \"wet\" (suffering from spray) and their bow was low in the water. An alternative 12-gun 24,000&nbsp;ton design had many disadvantages as well; the extra two guns and a lower casemate had \"hidden costs\"\u2014the two wing turrets planned would weaken the upper deck, be almost impossible to adequately protect against underwater attack, and force magazines to be located too close to the sides of the ship.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|p=69}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=113}}\n\nThe US Navy continued to expand its battlefleet, laying down two ships in most subsequent years until 1920. The US continued to use reciprocating engines as an alternative to turbines until the ''Nevada'', laid down in 1912. In part, this reflected a cautious approach to battleship-building, and in part a preference for long endurance over high maximum speed owing to the US Navy's need to operate in the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp=69\u201370}}\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Settsu.jpg|thumb|The Japanese battleship ''Settsu'']]\n\nWith their victory in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904\u20131905, the Japanese became concerned about the potential for conflict with the US. The theorist [[Sat\u014d Tetsutar\u014d]] developed the doctrine that Japan should have a battlefleet at least 70% the size of that of the US. This would enable the Japanese navy to win two decisive battles: the first early in a prospective war against the US Pacific Fleet, and the second against the US Atlantic Fleet which would inevitably be dispatched as reinforcements.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\nJapan's first priorities were to refit the pre-dreadnoughts captured from Russia and to complete ''Satsuma'' and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Aki||2}}. The ''Satsuma''s were designed before ''Dreadnought'', but financial shortages resulting from the Russo-Japanese War delayed completion and resulted in their carrying a mixed armament, so they were known as \"semi-dreadnoughts\". These were followed by a modified ''Aki''-type: {{ship|Japanese battleship|Kawachi||2}} and {{ship|Japanese battleship|Settsu||2}}. These two ships were laid down in 1909 and completed in 1912. They were armed with twelve 12-inch guns, but they were of two different models with differing barrel-lengths, meaning that they would have had difficulty controlling their fire at long ranges.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=333}}\n\n===In other countries===\n{{see also|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[File:Provence-3.jpg|thumb|{{ship|French battleship|Provence||2}}, a {{sclass-|Bretagne|battleship|2}}]]\n\nCompared to the other major naval powers, France was slow to start building dreadnoughts, instead finishing the planned ''Danton'' class of pre-dreadnoughts, laying down five in 1907 and 1908. In September 1910 the first of the {{sclass-|Courbet|battleship|4}} was laid down, making France the eleventh nation to enter the dreadnought race.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp= 214\u2013215}} In the Navy Estimates of 1911, [[Paul B\u00e9nazet]] asserted that from 1896 to 1911, France dropped from being the world's second-largest naval power to fourth; he attributed this to problems in maintenance routines and neglect.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|p=190}} The closer alliance with the United Kingdom made these reduced forces more than adequate for French needs.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=214\u2013215}}\n\nThe Italian navy had received proposals for an all-big-gun battleship from Cuniberti well before ''Dreadnought'' was launched, but it took until 1909 for Italy to lay down one of its own. The construction of ''Dante Alighieri'' was prompted by rumours of Austro-Hungarian dreadnought-building. A further five dreadnoughts of the {{sclass-|Conte di Cavour|battleship|4}} and {{sclass-|Andrea Doria|battleship|4}} class followed as Italy sought to maintain its lead over Austria-Hungary. These ships remained the core of Italian naval strength until World War II. The subsequent {{sclass-|Francesco Caracciolo|battleship|2}} were suspended (and later cancelled) on the outbreak of World War I.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\n[[File:Tegetthoff.jpg|thumb|left|Austro-Hungarian battleship [[SMS Tegetthoff (1912)|''Tegetthoff'']]]]\nIn January 1909 Austro-Hungarian admirals circulated a document calling for a fleet of four dreadnoughts. A [[constitutional crisis]] in 1909\u20131910 meant no construction could be approved. In spite of this, shipyards laid down two dreadnoughts on a speculative basis \u2013 due especially to the energetic manipulations of [[Rudolf Montecuccoli]], Chief of the Austro-Hungarian Navy \u2013 later approved along with an additional two. The resulting ships, all ''Tegetthoff'' class, were to be accompanied by a further four ships of the {{sclass-|Ersatz Monarch|battleship|4}}, but these were cancelled on the outbreak of World War I.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n[[File:The Poltava.jpg|thumb|The Baltic Fleet's dreadnought ''[[Russian battleship Poltava (1911)|Poltava]]'' in 1916.]]\n\nIn June 1909 the Imperial Russian Navy began construction of four ''Gangut'' dreadnoughts for the [[Baltic Fleet]], and in October 1911, three more {{sclass-|Imperatritsa Mariya|battleship|4}} dreadnoughts for the [[Black Sea Fleet]] were laid down. Of seven ships, only one was completed within four years of being laid down, and the ''Gangut'' ships were \"obsolescent and outclassed\" upon commissioning.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|pp= 302\u2013303}}{{sfn|Gibbons|1983|p=205}} Taking lessons from Tsushima, and influenced by Cuniberti, they ended up more closely resembling slower versions of Fisher's battlecruisers than ''Dreadnought'', and they proved badly flawed due to their smaller guns and thinner armour when compared with contemporary dreadnoughts.{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|pp= 302\u2013303}}{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=393}}\n\nSpain commissioned three ships of the {{sclass-|Espa\u00f1a|battleship|4}}, with the first laid down in 1909.

Two were completed for Brazil: {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Minas Geraes||2}} was laid down on by Armstrong ([[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]]) on 17&nbsp;April 1907, and its [[sister ship|sister]], {{ship|Brazilian battleship|S\u00e3o Paulo||2}}, followed thirteen days later at Vickers ([[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]]). Although many naval journals in Europe and the US speculated that Brazil was really acting as a proxy for one of the naval powers and would hand the ships over to them as soon as they were complete, both ships were commissioned into the [[Brazilian Navy]] in 1910.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p= 216}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|pp= 403\u2013404}}{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=320}} The third ship, ''Rio de Janeiro'', was nearly complete when [[rubber]] prices collapsed and Brazil could not afford her.

After a Royal Commission [[Dutch 1913 battleship proposal|proposed the purchase of nine dreadnoughts]] in August 1913, there were extensive debates over the need for such ships and - if they were necessary - over the actual number needed. These lasted into August 1914, when a bill authorizing funding for four dreadnoughts was finalized, but the outbreak of World War I halted the ambitious plan.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp= 450\u2013455}}{{sfn|Gardiner|Gray|1985|pp= 363\u2013364, 366}}\n\nThe Ottoman Empire ordered two dreadnoughts from British yards, ''Reshadiye'' in 1911 and ''Fatih Sultan Mehmed'' in 1914. ''Reshadiye'' was completed, and in 1913, Turkey also acquired a nearly-completed dreadnought from Brazil, which became ''Sultan Osman I''. At the start of World War I, Britain seized the two completed ships for the Royal Navy. ''Reshadiye'' and ''Sultan Osman I'' became {{HMS|Erin}} and ''Agincourt'' respectively. (''Fatih Sultan Mehmed'' was scrapped.) This greatly offended the Ottoman Empire. When two German warships, the battlecruiser {{SMS|Goeben||6}} and the cruiser {{SMS|Breslau}}, became trapped in Ottoman territory after the start of the war, Germany \"gave\" them to the Ottomans. (They remained German-crewed and under German orders.) The British seizure and the German gift proved important factors in the Ottoman Empire joining the [[Central Powers]] in October 1914.{{sfn|Greger|1993|p=252}}\n\nGreece had ordered a dreadnought from Germany, but work stopped on the outbreak of war. The main armament for the Greek ship had been ordered in the United States, and the guns consequently equipped a class of British [[Monitor (warship)|monitors]].

The British ''Orion'' class jumped an unprecedented 2,000-tons in displacement, introduced the heavier [[BL 13.5 inch /45 naval gun|13.5-inch]] (343&nbsp;mm) gun, and placed all the main armament on the centreline (hence with some turrets [[superfiring]] over others). In the four years between ''Dreadnought'' and ''Orion'', displacement had increased by 25%, and weight of broadside (the weight of ammunition that can be fired on a single bearing in one salvo) had doubled.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=126}}\n\nBritish super-dreadnoughts were joined by those built by other nations. The US Navy {{sclass-|New York|battleship|4}}, laid down in 1911, carried 14-inch (356&nbsp;mm) guns in response to the British move and this calibre became standard. In Japan, two {{sclass-|Fus\u014d|battleship|4}} super-dreadnoughts were laid down in 1912, followed by the two {{sclass-|Ise|battleship|4}} in 1914, with both classes carrying twelve 14-inch (356&nbsp;mm) guns. In 1917, the {{sclass-|Nagato|battleship|4}} was ordered, the first super-dreadnoughts to mount 16-inch guns, making them arguably the most powerful warships in the world. All were increasingly built from Japanese rather than from imported components. In France, the ''Courbet''s were followed by three super-dreadnoughts of the {{sclass-|Bretagne|battleship|4}}, carrying 340&nbsp;mm (13.4&nbsp;in) guns; another five {{sclass-|Normandie|battleship|5}}s were canceled on the outbreak of World War I.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p= 214}} The aforementioned Brazilian dreadnoughts sparked a small-scale [[South American dreadnought race|arms race in South America]], as Argentina and Chile each ordered two super-dreadnoughts from the US and the United Kingdom, respectively. Argentina's {{ship|ARA|Rivadavia||2}} and {{ship|ARA|Moreno||2}} had a main armament equaling that of their Brazilian counterparts, but were much heavier and carried thicker armour. The British purchased both of Chile's battleships on the outbreak of the First World War.

The new [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch (381-mm) gun]] gave greater firepower in spite of the loss of a turret, and there were a thicker armour belt and improved underwater protection. The class had a 25-knot (46-km/h - 28.5 mph) design speed, and they were considered the first [[fast battleship]]s.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=140\u2013144}}\n\nThe design weakness of super-dreadnoughts, which distinguished them from post-1918 vessels, was armour disposition. Their design emphasized the vertical armour protection needed in short-range battles, where shells would strike the sides of the ship, and assumed that an outer plate of armour would detonate any incoming shells so that crucial internal structures such as turret bases needed only light protection against splinters. This was in spite of the fact that these ships could engage the enemy at {{convert|20000|yard|m|abbr= on}}, ranges where the shells would descend at angles of up to thirty degrees (\"plunging fire\") and so could drop behind the outer plate and strike the internal structures directly. Post-war designs typically had 5 to 6&nbsp;inches (130 to 150&nbsp;mm) of deck armour laid across the top of single, much thicker vertical plates to defend against this. The concept of [[zone of immunity]] became a major part of the thinking behind battleship design. Lack of underwater protection was also a weakness of these pre-World War I designs, which originated before the use of torpedoes became widespread.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=75\u201379}}\n\nThe United States Navy designed its '[[Standard type battleship]]s', beginning with the ''Nevada'' class, with long-range engagements and plunging fire in mind; the first of these was laid down in 1912, four years before the [[Battle of Jutland]] taught the dangers of long-range fire to European navies. Important features of the standard battleships were \"all or nothing\" armour and \"raft\" construction\u2014based on a design philosophy which held that only those parts of the ship worth giving the thickest possible protection were worth armouring at all, and that the resulting armoured \"raft\" should contain enough reserve buoyancy to keep the entire ship afloat in the event the unarmoured bow and stern were thoroughly punctured and flooded. This design proved its worth in the 1942 [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], when an ill-timed turn by {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} silhouetted her to Japanese guns. In spite of receiving 26 hits, her armoured raft remained untouched and she remained both afloat and operational at the end of action.{{sfn|Friedman|1985|pp= 202\u2013203}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==In action==\n[[File:HMS Audacious crew take to lifeboats.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Audacious|1912|6}} sinks after hitting a [[naval mine|mine]], October 1914]]\n{{Main article|Naval Warfare of World War I}}\n\nThe First World War saw no decisive engagements between battlefleets to compare with Tsushima.

By the end of October, British strategy and tactics in the North Sea had changed to reduce the risk of U-boat attack.{{sfn|Massie|2005|pp=127\u2013145}} Jutland was the only major clash of dreadnought battleship fleets in history, and the German plan for the battle relied on U-boat attacks on the British fleet; and the escape of the German fleet from the superior British firepower was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers closing on British battleships, causing them to turn away to avoid the threat of torpedo attack. Further near-misses from submarine attacks on battleships led to growing concern in the Royal Navy about the vulnerability of battleships.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=245\u2013248}}\n\nFor the German part, the High Seas Fleet determined not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines, and since submarines were more needed for commerce raiding, the fleet stayed in port for much of the remainder of the war.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=247\u2013249}} Other theatres showed the role of small craft in damaging or destroying dreadnoughts. The two Austrian dreadnoughts lost in November 1918 were casualties of Italian torpedo boats and [[frogmen]].\n\n==Battleship building from 1914 onwards==\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Hamburg port NARA-68155073 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Unfinished {{sclass-|Bayern|battleship|1}} ''W\u00fcrttemberg'' (right) and the {{sclass-|Mackensen|battlecruiser|1}} ''Prinz Eitel Friedrich'' in Hamburg after the war, in about 1920]]  \n\nThe outbreak of World War I largely halted the dreadnought arms race as funds and technical resources were diverted to more pressing priorities. The foundries which produced battleship guns were dedicated instead to the production of land-based artillery, and shipyards were flooded with orders for small ships. The weaker naval powers engaged in the Great War\u2014France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia\u2014suspended their battleship programmes entirely. The United Kingdom and Germany continued building battleships and battlecruisers but at a reduced pace.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=61}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Fisher returned to his old post as First Sea Lord; he had been created 1st Baron Fisher in 1909, taking the motto ''Fear God and dread nought''. This, combined with a government moratorium on battleship building, meant a renewed focus on the battlecruiser. Fisher resigned in 1915 following arguments about the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] with the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill.\n\nThe final units of the ''Revenge'' and ''Queen Elizabeth'' classes were completed, though the last two battleships of the ''Revenge'' class were re-ordered as battlecruisers of the {{sclass-|Renown|battlecruiser|4}}. Fisher followed these ships with the even more extreme [[Courageous-class battlecruiser|''Courageous'' class]]; very fast and heavily armed ships with minimal, {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=2}} armour, called 'large light cruisers' to get around a Cabinet ruling against new capital ships. Fisher's mania for speed culminated in his suggestion for {{HMS|Incomparable}}, a mammoth, lightly armoured battlecruiser.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=61\u201362}}\n\nIn Germany, two units of the pre-war {{sclass-|Bayern|battleship|4}} were gradually completed, but the other two laid down were still unfinished by the end of the War. [[SMS Hindenburg|''Hindenburg'']], also laid down before the start of the war, was completed in 1917. The {{sclass-|Mackensen|battlecruiser|4}}, designed in 1914\u20131915, were begun but never finished.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=277\u2013284}}\n\n===Post-war===\n{{see also|List of battleships of the Second World War}}\nIn spite of the lull in battleship building during the World War, the years 1919\u20131922 saw the threat of a renewed naval arms race between the United Kingdom, Japan, and the US. The Battle of Jutland exerted a huge influence over the designs produced in this period. The first ships which fit into this picture are the British {{sclass2-|Admiral|battlecruiser|4}}, designed in 1916. Jutland finally persuaded the Admiralty that lightly armoured battlecruisers were too vulnerable, and therefore the final design of the Admirals incorporated much-increased armour, increasing displacement to 42,000 tons. The initiative in creating the new arms race lay with the Japanese and United States navies. The United States [[Naval Act of 1916|Naval Appropriations Act of 1916]] authorized the construction of 156 new ships, including ten battleships and six battlecruisers. For the first time, the United States Navy was threatening the British global lead.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=62\u201363}} This programme was started slowly (in part because of a desire to learn lessons from Jutland), and never fulfilled entirely. The new American ships (the ''Colorado''-class battleships, ''South'' ''Dakota''-class battleships  and {{sclass-|Lexington|battlecruiser|2}}<nowiki/>s), took a qualitative step beyond the British ''Queen Elizabeth'' class and ''Admiral'' classes by mounting 16-inch guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=63}}\n\n[[File:USS California (BB-44) - NH 82114.jpg|thumb|left|The American {{USS|California|BB-44|2}}, one of two {{sclass-|Tennessee|battleship|0}} battleships, steaming at high speed in 1921]]\nAt the same time, the Imperial Japanese Navy was finally gaining authorization for its [[eight-eight fleet|'eight-eight battlefleet']]. The ''Nagato'' class, authorized in 1916, carried eight 16-inch guns like their American counterparts. The next year's naval bill authorized two more battleships and two more battlecruisers. The battleships, which became the {{sclass-|Tosa|battleship|4}}, were to carry ten 16-inch guns. The battlecruisers, the {{sclass-|Amagi|battlecruiser|4}}, also carried ten 16-inch guns and were designed to be capable of 30 knots, capable of beating both the British Admiral- and the US&nbsp;Navy's ''Lexington''-class battlecruisers.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=171}}\n\nMatters took a further turn for the worse in 1919 when [[Woodrow Wilson]] proposed a further expansion of the United States Navy, asking for funds for an additional ten battleships and six battlecruisers in addition to the completion of the 1916 programme (the {{sclass-|South Dakota|battleship (1920)|4}} not yet started). In response, the [[Diet of Japan]] finally agreed to the completion of the 'eight-eight fleet', incorporating a further four battleships.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=174}} These ships, the {{sclass-|Kii|battleship|4}} would displace 43,000 tons; the next design, the {{sclass2-|Number 13|battleship|4}}, would have carried {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|p=356}} Many in the Japanese navy were still dissatisfied, calling for an 'eight-eight-eight' fleet with 24 modern battleships and battlecruisers.\n\nThe British, impoverished by World War I, faced the prospect of slipping behind the US and Japan. No ships had been begun since the Admiral class, and of those only {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} had been completed. A June 1919 Admiralty plan outlined a post-war fleet with 33 battleships and eight battlecruisers, which could be built and sustained for \u00a3171 million a year (approximately \u00a3{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|171000000|1919|r=-4}}|0}} today); only \u00a384 million was available. The Admiralty then demanded, as an absolute minimum, a further eight battleships.{{sfn|Kennedy|1983|pp=274\u2013275}} These would have been the [[G3 battlecruiser]]s, with 16-inch guns and high speed, and the N3-class battleships, with {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=3}} guns.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=173\u2013174}} Its navy severely limited by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Germany did not participate in this three-way naval building competition. Most of the German dreadnought fleet was scuttled at [[Scapa Flow]] by its crews in 1919; the remainder were handed over as war prizes.{{efn|name=war prizes}}{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|1990|p={{Page needed|date=September 2010}}}}\n\nThe major naval powers avoided the cripplingly expensive expansion programmes by negotiating the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922. The Treaty laid out a list of ships, including most of the older dreadnoughts and almost all the newer ships under construction, which were to be scrapped or otherwise put out of use. It furthermore declared a 'building holiday' during which no new battleships or battlecruisers were to be laid down, save for the British ''Nelson'' class. The ships which survived the treaty, including the most modern super-dreadnoughts of all three navies, formed the bulk of international capital ship strength through the 1920s and 1930s and, with some modernisation, into World War II. The ships built under the terms of the Washington Treaty (and subsequently the London Treaties in 1930 and 1936) to replace outdated vessels were known as treaty battleships.{{sfn|Breyer|1973|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nFrom this point on, the term 'dreadnought' became less widely used. Most pre-dreadnought battleships were scrapped or [[Hulk (ship)|hulked]] after World War I,{{efn|name=hulks}} so the term 'dreadnought' became less necessary.\n\n==Notes==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{notes\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = biggun\n| The concept of an all-big-gun ship had been in development for several years before ''Dreadnought''{{'}}s construction.

This, therefore, needs accurate estimation (prediction) of the range to the target, which was one of the main problems of fire control. On warships, these problems are complicated by the fact that the ship will naturally roll in the water. {{harvnb|Friedman|1978|p=99}}.\n}}\n\n{{efn\n| name = velocity\n| Lighter projectiles have a lower ratio of mass to frontal surface area, and so their velocity is reduced more quickly by air resistance.\n}}\n\n{{efn\n| name = Mississippi\n| See {{harvnb|Friedman|1985|p=51}}, for discussion of alternative proposals for the {{sclass-|Mississippi|battleship|4}}.\n}}\n\n{{efn\n| name = uniform armament\n| Additional advantage is gained by having a uniform armament.

Using the fact that a Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) distribution is the same as an Exp(1) distribution, and noting the method of [[exponential distribution#Generating exponential variates|generating exponential variables]], we conclude that if ''U'' is [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on (0, 1], then \u2212ln(''U'') is distributed Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) (i.e. [[inverse transform sampling]]). Now, using the \"''\u03b1''-addition\" property of gamma distribution, we expand this result:\n\n: <math>-\\sum_{k=1}^n \\ln U_k \\sim \\Gamma(n, 1)</math>\n\nwhere ''U''<sub>''k''</sub> are all uniformly distributed on (0, 1] and [[statistical independence|independent]].

Using the fact that a Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) distribution is the same as an Exp(1) distribution, and noting the method of [[exponential distribution#Generating exponential variates|generating exponential variables]], we conclude that if ''U'' is [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on (0, 1], then \u2212ln(''U'') is distributed Gamma(1,&nbsp;1) (i.e. [[inverse transform sampling]]). Now, using the \"''\u03b1''-addition\" property of gamma distribution, we expand this result:\n\n: <math>-\\sum_{k=1}^n \\ln U_k \\sim \\Gamma(n, 1)</math>\n\nwhere ''U''<sub>''k''</sub> are all uniformly distributed on (0, 1] and [[statistical independence|independent]].

With the CBC and American broadcasters [[Metromedia]] and [[Kaiser Broadcasting]] handling distribution and co-production, the series was produced in [[Ottawa]] at [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] affiliate [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV]] and aired for 39 weeks, presenting three separate 13-week story arcs.\n\n== Plot summary ==\nThe series\u2019 protagonist is billionaire Jean Paul Desmond, a tragic character whose absolute refusal to accept the death of his beloved wife Erica on the remote Caribbean island of Maljardin leads him to a blasphemous defiance of God. He strikes an ill-fated bargain with the spirit of his sinister ancestor, Jacques Eloi des Mondes, which drives the story for the series\u2019 first thirteen weeks. Other characters in the cast include Raxl and Quito, a pair of devoted and mysterious servants; Holly Marshall, a runaway heiress; Reverend Matthew Dawson, a conflicted minister; Evangeline \"Vangie\" Abot, a local mystic; Tim Stanton, a struggling artist; Erica's sister Allison Carr, a female doctor; Dan Forrest, an outraged business associate; and Holly's mother Elizabeth Marshall, a social-climbing widow.\n\nAfter its sixty-fifth episode, ''Strange Paradise'' was substantially re-tooled, jettisoning the majority of the cast and moving its setting from the Caribbean to Desmond Hall, the family's ancestral home in North America. The stories presented in this overhauled version of the series involve the \"mark of death\" driving Jean Paul to murder, the disappearance of Jean Paul's brother Philip, the machinations of a witches\u2019 coven against the Desmonds, the influence of the Serpent God at Desmond Hall, and ultimately the final showdown with the powers of darkness.  The unifying thread which binds all of these elements is Jean Paul's struggle to lift the curse which plagues the Desmond family.  Additional characters in the Desmond Hall cast include Jean Paul's kindly cousin Ada Thaxton and her brooding son Cort, Laszlo Thaxton, Ada's conniving second husband, Irene Hatter, the town gossip and a witch, Emily Blair, a shy researcher invited by Philip, Susan O'Clair, whose destiny and those who are around her draw her to Desmond Hall, Helena Raleigh, an actress and Erica's doppelganger, and Julien Desmond, Ada's long-lost father.\n\n==Production==\nThe ratings for ''Strange Paradise'' were rocky from the start, leading to a production shake-up early in the series' run. By October 8, 1969\u2014just a month after its American debut\u2014the show was dropped by [[Metromedia]] stations in New York and Los Angeles, and moved into early afternoon by [[Kaiser Broadcasting|Kaiser]] stations in Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland and Detroit.<ref name=\"overhaul\">{{cite news|title='Paradise' Heads For Overhaul As N.Y, L.A. Drop It|publisher=Variety|date=October 8, 1969}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the poor ratings, writer Ian Martin and executive producer Jerry Layton left the show after the first nine weeks of production. Layton was replaced by [[Robert Costello]], who left his role as producer on ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', an inspiration for ''Strange Paradise''. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported on the shakeup: \"Krantz prexy Steven Krantz says the show will be beefed up with a faster pace and made 'generally better'. We will have a hit show out of this,\" he says, drawing a parallel with the N.Y. Mets, who started the season slow but...\"<ref name=\"overhaul\"/> (At the time of this quote, the once-lowly Mets had just won the [[National League Championship Series]], and were on their way to the 1969 [[World Series]], which they would also win.)\n\nMartin had written the scripts for the first nine weeks, and after his departure, writers George Salverson, Ron Chudley and James Elward were quickly brought in to keep the continuing story afloat for a couple of weeks while a further writing staff was assembled. Cornelius Crane finished the first 13-week arc. Martin's story was scuttled so quickly that there was no time to change the promotional blurbs, which were sent out some weeks in advance to newspapers and local TV schedule listings. As a result, around November\u2013December 1969, a number of U.S. publications carried daily descriptions of Ian Martin episodes which were never actually produced.\n\nAt the start of the second 13-week arc, the show changed focus, moving from the Caribbean island of Maljardin to Desmond Hall. Writer Cornelius Crane was joined by [[Ron Sproat]], a former writer for ''Dark Shadows''. Joseph Caldwell (also a former ''Dark Shadows'' writer) and John R. Melmer also wrote a few episodes during this period.\n\nFor the third and final 13-week arc, Crane left the writing team, and Sproat was joined by television neophyte [[Harding Lemay]] for four weeks. Despite his inexperience, Lemay became the sole writer for the last nine weeks of the show.\n\n== Cast ==\nCanadian actor [[Colin Fox (actor)|Colin Fox]] was chosen to play the dual roles of Jean Paul and Jacques. Fox has gone on to distinguish himself in numerous roles on stage, screen and television, with memorable turns in productions ranging from Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'' to ''[[Psi Factor: Chronicles of the Paranormal]]''. Other players in the Maljardin cast include [[Cosette Lee]] as Raxl, Kurt Schiegl as the hulking bald mute Quito, Sylvia Feigel as Holly, Dan MacDonald as Rev. Matt Dawson, Jon Granik as Dan, Paisley Maxwell as Elizabeth, Dawn Greenhalgh as Allison and Angela Roland as Vangie.  Of particular note among this original cast are Bruce Gray as Tim  and Tudi Wiggins as Erica, who went on to appear in a number of further daytime dramas and feature films.\n\nThe series' only original cast members to make the jump from Maljardin to ''Strange Paradise'''s Desmond Hall episodes were Colin Fox, [[Cosette Lee]], Kurt Schiegl, Sylvia Feigel, and Tudi Wiggins (though only Fox and Lee remained with the cast to the series\u2019 final episode).  New performers cast as Desmond Hall regulars include Neil Dainard as Phillip, Pat Moffat as Irene, Jack Creley as Laslo, Peg Dixon and Jan Campbell as Ada, David Wells as Cort, Lucy Warner as Emily Blair, Vivian Reis as Agatha Pruitt, Trudy Young (who played Holly's friend Dinah in the pilot episode) as Susan and Robert Goodier as Julien Desmond.\n\n== Reruns and later distribution ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}\nAlmost immediately following the production of ''Strange Paradise'''s final episode (while the series was still in the final weeks of its original CBC broadcast run), the serial was picked up for syndicated reruns in various markets in the U.S.  Thus, it was the first soap opera to be marketed in reruns. Also in 1993, ''Strange Paradise'' found new life in the home video market, when Centaur Distribution began issuing the series on videocassette. Eventually, 21 volumes were released on [[VHS]], encompassing the first 105 installments of the series, before the project folded.  Since that time, the rights to ''Strange Paradise'' have been purchased by a group called Nihali Entertainment but, to date,{{When|date=March 2014}} no [[DVD]] release of the series has been forthcoming.  However the show has remained available for broadcast in syndication since its premiere in 1969, most recently{{When|date=March 2014}} surfacing on Canada\u2019s [[Drive-In Classics]] just in time for the series\u2019 35th anniversary north of the border. It aired on Drive-In Classics from October 4, 2004 to October 1, 2007.\n\n== Influences on other projects ==\n''Strange Paradise'' has had at least a small life outside of its 195 serialized episodes.  Between December 1969 and August 1970, publisher Paperback Library issued three TV tie-in novels authored by Gothic romance writer Dorothy Daniels:<ref>[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?178797]</ref> ''Strange Paradise'';<ref>[http://www.romancewiki.com/Strange_Paradise]</ref> ''Island of Evil''<ref>[http://www.romancewiki.com/Island_Of_Evil_-_Dorothy_Daniels]</ref> and ''Raxl, Voodoo Priestess''.<ref>[http://www.romancewiki.com/Raxl,_Voodoo_Priestess]</ref>\n\nBetween 1974 and 1980, Ian Martin contributed numerous scripts to Himan Brown\u2019s ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', and many of those radio plays contained elements recognizably taken directly from his earlier writings on ''Strange Paradise''.  Chief among these efforts were his August 7, 1975, script ''To Die Is Forever'' (which is a virtual re-telling of the Maljardin story), ''Here Goes the Bride'' (February 4, 1974) and ''The Spectral Bride'' (September 26, 1974).  Around 1979, Martin began adapting some of his ''CBS Radio Mystery Theater'' scripts to novel form for publisher Popular Library, and one of the scripts chosen for this treatment was ''Here Goes the Bride''.  The novel saw publication in 1980 under the title ''Shadow over Seventh Heaven'', credited to Martin's pseudonym Joen Arliss. During the adaptation process he excised many of the elements which linked his original script with ''Strange Paradise''; however, his earlier Joen Arliss novel ''Nightmare's Nest'' does display a few of Martin's ''Strange Paradise'' influences.\n\nThe birth of the Internet has given rise to new outlets of influence for ''Strange Paradise''.  Online, a Yahoo Group has been founded, enabling fans of the series to share thoughts and messages. Likewise, individual fans have established websites to document the series and promote its fandom.\n\n== Production notes ==\nAn early working title for the production was ''The Garden of Evil'' (a reference to the English translation of Maljardin, the name of the island upon which the series is set).\n\n''Strange Paradise'' was marketed to potential broadcasters via the pilot episode shot in May 1969 and an accompanying pitch reel of related scenes, referred to by Krantz Films\u2019 staff as \"the Vignettes\".  A few actors and characters were dropped or altered after the filming of these initial promotional pieces.  Actor Paul Harding, who played the role of Dan Forrest in the pilot, declined to continue with the series and was replaced by Jon Granik.  Likewise, the part of Jacques Eloi des Mondes\u2019 wife Huaco was originated by actress Patricia Collins, but she did not join the series\u2019 regular cast.  Perhaps most significantly, actress Nonnie Griffin portrayed the pilot's Beryl Forbes, a character slated to be the Conjure Woman (a role important to the series).  However, Griffin declined to participate in the continuing series, and her character was dropped entirely.  Instead, the role of the Conjure Woman fell to Vangie Abbott, as portrayed by actress Angela Roland.\n\nBetween October 2001 and January 2002, the [[Nepean Museum]] near Ottawa, presented an exhibit celebrating the history of CJOH-TV.  Among the items displayed were props and costumes from ''Strange Paradise'', including cast photos, set designs, shooting scripts and the original conjure doll.\n\nExterior shots of Maljardin Mansion were filmed at [[Casa Loma]].<ref>http://www.strangeparadise.net/maljardintrivia.html</ref>\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Television|Canada}}\n* {{IMDb title|0244930|Strange Paradise}}\n* [http://www.tv.com/show/14192/summary.html ''Strange Paradise''] at TV.com\n* [http://pulpanddagger.com/movies/s5_b.html ''Strange Paradise''] at The Great Canadian Guide to the Movies & TV\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140311070603/http://www.film.queensu.ca/CBC/Sta.html ''Strange Paradise''] at Queen's Film & Media (archived)\n* [http://www.tv.com/show/14192/summary.html ''Strange Paradise''] fan site with episode guide\n\n[[Category:1960s Canadian drama television series]]\n[[Category:1970s Canadian drama television series]]\n[[Category:CBC Television shows]]\n[[Category:Canadian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Canadian fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:Canadian horror fiction television series]]\n[[Category:1969 Canadian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1970 Canadian television series endings]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television shows set on islands]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft in television]]\n[[Category:Canadian supernatural television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox television\n| show_name = Strange Paradise\n| image = File:Strange Paradise television show photo.jpg\n| caption = Strange Paradise\n| runtime = 30 minutes\n| creator = Jerry Layton<br />Ian Martin\n| starring = Colin Fox<br />Tudi Wiggins<br />Sylvia Feigel<br />Cosette Lee<br />Kurt Scheigl<br />Trudy Young<br />Lucy Warner<br />David Wells<br />Neil Dainard<br />Pat Moffatt\n| country = Canada\n| company = [[Krantz Films]]\n| network = [[CBC Television]]<br />[[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] ''(US)''\n| first_aired = 1969\n| last_aired = 1970\n| num_episodes = 195\n}}\n'''''Strange Paradise''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] occult-supernatural [[soap opera]] of 195 episodes, initially launched in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in the United States on September 8, 1969, and later broadcast on [[CBC Television]] from October 20, 1969, to July 22, 1970.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/412/mode/2up|accessdate=22 March 2020|page=412}}</ref> The production was the brainchild of producer [[Steve Krantz]], in an attempt to capitalize on the phenomenal success of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s daytime serial ''[[Dark Shadows]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Schemering |first1=Christopher |title=[[The Soap Opera Encyclopedia (Schemering book)|The Soap Opera Encyclopedia]] |date=1987 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=0-345-35344-7 |edition=2nd |page=223}}</ref> To develop the series, Krantz hired actor-writer Ian Martin and veteran TV and radio producer Jerry Layton, both of whom were given screen credit for the creation of ''Strange Paradise''.

After Bijelo Dugme split up, he started composing film scores. Among his better known film scores are three of [[Emir Kusturica]]'s films (''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'', ''[[Arizona Dream]]'', and ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]''). For Time of the Gypsies, Bregovi\u0107 won a [[Golden Arena for Best Film Music|Golden Arena Award]] at the [[Pula Film Festival]] in 1990, among other awards. He had also composed for the [[Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' and the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]]-entered film ''[[The Serpent's Kiss]]''.\n\nBregovi\u0107, during his five-decade long career, has composed for critically acclaimed singers, including [[Sezen Aksu]], [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[\u0160aban Bajramovi\u0107]], [[George Dalaras]] and [[Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Sarajevo]], [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|PR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]] to a [[Croats|Croat]] father Franjo Bregovi\u0107 and [[Serbs|Serb]] mother Borka Peri\u0161i\u0107,<ref>[http://www.yurope.com/nasa-borba/arhiva/Maj97/1805/1805_15.HTM Strogo kontrolisano disidentstvo];''Na\u0161a Borba'', 18 May 1997</ref><ref>http://www.goranbregovic.rs/biography/</ref> Goran grew up with two younger siblings \u2014 sister Dajana and brother Predrag. Their father was from the Croatian region of [[Zagorje]], specifically [[Sveti Petar \u010cvrstec]] village near [[Kri\u017eevci, Croatia|Kri\u017eevci]], while their mother was born in [[Virovitica]] to parents that had shortly before her birth arrived in the nearby village of [[\u010cemernica, Croatia|\u010cemernica]], settling there from the village of [[Kazanci]] near [[Gacko]] in eastern [[Herzegovina]]. Goran's maternal grandfather, fought in the [[Royal Serbian Army]] at the [[Macedonian front|Salonica Front]] during [[World War I]] and as a reward received land in [[Slavonia]] where he soon moved his family.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\">{{cite news|last1=Gruji\u0107|first1=Nenad|last2=Nik\u010devi\u0107|first2=Tamara|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=1090566|title=Cigani, juri\u0161!|agency=[[Vreme]]|date=27 December 2012|accessdate=6 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nGoran's parents met shortly after [[World War II]] in Virovitica where his mother Borka lived and his father Franjo (who fought on the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] side during the war) attended a [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) military school.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Franjo Bregovi\u0107 soon got his first job, teaching [[ballistics]] at a military school in Sarajevo, so the couple that at the time moved there.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Goran, their first child, was born in 1950 in Sarajevo.\n\nGoran was 10 years old when his parents divorced. In later interviews, he mentioned his father's alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of their marriage.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Soon after the split, his father moved to [[Livno]], taking Goran's younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran's brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/>\n\nGoran played violin in a [[music school]]. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran's mother bought him his first guitar in his early teens. Bregovi\u0107 wanted to enroll in a fine arts high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother's decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long.\n\n==Early career==\nUpon entering high school, teenage Bregovi\u0107 joined the school band Izohipse where he began on bass guitar. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior \u2013 he crashed into a school-owned [[Mercedes-Benz]]). Bregovi\u0107 then entered grammar school and its school band Be\u0161tije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing [[folk music]] in a [[kafana]] in [[Konjic]], working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.\n\nSpotting him at a Be\u0161tije gig in 1969, [[\u017deljko Bebek]] invited eighteen-year-old Bregovi\u0107 to play bass guitar in his band [[Kodeksi]], which Goran gladly accepted.\n\n===Kodeksi===\n{{main|Kodeksi}}\nEventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregovi\u0107 moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregovi\u0107, \u017deljko Bebek, [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]]. All of them would eventually become members of [[Bijelo Dugme]] at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]]. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in the departure of \u017deljko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in [[Naples]] and took them back to [[Sarajevo]].\n\n===Jutro===\n{{main|Jutro}}\nThen, in the autumn of 1971, Bregovi\u0107 enrolled at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]] left for London, so Bregovi\u0107 formed a band with Nuno Arnautali\u0107 called [[Jutro]] (Morning), which Red\u017ei\u0107 soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to [[Bijelo Dugme]] (\"White Button\").\n\n==Bijelo Dugme==\n[[File:Bregovic - portret - 1980.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in 1980 during Bijelo Dugme's new wave phase.]]\n{{main|Bijelo Dugme}}\nFrom 1974 until 1989, Bregovi\u0107 played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind [[Bijelo Dugme]] (''White Button''). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. From the get-go, he established himself as the band's undisputed leader as well as its public face in the Yugoslav print and electronic media. \n\nOver the band's fifteen-year run, in addition to their enormous popularity at home, led by Bregovi\u0107, Bijelo Dugme made several attempts at expanding their prominence abroad. In late 1975, while recording their second album ''[[\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu]]'' in [[London]], they additionally recorded an [[English language]] track called \"Playing the Part\" (translated version of their [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] track \"\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu\", itself an uncredited cover of [[Argent (band)|Argent]]'s 1972 track \"I Am the Dance of Ages\") that was packaged as a [[promo single]] for English music journalists. Never officially released for mass distribution, the track quickly fell into oblivion. \n\nBijelo Dugme had somewhat better luck with touring abroad, which almost entirely took place in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries as part of their respective [[cultural exchange]] programs with SFR Yugoslavia. The band briefly toured the [[Polish People's Republic]] during April 1977, a 9-concert leg as part of the tour in support of their third album ''[[Eto!

These included releasing a [[Goran Bregovi\u0107 (album)|solo record]] in 1976 and composing two movie soundtracks \u2014 1977's ''Leptirov oblak'' and 1979's ''Li\u010dne stvari''. \n\nHe also tried his hand at music production, producing [[Idoli]]'s 1980 seven-inch single \"[[Malj\u010diki]]\" / \"[[Retko te vi\u0111am sa devojkama]]\" and co-producing, alongside [[Kornelije Kova\u010d]], [[Zdravko \u010coli\u0107]]'s fourth studio album ''[[Malo poja\u010daj radio]]'' in 1981. \n\nBregovi\u0107 furthermore made guest appearances on guitar on various studio recordings by different Yugoslav pop, folk, and rock acts: [[Neda Ukraden]]'s track \"Tri djevojke\" (together with Bijelo Dugme bandmates [[Vlado Pravdi\u0107]] and [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]]) off her 1976 album ''Ko me to od nekud doziva'', [[Hanka Paldum]]'s track \"Zbog tebe\" off her 1980 album ''[[\u010ce\u017enja (album)|\u010ce\u017enja]]'', \"Ne da/ne nego i/ili\" track by [[Kozmetika]] off their 1983 [[Kozmetika (album)|eponymous album]], Valentino's track \"Pazi na ritam\" off their 1983 debut album ''ValentiNo1'', [[Riblja \u010corba]]'s track \"Disko mi\u0161i\u0107\" off their 1985 album ''[[Istina]]'', [[Dino Merlin|Merlin]]'s 1986 album ''[[Te\u0161ko meni sa tobom (a jo\u0161 te\u017ee bez tebe)]]'', Mjese\u010dari track \"Gdje izlazi\u0161 ovih dana\" off their 1988 album ''One \u0161etaju od 1 do 2'', and [[Piloti (band)|Piloti]] track \"Tiho, tiho\" off their 1990 album ''Nek te Bog \u010duva za mene''.\n\nDuring his time leading Bijelo Dugme, Bregovi\u0107 also became involved in the financial and organizational side of the [[music industry|music business]]. In 1984, dissatisfied with their respective financial terms at the state-owned [[Jugoton]] label, Bijelo Dugme bandleader Bregovi\u0107 and one of Yugoslavia's biggest pop stars Zdravko \u010coli\u0107 got together to establish their own music label Kamarad, which, via a deal with state-owned [[Diskoton]] and later another newly-established private label [[Komuna (company)|Komuna]], would end up co-releasing all of Bijelo Dugme's subsequent studio albums including three of \u010coli\u0107's studio albums from 1984 until 1990.<ref name=\"kamarad\">{{cite news|last=Predi\u0107|first=Zoran|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2014/11/kako-su-zbog-kamarada-zdravka-colica-i.html|title=\u010coli\u0107 i Bregovi\u0107 protiv Jugotona|agency=''RTV revija''|date=November 1984|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref> Considered an unusual move at the time in a socialist country with nearly across-the-board public ownership that had just recently began allowing certain modes of private entrepreneurship, starting a privately-owned record label, combined with Bregovi\u0107's and \u010coli\u0107's high public profile in Yugoslavia, got them both a lot of additional attention in the country's press.

Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by [[Iggy Pop]]) for Emir's next film ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]]'s ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|Queen Margot]]'' was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The next year's [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] award went to ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', for which Goran Bregovi\u0107 composed the music.\n\nIn 1997, he worked with Turkish singer [[Sezen Aksu]] on her album ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn ve Cenaze'' (''Wedding and Funeral''). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.\n\nHe made an album with [[George Dalaras]] in 1999 named ''[[Thessaloniki \u2013 Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes]]''. In the same year, Bregovi\u0107 recorded an album called ''[[Kayah i Bregovi\u0107]]'' (Kayah and Bregovi\u0107) with popular Polish singer [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]] which sold over 700,000 copies in [[Poland]] (seven times platinum record).\n\nIn 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, [[Krzysztof Krawczyk (singer)|Krzysztof Krawczyk]], titled \"Daj mi drugie \u017cycie\" (\"Give Me Second Life\").\n\nIn 2005, Bregovi\u0107 took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.\n\nA number of works created by Bregovi\u0107 can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]], most notably \"\u0110ur\u0111evdan\". The film itself actually features more Bregovi\u0107 samples than the soundtrack. \n\nTwo musical numbers by Bregovi\u0107, \"Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke,\" and \"Gas, Gas\" were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian telenovela, ''[[Salve Jorge]]'', on the television network [[Rede Globo]].<ref name=\"Salve Jorge Tracklist\">{{cite web|title=Salve Jorge (Trilha Sonora da Novela) [|url=http://musica.com.br/trilhas-sonoras/salve-jorge.html|publisher=Musica.com.br|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Wedding and Funeral Orchestra===\n[[Image:Goran Bregovic in Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in concert in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia on 3 October 2007.]]\nFor many years Bregovi\u0107 performed with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from [[Belgrade]], women wearing traditional Bulgarian costumes, and [[Romani people|Roma]] singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.\n\nSince 1998, and until about 2012, Bregovi\u0107 has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Wedding and Funeral Orchestra.

The other part of the brass band \u2013 including bass and percussions \u2013 were being played from his computer.

In later interviews, he mentioned his father's alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of their marriage.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Soon after the split, his father moved to [[Livno]], taking Goran's younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran's brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/>\n\nGoran played violin in a [[music school]]. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran's mother bought him his first guitar in his early teens. Bregovi\u0107 wanted to enroll in a fine arts high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother's decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long.\n\n==Early career==\nUpon entering high school, teenage Bregovi\u0107 joined the school band Izohipse where he began on bass guitar. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior \u2013 he crashed into a school-owned [[Mercedes-Benz]]). Bregovi\u0107 then entered grammar school and its school band Be\u0161tije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing [[folk music]] in a [[kafana]] in [[Konjic]], working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.\n\nSpotting him at a Be\u0161tije gig in 1969, [[\u017deljko Bebek]] invited eighteen-year-old Bregovi\u0107 to play bass guitar in his band [[Kodeksi]], which Goran gladly accepted.\n\n===Kodeksi===\n{{main|Kodeksi}}\nEventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregovi\u0107 moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregovi\u0107, \u017deljko Bebek, [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]]. All of them would eventually become members of [[Bijelo Dugme]] at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]]. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in the departure of \u017deljko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in [[Naples]] and took them back to [[Sarajevo]].\n\n===Jutro===\n{{main|Jutro}}\nThen, in the autumn of 1971, Bregovi\u0107 enrolled at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]] left for London, so Bregovi\u0107 formed a band with Nuno Arnautali\u0107 called [[Jutro]] (Morning), which Red\u017ei\u0107 soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to [[Bijelo Dugme]] (\"White Button\").\n\n==Bijelo Dugme==\n[[File:Bregovic - portret - 1980.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in 1980 during Bijelo Dugme's new wave phase.]]\n{{main|Bijelo Dugme}}\nFrom 1974 until 1989, Bregovi\u0107 played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind [[Bijelo Dugme]] (''White Button''). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. From the get-go, he established himself as the band's undisputed leader as well as its public face in the Yugoslav print and electronic media. \n\nOver the band's fifteen-year run, in addition to their enormous popularity at home, led by Bregovi\u0107, Bijelo Dugme made several attempts at expanding their prominence abroad. In late 1975, while recording their second album ''[[\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu]]'' in [[London]], they additionally recorded an [[English language]] track called \"Playing the Part\" (translated version of their [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] track \"\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu\", itself an uncredited cover of [[Argent (band)|Argent]]'s 1972 track \"I Am the Dance of Ages\") that was packaged as a [[promo single]] for English music journalists. Never officially released for mass distribution, the track quickly fell into oblivion. \n\nBijelo Dugme had somewhat better luck with touring abroad, which almost entirely took place in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries as part of their respective [[cultural exchange]] programs with SFR Yugoslavia. The band briefly toured the [[Polish People's Republic]] during April 1977, a 9-concert leg as part of the tour in support of their third album ''[[Eto!

His first project was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'' (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by [[Iggy Pop]]) for Emir's next film ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]]'s ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|Queen Margot]]'' was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The next year's [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] award went to ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', for which Goran Bregovi\u0107 composed the music.\n\nIn 1997, he worked with Turkish singer [[Sezen Aksu]] on her album ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn ve Cenaze'' (''Wedding and Funeral''). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.\n\nHe made an album with [[George Dalaras]] in 1999 named ''[[Thessaloniki \u2013 Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes]]''. In the same year, Bregovi\u0107 recorded an album called ''[[Kayah i Bregovi\u0107]]'' (Kayah and Bregovi\u0107) with popular Polish singer [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]] which sold over 700,000 copies in [[Poland]] (seven times platinum record).\n\nIn 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, [[Krzysztof Krawczyk (singer)|Krzysztof Krawczyk]], titled \"Daj mi drugie \u017cycie\" (\"Give Me Second Life\").\n\nIn 2005, Bregovi\u0107 took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.\n\nA number of works created by Bregovi\u0107 can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]], most notably \"\u0110ur\u0111evdan\". The film itself actually features more Bregovi\u0107 samples than the soundtrack. \n\nTwo musical numbers by Bregovi\u0107, \"Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke,\" and \"Gas, Gas\" were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian telenovela, ''[[Salve Jorge]]'', on the television network [[Rede Globo]].<ref name=\"Salve Jorge Tracklist\">{{cite web|title=Salve Jorge (Trilha Sonora da Novela) [|url=http://musica.com.br/trilhas-sonoras/salve-jorge.html|publisher=Musica.com.br|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Wedding and Funeral Orchestra===\n[[Image:Goran Bregovic in Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in concert in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia on 3 October 2007.]]\nFor many years Bregovi\u0107 performed with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from [[Belgrade]], women wearing traditional Bulgarian costumes, and [[Romani people|Roma]] singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.\n\nSince 1998, and until about 2012, Bregovi\u0107 has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Wedding and Funeral Orchestra.

He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Yokohama Stadium]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[NHK Hall]], and [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]].\n\nOe has also written and produced music for many artists, including [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Misato Watanabe]], [[Hiromi Go]], [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]] and [[Sayuri Ishikawa]].\n\nHe has composed music for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Believe\" which was featured in [[Sanrio Puroland]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSenri Oe was born on September 6th, 1960, in Fujiidera city [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was classically trained by his junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to become an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to become a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first bands during his time at university, was scouted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music]] and signed to [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] Japan in 1981.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album ===\nOn February 27, 1983, Oe performed on [[Sapporo Television Broadcasting|STV Radio]]'s Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio.\n\nOe soon released his first single \"Wallabee Shoes  (\u30ef\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u306c\u304e\u3059\u3066\u3066),\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU. Quickly garnering popularity, \"Wallabee Shoes\" charted at No. 10 in Sapporo radio.\n\nOe appeared on [[All Night Fuji]] (Akin to Saturday Night Live in Japan) on Channel 8 alongside [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] label-mates [[Wham!|Wham]] from Britain.\n\n=== 1985-2007: Greater pop music career success ===\nDirectly after graduating from [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], Oe rose to fame in November 1984 with the success of his sixth single, \"10 People, 10 Colors (\u5341\u4eba\u5341\u8272).\" His third album, Miseinen (\u672a\u6210\u5e74) Juvenile charted at No. 5 on [[Oricon]] (Japanese equivalent to the Billboard weekly chart).\n\nWith his now growing popularity across Japan, Oe toured performing in Japan's largest venues and stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]] (with [[seating capacity]] of 14,471, akin to Madison Square Garden) to promote his fifth album, AVEC Tour Final, in 1987.\n\nOe's seventh album 1234 was awarded Album of the Year in the third [[Japan Gold Disc Award|Gold Disc Awards]] (Japan's equivalent of the Grammy Awards) in the Pop Male Solo Artist Category.\n\nContinuing to tour large venues throughout Japan, Oe released the album, ''Sloppy Joe'', on March 25, 1989, which charted at No. 2 on the [[Oricon]] (Japan's equivalent of Billboard weekly chart).\n\nMeanwhile, Oe appeared as an actor on television for the first time, in the dramatic show entitled Kimi Ga Uso Wo Tuita.\n\nOe's ninth album, APOLLO, was the first of his albums to be recorded in New York City. The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1217486/|title=Senri Oe|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sanrio Puroland]] Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist [[Princess Tenko]] Play, for Destiny. Also, notably, Oe scored music for the Japanese animated film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Kono Hoshino Dokokade\" by Yasuda Sisters.\n\n=== 2008-2012: Career shift to jazz ===\nOn December 22, 2007, Oe announced that he would study jazz music in [[School of Jazz (The New School)|The New School for Jazz]] and moved to Manhattan on January 10, 2008, with his then puppy, a [[dachshund]] named Peace.\n\nSince Oe was fifteen years old, he was intent on learning jazz music theory at school. Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nAfter graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \"Peace Never Die\" Records, abbreviated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo. Peace has received a certificate which allows her to officially qualify as an emotional support dog for Oe.\n\nOe's jazz debut album was ''Boys Mature Slow''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/video/senri-oe/5600|title=SENRI OE Boys mature slow /Senri Oe (video)|website=JazzMusicArchives.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nFollowing conversations with former Tokyo Jazz Festival producer, Atsuko Yashima, Oe concluded that his second album's style could expand to include for a jazz 'big band' ensemble.\n\nOe composed eleven pieces for his next album, ''Spooky Hotel'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/B214393|title=Senri Oe|website=www.kennedy-center.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> which was released in 2013.\n\nFollowing ''Spooky Hotel'', Oe's big band performed in the Tokyo Jazz Festival at Tokyo Forum A Hall.\n\nOe's progress again toward composing for a drumless trio was entitled Collective Scribble;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/reports/2015/05/05/senri-oe-ny-trio-collective-scribble-tour-2015.html|title=Senri Oe Trio Bluenote collective Scribble|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Oe remarked that here, saxophone and piano combined with upright bass, \"like a drawing scribble.\"\n\nAt the same time, Oe was creating his fourth jazz vocal album, ''Answer July'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzspeaks.org/senri-oe-record-release-answer-july/|title=Senri Oe Record Release: Answer July|website=Jazz Speaks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicalmemoirs.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/new-cd-releases-reflect-sounds-of-summer-and-celebrate-men-of-jazz/|title=NEW CD RELEASES REFLECT SOUNDS OF SUMMER and CELEBRATE MEN OF JAZZ|date=2016-07-15|website=Musicalmemoirs's Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> with Sheila Jordan, Jon Hendricks, Theo Bleckmann and Lauren Kinham\n\n''Answer July'' was a Grammy-nominated consideration album in the Best Jazz Album in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Oe challenged himself to adopt the concept of combining pop with jazz in his fifth studio jazz album ''Boys & Girls'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-j-pop-star-turned-jazz-man-senri-oe-talks-solo-piano-for-det-132772|title=Interview: J-Pop star-turned-jazz man Senri Oe talks solo piano for Detroit Jazz Fest|work=AXS|access-date=2019-10-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/04/11/detroit-jazz-festival-chick-corea-bassist-esparanza-spaulding-drummer-terri-lyne-carrington/33738717/|title=2018 Detroit Jazz Fest lineup boasts diversity|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khon2.com/living-808/japanese-superstar-senri-oe-plays-the-blue-note/|title=Japanese Superstar Senri Oe plays the Blue Note|date=2019-05-21|website=KHON2|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox2detroit.com/mornings/jazz-pianist-senri-oe-performs|title=Jazz pianist Senri Oe performs|date=2018-09-03|website=FOX 2 Detroit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/a-whole-new-world-senri-oe-gets-his-kicks-as-a-jazz-pianist/|title=A Whole New World: Senri Oe Gets His Kicks As a Jazz Pianist|last=Magazine|first=JAZZIZ|date=2018-12-15|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> released in 2018.

He has held concerts in Japan's largest stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Yokohama Stadium]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[NHK Hall]], and [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]].\n\nOe has also written and produced music for many artists, including [[Seiko Matsuda]], [[Misato Watanabe]], [[Hiromi Go]], [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]] and [[Sayuri Ishikawa]].\n\nHe has composed music for the soundtrack of the film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Believe\" which was featured in [[Sanrio Puroland]].\n\n== Early life ==\nSenri Oe was born on September 6th, 1960, in Fujiidera city [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. Oe began playing piano at the age of three, and was classically trained by his then junior high school teacher Yumi Nara, who would go on to become an acclaimed opera singer. After each of their lessons, Nara would encourage Oe to improvise, and eventually Oe began to compose.\n\nUpon being introduced to music by The Carpenters, Captain & Tenille and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Oe decided to become a singer-songwriter. Soon after, Oe's music repertoire expanded to include jazz musicians such as Chris Conor, Bill Evans, Thelonius Monk, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Winton Kelly, Miles Davis and Charlie Parker.\n\nIn 1975, Oe participated in the final [[Yamaha Popular Song Contest]] POPCON (akin to American Idol).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagomusicguide.com/featured-artist-senri-oe/|title=FEATURED ARTIST - Senri Oe|date=2018-06-24|website=Chicago Music Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, Oe entered [[Kwansei Gakuin University]] and majored in economics while simultaneously beginning to pursue a professional music career. He formed his first bands during his time at university, was scouted by [[Sony Music Entertainment Japan|Sony Music]] and signed to [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] Japan in 1981.\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== 1983-1984: Early pop career and debut album ===\nOn February 27, 1983, Oe performed on [[Sapporo Television Broadcasting|STV Radio]]'s Sunday Jumbo Special in Sapporo, Hokkaido, granting him his initial exposure as a professional musician. Within this segment, Oe began a ten-minute performance in which he improvised a song on live radio.\n\nOe soon released his first single \"Wallabee Shoes  (\u30ef\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc\u306c\u304e\u3059\u3066\u3066),\" followed by his debut album, WAKUWAKU. Quickly garnering popularity, \"Wallabee Shoes\" charted at No. 10 in Sapporo radio.\n\nOe appeared on [[All Night Fuji]] (Akin to Saturday Night Live in Japan) on Channel 8 alongside [[Epic Records Japan|Epic Sony]] label-mates [[Wham!|Wham]] from Britain.\n\n=== 1985-2007: Greater pop music career success ===\nDirectly after graduating from [[Kwansei Gakuin University]], Oe rose to fame in November 1984 with the success of his sixth single, \"10 People, 10 Colors (\u5341\u4eba\u5341\u8272).\" His third album, Miseinen (\u672a\u6210\u5e74) Juvenile charted at No. 5 on [[Oricon]] (Japanese equivalent to the Billboard weekly chart).\n\nWith his now growing popularity across Japan, Oe toured performing in Japan's largest venues and stadiums, including [[Nippon Budokan]] (with [[seating capacity]] of 14,471, akin to Madison Square Garden) to promote his fifth album, AVEC Tour Final, in 1987.\n\nOe's seventh album 1234 was awarded Album of the Year in the third [[Japan Gold Disc Award|Gold Disc Awards]] (Japan's equivalent of the Grammy Awards) in the Pop Male Solo Artist Category.\n\nContinuing to tour large venues throughout Japan, Oe released the album, ''Sloppy Joe'', on March 25, 1989, which charted at No. 2 on the [[Oricon]] (Japan's equivalent of Billboard weekly chart).\n\nMeanwhile, Oe appeared as an actor on television for the first time, in the dramatic show entitled Kimi Ga Uso Wo Tuita.\n\nOe's ninth album, APOLLO, was the first of his albums to be recorded in New York City. The album was released to critical acclaim, charting at No.1 in the [[Oricon]] weekly chart on September, 21st 1990. Following APOLLO's success, Oe again toured in stadiums ([[Yokohama Stadium]], [[MetLife Dome|Seibu Dome]], [[Zozo Marine Stadium|Chiba Marine Stadium]], [[Yokohama Arena]], [[Osaka-j\u014d Hall|Osaka Castle Hall]]).\n\nOe's single \"Never See You Again (\u683c\u597d\u60aa\u3044\u3075\u3089\u308c\u304b\u305f) Kakko Warui Furare Kata\" was released in September 1990 and was his highest-charting single to date, charting at No.2 in the Oricon weekly chart.\n\nWhile continuing to record and perform, in 2000 Oe established his own record label, Station Kids Records, an imprint of Sony Music Entertainment Japan.\n\nOe also began to branch out to musical composition beyond pop music. Among these projects, he scored the soundtrack for the film Noto No Hanayome,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1217486/|title=Senri Oe|website=IMDb|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> [[Sanrio Puroland]] Park's Musical titled Believe, music for the performances of illusionist [[Princess Tenko]] Play, for Destiny. Also, notably, Oe scored music for the Japanese animated film ''[[Doraemon: Nobita's Great Adventure in the South Seas]]'', as well as \"Kono Hoshino Dokokade\" by Yasuda Sisters.\n\n=== 2008-2012: Career shift to jazz ===\nOn December 22, 2007, Oe announced that he would study jazz music in [[School of Jazz (The New School)|The New School for Jazz]] and moved to Manhattan on January 10, 2008, with his then puppy, a [[dachshund]] named Peace.\n\nSince Oe was fifteen years old, he was intent on learning jazz music theory at school. Due to his pop singer-songwriter career unexpectedly taking off, he chose to pause his jazz aspirations later in life.\n\n=== 2012-Present: Beginning of jazz pianist career ===\nAfter graduating from The New School for Jazz, Oe launched his jazz record label in 2012. It was called \"Peace Never Die\" Records, abbreviated to PND Records. His dog, Peace, also appeared in PND's logo. Peace has received a certificate which allows her to officially qualify as an emotional support dog for Oe.\n\nOe's jazz debut album was ''Boys Mature Slow''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzmusicarchives.com/video/senri-oe/5600|title=SENRI OE Boys mature slow /Senri Oe (video)|website=JazzMusicArchives.com|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nFollowing conversations with former Tokyo Jazz Festival producer, Atsuko Yashima, Oe concluded that his second album's style could expand to include for a jazz 'big band' ensemble.\n\nOe composed eleven pieces for his next album, ''Spooky Hotel'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/B214393|title=Senri Oe|website=www.kennedy-center.org|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> which was released in 2013.\n\nFollowing ''Spooky Hotel'', Oe's big band performed in the Tokyo Jazz Festival at Tokyo Forum A Hall.\n\nOe's progress again toward composing for a drumless trio was entitled Collective Scribble;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bluenote.co.jp/jp/reports/2015/05/05/senri-oe-ny-trio-collective-scribble-tour-2015.html|title=Senri Oe Trio Bluenote collective Scribble|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Oe remarked that here, saxophone and piano combined with upright bass, \"like a drawing scribble.\"\n\nAt the same time, Oe was creating his fourth jazz vocal album, ''Answer July'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jazzspeaks.org/senri-oe-record-release-answer-july/|title=Senri Oe Record Release: Answer July|website=Jazz Speaks|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://musicalmemoirs.wordpress.com/2016/07/15/new-cd-releases-reflect-sounds-of-summer-and-celebrate-men-of-jazz/|title=NEW CD RELEASES REFLECT SOUNDS OF SUMMER and CELEBRATE MEN OF JAZZ|date=2016-07-15|website=Musicalmemoirs's Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> with Sheila Jordan, Jon Hendricks, Theo Bleckmann and Lauren Kinham\n\n''Answer July'' was a Grammy-nominated consideration album in the Best Jazz Album in 2017.\n\nIn addition, Oe challenged himself to adopt the concept of combining pop with jazz in his fifth studio jazz album ''Boys & Girls'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-j-pop-star-turned-jazz-man-senri-oe-talks-solo-piano-for-det-132772|title=Interview: J-Pop star-turned-jazz man Senri Oe talks solo piano for Detroit Jazz Fest|work=AXS|access-date=2019-10-31|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/04/11/detroit-jazz-festival-chick-corea-bassist-esparanza-spaulding-drummer-terri-lyne-carrington/33738717/|title=2018 Detroit Jazz Fest lineup boasts diversity|website=Detroit News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khon2.com/living-808/japanese-superstar-senri-oe-plays-the-blue-note/|title=Japanese Superstar Senri Oe plays the Blue Note|date=2019-05-21|website=KHON2|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fox2detroit.com/mornings/jazz-pianist-senri-oe-performs|title=Jazz pianist Senri Oe performs|date=2018-09-03|website=FOX 2 Detroit|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jazziz.com/a-whole-new-world-senri-oe-gets-his-kicks-as-a-jazz-pianist/|title=A Whole New World: Senri Oe Gets His Kicks As a Jazz Pianist|last=Magazine|first=JAZZIZ|date=2018-12-15|website=JAZZIZ Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> released in 2018.

Demand for the plates quickly outgrew his one-man capacity. Haro Designs, as the company was first named, was formed in 1980 with headquarters in [[Torrance, California]].\n\nAs the company grew, Haro helped develop the sport of [[freestyle BMX]]. He travelled around the United States demonstrating radical trick-riding that had not been seen anywhere before. As a result, Haro earned the title \"The Father of Freestyle.\" \n\nDuring the early 1980s, the BMX boom continued. The company expanded its product line and established national and international distribution. During this time, the company gained a reputa for developing innovative BMX and freestyle bikes and accessories. Haro Bikes' most popular BMX/Freestyle models were the Master and the Sport.\n\n===Haro 1983 - 1987: Unique Bike Innovation===\nHaro introduced its first successful line of Freestyle BMX bikes in 1983. The Haro Sport and Master were the company's flagship bikes that sparked a revolution in bicycle design and imitation across the industry by other companies. In that year, its revenue greatly took off and it ignited a huge cult following.  In 1984, the company added the FST to its product line-up for consumers with lower budgets. As a result of Haro's huge success, companies like Hutch, Diamond Back, GT, Schwinn, Redline, Dyno, CW and Skyway modeled their own frame versions after Haro's designs. During the 80s, GT became Haro's strongest competitor. However, because of Haro's huge profits from the Sport, GT's sales dwindled in comparison.\n\nHaro possessed the best Freestyle team, dominating the 80s, 90s and 2000s. It won the most first places and top honors more than any other bike team. It contracted the most popular Freestylers in the history of the sport: Mike Dominguez, Donovan Ritter, Marc McGlynn, Bryan Blyther, Dave Nourie, Mat Hoffman, Dennis Mccoy, Ron Wilkerson, Joe Johnson, Ryan Nyquist, Dave Mirra, Rick Moliterno, Bob Morales, Eddie Fiola, Rich Sigur, and R.L. Osborn, not to mention other significant riders.\n\nDuring the 1980s GT struggled against bike company, Haro Bikes which dominated the freestyle BMX landscape and industry. As Haro was the most popular freestyle BMX bike at the time, it eclipsed GT in all categories especially in the number of bikes sold, number of sponsored freestyle riders and number of wins and trophies in competitions throughout the 80s and 90s.\n\n===Haro Bikes===\nThe first Haro bikes were manufactured by [[Torker]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://delsolbikes.com/about.php\n|title = Haro Bikes: The real Haro story\n|accessdate = 2008-02-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080610025857/http://delsolbikes.com/about.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-10}}</ref> In 1982, when Haro introduced his own line of racing bikes, his sponsorship by Torker and Max was terminated.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.fatbmx.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3832\n |title       = FATBMX: BMX Bizznizz : Interview with BMX guru Harold McGruther\n |access-date  = 2008-02-04\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080212053847/http://www.fatbmx.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3832\n |archive-date = 2008-02-12\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough injuries forced Haro to relinquish his riding duties, Haro Bikes subsequently compiled a virtual \"who's who\" list of talented riders including [[Bob Morales]], Mike Dominguez, Dennis McCoy, Ron Wilkerson, [[Matt Hoffman]], Eddie Fiola, Donovan Ritter, Marc McGlynn, Brian Blyther, Dave Nourie, Mike King, [[Pete Loncarevich]] ,Tony\"The Tiger\"Murray and many more. These riders won nearly every title there was in both BMX and freestyle. Media attention quickly put Haro Bikes in the spotlight as an industry leader with a bicycle line focused on the high end \"Master\" and more moderate \"Sport\". In 1986, Haro's design of the \"Master\" was at its climax with what is typically regarded as its most beautiful form with uniquely designed Haro Group 1 components, paint over chrome frame and forks, and uniquely designed flip-up pegs. The 1986 \"Master\" in team issue [[neon]] green with all original components has become highly collectible. In 1987, The \"Master\" was made over to reduce the cost of the 1986 model.\n\n===Company's sale===\nIn 1988, Bob Haro sold the company to a bigger bike company and agreed to a five-year consulting contract that provided continuing product innovation and a premium image for the brand. At the end of five years Bob left Haro Bikes and started a graphic design company.\n\nIn 1993, the company was sold again, this time to a group of investors headed by Jim Ford, a Vice President at Haro Bikes since 1981. With its new independence, and Jim leading the company as its President, the company re-established its focus on Bob Haro's original vision and began a rebuilding process that followed a sharp decline in the BMX market dating back to 1988.\n\nWithin one year, key management positions were filled and a new dealer base was established. A new competitive BMX racing team was formed and superstar freestyle riders [[Dave Mirra]] and [[Ryan Nyquist]] were signed by Haro soon after.\n\n===Reputation re-established===\nHaro's new products re-established its reputation for innovation and performance. By 1999, sales had exploded and Haro Bikes was again recognized as one of the top brands of BMX and freestyle bikes.\n\nThe sport's popularity has reached new heights, thanks to greater television exposure ESPN's [[X-Games]] and NBC's [[Gravity Games]]. In fact, Haro Bikes sponsored riders have combined to win over ten medals since the X-Games started in 1996, the most of any bike company. Dave Mirra is the most decorated X-Games athlete with eight medals, six of them gold.

Haro started out producing numberplates for [[BMX]] bikes in his Home. Demand for these stylish plates quickly outgrew his one-man capacity. Haro Designs, the first name of the company, was formed in 1980 with headquarters in [[Torrance, California]].\n\nWhile the company was growing, Haro was also growing the sport of [[freestyle BMX]]. He travelled around the country performing demos of radical trick riding that had not been seen anywhere before. As a result, Haro earned the title \"The Father of Freestyle\". During the early eighties, the company grew rapidly by expanding its product line and establishing national and international distribution. The BMX boom was in full swing and the company built a reputation for developing innovative, top-of-the-line BMX and freestyle bikes and accessories. Haro Bikes' most popular BMX/Freestyle models were the Master and the Sport.\n\n===Haro 1983 - 1987: Unique Bike Innovation===\nHaro introduced its first successful line of Freestyle BMX bikes in 1983. The Haro Sport and Master were the company's flagship bikes that sparked a revolution in bicycle design and imitation across the industry by other companies. In that year, its revenue greatly took off and it ignited a huge cult following.  In 1984, the company added the FST to its product line-up for consumers with lower budgets. As a result of Haro's huge success, companies like Hutch, Diamond Back, GT, Schwinn, Redline, Dyno, CW and Skyway modeled their own frame versions after Haro's designs. During the 80s, GT became Haro's strongest competitor. However, because of Haro's huge profits from the Sport, GT's sales dwindled in comparison.\n\nHaro possessed the best Freestyle team, dominating the 80s, 90s and 2000s. It won the most first places and top honors more than any other bike team. It contracted the most popular Freestylers in the history of the sport: Mike Dominguez, Donovan Ritter, Marc McGlynn, Bryan Blyther, Dave Nourie, Mat Hoffman, Dennis Mccoy, Ron Wilkerson, Joe Johnson, Ryan Nyquist, Dave Mirra, Rick Moliterno, Bob Morales, Eddie Fiola, Rich Sigur, and R.L. Osborn, not to mention other significant riders.\n\nDuring the 1980s GT struggled against bike company, Haro Bikes which dominated the freestyle BMX landscape and industry. As Haro was the most popular freestyle BMX bike at the time, it eclipsed GT in all categories especially in the number of bikes sold, number of sponsored freestyle riders and number of wins and trophies in competitions throughout the 80s and 90s.\n\n===Haro Bikes===\nThe first Haro bikes were manufactured by [[Torker]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url = http://delsolbikes.com/about.php\n|title = Haro Bikes: The real Haro story\n|accessdate = 2008-02-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080610025857/http://delsolbikes.com/about.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-10}}</ref> In 1982, when Haro introduced his own line of racing bikes, his sponsorship by Torker and Max was terminated.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.fatbmx.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3832\n |title       = FATBMX: BMX Bizznizz : Interview with BMX guru Harold McGruther\n |access-date  = 2008-02-04\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080212053847/http://www.fatbmx.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3832\n |archive-date = 2008-02-12\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough injuries forced Haro to relinquish his riding duties, Haro Bikes subsequently compiled a virtual \"who's who\" list of talented riders including [[Bob Morales]], Mike Dominguez, Dennis McCoy, Ron Wilkerson, [[Matt Hoffman]], Eddie Fiola, Donovan Ritter, Marc McGlynn, Brian Blyther, Dave Nourie, Mike King, [[Pete Loncarevich]] ,Tony\"The Tiger\"Murray and many more. These riders won nearly every title there was in both BMX and freestyle. Media attention quickly put Haro Bikes in the spotlight as an industry leader with a bicycle line focused on the high end \"Master\" and more moderate \"Sport\". In 1986, Haro's design of the \"Master\" was at its climax with what is typically regarded as its most beautiful form with uniquely designed Haro Group 1 components, paint over chrome frame and forks, and uniquely designed flip-up pegs. The 1986 \"Master\" in team issue [[neon]] green with all original components has become highly collectible. In 1987, The \"Master\" was made over to reduce the cost of the 1986 model.\n\n===Company's sale===\nIn 1988, Bob Haro sold the company to a bigger bike company and agreed to a five-year consulting contract that provided continuing product innovation and a premium image for the brand. At the end of five years Bob left Haro Bikes and started a graphic design company.\n\nIn 1993, the company was sold again, this time to a group of investors headed by Jim Ford, a Vice President at Haro Bikes since 1981. With its new independence, and Jim leading the company as its President, the company re-established its focus on Bob Haro's original vision and began a rebuilding process that followed a sharp decline in the BMX market dating back to 1988.\n\nWithin one year, key management positions were filled and a new dealer base was established. A new competitive BMX racing team was formed and superstar freestyle riders [[Dave Mirra]] and [[Ryan Nyquist]] were signed by Haro soon after.\n\n===Reputation re-established===\nHaro's new products re-established its reputation for innovation and performance. By 1999, sales had exploded and Haro Bikes was again recognized as one of the top brands of BMX and freestyle bikes.\n\nThe sport's popularity has reached new heights, thanks to greater television exposure ESPN's [[X-Games]] and NBC's [[Gravity Games]]. In fact, Haro Bikes sponsored riders have combined to win over ten medals since the X-Games started in 1996, the most of any bike company. Dave Mirra is the most decorated X-Games athlete with eight medals, six of them gold. Recently, Haro Bikes has taken major steps to establish its presence in the mountain bike market by signing former UCI World Champion Downhiller Mike King and the current UCI World Champion Cross Country racer, [[Michael Rasmussen (cyclist)|Michael Rasmussen]] of Denmark.\n\nBefore his death in 2016, [[Dave Mirra]] had left and made his own company Mirraco Bikes in 2007... an enterprise of Trek Bicycle Corporation. Ending his run with the Haro Brand.\n\nAs of 2019 Haro Bikes sponsors freestyle BMX riders [[Ryan Nyquist]], [[Dennis Enarson]], Chad Kerly, Matthias Dandois, Mike Gray and [[Dennis McCoy (BMX rider)|Dennis McCoy]].

It is {{convert|118|mi|km|abbr=on}} long and runs through the [[Scottish Highlands]] linking a series of small towns and villages with [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] at one end and [[Inverness]] at the other. Today, services between Inverness and [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]] and [[London]] use the line. At Inverness the line connects with the [[Far North Line]], the [[Aberdeen to Inverness Line|Aberdeen-Inverness Line]] and services on the [[Kyle of Lochalsh Line]]. All trains are diesel-powered.\n\nMuch of the Highland Main Line is [[Single track (rail)|single track]], and trains coming in opposite directions are often timed to arrive at stations at the same time, where [[Passing loop|crossing loops]] permit them to pass.

Originally, the line between Inverness and Perth went via [[Forres]], but the [[Inverness and Aviemore Direct Railway]] was opened in 1898 to allow for a more direct routeing.\n\nThere are two significant summits on the line; [[Pass of Drumochter|Drumochter Summit]] (also spelled ''Druimuachdar'') (elevation {{convert|1484|ft|m}}) between [[Blair Atholl]] and [[Dalwhinnie]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Yonge |first=John |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=Gerald |title=Railway Track Diagrams 1: Scotland & Isle of Man |edition=5th |date=December 2007 |origyear=1987 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=978-0-9549866-3-6 |at=map 19B |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Stuart K. |title=Rail Atlas of Great Britain and Ireland |edition=14th |year=2015 |origyear=1977 |publisher=Oxford Publishing Co |location=Addlestone |isbn=978-0-86093-669-5 |at=p. 60, section B2 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Vallance |first1=H.A. |last2=Clinker |first2=C.R. |last3=Lambert |first3=Anthony J. |title=The Highland Railway |edition=4th |year=1985 |origyear=1938 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=0-946537-24-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/highlandrailway0000vall/page/13 13, 25, 115, 116, 118, 177, 197] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/highlandrailway0000vall/page/13 }}</ref> and [[Slochd Summit]] (elevation {{convert|1315|ft|m}}) between [[Carrbridge]] and [[Inverness]].<ref>{{harvnb|Yonge|2007|loc=map 19D}}</ref> Other distinct features on the route include the [[viaducts]] at [[Culloden Viaduct|Culloden]] and [[Tomatin]], the spectacular mountain pass at Drumochter and the severe gradients encountered in both directions, particularly the extended climb from Inverness to the Slochd summit which averages around 1 in 60 the whole way.\n\nIn the 1960s, many sections of the line were converted from [[Double-track railway|double track]] to [[Single-track railway|single track]].

A roughly two-hourly Abellio ScotRail ''Inter7City'' service operates between [[Perth railway station, Scotland|Perth]] and [[Inverness railway station|Inverness]] throughout the day with 11 trains in total in each direction, with all services running from either {{Stnlnk|Glasgow Queen Street}} (via [[Stirling railway station (Scotland)|Stirling]]) or {{Stnlnk|Edinburgh Waverley}} (via [[Kirkcaldy railway station|Kirkcaldy]]). The [[London North Eastern Railway]] service is titled the ''[[Highland Chieftain]]''. Formed of an [[British Rail Class 800|Azuma]], it departs Inverness at 08:00 and runs to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] via the [[East Coast Main Line]], arriving in London at about 16:00. The return working leaves London at midday and reaches Inverness at 20:00.\n\nThe ''[[Caledonian Sleeper]]'' travels overnight between Inverness and [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] via the [[West Coast Main Line]]. This joins portions from [[Aberdeen railway station|Aberdeen]] and [[Fort William railway station|Fort William]] at Edinburgh Waverley and south of there forms the longest [[locomotive]]-hauled passenger train in the United Kingdom with 16 coaches.\n\nAll trains between Perth and Inverness call at [[Pitlochry railway station|Pitlochry]], [[Kingussie railway station|Kingussie]] and [[Aviemore railway station|Aviemore]].

Today, services between Inverness and [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]] and [[London]] use the line. At Inverness the line connects with the [[Far North Line]], the [[Aberdeen to Inverness Line|Aberdeen-Inverness Line]] and services on the [[Kyle of Lochalsh Line]]. All trains are diesel-powered.\n\nMuch of the Highland Main Line is [[Single track (rail)|single track]], and trains coming in opposite directions are often timed to arrive at stations at the same time, where [[Passing loop|crossing loops]] permit them to pass.

Originally, the line between Inverness and Perth went via [[Forres]], but the [[Inverness and Aviemore Direct Railway]] was opened in 1898 to allow for a more direct routeing.\n\nThere are two significant summits on the line; [[Pass of Drumochter|Drumochter Summit]] (also spelled ''Druimuachdar'') (elevation {{convert|1484|ft|m}}) between [[Blair Atholl]] and [[Dalwhinnie]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Yonge |first=John |editor-last=Jacobs |editor-first=Gerald |title=Railway Track Diagrams 1: Scotland & Isle of Man |edition=5th |date=December 2007 |origyear=1987 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |isbn=978-0-9549866-3-6 |at=map 19B |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Stuart K. |title=Rail Atlas of Great Britain and Ireland |edition=14th |year=2015 |origyear=1977 |publisher=Oxford Publishing Co |location=Addlestone |isbn=978-0-86093-669-5 |at=p. 60, section B2 |ref=harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Vallance |first1=H.A. |last2=Clinker |first2=C.R. |last3=Lambert |first3=Anthony J. |title=The Highland Railway |edition=4th |year=1985 |origyear=1938 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=0-946537-24-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/highlandrailway0000vall/page/13 13, 25, 115, 116, 118, 177, 197] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/highlandrailway0000vall/page/13 }}</ref> and [[Slochd Summit]] (elevation {{convert|1315|ft|m}}) between [[Carrbridge]] and [[Inverness]].<ref>{{harvnb|Yonge|2007|loc=map 19D}}</ref> Other distinct features on the route include the [[viaducts]] at [[Culloden Viaduct|Culloden]] and [[Tomatin]], the spectacular mountain pass at Drumochter and the severe gradients encountered in both directions, particularly the extended climb from Inverness to the Slochd summit which averages around 1 in 60 the whole way.\n\nIn the 1960s, many sections of the line were converted from [[Double-track railway|double track]] to [[Single-track railway|single track]].

The [[London North Eastern Railway]] service is titled the ''[[Highland Chieftain]]''.

The return working leaves London at midday and reaches Inverness at 20:00.\n\nThe ''[[Caledonian Sleeper]]'' travels overnight between Inverness and [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] via the [[West Coast Main Line]]. This joins portions from [[Aberdeen railway station|Aberdeen]] and [[Fort William railway station|Fort William]] at Edinburgh Waverley and south of there forms the longest [[locomotive]]-hauled passenger train in the United Kingdom with 16 coaches.\n\nAll trains between Perth and Inverness call at [[Pitlochry railway station|Pitlochry]], [[Kingussie railway station|Kingussie]] and [[Aviemore railway station|Aviemore]].

This documentary presents the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' as a film within a film. ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' follows \"the real Jeff Patterson\u2019s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to fictionalize the case\u2019s events for the big screen from the defense's point-of-view. Protests of the film ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' are discussed within the documentary coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the Wiccan community as a whole. Rachel Moskowitz and Andre Brooks respectively portray the \"real\" Kim Diamond and Jeffrey Patterson within the documentary.}} ''Blair Witch'' stars [[James Allen McCune]], [[Callie Hernandez]], Brandon Scott, Corbin Reid, [[Valorie Curry]], and Wes Robinson. The film, shot in a [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] style, follows a group of college students and their local guides who venture into the Black Hills Forest in Maryland to uncover the mysteries surrounding the prior disappearance of [[Heather Donahue]], the sister of one of the characters.\n\nDevelopment of the film began in September 2009, when creators of the franchise [[Daniel Myrick]] and [[Eduardo S\u00e1nchez (director)|Eduardo S\u00e1nchez]] announced their intent to produce a third ''Blair Witch'' film. The film was a sequel to the first film, would potentially contain the actors from the first film in some context, and would not reference any of the events from ''Book of Shadows''. In 2011, S\u00e1nchez remarked that further development on a sequel depended on getting [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] to approve the idea and for his and Myrick's schedule to match up.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The film went into [[development hell]], and later the script was trowed aside. In 2013, a third ''Blair Witch'' film was again in talks, with Wingard and Barrett being hired to work on a new script.\n\nInitially, the film's connection to the ''Blair Witch'' franchise was kept secret, with the film having been shot under the fake title, ''The Woods''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Roffman|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/07/adam-wingards-the-woods-is-actually-a-sequel-to-the-blair-witch-project/|title=Adam Wingard's ''The Woods'' is actually a sequel to ''The Blair Witch Project''|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|publisher=Consequence Holdings, LLC|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=July 23, 2016|language=en-US|access-date=July 25, 2016}}</ref> In July 2016, it was revealed at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]] that the film marketed with the faux-title ''The Woods'' actually turned out to be the sequel ''Blair Witch''.\n\nThe film premiered at San Diego Comic-Con on July 22, 2016 and was screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, before being theatrically released in the United States on September 16, by Lionsgate.<ref>{{cite web|first=Michelle|last=Smith|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3908212|title=''The Woods'' Trailer Doesn't Reveal Much, But Is Sure To Give You Massive Goosebumps|website=[[Moviepilot]]|date=May 10, 2016|accessdate=May 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511124217/http://moviepilot.com/posts/3908212|archive-date=May 11, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Blair Witch'' received mixed reviews, with critics noting it as an improvement on ''Book of Shadows'' while criticizing the writing and special effects.

Believing she is still alive, he heads into the woods, accompanied by his friend Peter Jones, Peter's girlfriend Ashley Bennett, and film student Lisa Arlington, who wants to film James' search as a [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''The Absence of Closure''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/891264965/the-absence-of-closure/posts/1665045/ |title=The Absence of Closure by Lisa Arlington |website=Kickstarter.com |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://absenceofclosure.tumblr.com/ |title=The Absence of Closure |website=Absenceofclosure.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> Locals Talia and Lane, who found and uploaded the video, join them.\n\nWhile walking through the woods and upon setting up camp for the night, Lane and Talia discuss the disappearance of Heather and her film crew, the 1940-41 murders by Rustin Parr, and other mysterious occurrences, which they ascribe to the Blair Witch. They hear noises during the night, then awaken at 2 p.m. to find strange stick figures hanging from the trees. When Lisa notices [[twine]] in Lane's backpack, he and Talia admit to creating the figures in order to convince the group to believe, but also point out that there is no explanation for the strange noises during the night and sleeping through the day. James and his friends banish Lane and Talia from the group and head out of the woods.\n\nAfter hours of walking, the four surprisingly arrive back at their original campsite. Lisa pilots a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] to obtain their location, but it malfunctions. Ashley becomes sick due to a wound on her foot, forcing the group to camp again. When Peter inspects Ashley's wounded foot, he notices what he thinks may be a parasite inside the wound. Peter leaves the camp for firewood, and is chased by an unknown entity; a tree falls on him, then he disappears.\n\nLane and Talia appear in the night, claiming they have been wandering for five days without a sunrise. Lane believes the camp is a hallucination and runs off, leaving the disheveled and ravenously hungry Talia. The next morning, James and Lisa are stunned to find that it is still dark outside at 7am and discover larger stick figures. Talia sees clumps of her hair tied to one of the figures. Ashley accuses Talia of crafting them and snaps the figure with Talia's hair in half; Talia herself is then snapped in half. An unseen force lifts their tent and the group is separated. Ashley finds the drone and climbs a tree to recover it, but is knocked out and falls from the tree, the unknown entity dragging her away.\n\nA rainstorm ensues as Lisa and James stumble across Rustin Parr's house, which James had previously stated to have been burned down after his execution. James hears someone he thinks is Heather scream upstairs, enters the house and sees Peter standing in the corner. He chases after the figure he believes to be Heather, confronted by a teleporting disheveled figure;{{efn|name=HeatherDonahue|Though glimpsed briefly, the figure indeed appears to be Heather Donahue as she appeared in the closing scenes of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', complete with her torn cardigan and hat. In an interview with [[Adam Wingard]], the film's director, it was later confirmed that the archival footage of Heather Donahue was intentionally meant to portray the Blair Witch in the form of Heather.}} upon its vanishing he barricades himself.\n\nLisa spots a tall, pale, long-limbed creature moving through the trees, and she runs into the house's basement. She finds a hostile Lane who traps her in a tunnel, saying, \u201cyou have to do what she tells you.\u201d She crawls through the tunnel to a different part of the house, where she stabs and kills Lane when he attacks her. Lisa flees when the long-limbed creature emerges from the tunnel and chases her through the house. Lisa runs up to the attic with Lane's camcorder, creating the [[bootstrap paradox|paradox]] video that lured them all to the woods.{{efn|name=ParadoxExplained|Early on in the film, as the group makes its way deep into the woods, Lisa asks Lane about his camera, an older model that she notes uses the exact same tape as the one he claims to have found. The footage Lisa records on Lane\u2019s camera while running through the shack is the same footage Lane found in the woods before the group ever actually went there, implying that they have been caught in a [[time loop]]}}\n\nShe reunites with James in the attic and they try to barricade the door. A bright light shines from outside the building. James tells Lisa to face the corner of the room and desperately apologizes to her before something enters the room. James is tricked into turning around, believing that he hears Heather's voice, and vanishes from sight. Lisa uses Lane's camcorder to view what is behind her and begins walking backward. However, hearing James' apology again, she turns and vanishes, with a flash of a yellowed arm, before her camera falls to the ground. After a few moments, the camera gives out.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[James Allen McCune]] as James Donahue \n* [[Callie Hernandez]] as Lisa Arlington\n* [[Brandon Scott (actor)|Brandon Scott]] as Peter\n* Corbin Reid as Ashley\n* [[Valorie Curry]] as Talia\n* Wes Robinson as Lane\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nWhile promoting ''[[V/H/S/2]]'' at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], director [[Adam Wingard]] and writer [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]] ran into original ''The Blair Witch Project'' co-filmmaker [[Eduardo S\u00e1nchez (director)|Eduardo S\u00e1nchez]] and producer [[Gregg Hale (producer)|Gregg Hale]], and asked them why there were not any more ''Blair Witch'' films.

Barrett said that the \"only thing I really pitched was the other characters; they\u2019d originally conceived the film as more similar to the first film, following its narrative fairly closely, with only three or four characters, I think, but I wanted more characters to give us more scare sequences.

This documentary presents the events of ''Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2'' as a film within a film. ''Shadow of the Blair Witch'' follows \"the real Jeff Patterson\u2019s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to fictionalize the case\u2019s events for the big screen from the defense's point-of-view.

Rachel Moskowitz and Andre Brooks respectively portray the \"real\" Kim Diamond and Jeffrey Patterson within the documentary.}} ''Blair Witch'' stars [[James Allen McCune]], [[Callie Hernandez]], Brandon Scott, Corbin Reid, [[Valorie Curry]], and Wes Robinson.

Believing she is still alive, he heads into the woods, accompanied by his friend Peter Jones, Peter's girlfriend Ashley Bennett, and film student Lisa Arlington, who wants to film James' search as a [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''The Absence of Closure''.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/891264965/the-absence-of-closure/posts/1665045/ |title=The Absence of Closure by Lisa Arlington |website=Kickstarter.com |date=May 12, 2014 |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://absenceofclosure.tumblr.com/ |title=The Absence of Closure |website=Absenceofclosure.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> Locals Talia and Lane, who found and uploaded the video, join them.\n\nWhile walking through the woods and upon setting up camp for the night, Lane and Talia discuss the disappearance of Heather and her film crew, the 1940-41 murders by Rustin Parr, and other mysterious occurrences, which they ascribe to the Blair Witch. They hear noises during the night, then awaken at 2 p.m. to find strange stick figures hanging from the trees. When Lisa notices [[twine]] in Lane's backpack, he and Talia admit to creating the figures in order to convince the group to believe, but also point out that there is no explanation for the strange noises during the night and sleeping through the day. James and his friends banish Lane and Talia from the group and head out of the woods.\n\nAfter hours of walking, the four surprisingly arrive back at their original campsite. Lisa pilots a [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] to obtain their location, but it malfunctions. Ashley becomes sick due to a wound on her foot, forcing the group to camp again. When Peter inspects Ashley's wounded foot, he notices what he thinks may be a parasite inside the wound. Peter leaves the camp for firewood, and is chased by an unknown entity; a tree falls on him, then he disappears.\n\nLane and Talia appear in the night, claiming they have been wandering for five days without a sunrise. Lane believes the camp is a hallucination and runs off, leaving the disheveled and ravenously hungry Talia. The next morning, James and Lisa are stunned to find that it is still dark outside at 7am and discover larger stick figures. Talia sees clumps of her hair tied to one of the figures. Ashley accuses Talia of crafting them and snaps the figure with Talia's hair in half; Talia herself is then snapped in half. An unseen force lifts their tent and the group is separated. Ashley finds the drone and climbs a tree to recover it, but is knocked out and falls from the tree, the unknown entity dragging her away.\n\nA rainstorm ensues as Lisa and James stumble across Rustin Parr's house, which James had previously stated to have been burned down after his execution. James hears someone he thinks is Heather scream upstairs, enters the house and sees Peter standing in the corner. He chases after the figure he believes to be Heather, confronted by a teleporting disheveled figure;{{efn|name=HeatherDonahue|Though glimpsed briefly, the figure indeed appears to be Heather Donahue as she appeared in the closing scenes of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', complete with her torn cardigan and hat.

She finds a hostile Lane who traps her in a tunnel, saying, \u201cyou have to do what she tells you.\u201d She crawls through the tunnel to a different part of the house, where she stabs and kills Lane when he attacks her. Lisa flees when the long-limbed creature emerges from the tunnel and chases her through the house. Lisa runs up to the attic with Lane's camcorder, creating the [[bootstrap paradox|paradox]] video that lured them all to the woods.{{efn|name=ParadoxExplained|Early on in the film, as the group makes its way deep into the woods, Lisa asks Lane about his camera, an older model that she notes uses the exact same tape as the one he claims to have found.

A bright light shines from outside the building. James tells Lisa to face the corner of the room and desperately apologizes to her before something enters the room. James is tricked into turning around, believing that he hears Heather's voice, and vanishes from sight. Lisa uses Lane's camcorder to view what is behind her and begins walking backward. However, hearing James' apology again, she turns and vanishes, with a flash of a yellowed arm, before her camera falls to the ground.

The [[New Zealand Free For All]] is held on Show Day. The public holiday in Christchurch is the observance of the Canterbury Anniversary Holiday (16 December in reality). The race meeting, along with the [[New Zealand Cup]] for thoroughbreds and greyhounds, forms part of Canterbury's carnival week, along with the Canterbury Agricultural and Pastoral Show. Until 1999, the A&amp;P show was held at showgrounds adjacent to Addington Raceway. \n\nThe New Zealand Trotting cup is considered as Canterbury's biggest day on its social calendar.  Many flock to Addington for the glitz and glamour of the event, rather than the horse racing.\n\n==Cup history==\n\nThree horses have won the race three times, they are [[Indianapolis (horse)|Indianapolis]], [[False Step]] and [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]]. False Step later went to the United States where he beat the acknowledged American champion of the time, [[Adios Butler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RacingTrotting/NewZealandHorsesInAmerica/en |title=New Zealand Horses in America|work=An Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=1966|author=A.H. McLintock (editor)}}</ref>   A number of horses have won the race twice including [[Harold Logan]] and [[Highland Fling (horse)|Highland Fling]] who both won their second cups off the very large handicap of 60 yards and Lazarus.\n\nIn 2007 a crowd of 25,000 people packed the race track. This Tuesday is also known for having remarkable weather, it had not rained at the New Zealand Trotting Cup since 1962, the year that mudlark [[Lordship (horse)|Lordship]] beat the hot favorite [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]].<ref>[http://www.addington.co.nz/timeline.asp?Case=1&ID=1962 Addington Raceway timeline, 1962] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016024444/http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=1&ID=1962 |date=16 October 2008 }}</ref>  It did rain in 2007, but only after the New Zealand Trotting Cup had already been run.\n\nCardigan Bay, the beaten favorite in 1962, did eventually win the race the next year in 1963, and also won the [[Inter Dominion]] in Australia in 1963. Cardigan Bay, in association with [[New Jersey]] master reinsman [[Stanley Dancer]] went on to become the first million dollar winner in the sport's history.\n\nA common feature of the race is the inclusion of Australian trained runners and occasionally they are the winners such as Steel Jaw in 1983, Lightning Blue in 1987, Arden Rooney in 2015. \n\nThe 2008 running of the race was won by Changeover, driven by David Butcher and trained by Geoff Small, in race/world record time (1.58.8 mile rate). The race was delayed by over 6 minutes due to fractious horses and a damaged wheel to one of the favoured runners. After being slow away, Butcher moved forward to lead, and soon after took a trail behind one of the other favourites, Baileys Dream. In an exciting finish, Butcher used the passing lane to pass Baileys Dream, with Report for Duty third for Anthony Butt (who was trying for 3 wins in a row in the NZ Cup). It was another dream result for the ATC Trotting Syndicate, who own the horse. The last horse home, favoured runner Monkey King, was credited with a time of 3.58.7, which was fast enough to have won every NZ Cup, except the 2007 running, won by [[Flashing Red]].\n\n[[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] equaled the record for most wins in 2013, having won the previous two years. Despite breaking stride at the start of the race, giving the leaders a 15-length head start (about 37m or 3 seconds), Terror To Love made up the distance slowly and worked towards the front, taking the lead in the back stretch of the final lap. The horse managed to hold off late-charging runners to record the unusual win by a head. The race announcer called the race the greatest win in the New Zealand Trotting Cup's history. The race time was the second fastest behind the 2008 win by Changeover.\n\nThe 2015 running of the New Zealand Cup was won by Australian-based horse, Arden Rooney, in a slowish overall time of 3.57.4, driven by [[Kerryn Manning]]. It was the first time in the history of the race that a female had driven the winner. Arden Rooney was given a leisurely time in front after a great beginning and with a last half mile in 55 seconds under a vigorous drive, gave little else a chance to catch it. Subsequently, the driver was given a two-week suspension and $1000 fine for \"Excessive use of whip\". It was her second fine for a similar offense in New Zealand within 8 days.\n\nIn 2016 the race was run and won by the dominant Purdon/Rasmussen training combination, with their horse Lazarus. It was won in a very fast time in completely dominant fashion by 10 lengths, running 3.53.1 for the 2 mile event (a mile rate of 1.57.2). The Purdon/Rasmussen combination filled 3 of the first 4 finishing positions.\n\nThe stake or total prize money for the New Zealand Cup has fluctuated over the years:\n\n* 1940 - 2500 pounds\n* 1950 - 7500 pounds\n* 1960 - 6750 pounds\n* 1970 - $25,000\n* 1980 - $100,000\n* 1990 - $375,000\n* 2008 - $1.2 million \n* 2009 - $1 million \n* 2010 - $750,000\n* 2011 and 2012 - $600,000 \n* 2013 - $650,000\n\nIn 2016, the [[Body art|ZM Body Art final]] was held at the Trotting Cup.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/86245535/models-bare-all-for-new-zealand-trotting-cup-body-art-contest Models bare all for New Zealand Trotting Cup body art contest] Retrieved November 2016</ref>\n\n==Records==\n'''Most wins:'''\n* 3 - [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] (2011, 2012, 2013)\n* 3 - [[False Step]] (1958, 1959, 1960)\n* 3 - [[Indianapolis (horse)|Indianapolis]] (1934, 1935, 1936)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[harness racer|driver]]:'''\n* 7 - Ricky May (1989, 1997, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013)\n* 6 - [[C C Devine]] (1951, 1956, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1979)\n* 5 - [[Mark Purdon]] (1995, 1996, 2014, 2016, 2017)\n* 4 - J Bryce (1916, 1925, 1926, 1933)\n* 4 - Todd Mitchell (1999, 2002, 2003, 2004)\n* 4 - [[P T Wolfenden]] (1963, 1965, 1970, 1977)\n\n== Winners list ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"25px\" | Year<br>\n! width=\"90px\" | Horse<br>\n! width=\"15px\" | Age<br>\n! width=\"15px\" | {{abbr|Hcp|Handicap}}<br>\n! width=\"250px\" | Owner(s)<br>\n! width=\"90px\" | Driver<br>\n! width=\"40px\" | Time<br>\n! width=\"40px\" | Second<br>\n! width=\"40px\" | Third<br>\n\n|-\n| 2019 || Cruz Bromac || 8 g || fr || D Zavitsanos, P M O\u2019Shea, Mrs D O\u2019Shea, Mrs J Zavitsanos, W R Viney || Blair Orange || 3:56.9 ||Spankem || Classie Brigade\n|-\n|2018 || Thefixer || 5 g || fr || Mrs G J Kennard, P I Kennard, Mrs P P Gillan, R J Fleetwood, R J Magness || Natalie Rasmussen || 3:53.9|| Tiger Tara||Dream About Me\n|-\n|2017 || Lazarus || 5 h || fr || G & P Kennard, T Casey & K Riseley || [[Mark Purdon]] || 3:55.0||Jack's Legend ||Tiger Tara\n|-\n|2016 || Lazarus || 4 h || fr || G & P Kennard, T Casey & K Riseley || [[Mark Purdon]] || 3:53.1|| Tiger Tara||Titan Banner\n|-\n|2015 || Arden Rooney || 6 g || fr || M W Butterworth & Mrs M T Butterworth || [[Kerryn Manning]] || 3:57.4||Smolda ||Mossdale Conner\n|-\n|2014 || Adore Me || 5 m || fr || C J Roberts, P G Kenny & Mrs M L Kenny || [[Mark Purdon]] || 3:54.6||Franco Nelson ||For A Reason\n|-\n|2013 || [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] || 6 h || fr || Terry McDonald || Ricky May || 3:57.0 ||Fly Like An Eagle ||Christen Me\n|-\n|2012 || [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] || 5 h || fr || Terry McDonald || Ricky May || 3:58.6||Highview Tommy ||Sushi Sushi\n|-\n|2011 || [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] || 4 h || fr || Terry McDonald || Jim Curtin || 4:02.0||Smoken Up || Highview Tommy\n|-\n|2010 || [[Monkey King (horse)|Monkey King]] *|| 8 g ||  fr || Cavalla Bloodstock Limited || Ricky May || 4:00.7|| Smoken Up|| Sleepy Tripp\n|-\n|2009 || [[Monkey King (horse)|Monkey King]] *|| 7 g ||  fr || Cavalla Bloodstock Limited || Ricky May || 3:57.3|| Bettor's Strike||Smoken Up\n|-\n|2008 || [[Changeover (horse)|Changeover]] || 5 h  ||  fr || A.T.C.

The [[New Zealand Free For All]] is held on Show Day. The public holiday in Christchurch is the observance of the Canterbury Anniversary Holiday (16 December in reality). The race meeting, along with the [[New Zealand Cup]] for thoroughbreds and greyhounds, forms part of Canterbury's carnival week, along with the Canterbury Agricultural and Pastoral Show. Until 1999, the A&amp;P show was held at showgrounds adjacent to Addington Raceway. \n\nThe New Zealand Trotting cup is considered as Canterbury's biggest day on its social calendar.  Many flock to Addington for the glitz and glamour of the event, rather than the horse racing.\n\n==Cup history==\n\nThree horses have won the race three times, they are [[Indianapolis (horse)|Indianapolis]], [[False Step]] and [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]]. False Step later went to the United States where he beat the acknowledged American champion of the time, [[Adios Butler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RacingTrotting/NewZealandHorsesInAmerica/en |title=New Zealand Horses in America|work=An Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=1966|author=A.H. McLintock (editor)}}</ref>   A number of horses have won the race twice including [[Harold Logan]] and [[Highland Fling (horse)|Highland Fling]] who both won their second cups off the very large handicap of 60 yards and Lazarus.\n\nIn 2007 a crowd of 25,000 people packed the race track. This Tuesday is also known for having remarkable weather, it had not rained at the New Zealand Trotting Cup since 1962, the year that mudlark [[Lordship (horse)|Lordship]] beat the hot favorite [[Cardigan Bay (horse)|Cardigan Bay]].<ref>[http://www.addington.co.nz/timeline.asp?Case=1&ID=1962 Addington Raceway timeline, 1962] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016024444/http://www.addington.co.nz/Timeline.asp?Case=1&ID=1962 |date=16 October 2008 }}</ref>  It did rain in 2007, but only after the New Zealand Trotting Cup had already been run.\n\nCardigan Bay, the beaten favorite in 1962, did eventually win the race the next year in 1963, and also won the [[Inter Dominion]] in Australia in 1963. Cardigan Bay, in association with [[New Jersey]] master reinsman [[Stanley Dancer]] went on to become the first million dollar winner in the sport's history.\n\nA common feature of the race is the inclusion of Australian trained runners and occasionally they are the winners such as Steel Jaw in 1983, Lightning Blue in 1987, Arden Rooney in 2015. \n\nThe 2008 running of the race was won by Changeover, driven by David Butcher and trained by Geoff Small, in race/world record time (1.58.8 mile rate). The race was delayed by over 6 minutes due to fractious horses and a damaged wheel to one of the favoured runners. After being slow away, Butcher moved forward to lead, and soon after took a trail behind one of the other favourites, Baileys Dream. In an exciting finish, Butcher used the passing lane to pass Baileys Dream, with Report for Duty third for Anthony Butt (who was trying for 3 wins in a row in the NZ Cup). It was another dream result for the ATC Trotting Syndicate, who own the horse. The last horse home, favoured runner Monkey King, was credited with a time of 3.58.7, which was fast enough to have won every NZ Cup, except the 2007 running, won by [[Flashing Red]].\n\n[[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] equaled the record for most wins in 2013, having won the previous two years. Despite breaking stride at the start of the race, giving the leaders a 15-length head start (about 37m or 3 seconds), Terror To Love made up the distance slowly and worked towards the front, taking the lead in the back stretch of the final lap. The horse managed to hold off late-charging runners to record the unusual win by a head. The race announcer called the race the greatest win in the New Zealand Trotting Cup's history. The race time was the second fastest behind the 2008 win by Changeover.\n\nThe 2015 running of the New Zealand Cup was won by Australian-based horse, Arden Rooney, in a slowish overall time of 3.57.4, driven by [[Kerryn Manning]]. It was the first time in the history of the race that a female had driven the winner. Arden Rooney was given a leisurely time in front after a great beginning and with a last half mile in 55 seconds under a vigorous drive, gave little else a chance to catch it. Subsequently, the driver was given a two-week suspension and $1000 fine for \"Excessive use of whip\". It was her second fine for a similar offense in New Zealand within 8 days.\n\nIn 2016 the race was run and won by the dominant Purdon/Rasmussen training combination, with their horse Lazarus. It was won in a very fast time in completely dominant fashion by 10 lengths, running 3.53.1 for the 2 mile event (a mile rate of 1.57.2). The Purdon/Rasmussen combination filled 3 of the first 4 finishing positions.\n\nThe stake or total prize money for the New Zealand Cup has fluctuated over the years:\n\n* 1940 - 2500 pounds\n* 1950 - 7500 pounds\n* 1960 - 6750 pounds\n* 1970 - $25,000\n* 1980 - $100,000\n* 1990 - $375,000\n* 2008 - $1.2 million \n* 2009 - $1 million \n* 2010 - $750,000\n* 2011 and 2012 - $600,000 \n* 2013 - $650,000\n\nIn 2016, the [[Body art|ZM Body Art final]] was held at the Trotting Cup.<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/fashion/86245535/models-bare-all-for-new-zealand-trotting-cup-body-art-contest Models bare all for New Zealand Trotting Cup body art contest] Retrieved November 2016</ref>\n\n==Records==\n'''Most wins:'''\n* 3 - [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] (2011, 2012, 2013)\n* 3 - [[False Step]] (1958, 1959, 1960)\n* 3 - [[Indianapolis (horse)|Indianapolis]] (1934, 1935, 1936)\n\n'''Most wins by a [[harness racer|driver]]:'''\n* 7 - Ricky May (1989, 1997, 2005, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013)\n* 6 - [[C C Devine]] (1951, 1956, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1979)\n* 5 - [[Mark Purdon]] (1995, 1996, 2014, 2016, 2017)\n* 4 - J Bryce (1916, 1925, 1926, 1933)\n* 4 - Todd Mitchell (1999, 2002, 2003, 2004)\n* 4 - [[P T Wolfenden]] (1963, 1965, 1970, 1977)\n\n== Winners list ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"25px\" | Year<br>\n! width=\"90px\" | Horse<br>\n! width=\"15px\" | Age<br>\n! width=\"15px\" | {{abbr|Hcp|Handicap}}<br>\n! width=\"250px\" | Owner(s)<br>\n! width=\"90px\" | Driver<br>\n! width=\"40px\" | Time<br>\n! width=\"40px\" | Second<br>\n! width=\"40px\" | Third<br>\n\n|-\n| 2019 || Cruz Bromac || 8 g || fr || D Zavitsanos, P M O\u2019Shea, Mrs D O\u2019Shea, Mrs J Zavitsanos, W R Viney || Blair Orange || 3:56.9 ||Spankem || Classie Brigade\n|-\n|2018 || Thefixer || 5 g || fr || Mrs G J Kennard, P I Kennard, Mrs P P Gillan, R J Fleetwood, R J Magness || Natalie Rasmussen || 3:53.9|| Tiger Tara||Dream About Me\n|-\n|2017 || Lazarus || 5 h || fr || G & P Kennard, T Casey & K Riseley || [[Mark Purdon]] || 3:55.0||Jack's Legend ||Tiger Tara\n|-\n|2016 || Lazarus || 4 h || fr || G & P Kennard, T Casey & K Riseley || [[Mark Purdon]] || 3:53.1|| Tiger Tara||Titan Banner\n|-\n|2015 || Arden Rooney || 6 g || fr || M W Butterworth & Mrs M T Butterworth || [[Kerryn Manning]] || 3:57.4||Smolda ||Mossdale Conner\n|-\n|2014 || Adore Me || 5 m || fr || C J Roberts, P G Kenny & Mrs M L Kenny || [[Mark Purdon]] || 3:54.6||Franco Nelson ||For A Reason\n|-\n|2013 || [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] || 6 h || fr || Terry McDonald || Ricky May || 3:57.0 ||Fly Like An Eagle ||Christen Me\n|-\n|2012 || [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] || 5 h || fr || Terry McDonald || Ricky May || 3:58.6||Highview Tommy ||Sushi Sushi\n|-\n|2011 || [[Terror to Love|Terror To Love]] || 4 h || fr || Terry McDonald || Jim Curtin || 4:02.0||Smoken Up || Highview Tommy\n|-\n|2010 || [[Monkey King (horse)|Monkey King]] *|| 8 g ||  fr || Cavalla Bloodstock Limited || Ricky May || 4:00.7|| Smoken Up|| Sleepy Tripp\n|-\n|2009 || [[Monkey King (horse)|Monkey King]] *|| 7 g ||  fr || Cavalla Bloodstock Limited || Ricky May || 3:57.3|| Bettor's Strike||Smoken Up\n|-\n|2008 || [[Changeover (horse)|Changeover]] || 5 h  ||  fr || A.T.C.
