S. Norman along with his good friend Frank Ritchie took over '''The Beacon''', which had been established as a Preparatory school in 1863 at 18 St John's Road, Sevenoaks. As the numbers in the school grew, larger premises were needed leading to the decision in October 1897 to build a new boarding school in Sevenoaks. Land was acquired from [[William Amherst, 3rd Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]]'s [[Montreal Park]] estate at Cross Keys, and construction of '''The New Beacon''' began in February 1899. The new building was ready by the end of the Autumn Term 1899.<ref>{{cite book |title=The New Beacon |first=Hugh |last=Barty-King |date=2000 |location=Great Britain |publisher=The Bath Press |isbn=0356219518}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1900 the New Beacon opened for the (continued) education of boys in a building with a capacity for 60 boarders. The exterior of the building changed little over the century, but the addition of a chapel in 1912 meant that the children no longer had to walk to [[Kippington]]. By 1913 the school had grown to 62 pupils and the fees were \u00a3120 per year for boarding and tuition, plus \u00a31 11s 6d for medical attendance. Other facilities included swimming baths, a miniature rifle range, a playground and two sports fields. During the First World War, staffing was depleted and the school's grounds and gardens had to be tended by staff and pupils. Thirty-seven former pupils were killed during the war, and another 75 Beaconians fell in the Second World War. Their names are noted on a memorial in the chapel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newbeacon.org.uk/about-us/history/|title=History|website=New Beacon School|access-date=27 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war changes and the increase in day boys===\nAfter the war numbers continued to grow and the roll call was over 120 pupils in 1948.

{"title_page": "Basso Continuo", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n'''Basso continuo''' parts, almost universal in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era (1600\u20131750), provided the [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] structure of the music by supplying a [[bassline]] and a [[chord progression]]. The phrase is often shortened to ''continuo'', and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part are called the ''continuo group''.\n[[File:Soloquartet and strings.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A harpsichordist and a bassist play continuo for a small group of singers.]]\n\n==Forces==\nThe makeup of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers (or, for a large performance, the [[conductor (music)|conductor]]), and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]], [[guitar]], [[Regal (instrument)|regal]], or [[harp]]. In addition, any number of instruments that play in the [[bass (music)|bass]] register may be included, such as [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[viol|bass viol]], or [[bassoon]]. The most common combination, at least in modern performances, is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as [[opera]]s, and organ  and cello for [[sacred music]]. A double bass may be added, particularly when accompanying a lower-pitched solo voice (e.g., a bass singer).\n\nTypically performers match the [[Family (musical instruments)|instrument families]] used in the full ensemble: including bassoon when the work includes oboes or other winds, but restricting it to cello and/or [[double bass]] if only strings are involved. [[Harp]]s, lutes, and other handheld instruments are more typical of early 17th-century music. Sometimes instruments are specified by the composer: in ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) [[Monteverdi]] calls for an exceptionally varied instrumentation, with multiple harpsichords and lutes with a [[bass violin]] in the pastoral scenes followed by lamenting to the accompaniment of [[Positive organ|''organo di legno'']] and ''[[chitarrone]]'', while [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] stands watch to the sound of a regal.\n\nThe keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument) player ''realizes'' (adds in an improvised fashion) a continuo part by playing, in addition to the notated bass line, notes above it to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are also expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices (notably the lead [[melody]] and any [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s that might be present in it) as a guide. Experienced players sometimes incorporate [[Motive (music)|motives]] found in the other instrumental parts into their improvised chordal accompaniment. Modern editions of such music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out in [[staff notation]] for a player, in place of improvisation. With the rise in [[historically informed performance]], however, the number of performers who are able to improvise their parts from the figures, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Notation==\nA part notated with figured bass consists of a [[bass line]] notated with [[Musical note|note]]s on a [[musical staff]] plus added numbers and [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s (or in some cases [[Backslash|(back)slash]]es added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what [[interval (music)|interval]]s above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which [[Inverted chord|inversions]] of which chords are to be played.\n\nThe phrase ''[[tasto solo]]'' indicates that only the bass line (without any upper chords) is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered. This instructs the chord-playing instrumentalist not to play any improvised chords for a period. The reason ''tasto solo'' had to be specified was because it was an accepted convention that if no figures were present in a section of otherwise figured bass line, the chord-playing performer would either assume that it was a [[root-position]] triad, or deduce from the harmonic motion that another figure was implied. For example, if a continuo part in the key of C begins with a C bass note in the first measure, which descends to a B{{music|natural}} in the second measure, even if there were no figures, the chord-playing instrumentalist would deduce that this was most likely a [[first inversion]] [[dominant chord]] (spelled B\u2013D\u2013G, from bottom note of the chord to the top).\n\nComposers were inconsistent in the usages described below. Especially in the 17th century, the numbers were omitted whenever the composer thought the chord was obvious.

Examples of its use in the 19th century are rarer, but they do exist: [[mass (music)|mass]]es by [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Franz Schubert]], for example, have a basso continuo part that was for an organist.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Baroque music]]\n[[Category:Bassline musicians]]\n[[Category:Chord progressions]]\n[[Category:Musical historicism]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=March 2020}}\n'''Basso continuo''' parts, almost universal in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era (1600\u20131750), provided the [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] structure of the music by supplying a [[bassline]] and a [[chord progression]]. The phrase is often shortened to ''continuo'', and the instrumentalists playing the continuo part are called the ''continuo group''.\n[[File:Soloquartet and strings.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A harpsichordist and a bassist play continuo for a small group of singers.]]\n\n==Forces==\nThe makeup of the continuo group is often left to the discretion of the performers (or, for a large performance, the [[conductor (music)|conductor]]), and practice varied enormously within the Baroque period. At least one instrument capable of playing chords must be included, such as a [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], [[organ (music)|organ]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]], [[guitar]], [[Regal (instrument)|regal]], or [[harp]]. In addition, any number of instruments that play in the [[bass (music)|bass]] register may be included, such as [[cello]], [[double bass]], [[viol|bass viol]], or [[bassoon]]. The most common combination, at least in modern performances, is harpsichord and cello for instrumental works and secular vocal works, such as [[opera]]s, and organ  and cello for [[sacred music]]. A double bass may be added, particularly when accompanying a lower-pitched solo voice (e.g., a bass singer).\n\nTypically performers match the [[Family (musical instruments)|instrument families]] used in the full ensemble: including bassoon when the work includes oboes or other winds, but restricting it to cello and/or [[double bass]] if only strings are involved. [[Harp]]s, lutes, and other handheld instruments are more typical of early 17th-century music. Sometimes instruments are specified by the composer: in ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) [[Monteverdi]] calls for an exceptionally varied instrumentation, with multiple harpsichords and lutes with a [[bass violin]] in the pastoral scenes followed by lamenting to the accompaniment of [[Positive organ|''organo di legno'']] and ''[[chitarrone]]'', while [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] stands watch to the sound of a regal.\n\nThe keyboard (or other chord-playing instrument) player ''realizes'' (adds in an improvised fashion) a continuo part by playing, in addition to the notated bass line, notes above it to complete chords, either determined ahead of time or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] in performance. The figured bass notation, described below, is a guide, but performers are also expected to use their musical judgment and the other instruments or voices (notably the lead [[melody]] and any [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s that might be present in it) as a guide. Experienced players sometimes incorporate [[Motive (music)|motives]] found in the other instrumental parts into their improvised chordal accompaniment. Modern editions of such music usually supply a realized keyboard part, fully written out in [[staff notation]] for a player, in place of improvisation. With the rise in [[historically informed performance]], however, the number of performers who are able to improvise their parts from the figures, as Baroque players would have done, has increased.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Figured bass notation==\nA part notated with figured bass consists of a [[bass line]] notated with [[Musical note|note]]s on a [[musical staff]] plus added numbers and [[Accidental (music)|accidental]]s (or in some cases [[Backslash|(back)slash]]es added to a number) beneath the staff to indicate what [[interval (music)|interval]]s above the bass notes should be played, and therefore which [[Inverted chord|inversions]] of which chords are to be played.\n\nThe phrase ''[[tasto solo]]'' indicates that only the bass line (without any upper chords) is to be played for a short period, usually until the next figure is encountered. This instructs the chord-playing instrumentalist not to play any improvised chords for a period. The reason ''tasto solo'' had to be specified was because it was an accepted convention that if no figures were present in a section of otherwise figured bass line, the chord-playing performer would either assume that it was a [[root-position]] triad, or deduce from the harmonic motion that another figure was implied. For example, if a continuo part in the key of C begins with a C bass note in the first measure, which descends to a B{{music|natural}} in the second measure, even if there were no figures, the chord-playing instrumentalist would deduce that this was most likely a [[first inversion]] [[dominant chord]] (spelled B\u2013D\u2013G, from bottom note of the chord to the top).\n\nComposers were inconsistent in the usages described below. Especially in the 17th century, the numbers were omitted whenever the composer thought the chord was obvious. Early composers such as [[Claudio Monteverdi]] often specified the octave by the use of [[interval (music)|compound intervals]] such as 10, 11, and 15.\n\n===Numbers===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+Common Conventional Symbols for Figured Bass\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: Silver\" |[[Triad (music)|Triads]]\n|-\n! align=\"center\" | Inversion\n! align=\"center\" | Intervals<br>above [[Bass note|bass]]\n! align=\"center\" | Symbol\n! align=\"center\" | Example\n|-\n|[[Root position]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{su|p=5|b=3}}\n| align=\"center\" | None\n| rowspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |<score lang=\"lilypond\">\n{\n     \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c' {\n                \\clef treble \\time 3/4\n                <e g c>4 <c g' c> <c e g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n           \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\time 3/4\n                c4 e g\n                }\n  \\figures {\n    < _ >4 <6> <6 4>\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n|-\n|[[First inversion|1st inversion]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{su|p=6|b=3}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|6 chord}}\n|-\n|[[Second inversion|2nd inversion]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{su|p=6|b=4}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|64 chord}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: Silver\" |[[Seventh chord]]s\n|-\n! align=\"center\" | Inversion\n! align=\"center\" | Intervals<br>above bass\n! align=\"center\" | Symbol\n! align=\"center\" | Example\n|-\n|Root position\n| align=\"center\" | {{overset|7|{{SubSup||3|5}}}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|7 chord}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |<score lang=\"lilypond\">\n    {\n     \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f\n      \\new PianoStaff <<\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\relative c' {\n                \\clef treble \\time 4/4\n                <b d f>4 <g d' f> <b f' g > <b d g>\n                }\n            >>\n        \\new Staff <<\n           \\relative c {\n                \\clef bass \\time 4/4\n                g4 b d f\n                }\n  \\figures {\n    <7>4 <6 5> <4 3> <4 2>\n  }\n            >>\n    >> }\n</score>\n|-\n|1st inversion\n| align=\"center\" | {{overset|6|{{SubSup||3|5}}}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|65 chord}}\n|-\n|2nd inversion\n| align=\"center\" | {{overset|6|{{SubSup||3|4}}}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|43 chord}}\n|-\n|[[Third inversion|3rd inversion]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{overset|6|{{SubSup||2|4}}}}\n| align=\"center\" | {{music|42 chord}} or {{music|2 chord}}\n|}\n\nContemporary figured bass abbreviations for triads and seventh chords are shown in the table to the right.\n\nThe numbers indicate the number of [[Scale (music)|scale]] steps above the given bass-line that a note should be played.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.colby.edu/academics_cs/courses/MU182A/upload/Figured-Bass-Notation.pdf|title=Figured Bass Notation|last=Vigil|first=R|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 14, 2018}}</ref> For example:\n\n:<score>{ \\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f \\time 6/4 \\clef bass << { c1 } \\figures { < 6 4 >1 } >> }</score>\n\nHere, the bass note is a C, and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above it should be played, that is an F and an A.

It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects [[radar]] waves, and it appeared that a warhead's signature would be different enough from decoys that a detector could pick out the warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional tracking radar on the single return from the warhead.<ref name=darpa/><ref name=press/>\n\nAlthough the concept appeared to offer a solution to the tracking problem, there was almost no information on either the physics of re-entry or a strong understanding of the normal composition of the upper layers of the [[ionosphere]]. ARPA began to address both simultaneously. To better understand the radar returns from a warhead, several radars were built on [[Kwajalein Atoll]], while Arecibo started with the dual purpose of understanding the ionosphere's F-layer while also producing a general-purpose scientific radio observatory.<ref name=darpa/><ref name=press/>\n\nThe observatory was built between mid-1960 and November 1963.

This design would have limited its use in other research areas, such as [[radar astronomy]], [[radio astronomy]] and atmospheric science, which require the ability to point at different positions in the sky and track those positions for an extended time as Earth rotates. Ward Low of the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) pointed out this flaw and put Gordon in touch with the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories|Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory]] (AFCRL) in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where one group headed by Phil Blacksmith was working on spherical reflectors and another group was studying the propagation of [[radio wave]]s in and through the upper atmosphere. Cornell University proposed the project to ARPA in mid-1958 and a contract was signed between the AFCRL and the University in November 1959. Cornell University and Zachary Sears published a request for proposals (RFP) asking for a design to support a feed moving along a spherical surface {{convert|435|ft|m|0}} above the stationary reflector. The RFP suggested a tripod or a tower in the center to support the feed. On the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna was announced at Cornell University, Gordon had also envisioned a {{convert|435|ft|m|abbr=on}} tower centered in the {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} reflector to support the feed.<ref>{{Citation\n| last  = Gordon\n| first = William\n| author-link = William E.

[[George Doundoulakis]] identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, (the most important area of the reflector), and devised a better design by suspending the [[antenna feed|feed]].<ref name=\"Fr\u00e8 276\"/><ref name=\"Gold 119\"/> He presented his proposal to [[Cornell University]] for a doughnut or [[torus]]-type [[truss]] suspended by four cables from four towers above the reflector, having along its edge a rail track for the [[azimuth]]al [[truss]] positioning. This second [[truss]], in the form of an arc, or [[arch]], was to be suspended below, which would rotate on the rails through 360 degrees. The arc also had rails on which the unit supporting the feed would move for the feed's elevational positioning. A [[counterweight]] would move symmetrically opposite to the feed for stability and, if a hurricane struck, the whole feed could be raised and lowered. [[Helias Doundoulakis]] designed the [[Wire rope|cable]] suspension system which was finally adopted. Although the present configuration is substantially the same as the original drawings by George and [[Helias Doundoulakis]], (although with three towers, instead of the original four as drawn in the original patent), the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent office]] granted [[Helias Doundoulakis]] a patent,<ref>{{US patent reference| number = 3273156| y = 1966| m = 09| d = 13| inventor = Helias Doundoulakis| title = Radio Telescope having a scanning feed supported by a cable suspension over a stationary reflector}}</ref> for the brothers' innovative idea. Two other assignees on the patent were friends [[William J. Casey]], who later became director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]], and Constantine Michalos, an attorney.\n\nThe idea of a spherical reflecting mirror with a steerable secondary has since been used in optical telescopes, in particular, the [[Hobby\u2013Eberly Telescope]] and the [[Southern African Large Telescope]].\n\nConstruction began in mid-1960, with the official opening on November 1, 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |title=Arecibo Observatory |publisher=History.com |accessdate=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314225635/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |archivedate=March 14, 2009 }}</ref> As the primary dish is [[spherical]], its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as would be the case for a [[parabolic reflector]]. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each line feed covered a narrow [[Frequency range|frequency band]]: 2\u20135% of the center frequency of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.\n\nSince then, the telescope has been upgraded several times. Initially, when the maximum expected operating frequency was about 500&nbsp;MHz, the surface consisted of half-inch galvanized wire mesh laid directly on the support cables. In 1974, a high-precision surface consisting of 40,000 individually adjustable aluminum panels replaced the old wire mesh, and the highest usable frequency rose to about 5000&nbsp;MHz. A [[Gregorian telescope|Gregorian reflector system]] was installed in 1997, incorporating secondary and tertiary reflectors to focus radio waves at one point. This allowed installing a suite of receivers, covering the full 1\u201310&nbsp;GHz range, that could be easily moved to the [[Focus (optics)|focal point]], giving Arecibo more flexibility. A metal mesh screen was also installed around the perimeter to block the ground's thermal radiation from reaching the feed antennas. Finally, a more powerful 2400&nbsp;MHz transmitter was added.\n\n{{wide image|Arecibo Radiotelescopio Panamorama SJU 06 2019 7446.jpg|1200px|Panoramic view of the Arecibo radio telescope primary dish}}\n\n== Research and discoveries ==\n[[File:Arecibo message.svg|125px|right|thumb|The [[Arecibo message]] with added color to highlight the separate parts.

It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects [[radar]] waves, and it appeared that a warhead's signature would be different enough from decoys that a detector could pick out the warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional tracking radar on the single return from the warhead.<ref name=darpa/><ref name=press/>\n\nAlthough the concept appeared to offer a solution to the tracking problem, there was almost no information on either the physics of re-entry or a strong understanding of the normal composition of the upper layers of the [[ionosphere]]. ARPA began to address both simultaneously. To better understand the radar returns from a warhead, several radars were built on [[Kwajalein Atoll]], while Arecibo started with the dual purpose of understanding the ionosphere's F-layer while also producing a general-purpose scientific radio observatory.<ref name=darpa/><ref name=press/>\n\nThe observatory was built between mid-1960 and November 1963. [[William E. Gordon]] of [[Cornell University]] oversaw its design, who intended to use it to study the Earth's [[ionosphere]].<ref name=\"Gold 119\">{{Citation\n| last    =Gold\n| first   =Thomas\n| author-link =Thomas Gold\n| date =2013\n| title    =Taking the Back off the Watch: A Personal Memoir\n| volume   =381\n| chapter  =7\n| chapter-url  =https://books.google.com/books?id=vlaFA0zgmSoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Taking+the+Back+off+the+Watch:+A+Personal+Memoir&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmprDCr-PcAhUnxYMKHY5BDUcQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=gordon&f=false\n| edition =1\n| publisher =Springer Heidelberg\n| location =New York\n| language =English\n| page  =119\n| isbn =978-3-642-27587-6\n| url =https://books.google.com/?id=vlaFA0zgmSoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Taking+the+Back+off+the+Watch+A+Personal+Memoir#v=onepage&q=Gordon%20&f=false\n| doi =10.1007/978-3-642-27588-3\n| series   =Astrophysics and Space Science Library\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Fr\u00e8 276\">{{Citation\n| last    =Fr\u00e8\n| first   =Pietro\n| date =2013\n| title    =Gravity, a geometrical course\n| chapter  =7\n| chapter-url  =https://books.google.com/books?id=1klJvLbHEQYC&pg=PA276&lpg=PA276&dq=radio+telescope+suspension+system&source=bl&ots=2XjStDiEUN&sig=vnY30y2qCwtEz5bMuhQ2K8gIQxY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjdqdv8rezZAhUGhuAKHUNGCvk4FBDoAQguMAE#v=onepage&q=radio%20telescope%20suspension%20system&f=false\n| edition =1\n| volume  =1:Development of the theory and basic physical applications\n| publisher =Springer\n| location =New York\n| language =English\n| page  =276\n| isbn =978-94-007-5360-0\n| doi =10.1007/978-94-007-5361-7\n| bibcode =2013ggc1.book.....F\n}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n | last =Matthews\n | first =John\n | title =A short history of geophysical radar at Arecibo Observatory\n | journal =History of Geo- and Space Sciences\n | volume =4\n | issue =1\n | page =20\n | year =2013\n | language =English\n | url =https://www.hist-geo-space-sci.net/4/19/2013/hgss-4-19-2013.pdf\n | doi =10.5194/hgss-4-19-2013\n | bibcode =2013HGSS....4...19M\n }}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n| last    =Cohen\n| first   =Marshall H.\n| year     =2009\n| title    =Genesis of the 1000-foot Arecibo dish\n| journal =Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage\n| volume  =12\n| issue   =2\n| language =English\n| pages =141\u2013152\n| url =http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2009JAHHvol12/2009JAHH...12..141C.pdf\n| bibcode =2009JAHH...12..141C\n}}\n</ref> He was attracted to the [[sinkholes]] in the [[karst]] regions of [[Puerto Rico]] that offered perfect cavities for a very large dish.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/history_center/arecibo.html| title=IEEE History Center: NAIC/Arecibo Radiotelescope, 1963| publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]| accessdate=2008-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher=National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center | url=http://www.naic.edu/history_gal/historicgal.html | title=Pictures of the construction of Arecibo Observatory (start to finish) | accessdate=2009-05-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090505205805/http://www.naic.edu/history_gal/historicgal.html| archivedate= May 5, 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| work= Acevedo, Tony (June 2004)| url= http://www.naic.edu/public/descrip_eng.htm| title= Description of Engineering of Arecibo Observatory| accessdate= 2009-05-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090504055743/http://www.naic.edu/public/descrip_eng.htm| archivedate= May 4, 2009| url-status= dead| df= mdy-all}}</ref> Originally, a fixed parabolic reflector was envisioned, pointing in a fixed direction with a {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} tower to hold equipment at the focus. This design would have limited its use in other research areas, such as [[radar astronomy]], [[radio astronomy]] and atmospheric science, which require the ability to point at different positions in the sky and track those positions for an extended time as Earth rotates. Ward Low of the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) pointed out this flaw and put Gordon in touch with the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories|Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory]] (AFCRL) in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where one group headed by Phil Blacksmith was working on spherical reflectors and another group was studying the propagation of [[radio wave]]s in and through the upper atmosphere. Cornell University proposed the project to ARPA in mid-1958 and a contract was signed between the AFCRL and the University in November 1959. Cornell University and Zachary Sears published a request for proposals (RFP) asking for a design to support a feed moving along a spherical surface {{convert|435|ft|m|0}} above the stationary reflector. The RFP suggested a tripod or a tower in the center to support the feed. On the day the project for the design and construction of the antenna was announced at Cornell University, Gordon had also envisioned a {{convert|435|ft|m|abbr=on}} tower centered in the {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} reflector to support the feed.<ref>{{Citation\n| last  = Gordon\n| first = William\n| author-link = William E.

[[George Doundoulakis]] identified the problem that a tower or tripod would have presented around the center, (the most important area of the reflector), and devised a better design by suspending the [[antenna feed|feed]].<ref name=\"Fr\u00e8 276\"/><ref name=\"Gold 119\"/> He presented his proposal to [[Cornell University]] for a doughnut or [[torus]]-type [[truss]] suspended by four cables from four towers above the reflector, having along its edge a rail track for the [[azimuth]]al [[truss]] positioning. This second [[truss]], in the form of an arc, or [[arch]], was to be suspended below, which would rotate on the rails through 360 degrees. The arc also had rails on which the unit supporting the feed would move for the feed's elevational positioning. A [[counterweight]] would move symmetrically opposite to the feed for stability and, if a hurricane struck, the whole feed could be raised and lowered. [[Helias Doundoulakis]] designed the [[Wire rope|cable]] suspension system which was finally adopted. Although the present configuration is substantially the same as the original drawings by George and [[Helias Doundoulakis]], (although with three towers, instead of the original four as drawn in the original patent), the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent office]] granted [[Helias Doundoulakis]] a patent,<ref>{{US patent reference| number = 3273156| y = 1966| m = 09| d = 13| inventor = Helias Doundoulakis| title = Radio Telescope having a scanning feed supported by a cable suspension over a stationary reflector}}</ref> for the brothers' innovative idea. Two other assignees on the patent were friends [[William J. Casey]], who later became director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] under President [[Ronald Reagan]], and Constantine Michalos, an attorney.\n\nThe idea of a spherical reflecting mirror with a steerable secondary has since been used in optical telescopes, in particular, the [[Hobby\u2013Eberly Telescope]] and the [[Southern African Large Telescope]].\n\nConstruction began in mid-1960, with the official opening on November 1, 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |title=Arecibo Observatory |publisher=History.com |accessdate=2008-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314225635/http://www.history.com/encyclopedia.do?vendorId=FWNE.fw..ar136000.a |archivedate=March 14, 2009 }}</ref> As the primary dish is [[spherical]], its focus is along a line rather than at one point, as would be the case for a [[parabolic reflector]]. As a result, complex line feeds were implemented to carry out observations. Each line feed covered a narrow [[Frequency range|frequency band]]: 2\u20135% of the center frequency of the band. A limited number of line feeds could be used at any one time, limiting the telescope's flexibility.\n\nSince then, the telescope has been upgraded several times. Initially, when the maximum expected operating frequency was about 500&nbsp;MHz, the surface consisted of half-inch galvanized wire mesh laid directly on the support cables. In 1974, a high-precision surface consisting of 40,000 individually adjustable aluminum panels replaced the old wire mesh, and the highest usable frequency rose to about 5000&nbsp;MHz. A [[Gregorian telescope|Gregorian reflector system]] was installed in 1997, incorporating secondary and tertiary reflectors to focus radio waves at one point. This allowed installing a suite of receivers, covering the full 1\u201310&nbsp;GHz range, that could be easily moved to the [[Focus (optics)|focal point]], giving Arecibo more flexibility. A metal mesh screen was also installed around the perimeter to block the ground's thermal radiation from reaching the feed antennas. Finally, a more powerful 2400&nbsp;MHz transmitter was added.\n\n{{wide image|Arecibo Radiotelescopio Panamorama SJU 06 2019 7446.jpg|1200px|Panoramic view of the Arecibo radio telescope primary dish}}\n\n== Research and discoveries ==\n[[File:Arecibo message.svg|125px|right|thumb|The [[Arecibo message]] with added color to highlight the separate parts.

The first of these operations was on June 13\u201314, 1964, using the call KP4BPZ. A dozen or so two-way contacts were made on 144 and 432&nbsp;MHz. On July 3 and July 24, 1965, KP4BPZ was again activated on 432&nbsp;MHz, making approximately 30 contacts on 432&nbsp;MHz during the limited time slots available.

His collection, 40 years in the making, was considered to have been the second largest in the world held privately and to have numbered over 1.5 million [[Biological specimen|specimens]]. Joicey was a [[fellow]] of the [[Zoological Society of London]], the [[Royal Geographical Society]], the [[Royal Entomological Society]], the [[Royal Horticultural Society]], and the [[Linnean Society of London]].\n\nJoicey employed specialist entomologists including [[George Talbot (entomologist)|George Talbot]] to curate his collection and financed numerous expeditions throughout the world to obtain previously unknown varieties. More than 190 scientific articles were produced during the active period of the Hill Museum. This body of research was described as \"a contribution to the study of the exotic Lepidoptera of very great scientific value\".<ref name=\"Riley\" />{{Rp|144}}\n\nJoicey's donations from his collection, made both during his life and following his death, contributed significantly to the quality and numerical predominance of the Lepidoptera collection held by the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London.

Its [[electric power]] was supplied by four [[radioisotope thermoelectric generators]] that provided a combined 155 watts at launch.\n\nIt was launched on March 2, 1972, by an [[Atlas-Centaur]] [[expendable launch system|expendable vehicle]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 36|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]]. Between July 15, 1972, and February 15, 1973, it became the first spacecraft to traverse the [[asteroid belt#Exploration|asteroid belt]].

This mission would ultimately be accomplished in the late 1970s by the two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes, but in order to prepare for it, NASA decided in 1964 to experiment with launching a pair of probes to the [[outer Solar System]].{{sfn|Launius|2004|p=36}} An advocacy group named the Outer Space Panel and chaired by American space scientist [[James A. Van Allen]], worked out the scientific rationale for exploring the outer planets.{{sfn|Van Allen|2001|p=155}}{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp=16}} NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard]] Spaceflight Center put together a proposal for a pair of \"Galactic Jupiter Probes\" that would pass through the asteroid belt and visit Jupiter. These were to be launched in 1972 and 1973 during favorable windows that occurred only a few weeks every 13 months. Launch during other time intervals would have been more costly in terms of propellant requirements.{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}}\n\nApproved by NASA in February 1969,{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}} the twin spacecraft were designated Pioneer F and Pioneer G before launch; later they were named ''Pioneer 10'' and ''[[Pioneer 11]]''. They formed part of the [[Pioneer program]],{{sfn|Burgess|1982|p=16}} a series of United States [[unmanned space missions]] launched between 1958 and 1978. This model was the first in the series to be designed for exploring the outer Solar System. Based on multiple proposals issued throughout the 1960s, the early mission objectives were to explore the interplanetary medium past the orbit of Mars, study the asteroid belt and assess the possible hazard to spacecraft traveling through the belt, and explore Jupiter and its environment.<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/> Later development-stage objectives included the probe closely approaching Jupiter to provide data on the effect the environmental radiation surrounding Jupiter would have on the spacecraft instruments.\n\nMore than 150 scientific experiments were proposed for the missions.{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=144}} The experiments to be carried on the spacecraft were selected in a series of planning sessions during the 1960s, then were finalized by early 1970. These would be to perform imaging and [[polarimetry]] of Jupiter and several of its satellites, make infrared and ultraviolet observations of Jupiter, detect asteroids and meteoroids, determine the composition of charged particles, and to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and the [[Zodiacal Light]].<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/> Observation of the spacecraft communications as it passed behind Jupiter would allow measurements of the planetary atmosphere, while tracking data would improve estimates of the mass of Jupiter and its moons.<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/>\n\n[[NASA Ames Research Center]], rather than Goddard, was selected to manage the project as part of the Pioneer program.{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}} The Ames Research Center, under the direction of Charles F. Hall, was chosen because of its previous experience with spin-stabilized spacecraft. The requirements called for a small, lightweight spacecraft which was magnetically clean and which could perform an interplanetary mission. It was to use spacecraft modules that had already been proven in the Pioneer 6 through 9 missions.<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/> Ames commissioned a documentary film by George Van Valkenburg titled \"Jupiter Odyssey\". It received numerous international awards, and is visible on Van Valkenburg's YouTube channel.\n\nIn February 1970, Ames awarded a combined $380 million contract to TRW for building both of the ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'' vehicles, bypassing the usual bidding process to save time. B. J. O'Brien and Herb Lassen led the TRW team that assembled the spacecraft.{{sfn|Dyer|1998|p=302}} Design and construction of the spacecraft required an estimated 25 million man-hours.{{sfn|Wolverton|2004|p=124}}  An engineer from TRW said \"This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/pioneer-beat-warranty|title= PIONEER BEAT 'WARRANTY'|magazine= Aviation Week |accessdate= 2017-09-15}}</ref>\n\nTo meet the schedule, the first launch would need to take place between February 29 and March 17 so that it could arrive at Jupiter in November 1974. This was later revised to an arrival date of December 1973 in order to avoid conflicts with other missions over the use of the [[Deep Space Network]] for communications, and to miss the period when Earth and Jupiter would be at opposite sides of the Sun. The encounter trajectory for ''Pioneer 10'' was selected to maximize the information returned about the radiation environment around Jupiter, even if this caused damage to some systems. It would come within about three times the radius of the planet, which was thought to be the closest it could approach and still survive the radiation. The trajectory chosen would give the spacecraft a good view of the sunlit side.{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp=16&ndash;19}}\n\n===Spacecraft design===\n[[File:Pioneer 10 systems diagram.svg|right|thumb|''Pioneer 10'' and ''Pioneer 11'' spacecraft diagram]]\nThe ''Pioneer 10'' bus measures {{convert|36|cm|in|sp=us}} deep and with six {{convert|76|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} long panels forming the hexagonal structure. The bus houses propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the eleven scientific instruments. The equipment compartment lay within an aluminum honeycomb structure to provide protection from [[meteoroid]]s. A layer of insulation, consisting of aluminized [[mylar]] and [[kapton]] blankets, provides passive thermal control.

They are positioned on two three-rod trusses, each {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length and 120 degrees apart. This was expected to be a safe distance from the sensitive scientific experiments carried on board. Combined, the RTGs provided 155&nbsp;W at launch, and decayed to 140&nbsp;W in transit to Jupiter. The spacecraft required 100&nbsp;W to power all systems.<ref name=\"PionOdys\"/>{{rp|44\u201345}} The generators are powered by the radioisotope fuel [[plutonium-238]], which is housed in a multi-layer capsule protected by a graphite heat shield.<ref name=skrabek_mcgrew1987/>\n\nThe pre-launch requirement for the SNAP-19 was to provide power for two years in space; this was greatly exceeded during the mission.<ref name=bennett_skrabek1996/> The plutonium-238 has a [[half-life]] of 87.74 years, so that after 29 years the radiation being generated by the RTGs was at 80% of its intensity at launch. However, steady deterioration of the [[thermocouple]] junctions led to a more rapid decay in electrical power generation, and by 2001 the total power output was 65&nbsp;W. As a result, later in the mission only selected instruments could be operated at any one time.<ref name=prd65_8/>\n\nThe space probe includes a redundant system of [[transceiver]]s, one attached to the narrow-beam, [[high-gain antenna]], the other to an omni-antenna and medium-gain antenna. The parabolic dish for the high-gain antenna is {{convert|2.74|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter and made from an aluminum honeycomb sandwich material. The spacecraft was spun about an axis that is parallel to the axis of this antenna so that it could remain oriented toward the Earth.<ref name=prd65_8/> Each transceiver is an 8&nbsp;W one and transmits data across the [[S-band]] using 2110&nbsp;MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292&nbsp;MHz for the downlink to Earth with the [[Deep Space Network]] tracking the signal.

The spacecraft includes two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of a processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system requires that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe.

Testing of the imaging system began, and the data were successfully received back at the Deep Space Network. A series of 16,000 commands were then uploaded to the spacecraft to control the flyby operations during the next sixty days. The orbit of the outer moon [[Sinope (moon)|Sinope]] was crossed on November 8. The [[bow shock]] of Jupiter's magnetosphere was reached on November 16, as indicated by a drop in the velocity of the [[solar wind]] from {{convert|451|km/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} to {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The [[magnetopause]] was passed through a day later. The spacecraft instruments confirmed that the magnetic field of Jupiter was inverted compared to that of Earth. By the 29th, the orbits of all of the outermost moons had been passed and the spacecraft was operating flawlessly.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79\u201393}}\n\nRed and blue pictures of Jupiter were being generated by the imaging photopolarimeter as the rotation of the spacecraft carried the instrument's field of view past the planet. These red and blue colors were combined to produce a synthetic green image, allowing a three-color combination to produce the rendered image. On November 26, a total of twelve such images were received back on Earth. By December 2, the image quality exceeded the best images made from Earth. These were being displayed in real-time back on Earth, and the Pioneer program would later receive an [[Emmy award]] for this presentation to the media. The motion of the spacecraft produced geometric distortions that later had to be corrected by computer processing.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79\u201393}} During the encounter, a total of more than 500 images were transmitted.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=170}}\n\nThe trajectory of the spacecraft took it along the magnetic equator of Jupiter, where the [[Particle radiation|ion radiation]] was concentrated.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=93}} Peak [[flux]] for this electron radiation is 10,000 times stronger than the maximum radiation around the Earth.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=126}} Starting on December 3, the radiation around Jupiter caused false commands to be generated. Most of these were corrected by contingency commands, but an image of [[Io (moon)|Io]] and a few close-ups of Jupiter were lost. Similar false commands would be generated on the way out from the planet.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79\u201393}} Nonetheless, ''Pioneer 10'' did succeed in obtaining images of the moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. The image of Ganymede showed low [[albedo]] features in the center and near the south pole, while the north pole appeared brighter. Europa was too far away to obtain a detailed image, although some albedo features were apparent.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=121}}\n\nThe trajectory of ''Pioneer 10'' was chosen to take it behind Io, allowing the [[Refraction|refractive effect]] of the moon's atmosphere on the radio transmissions to be measured. This demonstrated that the [[ionosphere]] of the moon was about {{convert|700|km|sp=us}} above the surface on the dayside, and the density ranged from 60,000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the dayside, down to 9,000 on the night face. An unexpected discovery was that Io was orbiting within a cloud of hydrogen that extended for about {{convert|805,000|km|sp=us}}, with a width and height of {{convert|402,000|km|sp=us}}. A smaller, {{convert|110,000|km|sp=us}} cloud was believed to have been detected near Europa.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=121}}\n\nIt was not until after ''Pioneer 10'' had cleared the asteroid belt that NASA selected a trajectory towards Jupiter that offered the slingshot effect that would send the spacecraft out of the Solar System.

This [[space exploration]] project was conducted by the [[NASA Ames Research Center]] in [[California]], and the space probe was manufactured by [[TRW Inc.]]\n\n''Pioneer 10'' was assembled around a hexagonal [[satellite bus|bus]] with a {{convert|2.74|m|sp=us|adj=on}} diameter parabolic dish [[Directional antenna|high-gain antenna]], and the spacecraft was [[Spin-stabilisation|spin stabilized]] around the axis of the antenna. Its [[electric power]] was supplied by four [[radioisotope thermoelectric generators]] that provided a combined 155 watts at launch.\n\nIt was launched on March 2, 1972, by an [[Atlas-Centaur]] [[expendable launch system|expendable vehicle]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 36|Cape Canaveral]], [[Florida]]. Between July 15, 1972, and February 15, 1973, it became the first spacecraft to traverse the [[asteroid belt#Exploration|asteroid belt]]. Photography of Jupiter began November 6, 1973, at a range of {{convert|25,000,000|km|sp=us}}, and about 500 images were transmitted. The closest approach to the planet was on December 4, 1973, at a range of {{convert|132,252|km|sp=us}}. During the mission, the on-board instruments were used to study the asteroid belt, the environment around Jupiter, the [[solar wind]], [[cosmic ray]]s, and eventually the far reaches of the Solar System and [[heliosphere]].<ref name=\"PionOdys\" />\n\n[[Radio communications]] were lost with ''Pioneer 10'' on January 23, 2003, because of the loss of electric power for its [[radio transmitter]], with the probe at a distance of {{convert|12|e9km|lk=out|sp=us}} from Earth.\n\n==Mission background==\n\n===History===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| image1    = Pioneer 10 Construction.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = ''Pioneer 10'' in the final stages of construction\n| image2    = Pioneer 10 on its kickmotor.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = ''Pioneer 10'' on a Star-37E kick motor just prior to being encapsulated for launch\n}}\nIn the 1960s, American aerospace engineer [[Gary Flandro]] of the NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] conceived of a mission, known as the [[Planetary Grand Tour]], that would exploit a rare alignment of the outer planets of the Solar System. This mission would ultimately be accomplished in the late 1970s by the two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes, but in order to prepare for it, NASA decided in 1964 to experiment with launching a pair of probes to the [[outer Solar System]].{{sfn|Launius|2004|p=36}} An advocacy group named the Outer Space Panel and chaired by American space scientist [[James A. Van Allen]], worked out the scientific rationale for exploring the outer planets.{{sfn|Van Allen|2001|p=155}}{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp=16}} NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard]] Spaceflight Center put together a proposal for a pair of \"Galactic Jupiter Probes\" that would pass through the asteroid belt and visit Jupiter. These were to be launched in 1972 and 1973 during favorable windows that occurred only a few weeks every 13 months. Launch during other time intervals would have been more costly in terms of propellant requirements.{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}}\n\nApproved by NASA in February 1969,{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}} the twin spacecraft were designated Pioneer F and Pioneer G before launch; later they were named ''Pioneer 10'' and ''[[Pioneer 11]]''. They formed part of the [[Pioneer program]],{{sfn|Burgess|1982|p=16}} a series of United States [[unmanned space missions]] launched between 1958 and 1978. This model was the first in the series to be designed for exploring the outer Solar System. Based on multiple proposals issued throughout the 1960s, the early mission objectives were to explore the interplanetary medium past the orbit of Mars, study the asteroid belt and assess the possible hazard to spacecraft traveling through the belt, and explore Jupiter and its environment.<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/> Later development-stage objectives included the probe closely approaching Jupiter to provide data on the effect the environmental radiation surrounding Jupiter would have on the spacecraft instruments.\n\nMore than 150 scientific experiments were proposed for the missions.{{sfn|Simpson|2001|p=144}} The experiments to be carried on the spacecraft were selected in a series of planning sessions during the 1960s, then were finalized by early 1970. These would be to perform imaging and [[polarimetry]] of Jupiter and several of its satellites, make infrared and ultraviolet observations of Jupiter, detect asteroids and meteoroids, determine the composition of charged particles, and to measure magnetic fields, plasma, cosmic rays and the [[Zodiacal Light]].<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/> Observation of the spacecraft communications as it passed behind Jupiter would allow measurements of the planetary atmosphere, while tracking data would improve estimates of the mass of Jupiter and its moons.<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/>\n\n[[NASA Ames Research Center]], rather than Goddard, was selected to manage the project as part of the Pioneer program.{{sfn|Burrows|1999|p=476}} The Ames Research Center, under the direction of Charles F. Hall, was chosen because of its previous experience with spin-stabilized spacecraft. The requirements called for a small, lightweight spacecraft which was magnetically clean and which could perform an interplanetary mission. It was to use spacecraft modules that had already been proven in the Pioneer 6 through 9 missions.<ref name=NASA_sp349_396/> Ames commissioned a documentary film by George Van Valkenburg titled \"Jupiter Odyssey\". It received numerous international awards, and is visible on Van Valkenburg's YouTube channel.\n\nIn February 1970, Ames awarded a combined $380 million contract to TRW for building both of the ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'' vehicles, bypassing the usual bidding process to save time. B. J. O'Brien and Herb Lassen led the TRW team that assembled the spacecraft.{{sfn|Dyer|1998|p=302}} Design and construction of the spacecraft required an estimated 25 million man-hours.{{sfn|Wolverton|2004|p=124}}  An engineer from TRW said \"This spacecraft is guaranteed for two years of interplanetary flight. If any component fails within that warranty period, just return the spacecraft to our shop and we will repair it free of charge.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url= http://aviationweek.com/awin/pioneer-beat-warranty|title= PIONEER BEAT 'WARRANTY'|magazine= Aviation Week |accessdate= 2017-09-15}}</ref>\n\nTo meet the schedule, the first launch would need to take place between February 29 and March 17 so that it could arrive at Jupiter in November 1974. This was later revised to an arrival date of December 1973 in order to avoid conflicts with other missions over the use of the [[Deep Space Network]] for communications, and to miss the period when Earth and Jupiter would be at opposite sides of the Sun. The encounter trajectory for ''Pioneer 10'' was selected to maximize the information returned about the radiation environment around Jupiter, even if this caused damage to some systems. It would come within about three times the radius of the planet, which was thought to be the closest it could approach and still survive the radiation. The trajectory chosen would give the spacecraft a good view of the sunlit side.{{sfn|Burrows|1990|pp=16&ndash;19}}\n\n===Spacecraft design===\n[[File:Pioneer 10 systems diagram.svg|right|thumb|''Pioneer 10'' and ''Pioneer 11'' spacecraft diagram]]\nThe ''Pioneer 10'' bus measures {{convert|36|cm|in|sp=us}} deep and with six {{convert|76|cm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} long panels forming the hexagonal structure. The bus houses propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the eleven scientific instruments. The equipment compartment lay within an aluminum honeycomb structure to provide protection from [[meteoroid]]s. A layer of insulation, consisting of aluminized [[mylar]] and [[kapton]] blankets, provides passive thermal control. Heat was generated by the dissipation of 70 to 120 [[watt]]s (W) from the electrical components inside the compartment.

They are positioned on two three-rod trusses, each {{convert|3|m|ft|sp=us}} in length and 120 degrees apart. This was expected to be a safe distance from the sensitive scientific experiments carried on board. Combined, the RTGs provided 155&nbsp;W at launch, and decayed to 140&nbsp;W in transit to Jupiter. The spacecraft required 100&nbsp;W to power all systems.<ref name=\"PionOdys\"/>{{rp|44\u201345}} The generators are powered by the radioisotope fuel [[plutonium-238]], which is housed in a multi-layer capsule protected by a graphite heat shield.<ref name=skrabek_mcgrew1987/>\n\nThe pre-launch requirement for the SNAP-19 was to provide power for two years in space; this was greatly exceeded during the mission.<ref name=bennett_skrabek1996/> The plutonium-238 has a [[half-life]] of 87.74 years, so that after 29 years the radiation being generated by the RTGs was at 80% of its intensity at launch. However, steady deterioration of the [[thermocouple]] junctions led to a more rapid decay in electrical power generation, and by 2001 the total power output was 65&nbsp;W. As a result, later in the mission only selected instruments could be operated at any one time.<ref name=prd65_8/>\n\nThe space probe includes a redundant system of [[transceiver]]s, one attached to the narrow-beam, [[high-gain antenna]], the other to an omni-antenna and medium-gain antenna. The parabolic dish for the high-gain antenna is {{convert|2.74|m|ft|sp=us}} in diameter and made from an aluminum honeycomb sandwich material. The spacecraft was spun about an axis that is parallel to the axis of this antenna so that it could remain oriented toward the Earth.<ref name=prd65_8/> Each transceiver is an 8&nbsp;W one and transmits data across the [[S-band]] using 2110&nbsp;MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292&nbsp;MHz for the downlink to Earth with the [[Deep Space Network]] tracking the signal. Data to be transmitted is passed through a [[convolution code|convolutional encoder]] so that most communication errors could be [[error detection and correction|corrected]] by the receiving equipment on Earth.<ref name=\"PionOdys\"/>{{rp|43}} The data transmission rate at launch was 256&nbsp;bit/s, with the rate degrading by about &minus;1.27&nbsp;millibit/s for each day during the mission.<ref name=prd65_8/>\n\nMuch of the computation for the mission is performed on Earth and transmitted to the spacecraft, where it was able to retain in memory up to five commands of the 222 possible entries by ground controllers. The spacecraft includes two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of a processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system requires that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe. A data storage unit is included to record up to 6,144 [[bytes]] of information gathered by the instruments.

Testing of the imaging system began, and the data were successfully received back at the Deep Space Network. A series of 16,000 commands were then uploaded to the spacecraft to control the flyby operations during the next sixty days. The orbit of the outer moon [[Sinope (moon)|Sinope]] was crossed on November 8. The [[bow shock]] of Jupiter's magnetosphere was reached on November 16, as indicated by a drop in the velocity of the [[solar wind]] from {{convert|451|km/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} to {{convert|225|km/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. The [[magnetopause]] was passed through a day later. The spacecraft instruments confirmed that the magnetic field of Jupiter was inverted compared to that of Earth. By the 29th, the orbits of all of the outermost moons had been passed and the spacecraft was operating flawlessly.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79\u201393}}\n\nRed and blue pictures of Jupiter were being generated by the imaging photopolarimeter as the rotation of the spacecraft carried the instrument's field of view past the planet. These red and blue colors were combined to produce a synthetic green image, allowing a three-color combination to produce the rendered image. On November 26, a total of twelve such images were received back on Earth. By December 2, the image quality exceeded the best images made from Earth. These were being displayed in real-time back on Earth, and the Pioneer program would later receive an [[Emmy award]] for this presentation to the media. The motion of the spacecraft produced geometric distortions that later had to be corrected by computer processing.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79\u201393}} During the encounter, a total of more than 500 images were transmitted.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=170}}\n\nThe trajectory of the spacecraft took it along the magnetic equator of Jupiter, where the [[Particle radiation|ion radiation]] was concentrated.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=93}} Peak [[flux]] for this electron radiation is 10,000 times stronger than the maximum radiation around the Earth.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=126}} Starting on December 3, the radiation around Jupiter caused false commands to be generated. Most of these were corrected by contingency commands, but an image of [[Io (moon)|Io]] and a few close-ups of Jupiter were lost. Similar false commands would be generated on the way out from the planet.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|pp=79\u201393}} Nonetheless, ''Pioneer 10'' did succeed in obtaining images of the moons [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. The image of Ganymede showed low [[albedo]] features in the center and near the south pole, while the north pole appeared brighter. Europa was too far away to obtain a detailed image, although some albedo features were apparent.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=121}}\n\nThe trajectory of ''Pioneer 10'' was chosen to take it behind Io, allowing the [[Refraction|refractive effect]] of the moon's atmosphere on the radio transmissions to be measured. This demonstrated that the [[ionosphere]] of the moon was about {{convert|700|km|sp=us}} above the surface on the dayside, and the density ranged from 60,000 electrons per cubic centimeter on the dayside, down to 9,000 on the night face. An unexpected discovery was that Io was orbiting within a cloud of hydrogen that extended for about {{convert|805,000|km|sp=us}}, with a width and height of {{convert|402,000|km|sp=us}}. A smaller, {{convert|110,000|km|sp=us}} cloud was believed to have been detected near Europa.{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=121}}\n\nIt was not until after ''Pioneer 10'' had cleared the asteroid belt that NASA selected a trajectory towards Jupiter that offered the slingshot effect that would send the spacecraft out of the Solar System. ''Pioneer 10'' was the first spacecraft to attempt such a maneuver and became a proof of concept for the missions that would follow. Such an extended mission was not originally something that was planned, but was planned for prior to launch.<ref>{{cite news|title=NASA says 'bye bye Birdie' to Pioneer 10 Spacecraft|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/10191839|accessdate=6 December 2017|work=The Salina Journal|date=13 June 1983}}</ref>\n\nAt the closest approach, the velocity of the spacecraft reached 132,000&nbsp;km/h,{{sfn|Fimmel|van_Allen|Burgess|1980|p=79}} and it came within {{convert|132,252|km|sp=us}} of the outer atmosphere of Jupiter.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community.

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen. Hence, [[emigrants]] from [[Suriname]] and [[Indonesia]] were shorter than some Chinese [[prisoners]] who used to live in the [[U.S.]] and [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baten |first1=J\u00f6rg |title=ANTHROPOMETRIC TRENDS IN SOUTHERN CHINA, 1830\u20131864 |journal=Australian Economic History Review |date=November 2008 |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=209\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Old Indonesian Peng family.jpg|thumb|left|1967 photo of [[Chinese Indonesians|Indonesian-Chinese]] family from [[Hubei]] ancestry, the second and third generations.]]\n\nFrom the mid-19th century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries such as the United States, Australia, Canada, Brazil, The United Kingdom, New Zealand, Argentina and the nations of Western Europe; as well as to Peru, Panama, and to a lesser extent to Mexico. Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

For over 400 years, Thai Chinese have largely intermarried and/or assimilated with their compatriots. The present Thai monarch, [[Chakri Dynasty]], is founded by King [[Rama I]] who himself is partly Chinese. His predecessor, King [[Taksin]] of the [[Thonburi Kingdom]], is the son of a Chinese immigrant from Guangdong Province and was born with a Chinese name.

The emergence of the [[Filipino mestizo|Mestizo class]] would later rise to the [[Principal\u00eda|noble Principalia class]], which later carried over and fueled the elite ruling classes of the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American era]] and later sovereign Philippines. Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community. Most of them in Singapore were once concentrated in [[Katong]].]]\n\nIn [[Myanmar]], the Chinese rarely intermarry (even amongst different Chinese linguistic groups), but have largely adopted the Burmese culture whilst maintaining Chinese cultural affinities. In [[Cambodia]], between 1965 and 1993, people with Chinese names were prevented from finding governmental employment, leading to a large number of people changing their names to a local, Cambodian name. Indonesia, and Myanmar were among the countries that do not allow birth names to be registered in foreign languages, including Chinese. But since 2003, the Indonesian government has allowed ethnic Chinese people to use their Chinese name or using their Chinese family name on their birth certificate.\n\n[[File:Sandakan Sabah PuuJihShihTemple-09.jpg|thumb|A [[Malaysian Chinese]] praying in [[Puu Jih Shih Temple]], [[Sandakan]], Sabah in front of [[Guanyin]] during [[Chinese New Year]] in 2013.]]\n\nIn Vietnam, all Chinese names can be pronounced by [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese readings]].

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities.

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.
