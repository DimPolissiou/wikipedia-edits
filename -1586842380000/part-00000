However, they also inhabit smaller woodlots as long as they have a scattering of tall trees.

They are self-assured on the vertical surfaces of large trees, but can seem awkward while feeding on small branches and vines. Pileated woodpeckers may also forage on or near the ground, especially around fallen, dead trees, which can contain a variety of insect life. They may forage around the sides of human homes or even cars, and can occasionally be attracted to suet-type feeders. Although they are less likely feeder visitors than smaller woodpeckers, pileateds may regularly be attracted to them in areas experiencing harsh winter conditions.\n\nUsually, pileated woodpeckers excavate their large nests in the cavities of dead trees. Woodpeckers make such large holes in dead trees that the holes can cause a small tree to break in half. The roost of a pileated woodpecker usually has multiple entrance holes. Pileated woodpeckers raise their young every year in a hole in a tree. In April, the hole made by the male attracts a female for mating and raising their young. Once the brood is raised, the pileated woodpeckers abandon the hole and do not use it the next year. When abandoned, these holes\u2014made similarly by all woodpeckers\u2014provide good homes in future years for many forest songbirds and a wide variety of other animals. Owls and tree-nesting ducks may largely rely on holes made by pileateds in which to lay their nests. Even mammals such as raccoons may use them. Other woodpeckers and smaller birds such as wrens may be attracted to pileated holes to feed on the insects found in them. Ecologically, the entire woodpecker family is important to the well being of many other bird species.

Its creed establishes its basic principles as believing in [[Jesus Christ]] and his [[crucifixion of Jesus|death]] on the cross so that humanity could have life, water [[baptism]] for the [[repentance]] of [[sin]], that to be saved one must be [[Born again Christianity|born again]] of the [[Holy Spirit]], and that one leader is the Divine ruler of  the [[Kingdom of God]]. The United House of Prayer for All People's sacred text is the [[Holy Bible]].\n\nThe first portion of the name is derived from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 56:7 where [[God]] says: \"Mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.\" (This is also found in [[Book of Matthew|Matthew]] 21:13, [[Book of Mark|Mark]] 11:17, and [[Book of Luke|Luke]] 19:46). The latter part is taken from \"[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 4:10\u201312 and [[Ephesians]] 2:20, which discusses [[Christianity|Christian]] salvation as being built on a figurative cornerstone, or rock,\"<ref name=\"dallam\"/> which \"is believed to be the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] as preached by the [[Apostle Peter]].\"<ref name=\"dallam\"/>\n\nThe United House of Prayer for All People believes that the word ''[[wikt:church|church]]'' means a group of Christians who are believers and worshippers in Christ and that the modern definition of ''church'' as a building, denomination, or institution is unbiblical according to the writings of the [[Bible|Holy Scriptures]] as recorded in Acts 9:31.\"<ref name=\"truth2005\">''The Truth and Facts of the United House of Prayer and the Most Honorable Bishop Dr. S.C. Madison'' (2005) p.30</ref> Therefore, the United House of Prayer does not see itself as a denomination.\n\n==History==\n\n===Bishop Grace===\n\nBishop Charles Manuel \"Sweet Daddy\" Grace was born [[Marcelino Manuel da Graca]], January 25, 1884, in Brava, Cape Verde Islands, a Portuguese possession off the west coast of Africa. He came to America on a ship called Freedom in 1903 and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts.\nAfter leaving his job as a railway cook, Grace began using the title bishop.<ref name=\"britannica\" /> In 1919, \"Daddy\" Grace, as parishioners knew him, built the first House of Prayer in West Wareham, Massachusetts at the cost of thirty-nine dollars.<ref name=uhopfap>{{cite web | url=http://www.tuhopfap.org/index2.html|title=Official Website of the United House of Prayer for All People|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> He later established branches in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E1D71739F934A25751C1A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=Harlem Church Is Outpost of Empire;House of Prayer Built Wide Holdings on Devotion to Sweet Daddy Grace|author1=Frantz, Douglas  |author2=Pulley, Brett |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1995-12-17|accessdate=2008-09-19 | newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:United House of Prayer for All People, Harlem.jpg|thumb|left|325px|The \"Mother House\" in [[Harlem, New York City]] was founded in 1920 by Bishop Grace; the congregation moved to this building after their first house burned down in 1947]]\n\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s, Grace traveled America preaching and establishing the United House of Prayer for all People. The constitution and bylaws of The United House of Prayer, promulgated in 1929, stated that the purpose of the organization in pertinent part was \"to erect and maintain places of worship and assembly where all people may gather prayer and to worship the [[Almighty God]], irrespective of denomination or creed.\"<ref name=\"uhopfap\" /> He traveled extensively throughout the [[Jim Crow laws|segregated]] [[Southern United States|South]] in the 1920s and 1930s preaching to integrated congregations years before the [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] struggles of the 1950s and 1960s and the religious [[ecumenical movement]]s which followed.\n\nOne of the principles that Grace taught which provoked controversy was the concept of one-man leadership. Grace used the Bible as his reference and taught that God only used one man at a time (e.g. [[Noah]], [[Moses]], and [[Jesus]]. One of the many criticisms made against Grace is the following statement which Grace is to have allegedly made in the early 1940s: \"Salvation is by Grace only. Grace has given God a vacation, and since He is on vacation, don't worry about Him.  If you sin against God, Grace can save you, but if you sin against Grace, God cannot save you.\"<ref name=\"britannica\" /><ref name=\"nytimes\" /><ref>Fauset, Arthur.  ''Black Gods of the Metropolis'', p.26</ref> Nonetheless, the \"interpretation of this point \u2013 that Grace claimed he himself was God \u2013 has been almost completely definitive in both academic and popular literature, and only a handful of writers have ever questioned it, usually as an aside.\"<ref name=\"dallam\">Dallam, Marie W. ''Daddy Grace: A Celebrity Preacher and His House of Prayer'', pp.57,87</ref> The most extensive research done by Danielle Brune Sigler on this statement shows that Mr. Fauset selectively quoted certain parts of the original message which changed the context.\"<ref name=\"dallam\"/> The original statement, spoken by a member and not Grace, shows that the members and Grace, himself, thought that he was not \"God himself\", but merely an \"intermediary\" and \"the path to salvation.\"<ref name=\"dallam\"/><ref name=dissertation>Brune, Danielle. \"Sweet Daddy Grace: The Life and Times of a Modern Day Prophet\" (Ph.D. diss., University of Texas, Austin, 2002), pp.64\u201371,170</ref>\n\nOne reason for the early success of the denomination is that offerings went directly to Grace for investment into products such as soap, stationery, tea, coffee, cookies, toothpaste, facial creams, talcum powder, hair dressing, and the ''Grace Magazine''.<ref name=\"britannica\" />\n\nBishop Grace died on January 12, 1960, at his home in Los Angeles, California. Bishop W. McCollough succeeded him and served for 31 years.\n\n===Bishop McCollough===\n\nWhen Grace died he left the church with an unclear succession. After winning a court fight and two elections, Walter McCollough succeeded Grace as the second bishop.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> Bishop McCollough launched a nationwide building program. Through this program, low-income and affordable housing was being erected. New church structures were built by their own construction teams and other edifices received major renovations, financed solely by the members. Day care centers and senior citizens homes were also erected. One of the unique features of Daddy McCollough's building programs was that all of the church structures were completely paid for at the time of dedication.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n[[Image:United House of Prayer for All People Washington DC.JPG|thumb|right|250px|United House of Prayer for All People in the [[Shaw, Washington, D.C.|Shaw]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.]]\n\nUnder his leadership, the House of Prayer acquired a fleet of luxury coach buses; property was acquired for the House of Prayer for use as future development sites; concert and marching bands were organized to march in annual parades and annual competitions; and softball teams were organized, nationwide, for interstate competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\nIn addition, the McCollough Scholarship Fund was established which allowed youth of the church to pursue higher education. Bishop McCollough died on March 21, 1991.<ref name=\"uhopfap\" />\n\n===Bishop Madison===\n\nOnce again a crisis occurred over the succession, with Charles McCollough, a son of the late Bishop McCollough, and Samuel Christian Madison, the Senior Minister of \"God's White House\", struggling for control of the church.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> On May 24, 1991, the members voted Madison to the office of Bishop. Shortly after, Madison pledged to fulfill everything that was on Bishop McCollough's agenda. Under his administration, over 123 Houses of Prayer received major renovation or were constructed. Added to this number were numerous apartments, senior citizens' dwellings, parsonages, houses, and commercial properties.\n\nBishop Madison was an advocate for scholastic achievement and was the chief executive officer and major contributor to the McCollough Scholarship College Fund.

Its creed establishes its basic principles as believing in [[Jesus Christ]] and his [[crucifixion of Jesus|death]] on the cross so that humanity could have life, water [[baptism]] for the [[repentance]] of [[sin]], that to be saved one must be [[Born again Christianity|born again]] of the [[Holy Spirit]], and that one leader is the Divine ruler of  the [[Kingdom of God]]. The United House of Prayer for All People's sacred text is the [[Holy Bible]].\n\nThe first portion of the name is derived from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 56:7 where [[God]] says: \"Mine house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.\" (This is also found in [[Book of Matthew|Matthew]] 21:13, [[Book of Mark|Mark]] 11:17, and [[Book of Luke|Luke]] 19:46). The latter part is taken from \"[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 4:10\u201312 and [[Ephesians]] 2:20, which discusses [[Christianity|Christian]] salvation as being built on a figurative cornerstone, or rock,\"<ref name=\"dallam\"/> which \"is believed to be the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] as preached by the [[Apostle Peter]].\"<ref name=\"dallam\"/>\n\nThe United House of Prayer for All People believes that the word ''[[wikt:church|church]]'' means a group of Christians who are believers and worshippers in Christ and that the modern definition of ''church'' as a building, denomination, or institution is unbiblical according to the writings of the [[Bible|Holy Scriptures]] as recorded in Acts 9:31.\"<ref name=\"truth2005\">''The Truth and Facts of the United House of Prayer and the Most Honorable Bishop Dr. S.C. Madison'' (2005) p.30</ref> Therefore, the United House of Prayer does not see itself as a denomination.\n\n==History==\n\n===Bishop Grace===\n\nBishop Charles Manuel \"Sweet Daddy\" Grace was born [[Marcelino Manuel da Graca]], January 25, 1884, in Brava, Cape Verde Islands, a Portuguese possession off the west coast of Africa. He came to America on a ship called Freedom in 1903 and settled in New Bedford, Massachusetts.\nAfter leaving his job as a railway cook, Grace began using the title bishop.<ref name=\"britannica\" /> In 1919, \"Daddy\" Grace, as parishioners knew him, built the first House of Prayer in West Wareham, Massachusetts at the cost of thirty-nine dollars.<ref name=uhopfap>{{cite web | url=http://www.tuhopfap.org/index2.html|title=Official Website of the United House of Prayer for All People|accessdate=2008-04-18}}</ref> He later established branches in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Newark, New Jersey]].<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E1D71739F934A25751C1A963958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=Harlem Church Is Outpost of Empire;House of Prayer Built Wide Holdings on Devotion to Sweet Daddy Grace|author1=Frantz, Douglas  |author2=Pulley, Brett |lastauthoramp=yes |date=1995-12-17|accessdate=2008-09-19 | newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:United House of Prayer for All People, Harlem.jpg|thumb|left|325px|The \"Mother House\" in [[Harlem, New York City]] was founded in 1920 by Bishop Grace; the congregation moved to this building after their first house burned down in 1947]]\n\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s, Grace traveled America preaching and establishing the United House of Prayer for all People. The constitution and bylaws of The United House of Prayer, promulgated in 1929, stated that the purpose of the organization in pertinent part was \"to erect and maintain places of worship and assembly where all people may gather prayer and to worship the [[Almighty God]], irrespective of denomination or creed.\"<ref name=\"uhopfap\" /> He traveled extensively throughout the [[Jim Crow laws|segregated]] [[Southern United States|South]] in the 1920s and 1930s preaching to integrated congregations years before the [[civil rights movement|civil rights]] struggles of the 1950s and 1960s and the religious [[ecumenical movement]]s which followed.\n\nOne of the principles that Grace taught which provoked controversy was the concept of one-man leadership. Grace used the Bible as his reference and taught that God only used one man at a time (e.g. [[Noah]], [[Moses]], and [[Jesus]]. One of the many criticisms made against Grace is the following statement which Grace is to have allegedly made in the early 1940s: \"Salvation is by Grace only. Grace has given God a vacation, and since He is on vacation, don't worry about Him.  If you sin against God, Grace can save you, but if you sin against Grace, God cannot save you.\"<ref name=\"britannica\" /><ref name=\"nytimes\" /><ref>Fauset, Arthur.  ''Black Gods of the Metropolis'', p.26</ref> Nonetheless, the \"interpretation of this point \u2013 that Grace claimed he himself was God \u2013 has been almost completely definitive in both academic and popular literature, and only a handful of writers have ever questioned it, usually as an aside.\"<ref name=\"dallam\">Dallam, Marie W. ''Daddy Grace: A Celebrity Preacher and His House of Prayer'', pp.57,87</ref> The most extensive research done by Danielle Brune Sigler on this statement shows that Mr. Fauset selectively quoted certain parts of the original message which changed the context.\"<ref name=\"dallam\"/> The original statement, spoken by a member and not Grace, shows that the members and Grace, himself, thought that he was not \"God himself\", but merely an \"intermediary\" and \"the path to salvation.\"<ref name=\"dallam\"/><ref name=dissertation>Brune, Danielle. \"Sweet Daddy Grace: The Life and Times of a Modern Day Prophet\" (Ph.D. diss., University of Texas, Austin, 2002), pp.64\u201371,170</ref>\n\nOne reason for the early success of the denomination is that offerings went directly to Grace for investment into products such as soap, stationery, tea, coffee, cookies, toothpaste, facial creams, talcum powder, hair dressing, and the ''Grace Magazine''.<ref name=\"britannica\" />\n\nBishop Grace died on January 12, 1960, at his home in Los Angeles, California. Bishop W. McCollough succeeded him and served for 31 years.\n\n===Bishop McCollough===\n\nWhen Grace died he left the church with an unclear succession. After winning a court fight and two elections, Walter McCollough succeeded Grace as the second bishop.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> Bishop McCollough launched a nationwide building program. Through this program, low-income and affordable housing was being erected. New church structures were built by their own construction teams and other edifices received major renovations, financed solely by the members. Day care centers and senior citizens homes were also erected. One of the unique features of Daddy McCollough's building programs was that all of the church structures were completely paid for at the time of dedication.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n[[Image:United House of Prayer for All People Washington DC.JPG|thumb|right|250px|United House of Prayer for All People in the [[Shaw, Washington, D.C.|Shaw]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.]]\n\nUnder his leadership, the House of Prayer acquired a fleet of luxury coach buses; property was acquired for the House of Prayer for use as future development sites; concert and marching bands were organized to march in annual parades and annual competitions; and softball teams were organized, nationwide, for interstate competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\nIn addition, the McCollough Scholarship Fund was established which allowed youth of the church to pursue higher education. Bishop McCollough died on March 21, 1991.<ref name=\"uhopfap\" />\n\n===Bishop Madison===\n\nOnce again a crisis occurred over the succession, with Charles McCollough, a son of the late Bishop McCollough, and Samuel Christian Madison, the Senior Minister of \"God's White House\", struggling for control of the church.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> On May 24, 1991, the members voted Madison to the office of Bishop. Shortly after, Madison pledged to fulfill everything that was on Bishop McCollough's agenda. Under his administration, over 123 Houses of Prayer received major renovation or were constructed. Added to this number were numerous apartments, senior citizens' dwellings, parsonages, houses, and commercial properties.\n\nBishop Madison was an advocate for scholastic achievement and was the chief executive officer and major contributor to the McCollough Scholarship College Fund.

ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet the needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the [[Economy|economic]], [[social]] and [[Biophysical environment|environmental]] dimensions of sustainable development.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{Cite book|title=Issues and trends in education for sustainable development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100244-1|location=Paris|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n==== Concept ====\nThe concept of [[Monitoring Education for Sustainable Development|ESD]] was born from the need for [[education]] to address the growing and changing  environmental challenges facing the [[planet]]. In order to do this, [[education]] must change to provide the [[knowledge]], skills, values and attitudes that empower [[learner]]s to contribute to sustainable development. At the same time, [[education]] must be strengthened in all agendas, programmes, and activities that promote sustainable development. Sustainable development must be integrated into [[education]] and education must be integrated into sustainable development. ESD promotes the integration of these critical sustainability issues in local and global contexts into the [[curriculum]] to prepare [[Learning|learners]] to understand and respond to the changing world. ESD aims to produce [[Educational aims and objectives|learning outcomes]] that include core competencies such as critical and systematic [[Thought|thinking]], collaborative [[decision-making]], and taking responsibility for the present and [[future generation]]s. Since traditional single-directional delivery of [[knowledge]] is not sufficient to inspire learners to take action as [[Citizenship|responsible citizens]], ESD entails rethinking the [[Learning environment|learning environmen]]<nowiki/>t, physical and virtual. The learning environment itself must adapt and apply a whole-institution approach to embed the philosophy of sustainable development. Building the capacity of [[Education|educators]] and policy support at international, regional, national and local levels helps drive changes in [[learning institution]]s. Empowered youth and local communities interacting with education institutions become key actors in advancing sustainable development.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==== UN Decade for Sustainable Development ====\nThe launch of the UN Decade of [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (2005-2014) started a global movement to reorient education to address the challenges of sustainable development. Building on the achievement of the Decade, stated in the Aichi-Nagoya Declaration on ESD, [[UNESCO]] endorsed the Global Action Programme on ESD (GAP) in the 37th session of its General Conference. Acknowledged by [[UN general assembly|UN General Assembly]] Resolution A/RES/69/211 and launched at the UNESCO World Conference on ESD in 2014, the GAP aims to scale-up actions and good practices. UNESCO has a major role, along with its partners, in bringing about key achievements to ensure the principles of [[Education for sustainable development|ESD]] are promoted through formal, non-formal and [[informal education]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Issues and trends in education for sustainable development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100244-1|location=Paris|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nInternational recognition of ESD as the key enabler for sustainable development is growing steadily. The role of ESD was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 [[Earth Summit|UN Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, [[South Africa]]; and the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|UN Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements such as the [[Paris Agreement]] (Article 12) also recognize the importance of ESD. Today, ESD is arguably at the heart of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] and its 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas - people, [[planet]], prosperity, [[peace]] and [[partnership]] - in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of [[human]]ity. ESD is explicitly mentioned in Target 4.7 of SDG4, which aims to ensure that all [[Learning|learners]] acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development and is understood as an important means to achieve all the other 16 SDGs (UNESCO, 2017).<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==Sub-groups==\n{{See also|Planetary boundaries|Triple bottom line}}\n{{Pillars of sustainability|Scheme of sustainable development: <br/ >at the confluence of three constituent parts.

This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nAn unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.<ref>See Horizon 2020 \u2013 the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm</ref> A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.<ref>{{cite journal |date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |issue = 5|title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545\u2013557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennstr\u00f6m | first5 = Anders}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269694158 |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H.

Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.\n\n====Agriculture====\n{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}\nSustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems.

Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|issue=9|doi=10.1068/a221259|pages=1259\u20131266|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.1749}}</ref>\n\nBenefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n====Energy====\n{{Main|Smart grid|Sustainable energy}}\nSustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time.

This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.<ref>Schaltegger, S. & Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Z\u00fcrich: vdf.</ref>  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: \"Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity\" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).<ref>DeSimone, L. & Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref>\n\nSimilar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130\u2013141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}</ref> describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nBoth eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\"/> point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=William|last2=Tilley|first2=Fiona|date=2006|title=Can businesses move beyond efficiency?

This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed.

This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy consumption and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nRecent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}</ref>\n\n===Natural capital===\n[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]\nThe sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\"/> Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],<ref name=hd01/> for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAnother problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nc-es/edout/albenutrient.html|title=Nutrients: Too Much of a Good Thing|last=Newcomb|first=Doug|date=|website=United States Fish and Wildlife Service|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012180755/http://www.fws.gov/nc-es/edout/albenutrient.html|archivedate=2006-10-12|accessdate=17 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Business-as-usual===\n[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]\nIf the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it.

Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason\u2014often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a \"business as usual\" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Education===\n''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''\n\nEducation must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: 'An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\n== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==\n{{Criticism section|date=August 2019}}\n{{Essay|section|date=August 2019}}\n{{undue weight|section|date=August 2019}}\nIt has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from \"conservation management\" to \"economic development\", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.<ref name=to01/>{{rp|48\u201354}}\n\nIn the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.<ref name=to01/>{{rp|48\u201354}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.\n\nBut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).<ref name=kt01/>{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall \"sustainable development\" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: \"It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and reduction in use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock.\"<ref name=kt01/>{{rp|13}}\n\nIn effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.<ref name=ngr01/>{{rp|20f}} <ref name=jr01/>{{rp|61\u201367}} <ref name=hd01/>{{rp|22f}} <ref>{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard C.

After World War II, the notion of \"development\" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations\u2014as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out\u2014as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed \"a change in the ''quality'' of growth\". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before\u2014and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of \"sustainable development\" has marched on worldwide.<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|94\u201399}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Applied sustainability]]\n*[[Biocapacity]]\n*[[Circles of Sustainability]]\n*[[Circular economy]]\n*[[Computational sustainability]]\n*[[Conservation biology]]\n*[[Conservation development]]\n*[[Cradle-to-cradle]]\n*[[Cultural footprint]]\n*[[Development Studies]]\n*[[Ecological economics]]\n*[[Ecological deficit]]\n*[[Ecological footprint]]\n*[[Ecological modernization]]\n*[[Ecologically sustainable development]]\n*[[Environmental issue]]\n*[[Environmental justice]]\n*[[Environmental racism]]\n*[[Earth system governance]]\n*[[Farmer Research Committee]]\n*[[Futures of Education]]\n*[[Gender and development]]\n*[[Green development]]\n*[[Micro-sustainability]]\n*[[Outline of sustainability]]\n*[[Overshoot (population)|Overshoot]]\n*[[Purple economy]]\n*[[Regenerative design]]\n*[[Social sustainability]]\n*[[Sustainable coffee]]\n*[[Sustainable Development Goals]]\n*[[Sustainable fishery]]\n*[[Sustainable forest management]]\n*[[Sustainable land management]]\n*[[Sustainable living]]\n*[[Sustainable redevelopment]]\n*[[Sustainable yield]]\n*[[Sustainopreneurship]]\n*[[Weak and strong sustainability]]\n*[[Zero-carbon city]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 32-33\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232555&set=00581C72C5_2_460&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Issues and trends in education for sustainable development\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 276\n| source = UNESDOC\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261445\n| license statement URL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261445\n| license = CC BY-SA\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Faiz|title=An Examination of the Development Path Taken by Small Island Developing States|url=http://www.islandvulnerability.org/m/ahmedm.pdf|year=2008|access-date=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003211109/http://www.islandvulnerability.org/m/ahmedm.pdf|archive-date=3 October 2012|url-status=dead}} (pp.&nbsp;17\u201326)\n* Atkinson, G., S.

This, in turn, influenced people like [[Gifford Pinchot]], first head of the [[US Forest Service]], whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and [[Aldo Leopold]] whose [[land ethic]] was influential in the development of the [[environmental movement]] in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Grober2\" /><ref name=\"Blewitt-2015\"/>\n\nFollowing the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between [[economic growth]] and development and [[environmental degradation]].

ESD aims to empower and equip current and future generations to meet the needs using a balanced and integrated approach to the [[Economy|economic]], [[social]] and [[Biophysical environment|environmental]] dimensions of sustainable development.<ref name=\"UNESCO\">{{Cite book|title=Issues and trends in education for sustainable development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100244-1|location=Paris|pages=7}}</ref>\n\n==== Concept ====\nThe concept of [[Monitoring Education for Sustainable Development|ESD]] was born from the need for [[education]] to address the growing and changing  environmental challenges facing the [[planet]]. In order to do this, [[education]] must change to provide the [[knowledge]], skills, values and attitudes that empower [[learner]]s to contribute to sustainable development. At the same time, [[education]] must be strengthened in all agendas, programmes, and activities that promote sustainable development. Sustainable development must be integrated into [[education]] and education must be integrated into sustainable development. ESD promotes the integration of these critical sustainability issues in local and global contexts into the [[curriculum]] to prepare [[Learning|learners]] to understand and respond to the changing world. ESD aims to produce [[Educational aims and objectives|learning outcomes]] that include core competencies such as critical and systematic [[Thought|thinking]], collaborative [[decision-making]], and taking responsibility for the present and [[future generation]]s. Since traditional single-directional delivery of [[knowledge]] is not sufficient to inspire learners to take action as [[Citizenship|responsible citizens]], ESD entails rethinking the [[Learning environment|learning environmen]]<nowiki/>t, physical and virtual. The learning environment itself must adapt and apply a whole-institution approach to embed the philosophy of sustainable development. Building the capacity of [[Education|educators]] and policy support at international, regional, national and local levels helps drive changes in [[learning institution]]s. Empowered youth and local communities interacting with education institutions become key actors in advancing sustainable development.<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==== UN Decade for Sustainable Development ====\nThe launch of the UN Decade of [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (2005-2014) started a global movement to reorient education to address the challenges of sustainable development. Building on the achievement of the Decade, stated in the Aichi-Nagoya Declaration on ESD, [[UNESCO]] endorsed the Global Action Programme on ESD (GAP) in the 37th session of its General Conference. Acknowledged by [[UN general assembly|UN General Assembly]] Resolution A/RES/69/211 and launched at the UNESCO World Conference on ESD in 2014, the GAP aims to scale-up actions and good practices. UNESCO has a major role, along with its partners, in bringing about key achievements to ensure the principles of [[Education for sustainable development|ESD]] are promoted through formal, non-formal and [[informal education]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Issues and trends in education for sustainable development|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100244-1|location=Paris|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nInternational recognition of ESD as the key enabler for sustainable development is growing steadily. The role of ESD was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 [[Earth Summit|UN Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, [[Brazil]]; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, [[South Africa]]; and the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|UN Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro. Other key global agreements such as the [[Paris Agreement]] (Article 12) also recognize the importance of ESD. Today, ESD is arguably at the heart of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]] and its 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) (United Nations, 2015). The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas - people, [[planet]], prosperity, [[peace]] and [[partnership]] - in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of [[human]]ity. ESD is explicitly mentioned in Target 4.7 of SDG4, which aims to ensure that all [[Learning|learners]] acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development and is understood as an important means to achieve all the other 16 SDGs (UNESCO, 2017).<ref name=\"UNESCO\"/>\n\n==Sub-groups==\n{{See also|Planetary boundaries|Triple bottom line}}\n{{Pillars of sustainability|Scheme of sustainable development: <br/ >at the confluence of three constituent parts.

A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development.

When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H.

Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.\n\n====Agriculture====\n{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}\nSustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems.

Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|issue=9|doi=10.1068/a221259|pages=1259\u20131266|citeseerx=10.1.1.335.1749}}</ref>\n\nBenefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n====Energy====\n{{Main|Smart grid|Sustainable energy}}\nSustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time.

This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.<ref>Levine, Jonathan. 2013. \"Urban Transportation and Social Equity: Transportation Planning Paradigms that Impede Policy Reform,\" in Naomi Carmon and Susan S.

This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.<ref>Schaltegger, S. & Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Z\u00fcrich: vdf.</ref>  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: \"Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity\" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).<ref>DeSimone, L. & Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref>\n\nSimilar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\">{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130\u2013141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}</ref> describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nBoth eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts<ref name=\"Dyllick, T. 2002\"/> point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=William|last2=Tilley|first2=Fiona|date=2006|title=Can businesses move beyond efficiency?

This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed.

While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAnother problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity.

Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason\u2014often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a \"business as usual\" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Education===\n''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''\n\nEducation must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: 'An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31\u201332}}</ref>\n\n== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==\n{{Criticism section|date=August 2019}}\n{{Essay|section|date=August 2019}}\n{{undue weight|section|date=August 2019}}\nIt has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from \"conservation management\" to \"economic development\", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.<ref name=to01/>{{rp|48\u201354}}\n\nIn the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.<ref name=to01/>{{rp|48\u201354}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.\n\nBut shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).<ref name=kt01/>{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall \"sustainable development\" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: \"It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and reduction in use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock.\"<ref name=kt01/>{{rp|13}}\n\nIn effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.<ref name=ngr01/>{{rp|20f}} <ref name=jr01/>{{rp|61\u201367}} <ref name=hd01/>{{rp|22f}} <ref>{{cite journal |last=Duncan |first=Richard C. |authorlink=Richard C.

After World War II, the notion of \"development\" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations\u2014as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out\u2014as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed \"a change in the ''quality'' of growth\". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before\u2014and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of \"sustainable development\" has marched on worldwide.<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|94\u201399}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Agroecology]]\n*[[Applied sustainability]]\n*[[Biocapacity]]\n*[[Circles of Sustainability]]\n*[[Circular economy]]\n*[[Computational sustainability]]\n*[[Conservation biology]]\n*[[Conservation development]]\n*[[Cradle-to-cradle]]\n*[[Cultural footprint]]\n*[[Development Studies]]\n*[[Ecological economics]]\n*[[Ecological deficit]]\n*[[Ecological footprint]]\n*[[Ecological modernization]]\n*[[Ecologically sustainable development]]\n*[[Environmental issue]]\n*[[Environmental justice]]\n*[[Environmental racism]]\n*[[Earth system governance]]\n*[[Farmer Research Committee]]\n*[[Futures of Education]]\n*[[Gender and development]]\n*[[Green development]]\n*[[Micro-sustainability]]\n*[[Outline of sustainability]]\n*[[Overshoot (population)|Overshoot]]\n*[[Purple economy]]\n*[[Regenerative design]]\n*[[Social sustainability]]\n*[[Sustainable coffee]]\n*[[Sustainable Development Goals]]\n*[[Sustainable fishery]]\n*[[Sustainable forest management]]\n*[[Sustainable land management]]\n*[[Sustainable living]]\n*[[Sustainable redevelopment]]\n*[[Sustainable yield]]\n*[[Sustainopreneurship]]\n*[[Weak and strong sustainability]]\n*[[Zero-carbon city]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 32-33\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232555&set=00581C72C5_2_460&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n}}\n\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Issues and trends in education for sustainable development\n| author = \n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 276\n| source = UNESDOC\n| documentURL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261445\n| license statement URL = https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000261445\n| license = CC BY-SA\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|60em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Faiz|title=An Examination of the Development Path Taken by Small Island Developing States|url=http://www.islandvulnerability.org/m/ahmedm.pdf|year=2008|access-date=19 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003211109/http://www.islandvulnerability.org/m/ahmedm.pdf|archive-date=3 October 2012|url-status=dead}} (pp.&nbsp;17\u201326)\n* Atkinson, G., S.

Several locations in the town are designated stops along a scenic holiday route, the [[Romanesque Road]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Quedlinburg asv2018-10 img41 Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Castle]]\n\nThe town of Quedlinburg is known to have existed since at least the early 9th century, when there was a settlement known as ''Gross Orden'' on the eastern bank of the River [[Bode River|Bode]]. It was first mentioned as a town in 922 as part of a donation by King [[Henry the Fowler]] (''Heinrich der Vogler''). The records of this donation were held by the abbey of [[Corvey]].\n\nAccording to legend, Henry had been offered the German crown at Quedlinburg in 919 by Franconian nobles, giving rise to the town being called the \"cradle of the German Reich\".<ref name=\"Booklet\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nAfter Henry's death in 936, his widow [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Saint Matilda]] founded a religious community for women (''[[Frauenstift]]'') on the castle hill, where daughters of the higher nobility were educated. The main task of this collegiate foundation, [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], was to pray for the memory of King Henry and the rulers who came after him. The ''[[Annals of Quedlinburg]]'' were also compiled there. The first abbess was Matilda, a granddaughter of King Henry and St. Matilda.\n\nThe Quedlinburg castle complex, founded by King Henry I and built up by [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]] in 936, was an imperial ''[[Kaiserpfalz|Pfalz]]'' of the Saxon emperors. The ''Pfalz'', including the  male convent, was in the valley, where today the Roman Catholic Church of ''St. Wiperti'' is situated, while the women's convent was located on the castle hill.\n\nIn 973, shortly before the death of [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]], a ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (Imperial Convention) was held at the imperial court in which [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]], duke of [[Polans (western)|Polans]], and [[Boleslav I of Bohemia|Boleslav]], duke of [[Bohemia]], as well as numerous other nobles from as far away as [[Byzantium]] and [[Bulgaria]], gathered to pay homage to the emperor. On the occasion, Otto the Great introduced his new daughter-in-law [[Theophanu]], a Byzantine princess whose marriage to [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] brought hope for recognition and continued peace between the rulers of the Eastern and Western empires.\n\nIn 994, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] granted the right of market, tax, and coining, and established the first market place to the north of the castle hill.\n\nThe town became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1426. Quedlinburg Abbey frequently disputed the independence of the town, which sought the aid of the [[Bishopric of Halberstadt]]. In 1477, [[Hedwig, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Hedwig]], aided by her brothers [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]], broke the resistance of the town and expelled the bishop's forces. Quedlinburg was forced to leave the Hanseatic League and was subsequently protected by the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. Both town and abbey converted to [[Lutheranism]] in 1539 during the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 1697, Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]] of Saxony sold his rights to Quedlinburg to Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III of Brandenburg]] for 240,000 thalers. Quedlinburg Abbey contested [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]'s claims throughout the 18th century, however. The abbey was secularized in 1802 during the [[German Mediatisation]], and Quedlinburg passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as part of the Principality of Quedlinburg.<!--(? -- this might be Halberstadt as there is no evidence that Quedlinburg ever became a principality) --> Part of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807\u201313, it was included within the new Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] in 1815. In all this time, ladies ruled Quedlinburg as abbesses without \"taking the veil\"; they were free to marry. The last of these ladies was a Swedish princess, an early fighter for women's rights, [[Sophia Albertina, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Sofia Albertina]].\n\nDuring the [[Nazism|Nazi regime]], the memory of Henry I became a sort of cult, as [[Heinrich Himmler]] saw himself as the reincarnation of the \"most German of all German\" rulers. The collegiate church and castle were to be turned into a shrine for [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazi Party tried to create a new religion. The cathedral was closed from 1938 and during the war. The local [[crematory]] was kept busy burning the victims of the [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] concentration camp. [[Georg Ay]] was local party chief from 1931 until the end of the war. Liberation in 1945 brought back the Protestant bishop and the church bells, and the Nazi-style eagle was taken down from the tower.\n\nDuring the last months of World War II, the [[United States military]] had occupied Quedlinburg. In the 1980s, upon the death of one of the US military men, the [[theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg]] came to light.\n\nQuedlinburg was administered within [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic|Bezirk]] [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] while part of the Communist [[East Germany]] from 1949 to 1990. It became part of the state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] upon [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nDuring Quedlinburg's Communist era, restoration specialists from [[Poland]] were called in during the 1980s to carry out repairs on the old architecture. Today, Quedlinburg is a center of restoration of [[Timber framing#German tradition or Fachwerkh\u00e4user|''Fachwerk'']] houses.\n[[File:Quedlinburg asv2018-10 img27 Roland.jpg|thumb|[[Roland]]]]\n\nQuedlinburg is the setting for the acclaimed 2016 [[Frantz (film)]], serving as a quintessential small German town in the wake of WWI, home to the family who is reeling from the death of a son in the war.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nThe town is located north of the [[Harz]] mountains, about 123 m above [[Normalh\u00f6hennull|NHN]].

The ''Pfalz'', including the  male convent, was in the valley, where today the Roman Catholic Church of ''St. Wiperti'' is situated, while the women's convent was located on the castle hill.\n\nIn 973, shortly before the death of [[Otto the Great|Emperor Otto I]], a ''[[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (Imperial Convention) was held at the imperial court in which [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]], duke of [[Polans (western)|Polans]], and [[Boleslav I of Bohemia|Boleslav]], duke of [[Bohemia]], as well as numerous other nobles from as far away as [[Byzantium]] and [[Bulgaria]], gathered to pay homage to the emperor. On the occasion, Otto the Great introduced his new daughter-in-law [[Theophanu]], a Byzantine princess whose marriage to [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto II]] brought hope for recognition and continued peace between the rulers of the Eastern and Western empires.\n\nIn 994, [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] granted the right of market, tax, and coining, and established the first market place to the north of the castle hill.\n\nThe town became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1426. Quedlinburg Abbey frequently disputed the independence of the town, which sought the aid of the [[Bishopric of Halberstadt]]. In 1477, [[Hedwig, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Hedwig]], aided by her brothers [[Ernest, Elector of Saxony|Ernest]] and [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Albert]], broke the resistance of the town and expelled the bishop's forces. Quedlinburg was forced to leave the Hanseatic League and was subsequently protected by the [[Electorate of Saxony]]. Both town and abbey converted to [[Lutheranism]] in 1539 during the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 1697, Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I]] of Saxony sold his rights to Quedlinburg to Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III of Brandenburg]] for 240,000 thalers. Quedlinburg Abbey contested [[Brandenburg-Prussia]]'s claims throughout the 18th century, however. The abbey was secularized in 1802 during the [[German Mediatisation]], and Quedlinburg passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] as part of the Principality of Quedlinburg.<!--(? -- this might be Halberstadt as there is no evidence that Quedlinburg ever became a principality) --> Part of the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] from 1807\u201313, it was included within the new Prussian [[Province of Saxony]] in 1815. In all this time, ladies ruled Quedlinburg as abbesses without \"taking the veil\"; they were free to marry. The last of these ladies was a Swedish princess, an early fighter for women's rights, [[Sophia Albertina, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Sofia Albertina]].\n\nDuring the [[Nazism|Nazi regime]], the memory of Henry I became a sort of cult, as [[Heinrich Himmler]] saw himself as the reincarnation of the \"most German of all German\" rulers. The collegiate church and castle were to be turned into a shrine for [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazi Party tried to create a new religion. The cathedral was closed from 1938 and during the war. The local [[crematory]] was kept busy burning the victims of the [[Langenstein-Zwieberge]] concentration camp. [[Georg Ay]] was local party chief from 1931 until the end of the war. Liberation in 1945 brought back the Protestant bishop and the church bells, and the Nazi-style eagle was taken down from the tower.\n\nDuring the last months of World War II, the [[United States military]] had occupied Quedlinburg. In the 1980s, upon the death of one of the US military men, the [[theft of medieval art from Quedlinburg]] came to light.\n\nQuedlinburg was administered within [[Administrative division of the German Democratic Republic|Bezirk]] [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] while part of the Communist [[East Germany]] from 1949 to 1990. It became part of the state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] upon [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nDuring Quedlinburg's Communist era, restoration specialists from [[Poland]] were called in during the 1980s to carry out repairs on the old architecture. Today, Quedlinburg is a center of restoration of [[Timber framing#German tradition or Fachwerkh\u00e4user|''Fachwerk'']] houses.\n[[File:Quedlinburg asv2018-10 img27 Roland.jpg|thumb|[[Roland]]]]\n\nQuedlinburg is the setting for the 2016 [[Frantz (film)]],serving as a quintessential small German town in the wake of WWI, home to the family who is reeling from the death of a son in the war.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nThe town is located north of the [[Harz]] mountains, about 123 m above [[Normalh\u00f6hennull|NHN]]. The nearest mountains reach 181 m above NHN. The largest part of the town is located in the western part of the [[Bode (river)|Bode]] river valley.

July and August are the hottest months, with an average temperature of 17&nbsp;\u00b0C (63&nbsp;\u00b0F) and 18&nbsp;\u00b0C (64&nbsp;\u00b0F). The average annual precipitation is close to 438&nbsp;mm with rain occurring usually from May to September.
