In July 2011, Cramton Bowl hosted the [[Alabama High School Athletic Association]] Alabama All-Stars Sports Week football game.\n\n==2011 renovations==\nBy the start of the 21st century, Cramton Bowl was widely regarded as being functionally obsolete for major sporting events. The stadium's relatively small capacity was not a concern as much as its age and condition. The stadium was not well maintained for most of its history, and by the dawn of the new millennium, it was actually crumbling. These issues were factors, although not the predominant ones, in the Blue-Gray Game not being held in 2002 and its subsequent relocation in 2003 to [[Troy University]]'s [[Veterans Memorial Stadium (Troy University)|Veterans Memorial Stadium]], about 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) from Montgomery.\n\nIn mid-2010 the City of Montgomery approved a measure for a $10 million renovation and addition to Cramton Bowl. The renovations planned for Cramton Bowl were a unique mix of the old and the new. The old structure was revamped and updated with four entrances, a state-of-the-art press box, an aesthetically enhanced plaza area, and a \"Walk of Fame,\" which celebrates Montgomery's sports history and houses various articles of historic sports memorabilia. Perhaps the most important and impressive addition was the {{convert|90,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} multi-purpose sports facility.<ref name=Conversion/> Demolition of the north end zone and press box began in late November 2010, which was phase one of the project. Phase two began in early January 2011 as crews removed an existing brick wall from the south end zone and dismantled the scoreboard to make way for the new multi-purpose sports facility. Work on the stadium was completed in 2011 while the new multi-purpose facility was finished in 2012.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20101128/SPORTS0403/11280347/1002/rss03\n | title = Cramton Bowl to get a facelift: Stadium to be joined by an indoor arena\n | accessdate = 2010-11-28\n | author = Gayle, Tim\n | url-status = dead\n | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130208121159/http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20101128/SPORTS0403/11280347/1002/rss03\n | archivedate = 2013-02-08\n }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20110127/SPORTS/101270341/1002/rss03\n | title = Cramton Bowl renovation work reveals hidden rooms\n | accessdate = 2011-01-27\n | author = Gayle, Tim\n | url-status = dead\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110219202324/http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20110127/SPORTS/101270341/1002/rss03\n | archivedate = 2011-02-19\n }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Cramton Bowl}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Alabama State University}}\n{{Alabama State Hornets football navbox}}\n{{Southwestern Athletic Conference football venue navbox}}\n{{Alabama Crimson Tide football navbox}}\n{{Alabama college football venues}}\n{{Camellia Bowl navbox}}\n{{NCAA Division I FBS bowl game stadium navbox}}\n\n[[Category:College football venues]]\n[[Category:High school football venues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football venues]]\n[[Category:Alabama State Hornets football]]\n[[Category:Faulkner Eagles football]]\n[[Category:American football venues in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Montgomery, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Alabama State Hornets and Lady Hornets sports venues]]\n[[Category:Negro league baseball venues still standing]]\n[[Category:1922 establishments in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1922]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox stadium\n| stadium_name      = Cramton Bowl\n| image             = Cramton Bowl Feb 2012 03.jpg\n| image_size        = 250px\n| caption           = Cramton Bowl in 2012\n| location          = 1022 Madison Avenue,<br />[[Montgomery, Alabama]] 36107\n| coordinates       = {{coord|32.37949|-86.293002|type:landmark_scale:10000_region:US|display=it}}\n| pushpin_map         = USA Alabama#USA\n| pushpin_relief      = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption = Location in Alabama##Location in the United States\n| opened            = 1922\n| owner             = City of Montgomery\n| operator          = \n| seating_capacity  = 25,000\n| surface           = UBU Speed S5\n| tenants           =  [[Camellia Bowl (2014\u2013present)|Camellia Bowl]] ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]]) (2014\u2013)<br>[[FCS Kickoff]] ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]]) (2017\u2013)<br>[[Blue\u2013Gray Football Classic]] (1939\u20132001)<br>[[Montgomery Public Schools]]<br>[[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State Hornets]] ([[Southwestern Athletic Conference|SWAC]]) (1923\u20132012)<br>[[Faulkner University|Faulkner Eagles]] ([[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]]) (2007\u2013present)<br>[[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama Crimson Tide]] ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]) (1922\u20131954)<br>[[Chattanooga Lookouts]] ([[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]) (1943)<br>[[Montgomery Rebels]] ([[Southeastern League]]) (1938\u20131949)<br>[[Montgomery Bombers]] ([[Southeastern League]]) (1937)<br>[[Montgomery Lions]] ([[Southeastern League]]) (1927\u20131930)\n}}\n'''Cramton Bowl''' is a 25,000-seat [[stadium]] located in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].

It was also home to the [[Turkey Day Classic]] and in 2009 hosted the inaugural [[Historically black colleges and universities|HBCU]] [[All-star]] Bowl.\n\nCramton Bowl also provided a location for [[Alabama Crimson Tide football]] home games in the capital city. The Crimson Tide played home games at Cramton Bowl in the [[1922 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1922]] through [[1932 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1932 seasons]], in [[1934 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1934]], from [[1944 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1944]] through [[1946 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1946]] and again from [[1951 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1951]] through [[1954 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1954]].

In July 2011, Cramton Bowl hosted the [[Alabama High School Athletic Association]] Alabama All-Stars Sports Week football game.\n\n==2011 renovations==\nBy the start of the 21st century, Cramton Bowl was widely regarded as being functionally obsolete for major sporting events. The stadium's relatively small capacity was not a concern as much as its age and condition. The stadium was not well maintained for most of its history, and by the dawn of the new millennium, it was actually crumbling. These issues were factors, although not the predominant ones, in the Blue-Gray Game not being held in 2002 and its subsequent relocation in 2003 to [[Troy University]]'s [[Veterans Memorial Stadium (Troy University)|Veterans Memorial Stadium]], about 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) from Montgomery.\n\nIn mid-2010 the City of Montgomery approved a measure for a $10 million renovation and addition to Cramton Bowl. The renovations planned for Cramton Bowl were a unique mix of the old and the new. The old structure was revamped and updated with four entrances, a state-of-the-art press box, an aesthetically enhanced plaza area, and a \"Walk of Fame,\" which celebrates Montgomery's sports history and houses various articles of historic sports memorabilia. Perhaps the most important and impressive addition was the {{convert|90,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} multi-purpose sports facility.<ref name=Conversion/> Demolition of the north end zone and press box began in late November 2010, which was phase one of the project. Phase two began in early January 2011 as crews removed an existing brick wall from the south end zone and dismantled the scoreboard to make way for the new multi-purpose sports facility. Work on the stadium was completed in 2011 while the new multi-purpose facility was finished in 2012.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20101128/SPORTS0403/11280347/1002/rss03\n | title = Cramton Bowl to get a facelift: Stadium to be joined by an indoor arena\n | accessdate = 2010-11-28\n | author = Gayle, Tim\n | url-status = dead\n | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130208121159/http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20101128/SPORTS0403/11280347/1002/rss03\n | archivedate = 2013-02-08\n }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20110127/SPORTS/101270341/1002/rss03\n | title = Cramton Bowl renovation work reveals hidden rooms\n | accessdate = 2011-01-27\n | author = Gayle, Tim\n | url-status = dead\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110219202324/http://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/article/20110127/SPORTS/101270341/1002/rss03\n | archivedate = 2011-02-19\n }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Cramton Bowl}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Alabama State University}}\n{{Alabama State Hornets football navbox}}\n{{Southwestern Athletic Conference football venue navbox}}\n{{Alabama Crimson Tide football navbox}}\n{{Alabama college football venues}}\n{{Camellia Bowl navbox}}\n{{NCAA Division I FBS bowl game stadium navbox}}\n\n[[Category:College football venues]]\n[[Category:High school football venues in the United States]]\n[[Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football venues]]\n[[Category:Alabama State Hornets football]]\n[[Category:Faulkner Eagles football]]\n[[Category:American football venues in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in Montgomery, Alabama]]\n[[Category:Alabama State Hornets and Lady Hornets sports venues]]\n[[Category:Negro league baseball venues still standing]]\n[[Category:1922 establishments in Alabama]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1922]]\n", "name_user": "Dale Arnett", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCollege football", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramton_Bowl"}

Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, [[desert]] environments. Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear [[prey]] moving underground. It mainly eats [[Insect|insects]], small [[Mammal|mammals]], and [[Bird|birds]].\n\nThe fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild. Its main predators are the African varieties of [[Verreaux's eagle-owl|eagle owl]], [[Jackal|jackals]], and other large mammals. Families of fennecs dig out [[Burrow|dens]] in the sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as {{convert|120|sqm|0|abbr=on}} and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the genus ''[[Vulpes]]''; however, this is debated due to differences between the fennec fox and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, the animal is considered an [[exotic pet]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe fennec fox weighs about {{convert|0.7|-|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with a body length of between {{convert|24|-|41|cm|0|abbr=on}}; it is around {{convert|20.3|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall.

Its coat, ears, and kidney functions have adapted to high-temperature, low-water, [[desert]] environments. Also, its hearing is sensitive enough to hear [[prey]] moving underground. It mainly eats [[Insect|insects]], small [[Mammal|mammals]], and [[Bird|birds]].\n\nThe fennec has a life span of up to 14 years in captivity and about 10 years in the wild. Its main predators are the African varieties of [[Verreaux's eagle-owl|eagle owl]], [[Jackal|jackals]], and other large mammals. Families of fennecs dig out [[Burrow|dens]] in the sand for habitation and protection, which can be as large as {{convert|120|sqm|0|abbr=on}} and adjoin the dens of other families. Precise population figures are not known but are estimated from the frequency of sightings; these indicate that the animal is currently not threatened by extinction. Knowledge of social interactions is limited to information gathered from captive animals. The species is usually assigned to the genus ''[[Vulpes]]''; however, this is debated due to differences between the fennec fox and other fox species. The fennec's fur is prized by the indigenous peoples of North Africa, and in some parts of the world, the animal is considered an [[exotic pet]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe fennec fox weighs about {{convert|0.7|-|1.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with a body length of between {{convert|24|-|41|cm|0|abbr=on}}; it is around {{convert|20.3|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall.

This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.\n\nIt is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. [[Aluminium]] capsules of {{CO2}} are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for [[air gun]]s, [[paintball]] markers/guns, inflating bicycle tires, and for making [[carbonated water]]. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests.

It does not itself react to extinguish the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents and carbon dioxide|fire extinguishers]], especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because although it excludes oxygen, it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that, unlike water or other chemical based methods, Carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits, leading to even more damage to equipment. Because it is a gas, it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in IT infrastructure rooms, where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space.<ref>National Fire Protection Association Code 12</ref> [[International Maritime Organization]] standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of {{CO2}} systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report (2000), causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.<ref>Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks, US EPA. 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as solvent ===\n{{See also|Supercritical carbon dioxide}}\n\nLiquid carbon dioxide is a good [[solvent]] for many [[lipophilic]] [[organic compound]]s and is used to remove [[caffeine]] from [[coffee]].<ref name=Tsotsas/> Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the [[pharmaceutical]] and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as [[organochloride]]s.

Solid carbon dioxide is called \"dry ice\" and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical. Solid carbon dioxide is always below {{convert|-78.5|C|F}} at regular atmospheric pressure, regardless of the air temperature.\n\n{{anchor|R744}} Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 or R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and may enjoy a renaissance due to the fact that [[R134a]] contributes to [[climate change]] more than {{CO2}} does. Its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to 130 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (1880 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]), {{CO2}} systems require highly resistant components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors. In automobile air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50\u00b0, R744 operates more efficiently than systems using R134a.

Concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this (range of 3,000 or 4,000).\n\nMiners, who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to an insufficient ventilation, referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as \"[[blackdamp]],\" \"choke damp\" or \"stythe.\" Before more effective technologies were developed, [[miners]] would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged [[Domestic Canary|canary]] with them as they worked. The canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans, and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch. The [[Davy lamp]] could also detect high levels of blackdamp (which sinks, and collects near the floor) by burning less brightly, while [[methane]], another suffocating gas and explosion risk, would make the lamp burn more brightly.\n\nIn February 2020, three people died from suffocation at a party in Moscow when dry ice (frozen CO2) was added to a swimming pool to cool it down.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51680049</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Human physiology ===\n\n==== Content ====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+[[Reference range]]s or averages for [[partial pressure of carbon dioxide|partial pressures of carbon dioxide]] (abbreviated p{{CO2}})\n|-\n! !!

However, the {{CO2}} bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of {{CO2}} decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. This is known as the [[Haldane Effect]], and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of {{CO2}} or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the [[Bohr effect]].\n\n==== Regulation of respiration ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}\nCarbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its concentration is high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.\n\nBicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of {{CO2}} in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].\n\nAlthough the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing [[air hunger]]. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the [[oxygen mask]] to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness.<ref name=\"solarnav\"/>\n\nThe respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial {{CO2}} pressure of 40&nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the {{CO2}} content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10\u201320&nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Chemistry}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Arterial blood gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Bosch reaction}}\n* {{annotated link|Bottled gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon dioxide sensor}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon sequestration}}\n* {{annotated link|Cave of Dogs}}\n* {{annotated link|EcoCute}} \u2013 as refrigerants\n* {{annotated link|Emission standard}}s\n* {{annotated link|Indoor air quality#Carbon dioxide|Indoor air quality}}\n* {{annotated link|Kaya identity}}\n* {{annotated link|Lake Kivu}}\n* {{annotated link|List of least carbon efficient power stations}}\n* {{annotated link|List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions}}\n* {{annotated link|Meromictic lake}}\n* {{annotated link|pCO2}}\n* {{annotated link|Gilbert Plass}} (early work on {{CO2}} and climate change)\n* {{annotated link|Sabatier reaction}}\n* NASA's {{annotated link|Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2}}\n* {{annotated link|Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |first=O.A. |last=Sepp\u00e4nen |last2=Fisk |first2=W.J. |last3=Mendell |first3=M.J. |title=Association of Ventilation Rates and {{CO2}} Concentrations with Health and Other Responses in Commercial and Institutional Buildings |journal=Indoor Air |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=226\u2013252 |date=December 1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.1999.00003.x |pmid=10649857 |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227032839/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Shendell |first=D.G. |last2=Prill |first2=R. |last3=Fisk |first3=W.J. |last4=Apte |first4=M.G. |last5=Blake |first5=D. |last6=Faulkner |first6=D. |title=Associations between classroom {{CO2}} concentrations and student attendance in Washington and Idaho |journal=Indoor Air |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=333\u2013341 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00251.x |pmid=15330793 |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227030811/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all |hdl=2376/5954 }}\n* {{cite journal |first=Jens |last=Soentgen |title= Hot air: The science and politics of {{CO2}} |journal=Global Environment |volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages= 134\u2013171 |date= February 2014 |doi= 10.3197/197337314X13927191904925 }}\n* {{cite book |title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines: a recommended practice guidance document |url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines-recommended-practice-guidance-document |publisher=Energy Institute and Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute |date=1 Sep 2010 |website=Global CCS Institute |quote=This new title is an essential guide for engineers, managers, procurement specialists and designers working on global carbon capture and storage projects. |access-date=2 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001428/https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines-recommended-practice-guidance-document |archive-date=7 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Library resources box |lcheading=Carbon dioxide}}\n* {{ICSC|0021}}<!-- in general: {{ICSC|AllDigits|TwoDigits}} -->\n* [http://sdsdata.org/68399 Carbon dioxide MSDS] by Amerigas in the SDSdata.org database.\n* [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0103.html CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards \u2013 Carbon Dioxide]\n* [http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html {{CO2}} Carbon Dioxide Properties, Uses, Applications]\n* [http://www.dryiceinfo.com/science.htm Dry Ice information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070225181531/http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide] (NOAA)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=RicDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 \"A War Gas That Saves Lives\"].

He found that [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) could be heated or treated with [[acid]]s to yield a gas he called \"fixed air.\" He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and supported neither flame nor animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through [[limewater]] (a saturated aqueous solution of [[calcium hydroxide]]), it would [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation.

Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more [[brittle]] than those made in more inert atmospheres.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} It is used as a welding gas primarily because it is much less expensive than more inert gases such as [[argon]] or [[helium]].{{citation needed|reason=why not use nitrogen?|date=July 2015}}  When used for [[MIG welding]], {{CO2}} use is sometimes referred to as MAG welding, for Metal Active Gas, as {{CO2}} can react at these high temperatures. It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres, improving the flow characteristics. Although, this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site. This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.\n\nIt is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. [[Aluminium]] capsules of {{CO2}} are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for [[air gun]]s, [[paintball]] markers/guns, inflating bicycle tires, and for making [[carbonated water]]. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests. Liquid carbon dioxide is used in [[supercritical drying]] of some food products and technological materials, in the preparation of specimens for [[scanning electron microscopy]]<ref name=Nordestgaard>{{cite journal |first1=B.G. |last1=Nordestgaard |first2=J. |last2=Rostgaard |date=1985 |journal=Journal of Microscopy |title=Critical\u2010point drying versus freeze drying for scanning electron microscopy: a quantitative and qualitative study on isolated hepatocytes |volume=137 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013207 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.1985.tb02577.x |pmid=3989858 }}</ref> and in the [[decaffeination]] of [[coffee]] beans.\n\n=== Fire extinguisher ===\n[[File:US Army 53023 Fire Prevention Week.jpg|thumb|Use of a {{CO2}} fire extinguisher.]]\nCarbon dioxide can be used to extinguish flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas. It does not itself react to extinguish the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents and carbon dioxide|fire extinguishers]], especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because although it excludes oxygen, it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that, unlike water or other chemical based methods, Carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits, leading to even more damage to equipment. Because it is a gas, it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in IT infrastructure rooms, where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space.<ref>National Fire Protection Association Code 12</ref> [[International Maritime Organization]] standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of {{CO2}} systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report (2000), causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.<ref>Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks, US EPA. 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as solvent ===\n{{See also|Supercritical carbon dioxide}}\n\nLiquid carbon dioxide is a good [[solvent]] for many [[lipophilic]] [[organic compound]]s and is used to remove [[caffeine]] from [[coffee]].<ref name=Tsotsas/> Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the [[pharmaceutical]] and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as [[organochloride]]s.

Solid carbon dioxide is called \"dry ice\" and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical. Solid carbon dioxide is always below {{convert|-78.5|C|F}} at regular atmospheric pressure, regardless of the air temperature.\n\n{{anchor|R744}} Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 or R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and may enjoy a renaissance due to the fact that [[R134a]] contributes to [[climate change]] more than {{CO2}} does. Its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to 130 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (1880 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]), {{CO2}} systems require highly resistant components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors. In automobile air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50\u00b0, R744 operates more efficiently than systems using R134a. Its environmental advantages ([[Global warming potential|GWP]] of 1, non-ozone depleting, non-toxic, non-flammable) could make it the future working fluid to replace current HFCs in cars, supermarkets, and heat pump water heaters, among others.

Concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this (range of 3,000 or 4,000).\n\nMiners, who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to an insufficient ventilation, referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as \"[[blackdamp]],\" \"choke damp\" or \"stythe.\" Before more effective technologies were developed, [[miners]] would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged [[Domestic Canary|canary]] with them as they worked. The canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans, and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch. The [[Davy lamp]] could also detect high levels of blackdamp (which sinks, and collects near the floor) by burning less brightly, while [[methane]], another suffocating gas and explosion risk, would make the lamp burn more brightly.\n\nIn February 2020, three people died from suffocation at a party in Moscow when dry ice (frozen CO2) was added to a swimming pool to cool it down.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51680049</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Human physiology ===\n\n==== Content ====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+[[Reference range]]s or averages for [[partial pressure of carbon dioxide|partial pressures of carbon dioxide]] (abbreviated p{{CO2}})\n|-\n! !!

However, the {{CO2}} bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of {{CO2}} decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. This is known as the [[Haldane Effect]], and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of {{CO2}} or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the [[Bohr effect]].\n\n==== Regulation of respiration ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}\nCarbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its concentration is high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.\n\nBicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of {{CO2}} in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].\n\nAlthough the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing [[air hunger]]. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the [[oxygen mask]] to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness.<ref name=\"solarnav\"/>\n\nThe respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial {{CO2}} pressure of 40&nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the {{CO2}} content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10\u201320&nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Chemistry}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Arterial blood gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Bosch reaction}}\n* {{annotated link|Bottled gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon dioxide sensor}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon sequestration}}\n* {{annotated link|Cave of Dogs}}\n* {{annotated link|EcoCute}} \u2013 as refrigerants\n* {{annotated link|Emission standard}}s\n* {{annotated link|Indoor air quality#Carbon dioxide|Indoor air quality}}\n* {{annotated link|Kaya identity}}\n* {{annotated link|Lake Kivu}}\n* {{annotated link|List of least carbon efficient power stations}}\n* {{annotated link|List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions}}\n* {{annotated link|Meromictic lake}}\n* {{annotated link|pCO2}}\n* {{annotated link|Gilbert Plass}} (early work on {{CO2}} and climate change)\n* {{annotated link|Sabatier reaction}}\n* NASA's {{annotated link|Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2}}\n* {{annotated link|Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |first=O.A. |last=Sepp\u00e4nen |last2=Fisk |first2=W.J. |last3=Mendell |first3=M.J. |title=Association of Ventilation Rates and {{CO2}} Concentrations with Health and Other Responses in Commercial and Institutional Buildings |journal=Indoor Air |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=226\u2013252 |date=December 1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.1999.00003.x |pmid=10649857 |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227032839/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Shendell |first=D.G. |last2=Prill |first2=R. |last3=Fisk |first3=W.J. |last4=Apte |first4=M.G. |last5=Blake |first5=D. |last6=Faulkner |first6=D. |title=Associations between classroom {{CO2}} concentrations and student attendance in Washington and Idaho |journal=Indoor Air |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=333\u2013341 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00251.x |pmid=15330793 |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227030811/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all |hdl=2376/5954 }}\n* {{cite journal |first=Jens |last=Soentgen |title= Hot air: The science and politics of {{CO2}} |journal=Global Environment |volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages= 134\u2013171 |date= February 2014 |doi= 10.3197/197337314X13927191904925 }}\n* {{cite book |title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines: a recommended practice guidance document |url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines-recommended-practice-guidance-document |publisher=Energy Institute and Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute |date=1 Sep 2010 |website=Global CCS Institute |quote=This new title is an essential guide for engineers, managers, procurement specialists and designers working on global carbon capture and storage projects. |access-date=2 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001428/https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines-recommended-practice-guidance-document |archive-date=7 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Library resources box |lcheading=Carbon dioxide}}\n* {{ICSC|0021}}<!-- in general: {{ICSC|AllDigits|TwoDigits}} -->\n* [http://sdsdata.org/68399 Carbon dioxide MSDS] by Amerigas in the SDSdata.org database.\n* [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0103.html CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards \u2013 Carbon Dioxide]\n* [http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html {{CO2}} Carbon Dioxide Properties, Uses, Applications]\n* [http://www.dryiceinfo.com/science.htm Dry Ice information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070225181531/http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide] (NOAA)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=RicDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 \"A War Gas That Saves Lives\"].
