The main competitor of this family is [[macOS]] by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] for personal computers and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] for mobile devices (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}}).\n** [[Windows Server]]: The operating system for server computers. The latest version is [[Windows Server 2019]]. Unlike its client sibling, it has adopted a strong naming scheme. The main competitor of this family is [[Linux]]. (c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}})\n** [[Windows PE]]: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to operate as a [[Live OS|live operating system]], used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.\n* [[Windows IoT]] (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed [[Windows CE]] as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer. Eventually, however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and was folded under Windows Compact trademark which also consists of [[Windows Embedded Industry]], Windows Embedded Professional, [[Windows Embedded Standard]], [[Windows Embedded Handheld]] and [[Windows Embedded Automotive]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|title = RTOS: Embedded Real Time Operating Systems|date = |accessdate = November 7, 2014|website = microsoft.com|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141215074031/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|archivedate = December 15, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following Windows families are no longer being developed:\n\n* [[Windows 9x]]: An operating system that targeted consumers market.

Unlike MS-DOS, Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time, through [[Nonpreemptive multitasking|cooperative multitasking]]. Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, which allows it to run applications larger than available memory: code segments and [[resource (Windows)|resources]] are swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce; data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control.\n\n===Windows 3.x===\n{{Main|Windows 3.0|Windows 3.1x}}\n[[File:Windows 3.0 workspace.png|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Windows 3.0]], released in 1990]]\n\n[[Windows 3.0]], released in 1990, improved the design, mostly because of [[virtual memory]] and loadable virtual device drivers ([[VxD]]s) that allow Windows to share arbitrary devices between multi-tasked DOS applications.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Windows 3.0 applications can run in [[protected mode]], which gives them access to several megabytes of memory without the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme.

NT OS/2 was intended to be a secure, [[multi-user]] operating system with [[POSIX]] compatibility and a modular, [[Software portability|portable]] [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] with [[preemptive multitasking]] and support for multiple processor architectures. However, following the successful release of [[Windows 3.0]], the NT development team decided to rework the project to use an extended [[32-bit]] port of the [[Windows API]] known as Win32 instead of those of OS/2. Win32 maintained a similar structure to the Windows [[API]]s (allowing existing Windows applications to easily be [[Porting|ported]] to the platform), but also supported the capabilities of the existing NT kernel. Following its approval by Microsoft's staff, development continued on what was now Windows NT, the first 32-bit version of Windows. However, IBM objected to the changes, and ultimately continued OS/2 development on its own.<ref name=\"insident\">{{cite book | ref= harv | last= Custer | first= Helen | title= Inside Windows NT | url= https://archive.org/details/insidewindowsnt00cust | url-access= registration | publisher= Microsoft Press | location= Redmond | year= 1993 | isbn=1-55615-481-X}}</ref><ref name=\"thurrott-nt\"/>\n\nThe first release of the resulting operating system, [[Windows NT 3.1]] (named to associate it with [[Windows 3.1]]) was released in July 1993, with versions for desktop [[workstation]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]]. [[Windows NT 3.5]] was released in September 1994, focusing on performance improvements and support for [[Novell]]'s [[NetWare]], and was followed up by [[Windows NT 3.51]] in May 1995, which included additional improvements and support for the [[PowerPC]] architecture. [[Windows NT 4.0]] was released in June 1996, introducing the redesigned interface of [[Windows 95]] to the NT series. On February 17, 2000, Microsoft released [[Windows 2000]], a successor to NT 4.0.

The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as [[Input Method Editor]]s, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs.\n\nInterface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. [[Language Interface Pack]]s (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later){{snd}} they translate most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the [[Windows Update]] service (except Windows 8).\n\nThe interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.\n\n[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] introduces a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location. The PC Settings app in [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows Server 2012 R2]] also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled [[Windows Store]] apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.\n\n====Platform support====\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and its predecessors supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000. (Although some these platforms implement [[64-bit computing]], the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Windows NT family still runs on IA-32, although the [[Windows Server]] line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture ([[IA-64]]), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until [[Windows Server 2012]]; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. [[Windows Vista]] was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.\n\nAn edition of Windows 8 known as [[Windows RT]] was specifically created for computers with [[ARM architecture]] and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated. Starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later includes support for PCs with [[ARM architecture]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Windows 10|date=2019-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Windows_10&oldid=890577832|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Windows CE===\n{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone}}\n[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a concept media player UI]]\n\nWindows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on [[Handheld PC|minimalistic computers]], like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones.

Microsoft has previously used a proprietary version control system called \"Source Depot\". Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into [[Team Foundation Server]] in 2013, but Windows continued to rely on Source Depot. Because of its large, decades-long history, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of [[Linux]] development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the repository takes several hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Bright| first = Peter| title = Microsoft hosts the Windows source in a monstrous 300GB Git repository| work = Ars Technica| accessdate = 2017-12-26| date = 2017-02-06| url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171226073905/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| archivedate = December 26, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline of releases==\n{{hidden begin\n|title      = Table of Windows versions\n|titlestyle = background:#D3D3D3\n}}\n{{Version|l||show=111111}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Product name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Latest version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[General availability]] date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Codename\n! colspan=\"2\" | Support until<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle|publisher=Microsoft|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011144824/http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Latest version of\n|-\n!

They were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security.\n\nThe [[Windows NT]] series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user, and implement absolute memory protection.

When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or \"Run as administrator\" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.<ref name=\"kennykerr\">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&nbsp;\u2013 Part 4&nbsp;\u2013 User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329071440/http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLeaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013\u20132016, detail the capabilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/|title=How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks) |last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2017-03-07|work=[[WIRED]]|language=en-US}}</ref> such as the ability to compromise [[operating system]]s such as Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3006021/vault-7-wikileaks-reveals-details-of-cias-hacks-of-android-iphone-windows-linux-macos-and-even-samsung-tvs |title=Vault 7: Wikileaks reveals details of CIA's hacks of Android, iPhone Windows, Linux, MacOS, and even Samsung TVs |website=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, computer experts reported that the [[BlueKeep]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-0708}}, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]], allowing for the possibility of [[remote code execution]], may now include related flaws, collectively named ''[[DejaBlue]]'', affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., [[Windows 7]] and all recent versions) as well.<ref name=\"WRD-20190813\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=DejaBlue: New BlueKeep-Style Bugs Renew The Risk Of A Windows worm |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dejablue-windows-bugs-worm-rdp/ |date=13 August 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|wired]] |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref> In addition, experts reported a [[Microsoft]] [[security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-1162}}, based on [[legacy code]] involving [[Text Services Framework#ctfmon|Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe)]], that affects all [[Windows]] versions from the older [[Windows XP]] version to the most recent [[Windows 10]] versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.<ref name=\"TP-20190814\">{{cite news |last=Seals |first=Tara |title=20-Year-Old Bug in Legacy Microsoft Code Plagues All Windows Users |url=https://threatpost.com/20-year-old-bug-legacy-microsoft-windows-users/147336/ |date=14 August 2019 |work=ThreatPost.com |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===File permissions===\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as [[AGDLP]] (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members.

(c.f. {{section link|Usage share of operating systems|Market share by category}})\n** [[Windows PE]]: A lightweight version of its Windows sibling, meant to operate as a [[Live OS|live operating system]], used for installing Windows on bare-metal computers (especially on many computers at once), recovery or troubleshooting purposes. The latest version is Windows PE 10.\n* [[Windows IoT]] (previously Windows Embedded): Initially, Microsoft developed [[Windows CE]] as a general-purpose operating system for every device that was too resource-limited to be called a full-fledged computer. Eventually, however, Windows CE was renamed Windows Embedded Compact and was folded under Windows Compact trademark which also consists of [[Windows Embedded Industry]], Windows Embedded Professional, [[Windows Embedded Standard]], [[Windows Embedded Handheld]] and [[Windows Embedded Automotive]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|title = RTOS: Embedded Real Time Operating Systems|date = |accessdate = November 7, 2014|website = microsoft.com|publisher = [[Microsoft]]|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141215074031/http://www.microsoft.com/windowsembedded/en-us/products-solutions-overview.aspx|archivedate = December 15, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following Windows families are no longer being developed:\n\n* [[Windows 9x]]: An operating system that targeted consumers market.

It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8.

This migration involved 3.5&nbsp;million separate files in a 300 gigabyte repository.<ref name=PBright /> By May 2017, 90 percent of its engineering team was using Git, in about 8500 commits and 1760 Windows builds per day.<ref name=PBright>{{cite web|last1=Bright|first1=Peter|title=Windows switch to Git almost complete: 8,500 commits and 1,760 builds each day|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|date=24 May 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524171707/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/90-of-windows-devs-now-using-git-creating-1760-windows-builds-per-day/|archivedate=May 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Multilingual support====\nMultilingual support has been built into Windows since Windows 3. The language for both the keyboard and the interface can be changed through the Region and Language Control Panel. Components for all supported input languages, such as [[Input Method Editor]]s, are automatically installed during Windows installation (in Windows XP and earlier, files for East Asian languages, such as Chinese, and right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic, may need to be installed separately, also from the said Control Panel). Third-party IMEs may also be installed if a user feels that the provided one is insufficient for their needs.\n\nInterface languages for the operating system are free for download, but some languages are limited to certain editions of Windows. [[Language Interface Pack]]s (LIPs) are redistributable and may be downloaded from Microsoft's Download Center and installed for any edition of Windows (XP or later){{snd}} they translate most, but not all, of the Windows interface, and require a certain base language (the language which Windows originally shipped with). This is used for most languages in emerging markets. Full Language Packs, which translates the complete operating system, are only available for specific editions of Windows (Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista and 7, and all editions of Windows 8, 8.1 and RT except Single Language). They do not require a specific base language, and are commonly used for more popular languages such as French or Chinese. These languages cannot be downloaded through the Download Center, but available as optional updates through the [[Windows Update]] service (except Windows 8).\n\nThe interface language of installed applications are not affected by changes in the Windows interface language. Availability of languages depends on the application developers themselves.\n\n[[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] introduces a new Language Control Panel where both the interface and input languages can be simultaneously changed, and language packs, regardless of type, can be downloaded from a central location. The PC Settings app in [[Windows 8.1]] and [[Windows Server 2012 R2]] also includes a counterpart settings page for this. Changing the interface language also changes the language of preinstalled [[Windows Store]] apps (such as Mail, Maps and News) and certain other Microsoft-developed apps (such as Remote Desktop). The above limitations for language packs are however still in effect, except that full language packs can be installed for any edition except Single Language, which caters to emerging markets.\n\n====Platform support====\nWindows NT included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. [[Windows NT 4.0]] and its predecessors supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000. (Although some these platforms implement [[64-bit computing]], the operating system treated them as 32-bit.) However, Windows 2000, the successor of Windows NT 4.0, dropped support for all platforms except the third generation x86 (known as [[IA-32]]) or newer in 32-bit mode. The client line of Windows NT family still runs on IA-32, although the [[Windows Server]] line has ceased supporting this platform with the release of [[Windows Server 2008 R2]].\n\nWith the introduction of the Intel Itanium architecture ([[IA-64]]), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 counterparts. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, released in 2005, is the last Windows client operating systems to support Itanium. Windows Server line continues to support this platform until [[Windows Server 2012]]; Windows Server 2008 R2 is the last Windows operating system to support Itanium architecture.\n\nOn April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or simply x64), the eighth generation of x86 architecture. [[Windows Vista]] was the first client version of Windows NT to be released simultaneously in IA-32 and x64 editions. x64 is still supported.\n\nAn edition of Windows 8 known as [[Windows RT]] was specifically created for computers with [[ARM architecture]] and while ARM is still used for Windows smartphones with Windows 10, tablets with Windows RT will not be updated. Starting from Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later includes support for PCs with [[ARM architecture]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Windows 10|date=2019-04-02|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Windows_10&oldid=890577832|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===Windows CE===\n{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone}}\n[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a concept media player UI]]\n\nWindows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on [[Handheld PC|minimalistic computers]], like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones.

Microsoft has previously used a proprietary version control system called \"Source Depot\". Microsoft had begun to integrate Git into [[Team Foundation Server]] in 2013, but Windows continued to rely on Source Depot. Because of its large, decades-long history, the Windows codebase is not especially well suited to the decentralized nature of [[Linux]] development that Git was originally created to manage. Each Git repository contains a complete history of all the files, which proved unworkable for Windows developers because cloning the repository takes several hours. Microsoft has been working on a new project called the Virtual File System for Git (VFSForGit) to address these challenges.<ref>{{Cite web| last = Bright| first = Peter| title = Microsoft hosts the Windows source in a monstrous 300GB Git repository| work = Ars Technica| accessdate = 2017-12-26| date = 2017-02-06| url = https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| url-status=live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171226073905/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/02/microsoft-hosts-the-windows-source-in-a-monstrous-300gb-git-repository/| archivedate = December 26, 2017| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline of releases==\n{{hidden begin\n|title      = Table of Windows versions\n|titlestyle = background:#D3D3D3\n}}\n{{Version|l||show=111111}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Product name\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Latest version\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[General availability]] date\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Codename\n! colspan=\"2\" | Support until<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|title=Microsoft Support Lifecycle|publisher=Microsoft|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011144824/http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/|archivedate=October 11, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Latest version of\n|-\n!

They were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security.\n\nThe [[Windows NT]] series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user, and implement absolute memory protection.

Though [[Windows XP]] did have limited accounts, the majority of home users did not change to an account type with fewer rights&nbsp;\u2013 partially due to the number of programs which unnecessarily required administrator rights&nbsp;\u2013 and so most home users ran as administrator all the time.\n\n[[Windows Vista]] changes this<ref>Microsoft describes in detail the steps taken to combat this in a TechNet bulletin.

When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or \"Run as administrator\" is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.<ref name=\"kennykerr\">{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&nbsp;\u2013 Part 4&nbsp;\u2013 User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070329071440/http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |archivedate=March 29, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nLeaked documents published by WikiLeaks, codenamed [[Vault 7]] and dated from 2013\u20132016, detail the capabilities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/cia-can-hack-phone-pc-tv-says-wikileaks/|title=How the CIA Can Hack Your Phone, PC, and TV (Says WikiLeaks) |last=Greenberg|first=Andy|date=2017-03-07|work=[[WIRED]]|language=en-US}}</ref> such as the ability to compromise [[operating system]]s such as Microsoft Windows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3006021/vault-7-wikileaks-reveals-details-of-cias-hacks-of-android-iphone-windows-linux-macos-and-even-samsung-tvs |title=Vault 7: Wikileaks reveals details of CIA's hacks of Android, iPhone Windows, Linux, MacOS, and even Samsung TVs |website=[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]] |date=7 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, computer experts reported that the [[BlueKeep]] [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-0708}}, that potentially affects older unpatched Microsoft Windows versions via the program's [[Remote Desktop Protocol]], allowing for the possibility of [[remote code execution]], may now include related flaws, collectively named ''[[DejaBlue]]'', affecting newer Windows versions (i.e., [[Windows 7]] and all recent versions) as well.<ref name=\"WRD-20190813\">{{cite news |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |title=DejaBlue: New BlueKeep-Style Bugs Renew The Risk Of A Windows worm |url=https://www.wired.com/story/dejablue-windows-bugs-worm-rdp/ |date=13 August 2019 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|wired]] |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref> In addition, experts reported a [[Microsoft]] [[security vulnerability]], {{CVE|2019-1162}}, based on [[legacy code]] involving [[Text Services Framework#ctfmon|Microsoft CTF and ctfmon (ctfmon.exe)]], that affects all [[Windows]] versions from the older [[Windows XP]] version to the most recent [[Windows 10]] versions; a patch to correct the flaw is currently available.<ref name=\"TP-20190814\">{{cite news |last=Seals |first=Tara |title=20-Year-Old Bug in Legacy Microsoft Code Plagues All Windows Users |url=https://threatpost.com/20-year-old-bug-legacy-microsoft-windows-users/147336/ |date=14 August 2019 |work=ThreatPost.com |accessdate=15 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===File permissions===\nAll Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as [[AGDLP]] (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) in which file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members.

However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.\n\n===Windows Defender===\nOn January 6, 2005, Microsoft released a [[Beta version]] of Microsoft AntiSpyware, based upon the previously released [[GIANT Company Software|Giant]] AntiSpyware. On February 14, 2006, Microsoft AntiSpyware became [[Windows Defender]] with the release of Beta 2. Windows Defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and other unwanted software. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users who have [[Windows Genuine Advantage|genuine]] copies of Microsoft Windows can freely download the program from Microsoft's web site, and Windows Defender ships as part of Windows Vista and 7.<ref name=defendervista>{{cite web|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/products/features/security-safety|title=Windows Vista: Security & Safety|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=April 16, 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608205804/http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/products/features/security-safety|archivedate=June 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In Windows 8, Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials have been combined into a single program, named Windows Defender.

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

Like other legumes, ''Mucuna'' plants bear pods. They are generally bat-pollinated and produce seeds that are [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] [[sea-bean]]s. These have a characteristic three-layered appearance, appearing like the eyes of a large [[mammal]] in some species and like a [[hamburger]] in others (most notably ''[[Mucuna sloanei|M. sloanei]]'') and giving rise to common names like '''deer-eye beans''', '''donkey-eye beans''', '''ox-eye beans''', or '''hamburger seed'''.\n\nThe name of the genus is derived from ''mucun\u00e3'', a [[Tupi\u2013Guarani languages|Tupi\u2013Guarani]] word for these species.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kaN-hLL-3qEC |title=CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names |volume=3 M-Q |first=Umberto |last=Quattrocchi |publisher=CRC Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8493-2677-6 |page=1738}}</ref>\n\n==Uses and ecology==\n[[File:Mucuna poggei MS 3655.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Mucuna poggei]]'' pods]]\n[[File:Mucuna birdwoodiana.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Mucuna birdwoodiana]]'' in [[Hong Kong]]]]\nThe pods of some species are covered in coarse hairs that contain the [[protease|proteolytic enzyme]] [[mucunain]] and cause itchy blisters when they come in contact with skin; [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]]s such as ''pruriens'' ([[Latin]]: \"itching\") or ''urens'' (Latinized [[Ancient Greek]]: \"stinging like a [[Urtica|nettle]]\") refer to this. Other parts of the plant have medicinal properties. The plants are used in [[herbalism]] against a range of conditions, such as [[urinary tract]], [[neurological]] and [[menstruation]] disorders, [[constipation]], [[edema]], [[fever]]s, [[tuberculosis]], [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s, [[Parkinson's disease]],<ref>Katzenschlager ''et al.''

They are grown as [[ornamental plant]]s and, locally, for food. Interest exists in developing ''Mucuna'' species as a sustainable, edible cover crop.

''Mucuna'' is also used as a food crop, e.g. in eastern [[Nigeria]], although the L-dopa content makes it less desirable. The plant must be processed before it can be eaten; for example, the leaves must be soaked to leach out the L-dopa. The seeds are also cracked open and soaked before they are eaten.<ref>Oudhia (2002), Diallo & Berhe (2003)</ref>\n\n''Mucuna'' pod hairs are a common ingredient in [[itching powder]].

Like other legumes, ''Mucuna'' plants bear pods. They are generally bat-pollinated and produce seeds that are [[Buoyancy|buoyant]] [[sea-bean]]s. These have a characteristic three-layered appearance, appearing like the eyes of a large [[mammal]] in some species and like a [[hamburger]] in others (most notably ''[[Mucuna sloanei|M. sloanei]]'') and giving rise to common names like '''deer-eye beans''', '''donkey-eye beans''', '''ox-eye beans''', or '''hamburger seed'''.\n\nThe name of the genus is derived from ''mucun\u00e3'', a [[Tupi\u2013Guarani languages|Tupi\u2013Guarani]] word for these species.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kaN-hLL-3qEC |title=CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names |volume=3 M-Q |first=Umberto |last=Quattrocchi |publisher=CRC Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8493-2677-6 |page=1738}}</ref>\n\n==Uses and ecology==\n[[File:Mucuna poggei MS 3655.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Mucuna poggei]]'' pods]]\n[[File:Mucuna birdwoodiana.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Mucuna birdwoodiana]]'' in [[Hong Kong]]]]\nThe pods of some species are covered in coarse hairs that contain the [[protease|proteolytic enzyme]] [[mucunain]] and cause itchy blisters when they come in contact with skin; [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]]s such as ''pruriens'' ([[Latin]]: \"itching\") or ''urens'' (Latinized [[Ancient Greek]]: \"stinging like a [[Urtica|nettle]]\") refer to this. Other parts of the plant have medicinal properties. The plants are used in [[herbalism]] against a range of conditions, such as [[urinary tract]], [[neurological]] and [[menstruation]] disorders, [[constipation]], [[edema]], [[fever]]s, [[tuberculosis]], [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s, [[Parkinson's disease]],<ref>Katzenschlager ''et al.'' (2004)</ref> and [[helminthiases]] like [[elephantiasis tropica|elephantiasis]].<ref>Oudhia (2002)</ref> [[Mucuna pruriens|Velvet bean]] (''M. pruriens'') is one of the most important sources of [[L-dopa]], a common component of [[nootropic]]s (\"smart drugs\"); it also contains [[serotonin]], [[5-HTP]], [[nicotine]], and some decidedly [[psychoactive]] compounds (see below).<ref name = erowid>Erowid (2002)</ref>\n\nSeveral species, such as the [[New Guinea creeper]] (''[[Mucuna novo-guineensis|M. novo-guineensis]]'') and ''M. pruriens'', have been brought into cultivation, although at temperatures below about 10&nbsp;\u00b0C they must be grown indoors. They are grown as [[ornamental plant]]s and, locally, for food. Interest exists in developing ''Mucuna'' species as a sustainable, edible cover crop. A scientific newsletter, ''Mucuna News'', has been produced in 2001/2002 to publish the results of an international workshop focusing on improved cultivation techniques.\n\n[[File:5-MeO-DMT.svg|thumb|right|[[5-MeO-DMT]], one of the [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] [[tryptamine]]s found in [[Mucuna pruriens|velvet bean]] (''M. pruriens'') in trace quantities<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|title=Indolealkylamines in ''Mucuna'' species |journal=Tropical and Subtropical Agroecosystems |volume=1 |issue=2\u20133 |date=April 2003 |pages=295\u2013307\n|last=Szabo\n|first=N.

(2000)</ref> ''M. pruriens'' was used in [[Native America]]n ''[[milpa]]'' agriculture and popular as [[green manure]] in the southern [[United States]] before it was replaced by [[soybean]]s in the mid- to late 20th century. ''Mucuna'' is also used as a food crop, e.g. in eastern [[Nigeria]], although the L-dopa content makes it less desirable. The plant must be processed before it can be eaten; for example, the leaves must be soaked to leach out the L-dopa. The seeds are also cracked open and soaked before they are eaten.<ref>Oudhia (2002), Diallo & Berhe (2003)</ref>\n\n''Mucuna'' pod hairs are a common ingredient in [[itching powder]]. On the other hand, the hairless parts of certain species are used by some South American [[shaman]]s to make an [[entheogen]]ic [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]].<ref>Chamakura (1994)</ref> Presence of the [[hallucinogen]]ic [[tryptamine]]s [[5-MeO-DMT]], [[bufotenine]] and [[dimethyltryptamine]],<ref name = erowid /> and supposedly {{Verify source|date=December 2007}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} the [[beta-carboline]] 6-MeO-[[harmane]] has been confirmed in ''M. pruriens'', apparently the only thoroughly researched species thus far.\n\nSome ''Mucuna'' species are used as food plants by [[caterpillar]]s of [[Lepidoptera]]. These include ''[[Morpho]]'' butterflies and the two-barred flasher (''[[Astraptes fulgerator]]'') which is sometimes found on ''[[Mucuna holtonii|M. holtonii]]'' and perhaps others.

Woodstock is also home to the [[Woodstock River Bandits|River Bandits]] of the [[Valley Baseball League]], the Shenandoah County Public School's Central campus, and the Shenandoah County Fairgrounds.\n\n==History==\nThe town was established by charter in March 1761 as a part of what was then Frederick County. It was originally formed from a land grant from [[Lord Fairfax]], and founded as Muellerstadt (Miller Town) in 1752 by founder Jacob Muller (or \"Mueller\"). The town's charter was sponsored by George Washington in Virginia's House of Burgesses. Woodstock has been the County Seat of Shenandoah County, since Shenandoah County's formation in 1772.\n\n=== Colonial Era ===\n\nThe Shenandoah Valley region around Woodstock was settled by Pennsylvania Germans who migrated south down the natural route of the Shenandoah Valley in the mid 1700s. The majority of these German settlers tended small farms that grew crops other than tobacco, were not slaveholders and had Protestant faiths different from the established Anglican church in Virginia. They thus had different culture and beliefs than the English society that was prevalent on the eastern side of the mountains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/settleland/landshen.html|title=Encouraging Settlement and Land Grants West of the Blue Ridge|website=www.virginiaplaces.org|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto15\">{{cite web|url=https://worldhistory.us/american-history/colonial-america-shenandoah-settlers.php|title=Colonial America \u2013 Shenandoah Settlers|first=Gail|last=Bellenger|date=October 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Seven Bends\" of the north fork of the Shenandoah River in the area of the river between Woodstock and Strasburg have locations associated with Indian mounds dating back to the Late Woodland Period (AD 900\u20131650.)

In the 1760s, there was constant danger of Indian raids, with some atrocities and brutality.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> The last Indian raid in the area occurred in 1766, three years after the formal end of the French and Indian War, about two miles south of Woodstock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cebe/learn/historyculture/cedar-creek-and-the-french-and-indian-war.htm|title=Cedar Creek and the French and Indian War - Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|first1=Mailing Address: P.

With many improvements, Route 11 has largely followed this route, which was later called the Great Wagon Road and then the Valley Pike. Jacob Muller apparently used this old trail in laying out the plans for the main street of what would become Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Muellerstadt was the early name for Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/view.php?history|title=Shenandoah County Historical Society|website=www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Establishment of the town ===\n\nThe new village was established by an act in 1761, sponsored by George Washington. The town was renamed Woodstock at that time. George Washington was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, representing Frederick County (the Woodstock area was then part of Frederick County and would remain so until 1772.) The act of the General Assembly gave full credit to Jacob Muller for initiating the idea.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Muller came from Germany in 1749 and had temporarily settled in Pennsylvania. By 1752 he obtained 400 acres from Lord Fairfax for the area that would eventually be included in the town limits of Woodstock. Muller settled in Narrow Passage near Woodstock, and in the next few years his holdings grew to something between 1200 and 2000 acres,<ref name=\"auto13\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=micSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=woodstock,+virginia+germans&source=bl&ots=mn8tBZc4yw&sig=ACfU3U00AtqFcQt0-lgCZJ3c9H_9xPPZOQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit6YrD-cHlAhVK1lkKHUsZAfwQ6AEwDnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=woodstock,+virginia+germans&f=false|title=The German Element of the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia|first=John Walter|last=Wayland|date=October 30, 1907|publisher=The author|via=Google Books}}</ref> and he proceeded to lay out a plan for the town, Mullerstadt.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> A few white settlers had preceded Muller, as the 1761 act establishing the town noted \"several persons are now living there\". It is realistic to assume this meant a scattering of log buildings.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  However, Muller's town plan was that referred to in the 1761 General Assembly act that established Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nThere is no clear reason why the town's name was changed to Woodstock, though theories include it being renamed by Washington<ref name=\"auto5\"/> or perhaps for a wood stockade used by the community as shelter from Indian raids. Notwithstanding, Jacob Muller's town continued for many years to be known as Millerstown, or to German-language residents, Muellerstadt.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> During the years following the establishment of the town, Muller held a big land sale in which 40 parcels he plotted were purchased.  Muller died in 1766, just four years after his land sales. Andrew Brewbaker, his son-in-law, became proprietor of his grant, supported by a board of trustees appointed by the General Assembly to govern the new town.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  This form of government continued until 1795, when the town was authorized to hold elections. Unfortunately, the Town Trustees appointed in 1761 left no records, so early history of Woodstock as a town cannot be determined with accuracy. There was also no local newspaper until 1817.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===  Revolutionary Era ===\n\nIn 1772, Woodstock became the county seat of Dunmore County (renamed Shenandoah County in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, shedding the name of the controversial last Royal governor of Virginia). Being named the county seat had significant impact for the development of the town. As a county seat, Woodstock necessitated the building of a courthouse and jail. By 1774, the county had erected a permanent courthouse.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  That original court house was replaced in 1795 with a limestone building designed by Thomas Jefferson, using native limestone. It was enlarged in 1871 and 1886. The Shenandoah County Courthouse, located on Main Street, is the oldest courthouse still in use west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=73774|title=Shenandoah County Courthouse Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Muhlenberg|John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg]], a native of Pennsylvania who was formerly a soldier in the British Army and German dragoons, accepted a call to become pastor to a Woodstock congregation in 1771. After theological training, he served both Lutherans and Episcopalians for four years in a wide-ranging pastorate in the Shenandoah Valley. During this time he was drawn to in politics, serving in the House of Burgesses in 1774 and as a delegate to the [[First Virginia Convention]]. Muhlenberg became famous for his impassioned speeches for the revolutionary cause, helping to raise a regiment in the Shenandoah Valley among its German and Scots-Irish frontier population. He would lead this regiment, the 8th Virginia, as its Colonel in the Continental Army.<ref name=\"Architect of the Capitol\">{{cite web |title=John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg |url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/john-peter-gabriel-muhlenberg |website=Architect of the Capitol |accessdate=31 October 2019 |language=en}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> At the conclusion of his fiery farewell sermon in Woodstock on January 21, 1776, Muhlenberg famously threw off his clerical robes to reveal an officer's uniform beneath and proclaimed, (according to later reports), \u201cin the language of Holy Writ there is a time for all things, a time to preach and a time to pray, but those times have passed away. There is a time to fight, and that time has now come.\u201d<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Muhlenberg went on to be promoted to a general in the Continental Army and led units in many battles, from Brandywine to Yorktown. Upon the end of the war in 1783, he did not return to live in Woodstock, but instead returned to his native Pennsylvania as a war hero, served in elected capacities and then was elected to the First Congress (1788-1789) and several successive Congresses. Elected to the Senate in 1801, he resigned to return to a revenue post in Philadelphia, where he died on October 1, 1807. While his statue in Congress' National Statuary Hall Collection was submitted by Pennsylvania in 1889, Muhlenberg has been revered in Woodstock for his fiery sermon and the unit he raised and inspired to fight for the nation's independence.<ref name=\"Architect of the Capitol\"/>\n\nThe frontier-recruited [[8th Virginia Regiment]] was drawn from Augusta, Berkeley, Culpeper, Dunmore (Shenandoah), Fincastle, Frederick Counties in the Shenandoah Valley, the district of West Augusta and Hampshire County which are in present-day West Virginia, and elsewhere along the Virginia frontier, which stretched from Kentucky to Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh, PA.) Two of the ten companies were raised from the Dunmore County area of Woodstock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.8thvirginia.com/1/category/frontier|title=Category: Frontier|website=The 8th Virginia Regiment|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> It was led by Muhlenberg, Colonel of the regiment and Abraham Bowman, Lt. Colonel, both from Woodstock.<ref name=\"8thvirginia.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.8thvirginia.com/the-8th-virginia.html|title=The 8th Virginia|website=The 8th Virginia Regiment|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> The 8th Virginia was called \"The German Regiment\" though it also contained substantial numbers of Scots-Irish. Frequently separated and detached to other units, the men of this tough, frontier-bred regiment served with distinction in many theatres of the war: White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Short Hills, Cooch's Bridge, Brandywine, Saratoga, Germantown and Charleston. They suffered the hardships at Valley Forge, and were afterwards mustered out of service, with those who reenlisted merging into other Virginia units.<ref name=\"8thvirginia.com\"/>\n\n=== Railroads ===\n\nThe commercial importance of Woodstock was enhanced by the coming of the railroad, and the railroad has significant impact upon the Woodstock's development. The first railroad south of Strasburg was the Manassas Gap Railroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/rail/valleyrail.html|title=Railroads of the Shenandoah Valley - and Why Isn't Harrisonburg on the Main Line?|website=www.virginiaplaces.org}}</ref> On 2 March 1859 the line was extended to Mount Jackson. The Civil War interrupted the work however, and the line remained a long spur from Strasburg, with Mt Jackson as the terminus. In 1865 the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O) acquired and reconstructed the line after extensive damage during the Civil War, merging it with the Orange & Alexandria to form the Orange, Alexandria and Manassas Railroad.<ref name=\"auto16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/PiedmontRR/railhst1.html|title=Norfolk Southern Railway History|website=www.trainweb.org}}</ref> They then extended the line to Harrisonburg in 1868.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> In 1872, the B&O formed a separate subsidiary railroad on the line known as the Strasburg & Harrisonburg RR (S&H RR). In 1873 the B&O RR leased and operated the S&H RR between Strasburg and Harrisonburg.  But the B&O encountered financial difficulties and sold the S&H railroad subsidiary to the Southern Railway in 1896.<!-- Deleted image removed:   [[File:Former Woodstock, VA Rail Depot.jpeg|thumb|left|Former B&O passenger depot at Woodstock VA, demolished in 1954]] -->\n\nIn 1888 the B&O built a passenger station in Woodstock, made with native limestone, noted as one of the more elaborate passenger depots in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/46|title=Woodstock Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> Woodstock became a freight rail entrepot with outward bound shipments of grain, cattle and fruit and inward bound freight of manufactured goods, rail service that continued into the 1960s. Passenger service ended in 1948 and freight rail service began to decline in the 1950s, reflecting a nationwide shift to cars and trucks with the advent of the national highway system. While individual industries were still served, sometime before 1969 regular freight depot service ended and the Woodstock freight depot was demolished in the 1970s.<ref name=\"auto14\">{{cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/47|title=Woodstock Freight Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories}}</ref> The Southern Railway merged with the Norfolk & Western in 1982 to become the Norfolk Southern Railroad, which owns the line through Woodstock to this day. However, industrial need for the line ended, and the rail between Strasburg between Edinburg (through Woodstock) is out of service, though the track remains.<ref name=\"auto16\"/>\n\nIn 1954 the B&O sold the passenger station and it was torn down in 1954 by a local businessman despite protests of many locals, and its loss damaged Woodstock's historical character and heritage as a once-active railroad town.<ref name=\"auto7\">{{cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/46|title=Woodstock Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories}}</ref>\n\n=== Civil War Era ===\nConfederate military units raised in Woodstock included Company F (the Muhlenberg Rifles) of the [[10th Virginia Infantry]] (of whom 71% had German surnames)<ref name=\"auto13\"/> as well as Company C of the [[33rd Virginia Infantry]], part of the Stonewall Brigade led by [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]]. While the area had an active Confederate population, it also was home to many reluctant secessionists, Unionists and families religiously opposed to slavery and war ([[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|German Dunkards]].) In addition, traditional enmity between the slavery-based plantation society in eastern Virginia and the small farm populations over the rugged Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountains, where slavery was not as predominant an economic institution, meant that allegiances in the Shenandoah Valley and western Virginia were often divided. Many of German descent in the Shenandoah Valley were generally or religiously opposed to slavery, even as others with German ethnicity served in the Confederate Army.<ref name=\"auto13\"/>\n\nThe Civil War left no serious visible scars on the town,<ref name=\"auto5\"/> although there was [[Partisan (military)|partisan activity]] and retaliation.<ref name=\"auto17\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=5277|title=Woodstock Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref> A few buildings were destroyed, notably the railroad depot and some warehouses along with a locomotive and some rolling stock.<ref name=\"auto17\"/> No major battles were fought in the immediate vicinity of the town, although skirmishes and large troop movements were not uncommon. Various homes were used from time to time as staff headquarters by both sides, and as the occasional military hospital.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> General [[Stonewall_Jackson|Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]] made Woodstock his headquarters during part of his [[Valley Campaign]] in spring 1962, using the small brick law office near the courthouse. Union General [[Phil Sheridan]] sent a famous telegraph message from Woodstock during his own [[Valley_campaigns_of_1864#Sheridan's_Shenandoah_Valley_campaign_(August\u2013October_1864)|Valley campaign in 1864]], during which his army destroyed anything of military value to the Confederates, stating \u201cI have destroyed over 2,000 barns filled with wheat, burned over 70 mills filled with grain and flour. I have made the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia so bare that a crow flying over it would have to carry its knapsack.\u201d <ref>http://www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/view.php?history</ref>\n\n[[File:General Custer saluting Confederate General Ramseur at the Woodstock races, Oct. 9, 1864 LCCN2004660727.jpg|thumb|left|Prior to the [[Battle of Tom's Brook]] and the Woodstock Races, Gen.

In conjunction with spring 1864 offensives, Union Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered Maj. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]] to move down the Valley Pike from West Virginia to [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], to destroy its railroads and canal while denying the rich Shenandoah Valley to the Confederacy. Receiving intelligence on these movements, Confederate Maj. Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]] scraped together all available troops, including cadets from Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington. Sigel's advance was slowed by Confederate cavalry and undermined by his own command jealousies and inept decisions, but on May 11 his cavalry captured a lightly defended Woodstock. The Confederates were forced out of Woodstock so fast that several telegrams between Breckinridge and his cavalry commander [[John D. Imboden]] fell into Union hands. These Woodstock dispatches revealed strength and location of Confederate forces as well as a rough time table for a cavalry rendezvous with the main Confederate force - potentially a game-changing intelligence coup. But rather than acting decisively, Sigel continued his cautious advance, allowing Confederates time to concentrate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-battle-of-new-market.html|title=StackPath|website=www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> Breckenridge decided to attack Sigel's army, which had advanced from Woodstock.

Woodstock is also home to the [[Woodstock River Bandits|River Bandits]] of the [[Valley Baseball League]], the Shenandoah County Public School's Central campus, and the Shenandoah County Fairgrounds.\n\n==History==\nThe town was established by charter in March 1761 as a part of what was then Frederick County. It was originally formed from a land grant from [[Lord Fairfax]], and founded as Muellerstadt (Miller Town) in 1752 by founder Jacob Muller (or \"Mueller\"). The town's charter was sponsored by George Washington in Virginia's House of Burgesses. Woodstock has been the County Seat of Shenandoah County, since Shenandoah County's formation in 1772.\n\n=== Colonial Era ===\n\nThe Shenandoah Valley region around Woodstock was settled by Pennsylvania Germans who migrated south down the natural route of the Shenandoah Valley in the mid 1700s. The majority of these German settlers tended small farms that grew crops other than tobacco, were not slaveholders and had Protestant faiths different from the established Anglican church in Virginia. They thus had different culture and beliefs than the English society that was prevalent on the eastern side of the mountains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/settleland/landshen.html|title=Encouraging Settlement and Land Grants West of the Blue Ridge|website=www.virginiaplaces.org|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto15\">{{cite web|url=https://worldhistory.us/american-history/colonial-america-shenandoah-settlers.php|title=Colonial America \u2013 Shenandoah Settlers|first=Gail|last=Bellenger|date=October 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Seven Bends\" of the north fork of the Shenandoah River in the area of the river between Woodstock and Strasburg have locations associated with Indian mounds dating back to the Late Woodland Period (AD 900\u20131650.)

In the 1760s, there was constant danger of Indian raids, with some atrocities and brutality.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> The last Indian raid in the area occurred in 1766, three years after the formal end of the French and Indian War, about two miles south of Woodstock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cebe/learn/historyculture/cedar-creek-and-the-french-and-indian-war.htm|title=Cedar Creek and the French and Indian War - Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|first1=Mailing Address: P.

With many improvements, Route 11 has largely followed this route, which was later called the Great Wagon Road and then the Valley Pike. Jacob Muller apparently used this old trail in laying out the plans for the main street of what would become Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Muellerstadt was the early name for Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/view.php?history|title=Shenandoah County Historical Society|website=www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Establishment of the town ===\n\nThe new village was established by an act in 1761, sponsored by George Washington. The town was renamed Woodstock at that time. George Washington was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, representing Frederick County (the Woodstock area was then part of Frederick County and would remain so until 1772.) The act of the General Assembly gave full credit to Jacob Muller for initiating the idea.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Muller came from Germany in 1749 and had temporarily settled in Pennsylvania. By 1752 he obtained 400 acres from Lord Fairfax for the area that would eventually be included in the town limits of Woodstock. Muller settled in Narrow Passage near Woodstock, and in the next few years his holdings grew to something between 1200 and 2000 acres,<ref name=\"auto13\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=micSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=woodstock,+virginia+germans&source=bl&ots=mn8tBZc4yw&sig=ACfU3U00AtqFcQt0-lgCZJ3c9H_9xPPZOQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit6YrD-cHlAhVK1lkKHUsZAfwQ6AEwDnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=woodstock,+virginia+germans&f=false|title=The German Element of the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia|first=John Walter|last=Wayland|date=October 30, 1907|publisher=The author|via=Google Books}}</ref> and he proceeded to lay out a plan for the town, Mullerstadt.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> A few white settlers had preceded Muller, as the 1761 act establishing the town noted \"several persons are now living there\". It is realistic to assume this meant a scattering of log buildings.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  However, Muller's town plan was that referred to in the 1761 General Assembly act that established Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nThere is no clear reason why the town's name was changed to Woodstock, though theories include it being renamed by Washington<ref name=\"auto5\"/> or perhaps for a wood stockade used by the community as shelter from Indian raids. Notwithstanding, Jacob Muller's town continued for many years to be known as Millerstown, or to German-language residents, Muellerstadt.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> During the years following the establishment of the town, Muller held a big land sale in which 40 parcels he plotted were purchased.  Muller died in 1766, just four years after his land sales. Andrew Brewbaker, his son-in-law, became proprietor of his grant, supported by a board of trustees appointed by the General Assembly to govern the new town.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  This form of government continued until 1795, when the town was authorized to hold elections. Unfortunately, the Town Trustees appointed in 1761 left no records, so early history of Woodstock as a town cannot be determined with accuracy. There was also no local newspaper until 1817.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===  Revolutionary Era ===\n\nIn 1772, Woodstock became the county seat of Dunmore County (renamed Shenandoah County in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, shedding the name of the controversial last Royal governor of Virginia). Being named the county seat had significant impact for the development of the town. As a county seat, Woodstock necessitated the building of a courthouse and jail. By 1774, the county had erected a permanent courthouse.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  That original court house was replaced in 1795 with a limestone building designed by Thomas Jefferson, using native limestone. It was enlarged in 1871 and 1886. The Shenandoah County Courthouse, located on Main Street, is the oldest courthouse still in use west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=73774|title=Shenandoah County Courthouse Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Muhlenberg|John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg]], a native of Pennsylvania who was formerly a soldier in the British Army and German dragoons, accepted a call to become pastor to a Woodstock congregation in 1771. After theological training, he served both Lutherans and Episcopalians for four years in a wide-ranging pastorate in the Shenandoah Valley. During this time he was drawn to in politics, serving in the House of Burgesses in 1774 and as a delegate to the [[First Virginia Convention]]. Muhlenberg became famous for his impassioned speeches for the revolutionary cause, helping to raise a regiment in the Shenandoah Valley among its German and Scots-Irish frontier population. He would lead this regiment, the 8th Virginia, as its Colonel in the Continental Army.<ref name=\"Architect of the Capitol\">{{cite web |title=John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg |url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/john-peter-gabriel-muhlenberg |website=Architect of the Capitol |accessdate=31 October 2019 |language=en}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> At the conclusion of his fiery farewell sermon in Woodstock on January 21, 1776, Muhlenberg famously threw off his clerical robes to reveal an officer's uniform beneath and proclaimed, (according to later reports), \u201cin the language of Holy Writ there is a time for all things, a time to preach and a time to pray, but those times have passed away. There is a time to fight, and that time has now come.\u201d<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Muhlenberg went on to be promoted to a general in the Continental Army and led units in many battles, from Brandywine to Yorktown. Upon the end of the war in 1783, he did not return to live in Woodstock, but instead returned to his native Pennsylvania as a war hero, served in elected capacities and then was elected to the First Congress (1788-1789) and several successive Congresses. Elected to the Senate in 1801, he resigned to return to a revenue post in Philadelphia, where he died on October 1, 1807. While his statue in Congress' National Statuary Hall Collection was submitted by Pennsylvania in 1889, Muhlenberg has been revered in Woodstock for his fiery sermon and the unit he raised and inspired to fight for the nation's independence.<ref name=\"Architect of the Capitol\"/>\n\nThe frontier-recruited [[8th Virginia Regiment]] was drawn from Augusta, Berkeley, Culpeper, Dunmore (Shenandoah), Fincastle, Frederick Counties in the Shenandoah Valley, the district of West Augusta and Hampshire County which are in present-day West Virginia, and elsewhere along the Virginia frontier, which stretched from Kentucky to Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh, PA.) Two of the ten companies were raised from the Dunmore County area of Woodstock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.8thvirginia.com/1/category/frontier|title=Category: Frontier|website=The 8th Virginia Regiment|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> It was led by Muhlenberg, Colonel of the regiment and Abraham Bowman, Lt.

Frequently separated and detached to other units, the men of this tough, frontier-bred regiment served with distinction in many theatres of the war: White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Short Hills, Cooch's Bridge, Brandywine, Saratoga, Germantown and Charleston. They suffered the hardships at Valley Forge, and were afterwards mustered out of service, with those who reenlisted merging into other Virginia units.<ref name=\"8thvirginia.com\"/>\n\n=== Railroads ===\n\nThe commercial importance of Woodstock was enhanced by the coming of the railroad, and the railroad has significant impact upon the Woodstock's development. The first railroad south of Strasburg was the Manassas Gap Railroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/rail/valleyrail.html|title=Railroads of the Shenandoah Valley - and Why Isn't Harrisonburg on the Main Line?|website=www.virginiaplaces.org}}</ref> On 2 March 1859 the line was extended to Mount Jackson. The Civil War interrupted the work however, and the line remained a long spur from Strasburg, with Mt Jackson as the terminus. In 1865 the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O) acquired and reconstructed the line after extensive damage during the Civil War, merging it with the Orange & Alexandria to form the Orange, Alexandria and Manassas Railroad.<ref name=\"auto16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/PiedmontRR/railhst1.html|title=Norfolk Southern Railway History|website=www.trainweb.org}}</ref> They then extended the line to Harrisonburg in 1868.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> In 1872, the B&O formed a separate subsidiary railroad on the line known as the Strasburg & Harrisonburg RR (S&H RR). In 1873 the B&O RR leased and operated the S&H RR between Strasburg and Harrisonburg.  But the B&O encountered financial difficulties and sold the S&H railroad subsidiary to the Southern Railway in 1896.<!-- Deleted image removed:   [[File:Former Woodstock, VA Rail Depot.jpeg|thumb|left|Former B&O passenger depot at Woodstock VA, demolished in 1954]] -->\n\nIn 1888 the B&O built a passenger station in Woodstock, made with native limestone, noted as one of the more elaborate passenger depots in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/46|title=Woodstock Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> Woodstock became a freight rail entrepot with outward bound shipments of grain, cattle and fruit and inward bound freight of manufactured goods, rail service that continued into the 1960s. Passenger service ended in 1948 and freight rail service began to decline in the 1950s, reflecting a nationwide shift to cars and trucks with the advent of the national highway system. While individual industries were still served, sometime before 1969 regular freight depot service ended and the Woodstock freight depot was demolished in the 1970s.<ref name=\"auto14\">{{cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/47|title=Woodstock Freight Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories}}</ref> The Southern Railway merged with the Norfolk & Western in 1982 to become the Norfolk Southern Railroad, which owns the line through Woodstock to this day. However, industrial need for the line ended, and the rail between Strasburg between Edinburg (through Woodstock) is out of service, though the track remains.<ref name=\"auto16\"/>\n\nIn 1954 the B&O sold the passenger station and it was torn down in 1954 by a local businessman despite protests of many locals, and its loss damaged Woodstock's historical character and heritage as a once-active railroad town.<ref name=\"auto7\">{{cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/46|title=Woodstock Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories}}</ref>\n\n=== Civil War Era ===\nConfederate military units raised in Woodstock included Company F (the Muhlenberg Rifles) of the [[10th Virginia Infantry]] (of whom 71% had German surnames)<ref name=\"auto13\"/> as well as Company C of the [[33rd Virginia Infantry]], part of the Stonewall Brigade led by [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]]. While the area had an active Confederate population, it also was home to many reluctant secessionists, Unionists and families religiously opposed to slavery and war ([[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|German Dunkards]].) In addition, traditional enmity between the slavery-based plantation society in eastern Virginia and the small farm populations over the rugged Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountains, where slavery was not as predominant an economic institution, meant that allegiances in the Shenandoah Valley and western Virginia were often divided. Many of German descent in the Shenandoah Valley were generally or religiously opposed to slavery, even as others with German ethnicity served in the Confederate Army.<ref name=\"auto13\"/>\n\nThe Civil War left no serious visible scars on the town,<ref name=\"auto5\"/> although there was [[Partisan (military)|partisan activity]] and retaliation.<ref name=\"auto17\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=5277|title=Woodstock Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref> A few buildings were destroyed, notably the railroad depot and some warehouses along with a locomotive and some rolling stock.<ref name=\"auto17\"/> No major battles were fought in the immediate vicinity of the town, although skirmishes and large troop movements were not uncommon. Various homes were used from time to time as staff headquarters by both sides, and as the occasional military hospital.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> General [[Stonewall_Jackson|Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]] made Woodstock his headquarters during part of his [[Valley Campaign]] in spring 1962, using the small brick law office near the courthouse. Union General [[Phil Sheridan]] sent a telegraph message from Woodstock during his own [[Valley_campaigns_of_1864#Sheridan's_Shenandoah_Valley_campaign_(August\u2013October_1864)|Valley campaign in 1864]], during which his army destroyed anything of military value to the Confederates, stating \u201cI have destroyed over 2,000 barns filled with wheat, burned over 70 mills filled with grain and flour.

In conjunction with spring 1864 offensives, Union Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered Maj. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]] to move down the Valley Pike from West Virginia to [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], to destroy its railroads and canal while denying the rich Shenandoah Valley to the Confederacy. Receiving intelligence on these movements, Confederate Maj. Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]] scraped together all available troops, including cadets from Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington. Sigel's advance was slowed by Confederate cavalry and undermined by his own command jealousies and inept decisions, but on May 11 his cavalry captured a lightly defended Woodstock. The Confederates were forced out of Woodstock so fast that several telegrams between Breckinridge and his cavalry commander [[John D. Imboden]] fell into Union hands. These Woodstock dispatches revealed strength and location of Confederate forces as well as a rough time table for a cavalry rendezvous with the main Confederate force - potentially a game-changing intelligence coup. But rather than acting decisively, Sigel continued his cautious advance, allowing Confederates time to concentrate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-battle-of-new-market.html|title=StackPath|website=www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> Breckenridge decided to attack Sigel's army, which had advanced from Woodstock.
