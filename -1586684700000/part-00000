The stadium was built for [[American football|football]] and in the past, it has served as home of several alternate-league football teams.

Roosevelt]] during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>[http://www.mynews13.com/content/news/cfnews13/news/article.html/content/news/articles/cfn/2014/2/4/florida_citrus_bowl.html Now you can watch the Citrus Bowl reconstruction online as it happens.] Central Florida News 13.</ref> The stadium was built to the immediate east of the baseball park [[Tinker Field]], which opened in 1914. The stadium opened later in 1936 with a capacity of 8,900 as Orlando Stadium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themaneland.com/2015/1/21/7863313/the-orlando-citrus-bowl-a-brief-history|title=The Orlando Citrus Bowl: A Brief History}}</ref> The first college football bowl game was played on January 1, 1947. Catawba defeated Maryville 31\u20136 in the inaugural [[Citrus Bowl (game)|Tangerine Bowl]]. 2,000 seats were added in 1952. During this period, the stadium was known as the Tangerine Bowl. 5,000 more seats were added in 1968, along with the first press box.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1976 an expansion project raised the capacity to 50,612, including a 3,600-seat upper deck on the east sidelines. However, shortly after completion the project proved to be a public fiasco and potentially an architectural and engineering failure. On November 27, 1976 the first major game was held at the expanded stadium, a regular season matchup between [[1976 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] and [[1976 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami]]. During the game, the newly-constructed upper deck noticeably swayed whenever fans stood up and cheered.<ref name=\"Sentinel11-28-19768pg49\">{{cite news|title=Sections of T-Bowl Sway|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23930373/|newspaper=Sentinel Star|page=49|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=November 28, 1976|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}{{Open access}}</ref> The deck vibrated, fences and railings shook and creaked, causing an unnerving sensation for the patrons sitting in those sections. The swaying and shaking was noticeable again about a month later during the [[1976 Tangerine Bowl|1976 Tangerine Bowl game]].

While it was believed that the upper deck was structurally sound and met building codes, it nevertheless was deemed a failure. Additional problems included inadequate access to restrooms in the upper deck, gaps between the sections which required obstructive fences, and the fact that the upper deck was built at such an angle that it had poor sight lines.<ref name=\"Sentinel05-15-1978pg1\">{{cite news|title=Rush sacks expansion for a loss (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23929076/|first=Larry|last=Guest|newspaper=Sentinel Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 15, 1978|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}{{Open access}}</ref><ref name=\"Sentinel05-15-1978pg6\">{{cite news|title=Rush sacks expansion for a loss (Part2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23929236/|first=Larry|last=Guest|newspaper=Sentinel Star|page=6|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 15, 1978|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}{{Open access}}</ref> Meanwhile, unsightly I-beams installed to hold up the upper deck now blocked seats in the lower deck that were previously unobstructed.<ref name=\"Sentinel05-16-1978pg1\">{{cite news|title=T-Bowl sway just one of its burdens (Part 1)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23929455/|first=Larry|last=Guest|newspaper=Sentinel Star|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 16, 1978|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}{{Open access}}</ref><ref name=\"Sentinel05-16-1978pg10\">{{cite news|title=T-Bowl sway just one of its burdens (Part 2)|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23929476/|first=Larry|last=Guest|newspaper=Sentinel Star|page=10|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=May 16, 1978|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}{{Open access}}</ref>\n\nThe maligned stadium's reputation was heavily tarnished after the upper deck scandal, criticized by public officials, media, and fans. Further complicating the situation was [[UCF Knights football|UCF]]'s pending move to the stadium for [[1979 UCF Knights football team|1979]]. The city finally received a settlement of $900,500 from the stadium's engineers, architects, and designers, money that was soon appropriated for new improvements. The infamous steel east upper deck was dismantled in May 1980.<ref name=\"Sentinel04-29-1980pg30\">{{cite news|title=3,600 swaying T-Bowl seats to be taken down in 2 weeks|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7680133/|first=Randy|last=Ziffer|newspaper=Sentinel Star|page=30|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=April 29, 1980|accessdate=September 21, 2018}}{{Open access}}</ref>\n\nAfter various new improvements, and a $30&nbsp;million renovation that added new concrete upper decks to both sides, a capacity of 65,438 was established in 1989. In 1983, the Florida Department of Citrus was added as a title sponsor for the facility, at a price of $250,000. From 1999 to 2002, key stadium improvements included the addition of contour seating, two escalators, and a new {{convert|107|ft|m|sing=on}} wide scoreboard/video screen. A new sound system, along with two full-color ribbon displays along the upper decks, were also added. The expansion resulted in the upper deck overhanging Tinker Field's right field area, albeit at a significant height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orlandocitrusbowl.com/about/history|title=Orlando Citrus Bowl history}}</ref>\n\n==Events hosted==\n===Football===\n[[File:Citrusbowlmiddle.JPG|thumb|left|275px|A view of the field during the inaugural [[Conference USA Football Championship|C-USA Championship Game]] in 2005]]\nCamping World Stadium has been home field to several short-lived [[American football|professional football]] teams. From 1966 to 1970, the stadium was home to the [[Orlando Panthers]] of the [[Continental Football League]]. In 1974, the [[Florida Blazers]] of the [[World Football League]] played their only season in existence at the Tangerine Bowl. The [[United States Football League|USFL's]] [[Orlando Renegades]] played one season in 1985. The [[Orlando Thunder]] of the [[NFL Europa|WLAF]] called the Citrus Bowl home in their two-season existence during the early 1990s, while the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]]'s [[Orlando Rage]] played there in 2001 as well as the [[United Football League (2009\u20132012)|UFL's]] [[Florida Tuskers]], occupying the stadium for 2 seasons from 2009, before moving to [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] as the [[Virginia Destroyers]] in 2011.

The school started playing home football games on their own field beginning on August 31, 2012.\n\nRollins College, Winter Park, Florida, was the first college to use the then named Orlando Stadium as its home field.

Lack of an agreement to rectify these issues led UCF to consider relocating, or spend considerable expense to upgrade the facility at its own cost. In addition, the stadium's capacity was seen as too large for UCF, leaving the stadium an appearance of being empty even with attendance of as much as 30,000\u201340,000 people per game. UCF's all-time attendance record was 51,978 for the 2005 [[Conference USA Football Championship|C-USA Championship Game]] versus [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]]. Furthermore, the stadium was located over {{convert|10|mi}} from the university's main campus in East Orlando, with travel times of up to a half-hour due to traffic. In 2005, UCF officials led by [[List of Presidents of the University of Central Florida|university president]] [[John Hitt]] made the decision to construct a new [[Spectrum Stadium|on-campus stadium]], which opened for the [[2007 UCF Knights football team|2007 season]].\n\nOrlando officials began exploring stadium refurbishment project in 2004, when the [[Capital One Bowl]] bid to become a [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) game, but was not chosen due to the stadium's aging condition. Camping World Stadium also submitted a bid for the [[ACC Championship Game]], but lost to [[Jacksonville Municipal Stadium]]. The key reasons for losing the bids were the lack of modern [[luxury box]]es, bench seating, and capacity. The hopes for Camping World Stadium became reality when, on September 29, 2006, Orlando Mayor [[Buddy Dyer]] announced an agreement on a $175-million renovation of Camping World Stadium.

However, the plans were heavily affected by the [[Great Recession]] of 2007\u201308.\n[[File:Citrus Bowl, Construction progress.jpg|thumb|Renovation nearing completion in late 2014|261x261px]]\nIn 2010, the natural grass surface was replaced with [[AstroTurf]] Gameday Grass 3D after the [[2009 Champs Sports Bowl]] and [[2010 Capital One Bowl]] were marred by poor field conditions that led to two football player injuries. Stadium conditions once again prompted a review of the stadiums condition. Finally, it was announced in May 2013 that the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium would undergo a reconstruction during 2014, at a cost of less than US$200 million. The cost estimate as of March 2014 was US$207 million. The stadium's upper level seating was retained, but the entire lower bowl structure was demolished.\n\nIn the newly reconstructed stadium there are two 360-degree concourses, a {{convert|20000|sqfoot|adj=on}} plaza deck (\"Party Deck\") in the north end zone, 41,000 all-new lower bowl seats with six additional inches of leg room & chairbacks, multiple giant video displays, new team facilities including locker rooms training rooms and attached media, new stadium operations facilities to allow better efficiency in food service, security, first aid and maintenance, new concessions and restrooms, and an open-air fa\u00e7ade. The new mezzanine is now referred to as the \"Plaza level\". The upper deck, previously numbered the \"300\" level, is now numbered the \"200\" level.\n\nThe reconstruction began immediately following a groundbreaking event held at the stadium on January 29, 2014 and demolition of the entire lower bowl lasted 25 days. The first event at the renovated Camping World Stadium was the 2014 edition of the [[Florida Classic]] on November 22, 2014.

Lack of an agreement to rectify these issues led UCF to consider relocating, or spend considerable expense to upgrade the facility at its own cost. In addition, the stadium's capacity was seen as too large for UCF, leaving the stadium an appearance of being empty even with attendance of as much as 30,000\u201340,000 people per game. UCF's all-time attendance record was 51,978 for the 2005 [[Conference USA Football Championship|C-USA Championship Game]] versus [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]]. Furthermore, the stadium was located over {{convert|10|mi}} from the university's main campus in East Orlando, with travel times of up to a half-hour due to traffic. In 2005, UCF officials led by [[List of Presidents of the University of Central Florida|university president]] [[John Hitt]] made the decision to construct a new [[Spectrum Stadium|on-campus stadium]], which opened for the [[2007 UCF Knights football team|2007 season]].\n\nOrlando officials began exploring stadium refurbishment project in 2004, when the [[Capital One Bowl]] bid to become a [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) game, but was not chosen due to the stadium's aging condition. Camping World Stadium also submitted a bid for the [[ACC Championship Game]], but lost to [[Jacksonville Municipal Stadium]]. The key reasons for losing the bids were the lack of modern [[luxury box]]es, bench seating, and capacity. The hopes for Camping World Stadium became reality when, on September 29, 2006, Orlando Mayor [[Buddy Dyer]] announced an agreement on a $175-million renovation of Camping World Stadium. It is part of the \"Triple Crown for Downtown\", a $1.1-billion plan to redo the Orlando Centroplex with a [[Amway Center|new $480-million arena]] for the [[Orlando Magic]], a new $375-million performing arts center, and the Camping World Stadium improvements. Conceptual drawings for the possible improvements include enclosed concourses on the east and west sides of the stadium and additions to the north side that will finally complete the lower bowl.<ref>http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/local/orange/orl-bk-magic09292006,0,1078507.story{{dead link|date=December 2016}}</ref> The Orlando/Orange County Interlocal Agreement was approved by the Orlando City Council on August 6, 2007. However, the plans were heavily affected by the [[Great Recession]] of 2007\u201308.\n[[File:Citrus Bowl, Construction progress.jpg|thumb|Renovation nearing completion in late 2014|261x261px]]\nIn 2010, the natural grass surface was replaced with [[AstroTurf]] Gameday Grass 3D after the [[2009 Champs Sports Bowl]] and [[2010 Capital One Bowl]] were marred by poor field conditions that led to two football player injuries. Stadium conditions once again prompted a review of the stadiums condition. Finally, it was announced in May 2013 that the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium would undergo a reconstruction during 2014, at a cost of less than US$200 million. The cost estimate as of March 2014 was US$207 million. The stadium's upper level seating was retained, but the entire lower bowl structure was demolished.\n\nIn the newly reconstructed stadium there are two 360-degree concourses, a {{convert|20000|sqfoot|adj=on}} plaza deck (\"Party Deck\") in the north end zone, 41,000 all-new lower bowl seats with six additional inches of leg room & chairbacks, multiple giant video displays, new team facilities including locker rooms training rooms and attached media, new stadium operations facilities to allow better efficiency in food service, security, first aid and maintenance, new concessions and restrooms, and an open-air fa\u00e7ade. The new mezzanine is now referred to as the \"Plaza level\". The upper deck, previously numbered the \"300\" level, is now numbered the \"200\" level.\n\nThe reconstruction began immediately following a groundbreaking event held at the stadium on January 29, 2014 and demolition of the entire lower bowl lasted 25 days. The first event at the renovated Camping World Stadium was the 2014 edition of the [[Florida Classic]] on November 22, 2014.

After the \u017di\u010da monastery was burned by the [[Cumans]] (between 1276 and 1292) the seat of Serbian archbishop was transferred to a more secure location - [[Patriarchal Monastery of Pe\u0107]] where it remained until the abolition of the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107]] in 1766.\n\nThe city became a major religious center of [[History of Medieval Serbia|medieval Serbia]] under the Serbian Emperor [[Stefan Du\u0161an]], who made it the seat of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1346. It retained this status until 1766, when the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107]] was abolished. Today, Pe\u0107 holds the memory of old Serbian Patriarchate.

Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.\n\nIn late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>\n\n===2007\u20132014: The Saturdays===\n[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]\nSince 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom. Its follow-up single \"[[Up (The Saturdays song)|Up]]\" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; to date the single has sold 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=109889 |title=Board Message |publisher=Buzzjack.com |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> The band's debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Lights]]'' (2008) reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was awarded Platinum selling status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).

''[[Wordshaker]]'' (2009) was the band's follow-up studio album and also charted within the top ten on the UK Albums Chart and went on to gain a Silver selling status, with singles \"[[Forever Is Over]]\" and \"[[Ego (The Saturdays song)|Ego]]\" charting within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. ''[[Headlines!]]'' (2010) was released as the band's first [[Mini album]] and charted at number-three on the UK Albums Chart and number-ten on the [[Irish Album Chart]]. ''Headlines!'' saw release of top ten singles \"[[Missing You (The Saturdays song)|Missing You]]\" and \"[[Higher (The Saturdays song)|Higher]]\" which features guest vocals from [[Flo Rida]], both singles became a massive commercial success for the band with \"Higher\" spending a massive 20 weeks on the chart. The Saturdays third studio album, ''[[On Your Radar]]'' (2011) contained three highly successful selling singles and two of which\u2014\"[[Notorious (The Saturdays song)|Notorious]]\" and \"[[All Fired Up (The Saturdays song)|All Fired Up]]\" charted within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart. \"[[My Heart Takes Over]]\" was also released from ''On Your Radar''.\n\nThe band released another extended play, ''[[Chasing The Saturdays (EP)|Chasing The Saturdays]]'' which was only released in North America. The band's fourth studio album, ''[[Living for the Weekend (The Saturdays album)|Living for the Weekend]]'' saw the release of the singles; \"[[30 Days (The Saturdays song)|30 Days]]\", \"[[What About Us (The Saturdays song)|What About Us]]\", \"[[Gentleman (The Saturdays song)|Gentleman]]\" and \"[[Disco Love]]\". \"[[30 Days (The Saturdays song)|30 Days]]\" became the group's eleventh top-ten hit, whilst \"[[What About Us (The Saturdays song)|What About Us]]\" featuring [[Sean Paul]] saw The Saturdays earn their first number-one single in 2013, it is taken from their forthcoming fourth studio album, ''[[Living for the Weekend (The Saturdays album)|Living for the Weekend]]''.

Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.\n\nIn late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>\n\n===2007\u20132014: The Saturdays===\n[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]\nSince 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom. Its follow-up single \"[[Up (The Saturdays song)|Up]]\" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; to date the single has sold 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=109889 |title=Board Message |publisher=Buzzjack.com |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> The band's debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Lights]]'' (2008) reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was awarded Platinum selling status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI).

''[[Headlines!]]'' (2010) was released as the band's first [[Mini album]] and charted at number-three on the UK Albums Chart and number-ten on the [[Irish Album Chart]]. ''Headlines!'' saw release of top ten singles \"[[Missing You (The Saturdays song)|Missing You]]\" and \"[[Higher (The Saturdays song)|Higher]]\" which features guest vocals from [[Flo Rida]], both singles became a massive commercial success for the band with \"Higher\" spending a massive 20 weeks on the chart.
