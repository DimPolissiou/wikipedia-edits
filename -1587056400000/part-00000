''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 32</ref> The much larger heterogeneous group of [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking peoples, who, according to Brian Conwell, stretch from [[Virginia]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and north to [[Hudson Bay]], was named after the tribe.\n\nMost Algonquins live in [[Quebec]]. The nine Algonquin bands in that province and one in [[Ontario]] have a combined population of about 11,000. The Algonquin are original natives of southern\nQuebec and eastern Ontario in Canada. Today they live in nine communities in Quebec and one in Ontario. The Algonquin were a small tribe that also lives in northern Michigan and southern Quebec and eastern Ontario. (Popular usage reflects some confusion on the point.  The term \"Algonquin\" is sometimes used, such as in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', to refer to all Algonquian-speaking societies, although this is not correct.)\n\nMany Algonquins still speak the Algonquin language, called generally ''{{lang|alq|Anicin\u00e0pemowin}}'' or specifically ''{{lang|alq|Om\u00e0miwinin\u00ecmowin}}''. The language is considered one of several divergent dialects of the Anishinaabe languages. Among younger speakers, the Algonquin language has experienced strong word borrowings from the [[Cree language]].<ref>Artuso, Christian. 1998. ''noogom gaa-izhi-anishinaabemonaaniwag: Generational Difference in Algonquin''.

''Lexique de la Langue Algonquine'', Montr\u00e9al: J. Chapleau & Fils.</ref>  Today Algonquins live in housings like those of the general public.\n\nTraditionally, the Algonquins were practitioners of ''[[Midewiwin]]'' (the right path). They  believed they were surrounded by many ''[[manitou|manit\u00f2]]k'' or spirits in the natural world. French missionaries converted many Algonquins to [[Catholicism]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, many of the people practice traditional ''Midewiwin'' or a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] merging of Christianity and Midewiwin.\n\nIn the earliest oral history, the Algonquins say they migrated from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast.  Together with other ''[[Anishinaabe|Anicin\u00e0pe]]k'', they arrived at the \"First Stopping Place\" near [[Montreal]].  While the other ''Anicin\u00e0pe'' peoples continued their journey up the [[St. Lawrence River]], the Algonquins settled along the ''Kitcis\u00ecpi'' ([[Ottawa River]]), a long-important highway for commerce, cultural exchange and transportation.  Algonquin identity, though, was not fully realized until after the dividing of the Anicin\u00e0pek at the \"Third Stopping Place\".  Scholars have used the oral histories, archeology, and linguistics to estimate this took place about 2000 years ago, near present-day [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]].\n\nAfter contact with the Europeans, especially the [[French people|French]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]], the Algonquin nations became active in the [[fur trade]].  This led them to fight against the powerful [[Iroquois]], whose confederacy was based in present-day New York.  In 1570, the Algonquins formed an alliance with the [[Innu|Montagnais]] to the east, whose territory extended to the ocean.\n\n==French contact==\n\n[[File:Algonquins.jpg|thumb|right|Algonquin couple, 18th-century watercolor.  The first Algonquian encountered by the [[French people|French]] were the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' (\"Ottawa River Men\"; singular: ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirini}}''), whose village was located on an island in the [[Ottawa River]]; the French called this group ''La Nation de l'Isle''.]]  The Algonquin first met Europeans when [[Samuel de Champlain]] came upon a party led by the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirini}}'' Chief [[Tessouat]] at [[Tadoussac, Quebec|Tadoussac]], in eastern present-day Quebec, in the summer of 1603.  They were celebrating a recent victory over the [[Iroquois]], with the allied [[Innu|Montagnais]] and Etechemins ([[Malecite]]).  Champlain did not understand that the Algonquins were socially united by a strong [[totem]]/clan system rather than the European-styled political concept of nationhood.  The several Algonquin bands each had its own chief.  Within each band, the chief depended on political approval from each of the band's clan leaders.  Champlain needed to cultivate relationships with numerous chiefs and clan leaders.  From 1603, some of the Algonquin allied with the French under Champlain. This alliance proved useful to the Algonquin, who previously had little to no access to European firearms.\n\nChamplain made his first exploration of the Ottawa River during May 1613 and reached the fortified ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirini}}'' village at [[Morrison Island]]. Unlike the other Algonquin communities, the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' did not change location with the seasons. They had chosen a strategic point astride the trade route between the [[Great Lakes]] and the St. Lawrence River.  They prospered through the collection of [[beaver]] pelts from native traders passing through their territory.  They also were proud of their corn fields.\n\nAt first, the French used the term \"Algonquin\" only for a second group, the ''[[Weskarini Algonquin First Nation|W\u00e0w\u00e0ckeciriniwak]]''.  However, by 1615, they applied the name to all of the Algonquin bands living along the Ottawa River.  Because of keen interest by tribes to gain control of the lower [[Ottawa River]], the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' and the ''{{lang|alq|W\u00e0w\u00e0ckeciriniwak}}'' came under fierce opposition.  These two large groups allied together, under the leadership of ''[[Sachem]]'' Charles Parcharini, to maintain the ''{{lang|alq|Om\u00e0miwinini}}'' identity and territory.\n\n==French-Indian War/Seven Years' War==\n{{main|French and Indian War|Seven Years' War}}\nThe [[Iroquois Confederacy]] drove the Algonquins from their lands.  They were aided by having been traded arms by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and later by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|English]].  The Iroquois and the English defeated the French and Algonquins.\n\nIn 1623, after [[Sir David Kirke]]'s occupation of [[New France]] demonstrated French colonial vulnerability, the French began to trade muskets to the Algonquins and their allies.  French [[Jesuits]] began to seek Algonquin conversions to [[Roman Catholic]]ism.\n\nThrough all of these years, the Iroquois never attacked the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirinik}}'' fortress.  But, in 1642, they made a surprise winter raid, attacking the Algonquin while most of the warriors were absent, and causing severe casualties.  On March 6, 1647 ([[Ash Wednesday]]), a large Mohawk war party attacked the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' living near [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec|Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] and almost exterminated them.  The ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' were still at [[Morrison Island]] in 1650 and inspired respect with their 400 warriors.  When the French retreated from the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] country that year, Tessouat is reported to have had the superior of the Jesuit mission suspended by his armpits because he refused to offer him the customary presents for being allowed to travel through Algonquin territory.\n\nSome joined the mission at Sillery, where they were mostly destroyed by an [[infectious disease]] [[epidemic]] by 1676.  Encouraged by the French, others remained at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.  Their  settlement at nearby [[Pointe-du-Lac]] continued until about 1830.  That year the last 14 families, numbering about 50, moved to [[Kanesatake]] near [[Oka, Quebec|Oka]]. (The families who stayed in Trois Rivieres can be found in the Algonquin census of Trois Rivieres in the mid-19th century).\n\nThe [[Sulpician Mission]] of the Mountain was founded at [[Montreal]] in 1677, and some Algonquins settled there together with Iroquois converts.  The mostly [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] community became known as [[Kahnawake]].  But many Algonquin maintained their attachment to the traditional territory and fur trading.  Those who agreed to move to established reserves or joined other historical bands were federally \"recognized\".  Many others who did not re-locate were later called \"stragglers\" in the [[Ottawa (County of)|Ottawa]] and [[Pontiac County|Pontiac]] counties.\n\n==Settlement in Quebec==\n\nStarting in 1721, many Christian Algonquins began to settle for the summer at Kahnesatake, near Oka.  The [[Mohawk Nation]] was then considered one of the [[Seven Nations of Canada]].  Algonquin warriors continued to fight in alliance with France until the British conquest of Quebec in 1760, during the Seven Years' War.  After the British took over colonial rule of Canada, their officials sought to make allies of the First Nations.  Fighting on behalf of the British Crown, the Algonquins took part in the [[Barry St. Leger|Barry St Leger]] campaign during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n[[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] settlers began encroaching on Algonquin lands shortly after the Revolution. Later in the 19th century, the [[lumber|lumber industry]] began to move up the [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]] valley, and a lot of Algonquins were relegated to a string of small reserves.\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe historical Algonquin society was largely hunting and fishing-based. Being primarily a hunting nation, the people emphasized mobility.  They used materials that were light  and easy to transport. [[Canoe]]s were made of [[birch bark]], sewed with spruce roots and rendered waterproof by the application of heated spruce [[resin]] and [[bear]] grease.  During winter, [[toboggan]]s were used to transport material, and people used [[snowshoe]]s to get around.  The women used ''{{lang|alq|tikinaagan}}'' (cradleboards) to carry their babies.  It was built with wood and covered with an envelope made of leather or material. The baby was standing up with his feet resting on a small board. The mother would then put the ''tikin\u00e0gan'' on her back. This allowed the infant to look around and observe his surroundings.  The child was kept close to the mother but also had much stimulation.\n\nAlgonquian-speaking people also practiced agriculture, particularly south of the [[Great Lakes]], where the climate allows for a longer growing season.  Notable indigenous crops historically farmed by Algonquins are the [[sunflower]] and [[tobacco]]. Around 800CE, Eastern Algonquians adopted maize agriculture from their neighbors in the interior.<ref name=\"autogenerated223\">{{cite book|last=Snow|first=Dean R.|title=Archaeology of Native North America|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|page=223}}</ref>  Even among groups who mainly hunted, agricultural products were an important source of food.  They obtained what was needed by trading with or raiding societies that practiced more agriculture. Eastern Algonquians created pots that could withstand not only thermal stress but the mechanical stress of rough use.<ref name=\"autogenerated223\"/>\n\n[[Archaeological]] sites on Morrison Island near [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], within the territory of the later ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'', reveal a 1,000-year-old culture that manufactured [[copper]] tools and weapons.  Copper ore was extracted north of [[Lake Superior]] and distributed down to present-day northern [[New York (state)|New York]]. Local pottery artifacts from this period show widespread similarities that indicate the continuing use of the river for cultural exchange throughout the [[Canadian Shield]] and beyond.\n\nSome centuries later, the Algonquin tribe moved in and inhabited the islands and shores along the Ottawa.  By the 17th century the first Europeans found them well established as a hunter-gatherer society in control of the river. The ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' showed entrepreneurial spirit. On Morrison Island, at the location where 5,000-year-old copper artifacts were discovered, the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirini}}'' band levied a toll on canoe flotillas descending the river.\n\n==Ethnobotany==\nThey use an [[infusion]] of leaves of ''[[Epigaea repens]]'' for kidney disorders.<ref>Black, Meredith Jean 1980 Algonquin Ethnobotany: An Interpretation of Aboriginal Adaptation in South Western Quebec.

The nine Algonquin bands in that province and one in [[Ontario]] have a combined population of about 11,000. The Algonquin are original natives of southern\nQuebec and eastern Ontario in Canada. Today they live in nine communities in Quebec and one in Ontario. The Algonquin were a small tribe that also lives in northern Michigan and southern Quebec and eastern Ontario. (Popular usage reflects some confusion on the point.  The term \"Algonquin\" is sometimes used, such as in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', to refer to all Algonquian-speaking societies, although this is not correct.)\n\nMany Algonquins still speak the Algonquin language, called generally ''{{lang|alq|Anicin\u00e0pemowin}}'' or specifically ''{{lang|alq|Om\u00e0miwinin\u00ecmowin}}''. The language is considered one of several divergent dialects of the Anishinaabe languages. Among younger speakers, the Algonquin language has experienced strong word borrowings from the [[Cree language]].<ref>Artuso, Christian. 1998.

''Lexique de la Langue Algonquine'', Montr\u00e9al: J. Chapleau & Fils.</ref>  Today Algonquins live in housings like those of the general public.\n\nTraditionally, the Algonquins were practitioners of ''[[Midewiwin]]'' (the right path). They  believed they were surrounded by many ''[[manitou|manit\u00f2]]k'' or spirits in the natural world. French missionaries converted many Algonquins to [[Catholicism]] in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, many of the people practice traditional ''Midewiwin'' or a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] merging of Christianity and Midewiwin.\n\nIn the earliest oral history, the Algonquins say they migrated from the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast.  Together with other ''[[Anishinaabe|Anicin\u00e0pe]]k'', they arrived at the \"First Stopping Place\" near [[Montreal]].  While the other ''Anicin\u00e0pe'' peoples continued their journey up the [[St. Lawrence River]], the Algonquins settled along the ''Kitcis\u00ecpi'' ([[Ottawa River]]), a long-important highway for commerce, cultural exchange and transportation.  Algonquin identity, though, was not fully realized until after the dividing of the Anicin\u00e0pek at the \"Third Stopping Place\".  Scholars have used the oral histories, archeology, and linguistics to estimate this took place about 2000 years ago, near present-day [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]].\n\nAfter contact with the Europeans, especially the [[French people|French]] and [[Dutch people|Dutch]], the Algonquin nations became active in the [[fur trade]].  This led them to fight against the powerful [[Iroquois]], whose confederacy was based in present-day New York.  In 1570, the Algonquins formed an alliance with the [[Innu|Montagnais]] to the east, whose territory extended to the ocean.\n\n==French contact==\n\n[[File:Algonquins.jpg|thumb|right|Algonquin couple, 18th-century watercolor.  The first Algonquian encountered by the [[French people|French]] were the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' (\"Ottawa River Men\"; singular: ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirini}}''), whose village was located on an island in the [[Ottawa River]]; the French called this group ''La Nation de l'Isle''.]]  The Algonquin first met Europeans when [[Samuel de Champlain]] came upon a party led by the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirini}}'' Chief [[Tessouat]] at [[Tadoussac, Quebec|Tadoussac]], in eastern present-day Quebec, in the summer of 1603.  They were celebrating a recent victory over the [[Iroquois]], with the allied [[Innu|Montagnais]] and Etechemins ([[Malecite]]).  Champlain did not understand that the Algonquins were socially united by a strong [[totem]]/clan system rather than the European-styled political concept of nationhood.  The several Algonquin bands each had its own chief.  Within each band, the chief depended on political approval from each of the band's clan leaders.  Champlain needed to cultivate relationships with numerous chiefs and clan leaders.  From 1603, some of the Algonquin allied with the French under Champlain. This alliance proved useful to the Algonquin, who previously had little to no access to European firearms.\n\nChamplain made his first exploration of the Ottawa River during May 1613 and reached the fortified ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirini}}'' village at [[Morrison Island]]. Unlike the other Algonquin communities, the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' did not change location with the seasons. They had chosen a strategic point astride the trade route between the [[Great Lakes]] and the St. Lawrence River.  They prospered through the collection of [[beaver]] pelts from native traders passing through their territory.  They also were proud of their corn fields.\n\nAt first, the French used the term \"Algonquin\" only for a second group, the ''[[Weskarini Algonquin First Nation|W\u00e0w\u00e0ckeciriniwak]]''.  However, by 1615, they applied the name to all of the Algonquin bands living along the Ottawa River.  Because of keen interest by tribes to gain control of the lower [[Ottawa River]], the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' and the ''{{lang|alq|W\u00e0w\u00e0ckeciriniwak}}'' came under fierce opposition.  These two large groups allied together, under the leadership of ''[[Sachem]]'' Charles Parcharini, to maintain the ''{{lang|alq|Om\u00e0miwinini}}'' identity and territory.\n\n==French-Indian War/Seven Years' War==\n{{main|French and Indian War|Seven Years' War}}\nThe [[Iroquois Confederacy]] drove the Algonquins from their lands.  They were aided by having been traded arms by the [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and later by the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|English]].  The Iroquois and the English defeated the French and Algonquins.\n\nIn 1623, after [[Sir David Kirke]]'s occupation of [[New France]] demonstrated French colonial vulnerability, the French began to trade muskets to the Algonquins and their allies.  French [[Jesuits]] began to seek Algonquin conversions to [[Roman Catholic]]ism.\n\nThrough all of these years, the Iroquois never attacked the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirinik}}'' fortress.  But, in 1642, they made a surprise winter raid, attacking the Algonquin while most of the warriors were absent, and causing severe casualties.  On March 6, 1647 ([[Ash Wednesday]]), a large Mohawk war party attacked the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' living near [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec|Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] and almost exterminated them.  The ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' were still at [[Morrison Island]] in 1650 and inspired respect with their 400 warriors.  When the French retreated from the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] country that year, Tessouat is reported to have had the superior of the Jesuit mission suspended by his armpits because he refused to offer him the customary presents for being allowed to travel through Algonquin territory.\n\nSome joined the mission at Sillery, where they were mostly destroyed by an [[infectious disease]] [[epidemic]] by 1676.  Encouraged by the French, others remained at Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.  Their  settlement at nearby [[Pointe-du-Lac]] continued until about 1830.  That year the last 14 families, numbering about 50, moved to [[Kanesatake]] near [[Oka, Quebec|Oka]]. (The families who stayed in Trois Rivieres can be found in the Algonquin census of Trois Rivieres in the mid-19th century).\n\nThe [[Sulpician Mission]] of the Mountain was founded at [[Montreal]] in 1677, and some Algonquins settled there together with Iroquois converts.  The mostly [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] community became known as [[Kahnawake]].  But many Algonquin maintained their attachment to the traditional territory and fur trading.  Those who agreed to move to established reserves or joined other historical bands were federally \"recognized\".  Many others who did not re-locate were later called \"stragglers\" in the [[Ottawa (County of)|Ottawa]] and [[Pontiac County|Pontiac]] counties.\n\n==Settlement in Quebec==\n\nStarting in 1721, many Christian Algonquins began to settle for the summer at Kahnesatake, near Oka.  The [[Mohawk Nation]] was then considered one of the [[Seven Nations of Canada]].  Algonquin warriors continued to fight in alliance with France until the British conquest of Quebec in 1760, during the Seven Years' War.  After the British took over colonial rule of Canada, their officials sought to make allies of the First Nations.  Fighting on behalf of the British Crown, the Algonquins took part in the [[Barry St. Leger|Barry St Leger]] campaign during the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n[[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] settlers began encroaching on Algonquin lands shortly after the Revolution. Later in the 19th century, the [[lumber|lumber industry]] began to move up the [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]] valley, and a lot of Algonquins were relegated to a string of small reserves.\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe historical Algonquin society was largely hunting and fishing-based. Being primarily a hunting nation, the people emphasized mobility.  They used materials that were light  and easy to transport. [[Canoe]]s were made of [[birch bark]], sewed with spruce roots and rendered waterproof by the application of heated spruce [[resin]] and [[bear]] grease.  During winter, [[toboggan]]s were used to transport material, and people used [[snowshoe]]s to get around.  The women used ''{{lang|alq|tikinaagan}}'' (cradleboards) to carry their babies.  It was built with wood and covered with an envelope made of leather or material. The baby was standing up with his feet resting on a small board. The mother would then put the ''tikin\u00e0gan'' on her back. This allowed the infant to look around and observe his surroundings.  The child was kept close to the mother but also had much stimulation.\n\nAlgonquian-speaking people also practiced agriculture, particularly south of the [[Great Lakes]], where the climate allows for a longer growing season.  Notable indigenous crops historically farmed by Algonquins are the [[sunflower]] and [[tobacco]]. Around 800CE, Eastern Algonquians adopted maize agriculture from their neighbors in the interior.<ref name=\"autogenerated223\">{{cite book|last=Snow|first=Dean R.|title=Archaeology of Native North America|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|page=223}}</ref>  Even among groups who mainly hunted, agricultural products were an important source of food.  They obtained what was needed by trading with or raiding societies that practiced more agriculture. Eastern Algonquians created pots that could withstand not only thermal stress but the mechanical stress of rough use.<ref name=\"autogenerated223\"/>\n\n[[Archaeological]] sites on Morrison Island near [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], within the territory of the later ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'', reveal a 1,000-year-old culture that manufactured [[copper]] tools and weapons.  Copper ore was extracted north of [[Lake Superior]] and distributed down to present-day northern [[New York (state)|New York]]. Local pottery artifacts from this period show widespread similarities that indicate the continuing use of the river for cultural exchange throughout the [[Canadian Shield]] and beyond.\n\nSome centuries later, the Algonquin tribe moved in and inhabited the islands and shores along the Ottawa.  By the 17th century the first Europeans found them well established as a hunter-gatherer society in control of the river. The ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpiriniwak}}'' showed entrepreneurial spirit. On Morrison Island, at the location where 5,000-year-old copper artifacts were discovered, the ''{{lang|alq|Kitcis\u00ecpirini}}'' band levied a toll on canoe flotillas descending the river.\n\n==Ethnobotany==\nThey use an [[infusion]] of leaves of ''[[Epigaea repens]]'' for kidney disorders.<ref>Black, Meredith Jean 1980 Algonquin Ethnobotany: An Interpretation of Aboriginal Adaptation in South Western Quebec.

They are not in any sense \"dialects\" of standard Italian, which itself started off as one of these local tongues, but [[sister language]]s of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general.

Dante's epic poems, known collectively as the ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]],'' to which another Tuscan poet [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] later affixed the title ''Divina'', were read throughout the peninsula and his written dialect became the \"canonical standard\" that all educated [[Italians]] could understand. Dante is still credited with standardizing the Italian language. In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects.{{r|\":0\"|page=22}} Thus the dialect of [[Florence]] became the basis for what would become the official language of Italy.\n\nItalian was progressively made an official language of most of the Italian states predating unification, slowly replacing Latin, even when ruled by foreign powers (like Spain in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], or Austria in the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]), even though the masses kept speaking primarily their local vernaculars. Italian was also one of the many recognised languages in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\nItaly has always had a distinctive dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as [[city-state]]s. Those dialects now have considerable [[variety (linguistics)|variety]]. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between [[Rome|Roman]] Italian and [[Milan]]ese Italian are the [[consonant length|gemination]] of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed \"e\", and of \"s\" in some cases: e.g. ''va bene'' \"all right\" is pronounced {{IPA|[vab\u02c8b\u025b\u02d0ne]}} by a Roman (and by any standard Italian speaker), {{IPA|[va\u02c8be\u02d0ne]}} by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies to the north of the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]); ''a casa'' \"at home\" is {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} for Roman, {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} or {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for standard, {{IPA|[a\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for Milanese and generally northern.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n\nIn contrast to the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic linguistic panorama]] of [[northern Italy]], the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and its related dialects were largely unaffected by the Franco-[[Occitan language|Occitan]] influences introduced to Italy mainly by [[bard]]s from France during the [[Middle Ages]], but after the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]], Sicily became the first Italian land to adopt Occitan lyric moods (and words) in poetry. Even in the case of Northern Italian languages, however, scholars are careful not to overstate the effects of outsiders on the natural indigenous developments of the languages.\n\nThe economic might and relatively advanced development of Tuscany at the time ([[Late Middle Ages]]) gave its language weight, though [[Venetian language|Venetian]] remained widespread in medieval Italian commercial life, and [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian (or Genoese)]] remained in use in maritime trade alongside the Mediterranean. The increasing political and cultural relevance of [[Florence]] during the periods of the rise of the ''[[Medici bank|Banco Medici]]'', [[Humanism]], and the [[Renaissance]] made its dialect, or rather a refined version of it, a standard in the arts.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe [[Renaissance]] era, known as {{lang|it|il Rinascimento}} in Italian, was seen as a time of \"rebirth\", which is the literal meaning of both {{lang|fr|renaissance}} (from French) and {{lang|it|rinascimento}} (Italian).\n\n[[File:Pietro Bembo2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.63|[[Pietro Bembo]] was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language from the Tuscan dialect, as a literary medium, codifying the language for standard modern usage.]]\n\nDuring this time, long-existing beliefs stemming from the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] began to be understood from new perspectives as [[humanists]]\u2014individuals who placed emphasis on the human body and its full potential\u2014began to shift focus from the church to human beings themselves.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A history of Western society|last=P.|first=McKay, John|date=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Hill, Bennett D., Buckler, John.|isbn=978-0-618-52273-6|edition=8th|location=Boston|oclc=58837884}}</ref> Humanists began forming new beliefs in various forms: social, political, and intellectual. The ideals of the Renaissance were evident throughout the [[Protestant Reformation]], which took place simultaneously with the Renaissance. The Protestant Reformation began with [[Martin Luther]]'s rejection of the selling of indulgences by [[Johann Tetzel]] and other authorities within the Roman Catholic Church, resulting in Luther's eventual break-off from the Roman Catholic Church in the [[Diet of Worms]]. After Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, he founded what was then understood to be a sect of [[Catholicism]], later referred to as [[Lutheranism]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Luther's preaching in favor of faith and scripture rather than tradition led him to translate the [[Bible]] into many other languages, which would allow for people from all over Europe to read the Bible. Previously, the Bible was only translated into [[Latin]], but after this development it could be understood in many other languages, including Italian. The Italian language was able to spread even more with the help of Luther and the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]. The printing press facilitated the spread of Italian because it was able to rapidly produce texts, such as the Bible, and cut the costs of books which allowed for more people to have access to the translated Bible and new pieces of literature.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=Steven|last2=Harris|first2=Beth|title=An Introduction to the Protestant Reformation|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/renaissance-and-reformation/protestant-reformation/a/an-introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation|website=khanacademy|publisher=khanacademy|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman Catholic Church was losing its control over the population, as it was not open to change, and there was an increasing number of reformers with differing beliefs.<ref name=\":0x\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Renaissance|title=Renaissance|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc|last1=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nItalian became the language used in the courts of every state in the [[Italian peninsula]], as well as the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variety]] in the island of [[Corsica]] (but not in [[Sardinia]], which on the contrary [[Sardinian language#Savoyard period \u2013 Italian influence|underwent Italianization]] well into the late 18th century because of the prestige enjoyed by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the widespread use of Sardinian<ref>Cardia, Amos.

This discussion, known as {{lang|it|questione della lingua}} (i. e., the ''problem of the language''), ran through the Italian culture until the end of the 19th century, often linked to the political debate on achieving a united Italian state. Renaissance scholars divided into three main factions:\n* The [[purism (language)|purists]], headed by Venetian [[Pietro Bembo]] (who, in his ''[[Gli Asolani]]'', claimed the language might be based only on the great literary classics, such as [[Petrarch]] and some part of Boccaccio). The purists thought the Divine Comedy was not dignified enough because it used elements from non-lyric registers of the language.\n* [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] and other [[Florence|Florentines]] preferred the version spoken by ordinary people in their own times.\n* The [[courtier]]s, like [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], insisted that each local vernacular contribute to the new standard.\n\nA fourth faction claimed that the best Italian was the one that the papal court adopted, which was a mixture of the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] and [[Roman dialect|Roman]] dialects. \nEventually, Bembo's ideas prevailed, and the foundation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Florence (1582\u20131583), the official legislative body of the Italian language led to publication of [[Agnolo Monosini]]'s Latin tome {{lang|la|[[Floris Italicae lingue libri novem|Floris italicae linguae libri novem]]|italic=yes}} in 1604 followed by the first Italian dictionary in 1612.\n\nThe continual advancements in technology plays a crucial role in the diffusion of languages. After the invention of the [[printing press]] in the fifteenth century, the number of printing presses in Italy grew rapidly and by the year 1500 reached a total of 56, the biggest number of printing presses in all of Europe. This allowed to produce more pieces of literature at a lower cost and as the dominant language, Italian spread.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Information Technology and Economic Change: The Impact of the Printing Press|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=126|issue=3|pages=1133\u20131172|last1=Dittmar|first1=Jeremiah|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr035|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8ab843701523883bb51bb7752f2891fdfc841d18}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern era ===\nAn important event that helped the diffusion of Italian was the conquest and occupation of Italy by [[Napoleon]] in the early 19th century (who was himself of Italian-Corsican descent).

Examples are [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]], where [[Talian dialect|Talian]] is used, and the town of [[Chipilo]] near Puebla, [[Mexico]]; each continues to use a derived form of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] dating back to the nineteenth century. Another example is [[Cocoliche]], an Italian\u2013Spanish [[pidgin]] once spoken in [[Argentina]] and especially in [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Lunfardo]].\n\n=== Lingua franca ===\n{{See also|Mediterranean Lingua Franca}}\n\nStarting in late [[medieval]] times in much of Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin was replaced as the primary commercial language by Italian language variants (especially Tuscan and Venetian). These variants were consolidated during the [[Renaissance]] with the strength of Italy and the rise of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] and [[the arts]].\n\nDuring that period, Italy held artistic sway over the rest of Europe. It was the norm for all educated gentlemen to make the [[Grand Tour]], visiting Italy to see its great historical monuments and works of art. It thus became expected to learn at least some Italian. In England, while the classical languages [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] were the first to be learned, Italian became the second most common modern language after French, a position it held until the late eighteenth century when it tended to be replaced by German. [[John Milton]], for instance, wrote some of his early poetry in Italian.\n\nWithin the [[Catholic church]], Italian is known by a large part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and is used in substitution for Latin in some official documents.\n\nItalian [[loanword]]s continue to be used in most languages in matters of art and [[music]] (especially [[classical music]] including [[opera]]), in the [[design]] and [[fashion]] industries, in some sports like [[football (association)|football]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilsonline.it/italy/italianlanguage.html|title=Italian Language|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ilsonline.it|access-date=7 October 2016}}</ref> and especially, in culinary terms.\n\n== Languages and dialects ==\n{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}\n[[File:Dialetti Italia 1939.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Linguistic map of Italy according to Clemente Merlo and Carlo Tagliavini (1937)]]\n[[File:Minoranze linguistiche it.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Italy's ethno-linguistic minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|title=Lingue di Minoranza e Scuola: Carta Generale|website=Minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010152621/http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\nIn Italy, almost all the [[Languages of Italy|other languages spoken as the vernacular]] \u2014 other than standard Italian and some languages spoken among immigrant communities \u2014 are often imprecisely called \"[[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]\",<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/facts-figures-italian-language/ | title=Major Dialects of Italian|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=22 October 2015 }}</ref> even though they are quite different, with some belonging to different linguistic branches. The only exceptions to this are twelve groups considered \"[[Languages of Italy#Recognition by the Italian state|historical language minorities]]\", which are officially recognized as distinct [[minority language]]s by the law. On the other hand, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (a language spoken on the [[France|French]] island of [[Corsica]]) is closely related to medieval [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], from which Standard Italian derives and evolved.\n\nThe differences in the evolution of Latin in the different regions of Italy can be attributed to the presence of three other types of languages: [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrata, superstrata, and adstrata]]. The most prevalent were substrata (the language of the original inhabitants), as the Italian dialects were most likely simply Latin as spoken by native cultural groups. Superstrata and adstrata were both less important. Foreign conquerors of Italy that dominated different regions at different times left behind little to no influence on the dialects. Foreign cultures with which Italy engaged in peaceful relations with, such as trade, had no significant influence either.{{r|\":0\"|page=19-20}}\n\nThroughout Italy, regional variations of Standard Italian, called [[Regional Italian]], are spoken. Regional differences can be recognized by various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local language (for example, in informal situations ''{{wiktit|and\u00e0}}'', ''{{wiktit|ann\u00e0}}'' and ''{{wiktit|nare}}'' replace the standard Italian ''{{wiktit|andare}}'' in the area of Tuscany, Rome and Venice respectively for the infinitive \"to go\").\n\nThere is no definitive date when the various Italian variants of Latin\u2014including varieties that contributed to modern Standard Italian\u2014began to be distinct enough from Latin to be considered separate languages. One criterion for determining that two language variants are to be considered separate languages rather than variants of a single language is that they have evolved so that they are no longer [[mutually intelligible]]; this diagnostic is effective if mutual intelligibility is minimal or absent (e.g. in Romance, Romanian and Portuguese), but it fails in cases such as Spanish-Portuguese or Spanish-Italian, as native speakers of either pairing can understand each other well if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, on the basis of accumulated differences in morphology, syntax, phonology, and to some extent lexicon, it is not difficult to identify that for the Romance varieties of Italy, the first extant written evidence of languages that can no longer be considered Latin comes from the ninth and tenth centuries C.E. These written sources demonstrate certain vernacular characteristics and sometimes explicitly mention the use of the vernacular in Italy. Full literary manifestations of the vernacular began to surface around the 13th century in the form of various religious texts and poetry.{{r|\":0\"|page=21}}Although these are the first written records of Italian varieties separate from Latin, the spoken language had likely diverged long before the first written records appear, since those who were literate generally wrote in Latin even if they spoke other Romance varieties in person.\n\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of Standard Italian became increasingly widespread and was mirrored by a decline in the use of the dialects. An increase in literacy was one of the main driving factors (one can assume that only literates were capable of learning Standard Italian, whereas those who were illiterate had access only to their native dialect). The percentage of literates rose from 25% in 1861 to 60% in 1911, and then on to 78.1% in 1951. [[Tullio De Mauro]], an Italian linguist, has asserted that in 1861 only 2.5% of the population of Italy could speak Standard Italian. He reports that in 1951 that percentage had risen to 87%. The ability to speak Italian did not necessarily mean it was in everyday use, and most people (63.5%) still usually spoke their native dialects. In addition, other factors such as mass emigration, industrialization, and urbanization, and internal migrations after [[World War II]] contributed to the proliferation of Standard Italian. The Italians who emigrated during the [[Italian diaspora]] beginning in 1861 were often of the uneducated lower class, and thus the emigration had the effect of increasing the percentage of literates, who often knew and understood the importance of Standard Italian, back home in Italy. A large percentage of those who had emigrated also eventually returned to Italy, often more educated than when they had left.{{r|\":0\"|page=35}}\n\nThe Italian dialects have declined in the modern era, as Italy unified under Standard Italian and continues to do so aided by mass media, from newspapers to radio to television.{{r|\":0\"|page=37}}\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n[[File:It-Vangeli.ogg|thumb|[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Luke#Chapter 2|Luke 2]], 1\u20137 of the Bible being read by a speaker of Italian from [[Milan]]]]\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{transcluded section|source=Italian phonology|part=yes}}\n{{trim|{{#section-h:Italian phonology|Consonants}}}}\nItalian has a seven-vowel system, consisting of {{IPA|/a, \u025b, e, i, \u0254, o, u/}}, as well as 23 consonants. Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian phonology is conservative, preserving many words nearly unchanged from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Some examples:\n* Italian ''{{wiktita|quattordici}}'' \"fourteen\" < Latin {{smallcaps|{{wiktlat|quattuordecim}}}} (cf. Romanian ''{{wiktron|paisprezece}}/{{wiktron|pai\u0219pe}}'', Spanish ''{{wiktspa|catorce}}'', French ''{{wiktfra|quatorze}}'' {{IPA|/ka\u02c8t\u0254\u0281z/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[wikt:catorze|catorze]]|italic=yes}})\n* Italian ''settimana'' \"week\" < Latin {{smallcaps|septim\u0101na}} (cf. Romanian ''s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2n\u0103'', Spanish and Portuguese ''semana'', French ''semaine'' {{IPA|/s(\u0259)\u02c8m\u025bn/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''setmana'')\n* Italian ''medesimo'' \"same\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|medi(p)simum}} (cf. Spanish ''mismo'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mesmo'', French ''m\u00eame'' {{IPA|/m\u025bm/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''mateix''; note that Italian usually uses the shorter ''stesso'')\n* Italian ''guadagnare'' \"to win, earn, gain\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|guadany\u0101re}} < [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] {{IPA|/waidanjan/}} (cf. Spanish ''ganar'', Portuguese ''ganhar'', French ''gagner'' {{IPA|/\u0261a\u02c8\u0272e/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''guanyar'')\n\nThe conservativeness of Italian phonology is partly explained by its origin. Italian stems from a literary language that is derived from the 13th-century speech of the city of [[Florence]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], and has changed little in the last 700 years or so. Furthermore, the Tuscan dialect is the most conservative of all [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]], radically different from the [[Gallo-Italian languages]] less than 100 miles to the north (across the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]).\n\nThe following are some of the conservative phonological features of Italian, as compared with the common [[Western Romance]] languages (French, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). Some of these features are also present in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n* Little or no [[lenition]] of consonants between vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|v\u012bta}} > ''vita'' \"life\" (cf. Romanian ''via\u021b\u0103'', Spanish ''vida'' {{IPA|[bi\u00f0a]}}, French ''vie''), {{smallcaps|pedem}} > ''piede'' \"foot\" (cf. Spanish ''pie'', French ''pied'' {{IPA|/pje/}}).\n* Preservation of geminate consonants, e.g. {{smallcaps|annum}} > {{IPA|/\u02c8an.no/}} ''anno'' \"year\" (cf. Spanish ''a\u00f1o'' {{IPA|/a\u0272o/}}, French ''an'' {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}}, Portuguese ''ano'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u00e3.nu/}}).\n* Preservation of all [[Proto-Romance]] final vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|pacem}} > ''pace'' \"peace\" (cf. Romanian ''pace'', Spanish ''paz'', French ''paix'' {{IPA|/p\u025b/}}), {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Romanian ''opt'', Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit'' {{IPA|/\u0265i(t)/}}), {{smallcaps|f\u0113c\u012b}} > ''feci'' \"I did\" (cf. Spanish ''hice'', French ''fis'' {{IPA|/fi/}}).\n* Preservation of most intertonic vowels (those between the stressed syllable and either the beginning or ending syllable). This accounts for some of the most noticeable differences, as in the forms ''quattordici'' and ''settimana'' given above.\n* Slower consonant development, e.g. {{smallcaps|folia}} > Italo-Western {{IPA|/f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} > ''foglia'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} \"leaf\" (cf. Romanian ''foaie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u032faje/}}, Spanish ''hoja'' {{IPA|/\u02c8oxa/}}, French ''feuille'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0153j/}}; but note Portuguese ''folha'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u028e\u0250/}}).\n\nCompared with most other Romance languages, Italian has many inconsistent outcomes, where the same underlying sound produces different results in different words, e.g. {{smallcaps|lax\u0101re}} > ''lasciare'' and ''lassare'', {{smallcaps|capti\u0101re}} > ''cacciare'' and ''cazzare'', {{smallcaps|(ex)d\u0113roteol\u0101re}} > ''sdrucciolare'', ''druzzolare'' and ''ruzzolare'', {{smallcaps|r\u0113g\u012bna}} > ''regina'' and ''reina''. Although in all these examples the second form has fallen out of usage, the dimorphism is thought to reflect the several-hundred-year period during which Italian developed as a literary language divorced from any native-speaking population, with an origin in 12th/13th-century Tuscan but with many words borrowed from [[Languages of Italy|languages]] farther to the north, with different sound outcomes. (The [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]], the most important [[isogloss]] in the entire Romance-language area, passes only about 20 miles to the north of Florence.) Dual outcomes of Latin /p t k/ between vowels, such as {{smallcaps|l\u014fcum}} > '' luogo'' but {{smallcaps|f\u014fcum}} > '' fuoco'', was once thought to be due to borrowing of northern voiced forms, but is now generally viewed as the result of early phonetic variation within Tuscany.\n\nSome other features that distinguish Italian from the Western Romance languages:\n* Latin {{smallcaps|ce-,ci-}} becomes {{IPA|/t\u0283e, t\u0283i/}} rather than {{IPA|/(t)se, (t)si/}}.\n* Latin {{smallcaps|-ct-}} becomes {{IPA|/tt/}} rather than {{IPA|/jt/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}: {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit,'' Portuguese ''oito'').\n* Vulgar Latin {{smallcaps|-cl-}} becomes ''cchi'' {{IPA|/kkj/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u028e/}}: {{smallcaps|oclum}} > ''occhio'' \"eye\" (cf. Portuguese ''olho'' {{IPA|/o\u028eu/}}, French ''oeil'' {{IPA|/\u0153j/}} < {{IPA|/\u0153\u028e/}}); but Romanian ''ochi'' {{IPA|/ok\u02b2/}}.\n* Final {{IPA|/s/}} is not preserved, and vowel changes rather than {{IPA|/s/}} are used to mark the plural: ''amico, amici'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amica, amiche'' \"female friend(s)\" (cf. Romanian ''amic, amici'',''amic\u0103, amice'', Spanish ''amigo(s)'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amiga(s)'' \"female friend(s)\"); {{smallcaps|tr\u0113s, sex}} \u2192 ''tre, sei'' \"three, six\" (cf. Romanian ''trei, \u0219ase'', Spanish ''tres, seis'').\n\nStandard Italian also differs in some respects from most nearby Italian languages:\n* Perhaps most noticeable is the total lack of [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]], though metaphony is a feature characterizing nearly every other [[Languages of Italy|Italian language]].\n* No simplification of original {{IPA|/nd/}}, {{IPA|/mb/}} (which often became {{IPA|/nn/, /mm/}} elsewhere).\n\n=== Assimilation ===\nItalian [[phonotactics]] do not usually permit verbs and polysyllabic nouns to end with consonants, excepting poetry and song, so foreign words may receive [[Epenthetic vowel#Epenthesis of a vowel, or anaptyxis|extra terminal vowel sounds]].<!--(Maybe this should go under history?)--->\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Italian alphabet}}\nThe Italian alphabet is typically considered to consist of 21 letters. The letters j, k, w, x, y are traditionally excluded, though they appear in loanwords such as ''jeans'', ''whisky'', ''taxi'', ''xenofobo'', ''xilofono''. The letter {{angle bracket|x}} has become common in standard Italian with the prefix ''extra-'', although ''(e)stra-'' is traditionally used; it is also common to use the Latin particle ''ex(-)'' to mean \"former(ly)\" as in: ''la mia ex'' (\"my ex-girlfriend\"), \"Ex-Jugoslavia\" (\"Former Yugoslavia\"). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} appears in the first name ''Jacopo'' and in some Italian place-names, such as [[Bajardo]], [[Bojano]], [[Joppolo]], [[Jerzu]], [[Jesolo]], [[Jesi]], [[Ajaccio]], among others, and in ''Mar Jonio'', an alternative spelling of ''Mar Ionio'' (the [[Ionian Sea]]). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} may appear in dialectal words, but its use is discouraged in contemporary standard Italian.<ref name=\"Clivio\">{{cite book|title=The Sounds, Forms, and Uses of Italian: An Introduction to Italian Linguistics|first=Gianrenzo|last=Clivio|first2=Marcel|last2=Danesi|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000|pages=21, 66}}</ref> Letters used in foreign words can be replaced with [[phonetics|phonetically]] equivalent native Italian letters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: {{angle bracket|gi}}, {{angle bracket|ge}}, or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|j}}; {{angle bracket|c}} or {{angle bracket|ch}} for {{angle bracket|k}} (including in the standard prefix ''kilo-''); {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}} or {{angle bracket|v}} for {{angle bracket|w}}; {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|ss}}, {{angle bracket|z}}, {{angle bracket|zz}} or {{angle bracket|cs}} for {{angle bracket|x}}; and {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|y}}.\n* The [[acute accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|front close-mid vowel]], as in ''perch\u00e9'' \"why, because\". In dictionaries, it is also used over {{angle bracket|o}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid back rounded vowel|back close-mid vowel]] (''azi\u00f3ne''). The [[grave accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|front open-mid vowel]], as in ''t\u00e8'' \"tea\". The grave accent is used over any vowel to indicate word-final stress, as in ''giovent\u00f9'' \"youth\". Unlike {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}, which is a ''close''-mid vowel, a stressed final {{angle bracket|o}} is always a [[Open-mid back rounded vowel|back open-mid vowel]] (''andr\u00f2''), making {{angle bracket|\u00f3}} unnecessary outside of dictionaries. Most of the time, the penultimate syllable is stressed. But if the stressed vowel is the final letter of the word, the accent is mandatory, otherwise it is virtually always omitted. Exceptions are typically either in dictionaries, where all or most stressed vowels are commonly marked. Accents can optionally be used to disambiguate words that differ only by stress, as for ''pr\u00ecncipi'' \"princes\" and ''princ\u00ecpi'' \"principles\", or ''\u00e0ncora'' \"anchor\" and ''anc\u00f3ra'' \"still''/''yet\". For monosyllabic words, the rule is different: when two orthographically identical monosyllabic words with different meanings exist, one is accented and the other is not (example: ''\u00e8'' \"is\", ''e'' \"and\").\n* The letter {{angle bracket|h}} distinguishes ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'' (present indicative of ''avere'' \"to have\") from ''o'' (\"or\"), ''ai'' (\"to the\"), ''a'' (\"to\"), ''anno'' (\"year\"). In the spoken language, the letter is always silent. The {{angle bracket|h}} in ''ho'' additionally marks the contrasting open pronunciation of the {{angle bracket|o}}. The letter {{angle bracket|h}} is also used in combinations with other letters. No [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/h/}} exists in Italian. In nativized foreign words, the {{angle bracket|h}} is silent. For example, ''hotel'' and ''hovercraft'' are pronounced {{IPA|/o\u02c8t\u025bl/}} and {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254verkraft/}} respectively. (Where {{angle bracket|h}} existed in Latin, it either disappeared or, in a few cases before a back vowel, changed to {{IPA|[\u0261]}}: ''traggo'' \"I pull\" \u2190 Lat. {{smallcaps|trah\u014d}}.)\n* The letters {{angle bracket|s}} and {{angle bracket|z}} can symbolize [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants. {{angle bracket|z}} symbolizes {{IPA|/dz/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on context, with few minimal pairs. For example: ''zanzara'' {{IPA|/dzan\u02c8dza\u02d0ra/}} \"mosquito\" and ''nazione'' {{IPA|/nat\u02c8tsjo\u02d0ne/}} \"nation\". {{angle bracket|s}} symbolizes {{IPA|/s/}} word-initially before a vowel, when clustered with a voiceless consonant ({{angle bracket|p, f, c, ch}}), and when doubled; it symbolizes {{IPA|/z/}} when between vowels and when clustered with voiced consonants. Intervocalic {{angle bracket|s}} varies regionally between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, with {{IPA|/z/}} being more dominant in northern Italy and {{IPA|/s/}} in the south.\n* The letters {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} vary in pronunciation between [[plosives]] and [[affricates]] depending on following vowels. The letter {{angle bracket|c}} symbolizes {{IPA|/k/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|t\u0283}} as in ''chair'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. The letter {{angle bracket|g}} symbolizes {{IPA|/\u0261/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|d\u0292}} as in ''gem'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Other Romance languages and, to an extent, English have similar variations for {{angle bracket|c, g}}. Compare [[hard and soft C]], [[hard and soft G]]. (See also [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].)\n* The [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|gh}} indicate ({{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) before {{angle bracket|i, e}}. The digraphs {{angle bracket|ci}} and {{angle bracket|gi}} indicate softness ({{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}) before {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. For example:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before back vowel (A, O, U)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before front vowel (I, E)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Plosive\n!

For example, it is silent in ''[[ciao]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283a\u02d0.o/}} and cielo {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u025b\u02d0.lo/}}, but it is pronounced in ''farmacia'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.a/}} and ''farmacie'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.e/}}.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n<!--\n* There are three other special [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] in Italian: [[gn (digraph)|{{angle bracket|gn}}]], {{angle bracket|gl}} and {{angle bracket|sc}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|gn}} represents {{IPAslink|\u0272}}. {{angle bracket|gl}} represents {{IPAslink|\u028e}} before {{angle bracket|i}}, and never at the beginning of a word, except in the [[personal pronoun]] and [[definite article]] ''gli''. An exception is the word ''glicerina'' (\"glycerin\"), which is pronounced with a hard {{angle bracket|g}}. (Compare with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} and {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{angle bracket|nh}} and {{angle bracket|lh}}.) {{angle bracket|sc}} represents a fricative {{IPAslink|\u0283}} before {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Except in the speech of some Northern Italians, all of these are normally [[geminate]] between vowels.\n* In general, there is a clear one-to-one correspondence between letters or digraphs and phonemes, as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; in standard varieties of Italian, there is little allophonic variation. The most notable exceptions are assimilation of /n/ in point of articulation before consonants, assimilatory voicing of /s/ to following voiced consonants, and vowel length (vowels are long in stressed open syllables, except at the end of words, and short elsewhere) \u2014 compare with the substantial number of [[allophone]]s of the English phoneme /t/. Spelling is mostly phonemic and usually difficult to mistake, given a clear pronunciation. Exceptions exist, especially in foreign borrowings. There are fewer cases of [[dyslexia]] than among speakers of languages such as English,<ref>E. Paulescu et al., Dyslexia \u2013 cultural diversity and biological unity, \"Science\", vol. 291, pp. 2165\u20132167.</ref> and the concept of a [[spelling bee]] is strange to Italians.\n\n=== Common variations ===\nSome variations in the usage of the writing system may be present in practical use. These are scorned by educated people and normal written language, but they are so common in certain limited contexts that knowledge of them may be useful.\n* Usage of ''x'' instead of ''per'' \"for\". This is common among teenagers and in [[Text messaging|SMS]] abbreviations. The multiplication operator is read \"per\" in Italian. For example, ''per te'' (\"for you\") is shortened to ''x te'' (compare with English ''4 u''). The ''per'' within words can also be replaced with ''x''. For example: ''perch\u00e9'' (\"why, because\") to ''xch\u00e9'' or ''xk\u00e9''; ''sapere'' (\"to know\") to ''saxe''). This usage is useful shorthand in quick notes or in SMS, but it is unacceptable in formal writing.\n* Usage of foreign letters such as {{angle bracket|k}}, {{angle bracket|j}} and {{angle bracket|y}}, especially in nicknames and SMS language: ''ke'' instead of ''che'', ''Giusy'' instead of ''Giuseppina''. This is mirrored in the usage of ''i'' in English names such as ''Staci'' instead of ''Stacey'' or in the usage of ''c'' in [[Northern Europe]] (''Jacob'' instead of ''Jakob''). The use of {{angle bracket|k}} instead of {{angle bracket|ch}} or {{angle bracket|c}} to represent a plosive sound is documented in some historical texts from before the standardization of the Italian language. The usage is no longer standard in Italian. The letter {{angle bracket|k}} has sometimes been used in satire to suggest a political figure is an authoritarian or even a \"pseudo-nazi\". For example, [[Francesco Cossiga]] was famously nicknamed ''Kossiga'' by rioting students during his tenure as minister of internal affairs. Compare the [[satiric misspelling#\"K\" replacing \"C\"|politicized spelling ''Amerika'']] in the USA. Although not a letter in the standard Italian alphabet, the letter {{angle bracket|j}} is found in many of the languages of southern Italy, including [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. In modern texts written in any such language, the {{angle bracket|j}} is often replaced with {{angle bracket|i}}.\n* The following abbreviations are limited to electronic-communications media: ''nn'' for ''non'' \"not\"; ''cmq'' for ''comunque'' \"anyway, however\"; ''cm'' for ''come'' \"how, like, as\"; ''d'' for ''di'' \"of\"; ''(io/loro) sn'' for ''(io/loro) sono'' \"I am, they are\"; ''(io) dv'' for ''(io) devo'' \"I must, I have to\" or for ''dove'' \"where\"; ''(tu) 6'' for ''(tu) sei'' \"you are\"; ''dmn'' for ''domani'' \"tomorrow\".\n* Whenever non-[[ASCII]] characters are unavailable or unreliable (as in e-mail), accents may be replaced with adjacent apostrophes. For example: in ''perche<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' instead of ''perch\u00e9''. The practice was standard on manual typewriters that had no accents and is still common for uppercase accented letters. Uppercase {{angle bracket|[[\u00c8]]}} is rare and is absent from the [[Keyboard layout#Italian|Italian keyboard layout]]. It is often substituted with {{angle bracket|E<nowiki>'</nowiki>}}, even though there are [[:it:Aiuto:Manuale di stile#Scrivere \u00c8|several ways]] of producing the uppercase \u00c8 on a computer.\n\n== Sounds ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n{{IPA notice|lang=it}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nItalian has seven [[vowel]] phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, represented by five letters: \"a, e, i, o, u\". The pairs {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/\u025b/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/\u0254/}} are seldom distinguished in writing and often confused, even though most varieties of Italian employ both phonemes consistently. Compare, for example standard \"perch\u00e9\" {{IPA|[per\u02c8ke]}} (why, because) and \"senti\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u025bnti]}} (you hear), as pronounced by most central and southern speakers, with {{IPA|[per\u02c8k\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8senti]}}, employed by most northern speakers. As a result, the usage is strongly indicative of a person's origin. The standard (Tuscan) usage of these vowels is listed in vocabularies, and employed outside Tuscany mainly by specialists, especially actors and a few (television) journalists.\nThese are truly different [[phonemes]], however: compare {{IPA|/\u02c8peska/}} (fishing) and {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u025bska/}} (peach), both spelled ''pesca'' ({{Audio|It-pesca.ogg|listen}}). Similarly {{IPA|/\u02c8botte/}} ('barrel') and {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254tte/}} ('beatings'), both spelled ''botte'', discriminate {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} ({{Audio|It-botte-mp.ogg|listen}}).\n\nIn general, vowel combinations usually pronounce each vowel separately. [[Diphthong]]s exist (e.g. ''uo'', ''iu'', ''ie'', ''ai''), but are limited to an unstressed ''u'' or ''i'' before or after a stressed vowel.\n\nThe unstressed ''u'' in a diphthong approximates the English semivowel ''w'', and the unstressed ''i'' approximates the semivowel ''y''. E.g.: ''buono'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bw\u0254\u02d0no]}}, ''ieri'' {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025b\u02d0ri]}}.\n\n[[Triphthong]]s exist in Italian as well, like \"contin''uia''mo\" (\"we continue\"). Three vowel combinations exist only in the form semiconsonant ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}), followed by a vowel, followed by a [[:wikt:desinence|desinence]] vowel (usually {{IPA|/i/}}), as in ''miei'', ''suoi'', or two semiconsonants followed by a vowel, as the group ''-uia-'' exemplified above, or ''-iuo-'' in the word ''aiuola''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Serianni | first=Luca | author2=Castelvecchi, Alberto |title=Italiano | publisher=Garzanti | year=1997 | page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile diphthongs ===\nMany Latin words with a short ''e'' or ''o'' have Italian counterparts with a so-called mobile diphthong (''ie'' and ''uo'' respectively). The mobility, however, is of stress: when the vowel sound is stressed, it is pronounced and written as a diphthong, e.g. ''buono'' 'good'; when not stressed, it is pronounced and written as a single vowel, as in ''bont\u00e0'' 'goodness'.\n\nSo Latin ''focus'' gave rise to Italian ''fuoco'' (meaning both \"fire\" and \"optical focus\"): when unstressed, as in ''focale'' (\"focal\") the \"o\" remains alone. Latin ''pes'' (more precisely its accusative form ''pedem'') is the source of Italian ''piede'' (foot): but unstressed \"e\" was left unchanged in ''pedone'' (pedestrian) and ''pedale'' (pedal). From Latin ''jocus'' comes Italian ''giuoco'' (\"play\", \"game\"), though in this case ''gioco'' is more common: ''giocare'' means \"to play (a game)\". From Latin ''homo'' comes Italian ''uomo'' (man), but also ''umano'' (human) and ''ominide'' (hominid). From Latin ''ovum'' comes Italian ''uovo'' (egg) and ''ovaie'' (ovaries). (The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''juego'' (play, game) and ''jugar'' (to play), ''nieve'' (snow) and ''nevar'' (to snow)). Stress-conditioned historical diphthongization can also produce alternating verb stems, as in stem-stressed ''siedo'' 'I sit' and suffix-stressed ''sediamo'' 'we sit'.\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{{See also|Syntactic doubling}}\n\nTwo symbols in a table cell denote the voiceless and voiced consonant, respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Consonants of Italian<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rogers & d'Arcangeli|2004|p=117}}</ref>\n!\n!

More generally, nasals assimilate to the point of articulation of whatever consonant they precede. -->\n\nItalian has geminate, or double, consonants, which are distinguished by [[Consonant length|length]] and intensity. Length is distinctive for all consonants except for {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/\u028e/}}, {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, which are always geminate when between vowels, and {{IPA|/z/}}, which is always single.\nGeminate plosives and affricates are realized as lengthened closures. Geminate fricatives, nasals, and {{IPA|/l/}} are realized as lengthened [[continuant]]s. There is only one vibrant phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} but the actual pronunciation depends on context and regional accent. Generally one can find a flap consonant {{IPA|[\u027e]}} in unstressed position whereas {{IPA|[r]}} is more common in stressed syllables, but there may be exceptions. Especially people from the Northern part of Italy ([[Parma]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[South Tyrol]]) may pronounce {{IPA|/r/}} as {{IPA|[\u0280]}}, {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, or {{IPA|[\u028b]}}.<ref>{{cite book |last= Canepari |first= Luciano |title= Il M\u00aaPI \u2013 Manuale di pronuncia italiana |edition= second |date=January 1999 |publisher= Zanichelli |location= Bologna |isbn= 978-88-08-24624-0}}</ref>\n\nOf special interest to the linguistic study of [[Regional Italian]] is the ''[[Tuscan gorgia|gorgia toscana]]'', or \"Tuscan Throat\", the weakening or [[lenition]] of [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} in the [[Tuscan language]].\n\nThe [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0292/}} is present as a phoneme only in loanwords: for example, ''garage'' {{IPA|[\u0261a\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0292]}}. Phonetic {{IPA|[\u0292]}} is common in Central and Southern Italy as an intervocalic allophone of {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}: ''gente'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'people' but ''la gente'' {{IPA|[la\u02c8\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'the people', ''ragione'' {{IPA|[ra\u02c8\u0292o\u02d0ne]}} 'reason'.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Italian grammar}}\n{{See also|Italian verbs}}\n\nItalian grammar is typical of the grammar of [[Romance languages]] in general. [[Grammatical case|Cases]] exist for personal pronouns ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Dative case|dative]]), but not for nouns.\n\nThere are two basic classes of nouns in Italian, referred to as [[Grammatical gender|genders]], masculine and feminine. Gender may be [[natural gender|natural]] (''ragazzo'' 'boy', ''ragazza'' 'girl') or simply grammatical with no possible reference to biological gender (masculine ''costo'' 'cost', feminine ''costa'' 'coast'). Masculine nouns typically end in ''-o'' (''ragazzo'' 'boy'), with plural marked by ''-i'' (''ragazzi'' 'boys'), and feminine nouns typically end in ''-a'', with plural marked by ''-e'' (''ragazza'' 'girl', ''ragazze'' 'girls'). For a group composed of boys and girls, ''ragazzi'' is the plural, suggesting that ''-i'' is a general plural. A third category of nouns is [[Marker (linguistics)|unmarked]] for gender, ending in ''-e'' in the singular and ''-i'' in the plural: ''legge'' 'law, f. sg.', ''leggi'' 'laws, f. pl.'; ''fiume'' 'river, m. sg.', ''fiumi'' 'rivers, m. pl.', thus assignment of gender is arbitrary in terms of form, enough so that terms may be identical but of distinct genders: ''fine'' meaning 'aim', 'purpose' is masculine, while ''fine'' meaning 'end, ending' (e.g. of a movie) is feminine, and both are ''fini'' in the plural, a clear instance of ''-i'' as a non-gendered default plural marker. These nouns often, but not always, denote [[Animacy|inanimates]]. There are a number of nouns that have a masculine singular and a feminine plural, most commonly of the pattern m. sg. ''-o'', f. pl. ''-a'' (''miglio'' 'mile, m. sg.', ''miglia'' 'miles, f. pl.'; ''paio'' 'pair, m. sg., ''paia'' 'pairs, f. pl.'), and thus are sometimes considered neuter (these are usually derived from [[Grammatical gender|neuter]] Latin nouns). An instance of neuter gender also exists in pronouns of the third person singular.{{sfn|Simone|2010}}\n\nExamples:<ref name=\":6\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"Accademia della Crusca\"\n! href=\"Floris Italicae lingue libri novem\" |Definition\n!Gender\n! href=\"Napoleon\" |Singular Form\n! href=\"lingua franca\" |Plural Form\n|- href=\"bourgeoisie\"\n|Son\n| href=\"The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)\" |Masculine\n|Figlio\n|Figli\n|- href=\"Alessandro Manzoni\"\n| href=\"Arno River\" |House\n| href=\"Florence\" |Feminine\n|Casa\n| href=\"ciao\" |Case\n|- href=\"Venetian language\"\n|Love\n| href=\"panettone\" |Masculine\n| href=\"Lombard language\" |Amore\n|Amori\n|- href=\"Romance language\"\n| href=\"Vulgar Latin\" |Art\n| href=\"Tuscan language\" |Feminine\n| href=\"Florentine dialect\" |Arte\n| href=\"Italo-Dalmatian languages\" |Arti\n|}\nNouns, adjectives, and articles [[Inflection|inflect]] for gender and number (singular and plural).\n\nLike in English, common nouns are capitalized when occurring at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike English, nouns referring to languages (e.g. Italian), speakers of languages, or inhabitants of an area (e.g. Italians) are not capitalized.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three types of [[adjective]]s: descriptive, invariable and form-changing. Descriptive adjectives are the most common, and their endings change to match the number and gender of the noun they modify. Invariable adjectives are adjectives whose endings do not change. The form changing adjectives \"buono (good), bello (beautiful), grande (big), and santo (saint)\" change in form when placed before different types of nouns. Italian has three degrees for comparison of adjectives: positive, comparative, and superlative.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe order of words in the phrase is relatively free compared to most European languages.<ref name=\"Clivio\" /> The position of the verb in the phrase is highly mobile. Word order often has a lesser grammatical function in Italian than in [[English language|English]]. Adjectives are sometimes placed before their noun and sometimes after. Subject nouns generally come before the verb. Italian is a [[null-subject language]], so that nominative pronouns are usually absent, with subject indicated by verbal [[inflection]]s (e.g. ''amo'' 'I love', ''ama'' 's/he loves', ''amano'' 'they love'). Noun objects normally come after the verb, as do pronoun objects after imperative verbs, infinitives and gerunds, but otherwise pronoun objects come before the verb.\n\nThere are both indefinite and definite [[Article (grammar)|articles]] in Italian. There are four indefinite articles, selected by the gender of the noun they modify and by the phonological structure of the word that immediately follows the article. ''Uno'' is masculine singular, used before ''z'' ({{IPA|ts/}} or {{IPA|/dz/}}), ''s+consonant'', ''gn'' ({{IPA|/\u0272/}}), or ''ps'', while masculine singular ''un'' is used before a word beginning with any other sound. The noun ''zio'' 'uncle' selects masculine singular, thus ''uno zio'' 'an uncle' or ''uno zio anziano'' 'an old uncle,' but ''un mio zio'' 'an uncle of mine'. The feminine singular indefinite articles are ''una'', used before any consonant sound, and its abbreviated form, written ''un','' used before vowels: ''una camicia'' 'a shirt', ''una camicia bianca'' 'a white shirt', ''un'altra camicia'' 'a different shirt'. There are seven forms for definite articles, both singular and plural. In the singular: ''lo'', which corresponds to the uses of ''uno''; ''il'', which corresponds to the uses with consonant of ''un''; ''la,'' which corresponds to the uses of ''una''; ''l','' used for both masculine and feminine singular before vowels. In the plural: ''gli'' is the masculine plural of ''lo and l<nowiki>'</nowiki>''; ''i'' is the plural of ''il''; and ''le'' is the plural of feminine ''la'' and ''l''<nowiki/>'.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are numerous [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] of [[preposition]]s with subsequent [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. There are numerous productive [[suffix]]es for [[Italian diminutive|diminutive]], [[Augmentative#Italian|augmentative]], pejorative, attenuating etc., which are also used to create [[neologism]]s.\n\nThere are 27 pronouns, grouped in [[clitic]] and tonic pronouns. Personal pronouns are separated into three groups: subject, object (which take the place of both direct and indirect objects), and reflexive. Second person subject pronouns have both a polite and a familiar form. These two different types of address are very important in Italian social distinctions. All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed (clitics). Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb (''Lo vedo''. 'I see him.'). Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required, for contrast, or to avoid ambiguity (''Vedo lui, ma non lei''. 'I see him, but not her'). Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three regular sets of verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], and various verbs are irregularly conjugated. Within each of these sets of conjugations, there are four simple (one-word) verbal conjugations by person/number in the [[indicative mood]] ([[present tense]]; [[past tense]] with [[imperfective aspect]], past tense with [[perfective aspect]], and [[future tense]]), two simple conjugations in the [[subjunctive mood]] (present tense and past tense), one simple conjugation in the [[conditional mood]], and one simple conjugation in the [[imperative mood]]. Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of \"to be\" or \"to have\" followed by a [[past participle]]. \"To have\" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive (\"Ha detto\", \"ha fatto\": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while \"to be\" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs (\"\u00c8 andato\", \"\u00e8 stato\": he/she has gone, he/she has been). \"To be\" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive (\"\u00ca detto\", \"\u00e8 fatto\": it is said, it is made/done). This rule is not absolute, and some exceptions do exist.\n\n== Words ==\n===Conversation===\nNote: the plural form of verbs could also be used as an extremely formal (for example to [[Nobility|noble]] people in [[Monarchy|monarchies]]) singular form (see [[royal we]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

They are not in any sense \"dialects\" of standard Italian, which itself started off as one of these local tongues, but [[sister language]]s of Italian. Mutual intelligibility with Italian varies widely, as it does with Romance languages in general.

Dante's epic poems, known collectively as the ''[[Divine Comedy|Commedia]],'' to which another Tuscan poet [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] later affixed the title ''Divina'', were read throughout the peninsula and his written dialect became the \"canonical standard\" that all educated [[Italians]] could understand. Dante is still credited with standardizing the Italian language. In addition to the widespread exposure gained through literature, the Florentine dialect also gained prestige due to the political and cultural significance of Florence at the time and the fact that it was linguistically an intermediate between the northern and the southern Italian dialects.{{r|\":0\"|page=22}} Thus the dialect of [[Florence]] became the basis for what would become the official language of Italy.\n\nItalian was progressively made an official language of most of the Italian states predating unification, slowly replacing Latin, even when ruled by foreign powers (like Spain in the [[Kingdom of Naples]], or Austria in the [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]), even though the masses kept speaking primarily their local vernaculars. Italian was also one of the many recognised languages in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].\n\nItaly has always had a distinctive dialect for each city because the cities, until recently, were thought of as [[city-state]]s. Those dialects now have considerable [[variety (linguistics)|variety]]. As Tuscan-derived Italian came to be used throughout Italy, features of local speech were naturally adopted, producing various versions of regional Italian. The most characteristic differences, for instance, between [[Rome|Roman]] Italian and [[Milan]]ese Italian are the [[consonant length|gemination]] of initial consonants and the pronunciation of stressed \"e\", and of \"s\" in some cases: e.g. ''va bene'' \"all right\" is pronounced {{IPA|[vab\u02c8b\u025b\u02d0ne]}} by a Roman (and by any standard Italian speaker), {{IPA|[va\u02c8be\u02d0ne]}} by a Milanese (and by any speaker whose native dialect lies to the north of the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]); ''a casa'' \"at home\" is {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} for Roman, {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0sa]}} or {{IPA|[ak\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for standard, {{IPA|[a\u02c8ka\u02d0za]}} for Milanese and generally northern.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n\nIn contrast to the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Gallo-Italic linguistic panorama]] of [[northern Italy]], the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and its related dialects were largely unaffected by the Franco-[[Occitan language|Occitan]] influences introduced to Italy mainly by [[bard]]s from France during the [[Middle Ages]], but after the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy]], Sicily became the first Italian land to adopt Occitan lyric moods (and words) in poetry. Even in the case of Northern Italian languages, however, scholars are careful not to overstate the effects of outsiders on the natural indigenous developments of the languages.\n\nThe economic might and relatively advanced development of Tuscany at the time ([[Late Middle Ages]]) gave its language weight, though [[Venetian language|Venetian]] remained widespread in medieval Italian commercial life, and [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian (or Genoese)]] remained in use in maritime trade alongside the Mediterranean. The increasing political and cultural relevance of [[Florence]] during the periods of the rise of the ''[[Medici bank|Banco Medici]]'', [[Humanism]], and the [[Renaissance]] made its dialect, or rather a refined version of it, a standard in the arts.\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe [[Renaissance]] era, known as {{lang|it|il Rinascimento}} in Italian, was seen as a time of \"rebirth\", which is the literal meaning of both {{lang|fr|renaissance}} (from French) and {{lang|it|rinascimento}} (Italian).\n\n[[File:Pietro Bembo2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.63|[[Pietro Bembo]] was an influential figure in the development of the Italian language from the Tuscan dialect, as a literary medium, codifying the language for standard modern usage.]]\n\nDuring this time, long-existing beliefs stemming from the teachings of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] began to be understood from new perspectives as [[humanists]]\u2014individuals who placed emphasis on the human body and its full potential\u2014began to shift focus from the church to human beings themselves.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=A history of Western society|last=P.|first=McKay, John|date=2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|others=Hill, Bennett D., Buckler, John.|isbn=978-0-618-52273-6|edition=8th|location=Boston|oclc=58837884}}</ref> Humanists began forming new beliefs in various forms: social, political, and intellectual. The ideals of the Renaissance were evident throughout the [[Protestant Reformation]], which took place simultaneously with the Renaissance. The Protestant Reformation began with [[Martin Luther]]'s rejection of the selling of indulgences by [[Johann Tetzel]] and other authorities within the Roman Catholic Church, resulting in Luther's eventual break-off from the Roman Catholic Church in the [[Diet of Worms]]. After Luther was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church, he founded what was then understood to be a sect of [[Catholicism]], later referred to as [[Lutheranism]].<ref name=\":4\" /> Luther's preaching in favor of faith and scripture rather than tradition led him to translate the [[Bible]] into many other languages, which would allow for people from all over Europe to read the Bible. Previously, the Bible was only translated into [[Latin]], but after this development it could be understood in many other languages, including Italian. The Italian language was able to spread even more with the help of Luther and the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]]. The printing press facilitated the spread of Italian because it was able to rapidly produce texts, such as the Bible, and cut the costs of books which allowed for more people to have access to the translated Bible and new pieces of literature.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Zucker|first1=Steven|last2=Harris|first2=Beth|title=An Introduction to the Protestant Reformation|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/renaissance-and-reformation/protestant-reformation/a/an-introduction-to-the-protestant-reformation|website=khanacademy|publisher=khanacademy|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> The Roman Catholic Church was losing its control over the population, as it was not open to change, and there was an increasing number of reformers with differing beliefs.<ref name=\":0x\">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Renaissance|title=Renaissance|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, inc|last1=The Editors of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nItalian became the language used in the courts of every state in the [[Italian peninsula]], as well as the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige variety]] in the island of [[Corsica]] (but not in [[Sardinia]], which on the contrary [[Sardinian language#Savoyard period \u2013 Italian influence|underwent Italianization]] well into the late 18th century because of the prestige enjoyed by [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the widespread use of Sardinian<ref>Cardia, Amos.

This discussion, known as {{lang|it|questione della lingua}} (i. e., the ''problem of the language''), ran through the Italian culture until the end of the 19th century, often linked to the political debate on achieving a united Italian state. Renaissance scholars divided into three main factions:\n* The [[purism (language)|purists]], headed by Venetian [[Pietro Bembo]] (who, in his ''[[Gli Asolani]]'', claimed the language might be based only on the great literary classics, such as [[Petrarch]] and some part of Boccaccio). The purists thought the Divine Comedy was not dignified enough because it used elements from non-lyric registers of the language.\n* [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] and other [[Florence|Florentines]] preferred the version spoken by ordinary people in their own times.\n* The [[courtier]]s, like [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]], insisted that each local vernacular contribute to the new standard.\n\nA fourth faction claimed that the best Italian was the one that the papal court adopted, which was a mixture of the [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] and [[Roman dialect|Roman]] dialects. \nEventually, Bembo's ideas prevailed, and the foundation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Florence (1582\u20131583), the official legislative body of the Italian language led to publication of [[Agnolo Monosini]]'s Latin tome {{lang|la|[[Floris Italicae lingue libri novem|Floris italicae linguae libri novem]]|italic=yes}} in 1604 followed by the first Italian dictionary in 1612.\n\nThe continual advancements in technology plays a crucial role in the diffusion of languages. After the invention of the [[printing press]] in the fifteenth century, the number of printing presses in Italy grew rapidly and by the year 1500 reached a total of 56, the biggest number of printing presses in all of Europe. This allowed to produce more pieces of literature at a lower cost and as the dominant language, Italian spread.<ref>{{cite journal|date=2011|title=Information Technology and Economic Change: The Impact of the Printing Press|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=126|issue=3|pages=1133\u20131172|last1=Dittmar|first1=Jeremiah|doi=10.1093/qje/qjr035|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8ab843701523883bb51bb7752f2891fdfc841d18}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern era ===\nAn important event that helped the diffusion of Italian was the conquest and occupation of Italy by [[Napoleon]] in the early 19th century (who was himself of Italian-Corsican descent).

Examples are [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Brazil]], where [[Talian dialect|Talian]] is used, and the town of [[Chipilo]] near Puebla, [[Mexico]]; each continues to use a derived form of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] dating back to the nineteenth century. Another example is [[Cocoliche]], an Italian\u2013Spanish [[pidgin]] once spoken in [[Argentina]] and especially in [[Buenos Aires]], and [[Lunfardo]].\n\n=== Lingua franca ===\n{{See also|Mediterranean Lingua Franca}}\n\nStarting in late [[medieval]] times in much of Europe and the Mediterranean, Latin was replaced as the primary commercial language by Italian language variants (especially Tuscan and Venetian). These variants were consolidated during the [[Renaissance]] with the strength of Italy and the rise of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]] and [[the arts]].\n\nDuring that period, Italy held artistic sway over the rest of Europe. It was the norm for all educated gentlemen to make the [[Grand Tour]], visiting Italy to see its great historical monuments and works of art. It thus became expected to learn at least some Italian. In England, while the classical languages [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] were the first to be learned, Italian became the second most common modern language after French, a position it held until the late eighteenth century when it tended to be replaced by German. [[John Milton]], for instance, wrote some of his early poetry in Italian.\n\nWithin the [[Catholic church]], Italian is known by a large part of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and is used in substitution for Latin in some official documents.\n\nItalian [[loanword]]s continue to be used in most languages in matters of art and [[music]] (especially [[classical music]] including [[opera]]), in the [[design]] and [[fashion]] industries, in some sports like [[football (association)|football]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilsonline.it/italy/italianlanguage.html|title=Italian Language|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ilsonline.it|access-date=7 October 2016}}</ref> and especially, in culinary terms.\n\n== Languages and dialects ==\n{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}\n[[File:Dialetti Italia 1939.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Linguistic map of Italy according to Clemente Merlo and Carlo Tagliavini (1937)]]\n[[File:Minoranze linguistiche it.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Italy's ethno-linguistic minorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|title=Lingue di Minoranza e Scuola: Carta Generale|website=Minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it|accessdate=8 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010152621/http://www.minoranze-linguistiche-scuola.it/carta-generale/|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\nIn Italy, almost all the [[Languages of Italy|other languages spoken as the vernacular]] \u2014 other than standard Italian and some languages spoken among immigrant communities \u2014 are often imprecisely called \"[[Languages of Italy|Italian dialects]]\",<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ccjk.com/facts-figures-italian-language/ | title=Major Dialects of Italian|publisher=Ccjk.com|accessdate=22 October 2015 }}</ref> even though they are quite different, with some belonging to different linguistic branches. The only exceptions to this are twelve groups considered \"[[Languages of Italy#Recognition by the Italian state|historical language minorities]]\", which are officially recognized as distinct [[minority language]]s by the law. On the other hand, [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (a language spoken on the [[France|French]] island of [[Corsica]]) is closely related to medieval [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], from which Standard Italian derives and evolved.\n\nThe differences in the evolution of Latin in the different regions of Italy can be attributed to the presence of three other types of languages: [[Stratum (linguistics)|substrata, superstrata, and adstrata]]. The most prevalent were substrata (the language of the original inhabitants), as the Italian dialects were most likely simply Latin as spoken by native cultural groups. Superstrata and adstrata were both less important. Foreign conquerors of Italy that dominated different regions at different times left behind little to no influence on the dialects. Foreign cultures with which Italy engaged in peaceful relations with, such as trade, had no significant influence either.{{r|\":0\"|page=19-20}}\n\nThroughout Italy, regional variations of Standard Italian, called [[Regional Italian]], are spoken. Regional differences can be recognized by various factors: the openness of vowels, the length of the consonants, and influence of the local language (for example, in informal situations ''{{wiktit|and\u00e0}}'', ''{{wiktit|ann\u00e0}}'' and ''{{wiktit|nare}}'' replace the standard Italian ''{{wiktit|andare}}'' in the area of Tuscany, Rome and Venice respectively for the infinitive \"to go\").\n\nThere is no definitive date when the various Italian variants of Latin\u2014including varieties that contributed to modern Standard Italian\u2014began to be distinct enough from Latin to be considered separate languages. One criterion for determining that two language variants are to be considered separate languages rather than variants of a single language is that they have evolved so that they are no longer [[mutually intelligible]]; this diagnostic is effective if mutual intelligibility is minimal or absent (e.g. in Romance, Romanian and Portuguese), but it fails in cases such as Spanish-Portuguese or Spanish-Italian, as native speakers of either pairing can understand each other well if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, on the basis of accumulated differences in morphology, syntax, phonology, and to some extent lexicon, it is not difficult to identify that for the Romance varieties of Italy, the first extant written evidence of languages that can no longer be considered Latin comes from the ninth and tenth centuries C.E. These written sources demonstrate certain vernacular characteristics and sometimes explicitly mention the use of the vernacular in Italy. Full literary manifestations of the vernacular began to surface around the 13th century in the form of various religious texts and poetry.{{r|\":0\"|page=21}}Although these are the first written records of Italian varieties separate from Latin, the spoken language had likely diverged long before the first written records appear, since those who were literate generally wrote in Latin even if they spoke other Romance varieties in person.\n\nThroughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the use of Standard Italian became increasingly widespread and was mirrored by a decline in the use of the dialects. An increase in literacy was one of the main driving factors (one can assume that only literates were capable of learning Standard Italian, whereas those who were illiterate had access only to their native dialect). The percentage of literates rose from 25% in 1861 to 60% in 1911, and then on to 78.1% in 1951. [[Tullio De Mauro]], an Italian linguist, has asserted that in 1861 only 2.5% of the population of Italy could speak Standard Italian. He reports that in 1951 that percentage had risen to 87%. The ability to speak Italian did not necessarily mean it was in everyday use, and most people (63.5%) still usually spoke their native dialects. In addition, other factors such as mass emigration, industrialization, and urbanization, and internal migrations after [[World War II]] contributed to the proliferation of Standard Italian. The Italians who emigrated during the [[Italian diaspora]] beginning in 1861 were often of the uneducated lower class, and thus the emigration had the effect of increasing the percentage of literates, who often knew and understood the importance of Standard Italian, back home in Italy. A large percentage of those who had emigrated also eventually returned to Italy, often more educated than when they had left.{{r|\":0\"|page=35}}\n\nThe Italian dialects have declined in the modern era, as Italy unified under Standard Italian and continues to do so aided by mass media, from newspapers to radio to television.{{r|\":0\"|page=37}}\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n[[File:It-Vangeli.ogg|thumb|[[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Luke#Chapter 2|Luke 2]], 1\u20137 of the Bible being read by a speaker of Italian from [[Milan]]]]\n{{IPA notice}}\n{{transcluded section|source=Italian phonology|part=yes}}\n{{trim|{{#section-h:Italian phonology|Consonants}}}}\nItalian has a seven-vowel system, consisting of {{IPA|/a, \u025b, e, i, \u0254, o, u/}}, as well as 23 consonants. Compared with most other Romance languages, Italian phonology is conservative, preserving many words nearly unchanged from [[Vulgar Latin]]. Some examples:\n* Italian ''{{wiktita|quattordici}}'' \"fourteen\" < Latin {{smallcaps|{{wiktlat|quattuordecim}}}} (cf. Romanian ''{{wiktron|paisprezece}}/{{wiktron|pai\u0219pe}}'', Spanish ''{{wiktspa|catorce}}'', French ''{{wiktfra|quatorze}}'' {{IPA|/ka\u02c8t\u0254\u0281z/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|[[wikt:catorze|catorze]]|italic=yes}})\n* Italian ''settimana'' \"week\" < Latin {{smallcaps|septim\u0101na}} (cf. Romanian ''s\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2n\u0103'', Spanish and Portuguese ''semana'', French ''semaine'' {{IPA|/s(\u0259)\u02c8m\u025bn/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''setmana'')\n* Italian ''medesimo'' \"same\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|medi(p)simum}} (cf. Spanish ''mismo'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''mesmo'', French ''m\u00eame'' {{IPA|/m\u025bm/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''mateix''; note that Italian usually uses the shorter ''stesso'')\n* Italian ''guadagnare'' \"to win, earn, gain\" < Vulgar Latin *{{smallcaps|guadany\u0101re}} < [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] {{IPA|/waidanjan/}} (cf. Spanish ''ganar'', Portuguese ''ganhar'', French ''gagner'' {{IPA|/\u0261a\u02c8\u0272e/}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''guanyar'')\n\nThe conservativeness of Italian phonology is partly explained by its origin. Italian stems from a literary language that is derived from the 13th-century speech of the city of [[Florence]] in the region of [[Tuscany]], and has changed little in the last 700 years or so. Furthermore, the Tuscan dialect is the most conservative of all [[Regional Italian|Italian dialects]], radically different from the [[Gallo-Italian languages]] less than 100 miles to the north (across the [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]]).\n\nThe following are some of the conservative phonological features of Italian, as compared with the common [[Western Romance]] languages (French, Spanish, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). Some of these features are also present in [[Romanian language|Romanian]].\n* Little or no [[lenition]] of consonants between vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|v\u012bta}} > ''vita'' \"life\" (cf. Romanian ''via\u021b\u0103'', Spanish ''vida'' {{IPA|[bi\u00f0a]}}, French ''vie''), {{smallcaps|pedem}} > ''piede'' \"foot\" (cf. Spanish ''pie'', French ''pied'' {{IPA|/pje/}}).\n* Preservation of geminate consonants, e.g. {{smallcaps|annum}} > {{IPA|/\u02c8an.no/}} ''anno'' \"year\" (cf. Spanish ''a\u00f1o'' {{IPA|/a\u0272o/}}, French ''an'' {{IPA|/\u0251\u0303/}}, Portuguese ''ano'' {{IPA|/\u02c8\u00e3.nu/}}).\n* Preservation of all [[Proto-Romance]] final vowels, e.g. {{smallcaps|pacem}} > ''pace'' \"peace\" (cf. Romanian ''pace'', Spanish ''paz'', French ''paix'' {{IPA|/p\u025b/}}), {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Romanian ''opt'', Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit'' {{IPA|/\u0265i(t)/}}), {{smallcaps|f\u0113c\u012b}} > ''feci'' \"I did\" (cf. Spanish ''hice'', French ''fis'' {{IPA|/fi/}}).\n* Preservation of most intertonic vowels (those between the stressed syllable and either the beginning or ending syllable). This accounts for some of the most noticeable differences, as in the forms ''quattordici'' and ''settimana'' given above.\n* Slower consonant development, e.g. {{smallcaps|folia}} > Italo-Western {{IPA|/f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} > ''foglia'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0254\u028e\u028ea/}} \"leaf\" (cf. Romanian ''foaie'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u032faje/}}, Spanish ''hoja'' {{IPA|/\u02c8oxa/}}, French ''feuille'' {{IPA|/\u02c8f\u0153j/}}; but note Portuguese ''folha'' {{IPA|/\u02c8fo\u028e\u0250/}}).\n\nCompared with most other Romance languages, Italian has many inconsistent outcomes, where the same underlying sound produces different results in different words, e.g. {{smallcaps|lax\u0101re}} > ''lasciare'' and ''lassare'', {{smallcaps|capti\u0101re}} > ''cacciare'' and ''cazzare'', {{smallcaps|(ex)d\u0113roteol\u0101re}} > ''sdrucciolare'', ''druzzolare'' and ''ruzzolare'', {{smallcaps|r\u0113g\u012bna}} > ''regina'' and ''reina''. Although in all these examples the second form has fallen out of usage, the dimorphism is thought to reflect the several-hundred-year period during which Italian developed as a literary language divorced from any native-speaking population, with an origin in 12th/13th-century Tuscan but with many words borrowed from [[Languages of Italy|languages]] farther to the north, with different sound outcomes. (The [[La Spezia\u2013Rimini Line]], the most important [[isogloss]] in the entire Romance-language area, passes only about 20 miles to the north of Florence.) Dual outcomes of Latin /p t k/ between vowels, such as {{smallcaps|l\u014fcum}} > '' luogo'' but {{smallcaps|f\u014fcum}} > '' fuoco'', was once thought to be due to borrowing of northern voiced forms, but is now generally viewed as the result of early phonetic variation within Tuscany.\n\nSome other features that distinguish Italian from the Western Romance languages:\n* Latin {{smallcaps|ce-,ci-}} becomes {{IPA|/t\u0283e, t\u0283i/}} rather than {{IPA|/(t)se, (t)si/}}.\n* Latin {{smallcaps|-ct-}} becomes {{IPA|/tt/}} rather than {{IPA|/jt/}} or {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}: {{smallcaps|oct\u014d}} > ''otto'' \"eight\" (cf. Spanish ''ocho'', French ''huit,'' Portuguese ''oito'').\n* Vulgar Latin {{smallcaps|-cl-}} becomes ''cchi'' {{IPA|/kkj/}} rather than {{IPA|/\u028e/}}: {{smallcaps|oclum}} > ''occhio'' \"eye\" (cf. Portuguese ''olho'' {{IPA|/o\u028eu/}}, French ''oeil'' {{IPA|/\u0153j/}} < {{IPA|/\u0153\u028e/}}); but Romanian ''ochi'' {{IPA|/ok\u02b2/}}.\n* Final {{IPA|/s/}} is not preserved, and vowel changes rather than {{IPA|/s/}} are used to mark the plural: ''amico, amici'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amica, amiche'' \"female friend(s)\" (cf. Romanian ''amic, amici'',''amic\u0103, amice'', Spanish ''amigo(s)'' \"male friend(s)\", ''amiga(s)'' \"female friend(s)\"); {{smallcaps|tr\u0113s, sex}} \u2192 ''tre, sei'' \"three, six\" (cf. Romanian ''trei, \u0219ase'', Spanish ''tres, seis'').\n\nStandard Italian also differs in some respects from most nearby Italian languages:\n* Perhaps most noticeable is the total lack of [[metaphony (Romance languages)|metaphony]], though metaphony is a feature characterizing nearly every other [[Languages of Italy|Italian language]].\n* No simplification of original {{IPA|/nd/}}, {{IPA|/mb/}} (which often became {{IPA|/nn/, /mm/}} elsewhere).\n\n=== Assimilation ===\nItalian [[phonotactics]] do not usually permit verbs and polysyllabic nouns to end with consonants, excepting poetry and song, so foreign words may receive [[Epenthetic vowel#Epenthesis of a vowel, or anaptyxis|extra terminal vowel sounds]].<!--(Maybe this should go under history?)--->\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Italian alphabet}}\nThe Italian alphabet is typically considered to consist of 21 letters. The letters j, k, w, x, y are traditionally excluded, though they appear in loanwords such as ''jeans'', ''whisky'', ''taxi'', ''xenofobo'', ''xilofono''. The letter {{angle bracket|x}} has become common in standard Italian with the prefix ''extra-'', although ''(e)stra-'' is traditionally used; it is also common to use the Latin particle ''ex(-)'' to mean \"former(ly)\" as in: ''la mia ex'' (\"my ex-girlfriend\"), \"Ex-Jugoslavia\" (\"Former Yugoslavia\"). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} appears in the first name ''Jacopo'' and in some Italian place-names, such as [[Bajardo]], [[Bojano]], [[Joppolo]], [[Jerzu]], [[Jesolo]], [[Jesi]], [[Ajaccio]], among others, and in ''Mar Jonio'', an alternative spelling of ''Mar Ionio'' (the [[Ionian Sea]]). The letter {{angle bracket|j}} may appear in dialectal words, but its use is discouraged in contemporary standard Italian.<ref name=\"Clivio\">{{cite book|title=The Sounds, Forms, and Uses of Italian: An Introduction to Italian Linguistics|first=Gianrenzo|last=Clivio|first2=Marcel|last2=Danesi|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2000|pages=21, 66}}</ref> Letters used in foreign words can be replaced with [[phonetics|phonetically]] equivalent native Italian letters and [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: {{angle bracket|gi}}, {{angle bracket|ge}}, or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|j}}; {{angle bracket|c}} or {{angle bracket|ch}} for {{angle bracket|k}} (including in the standard prefix ''kilo-''); {{angle bracket|o}}, {{angle bracket|u}} or {{angle bracket|v}} for {{angle bracket|w}}; {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|ss}}, {{angle bracket|z}}, {{angle bracket|zz}} or {{angle bracket|cs}} for {{angle bracket|x}}; and {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}} for {{angle bracket|y}}.\n* The [[acute accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid front unrounded vowel|front close-mid vowel]], as in ''perch\u00e9'' \"why, because\". In dictionaries, it is also used over {{angle bracket|o}} to indicate a stressed [[Close-mid back rounded vowel|back close-mid vowel]] (''azi\u00f3ne''). The [[grave accent]] is used over word-final {{angle bracket|e}} to indicate a [[Open-mid front unrounded vowel|front open-mid vowel]], as in ''t\u00e8'' \"tea\". The grave accent is used over any vowel to indicate word-final stress, as in ''giovent\u00f9'' \"youth\". Unlike {{angle bracket|\u00e9}}, which is a ''close''-mid vowel, a stressed final {{angle bracket|o}} is always a [[Open-mid back rounded vowel|back open-mid vowel]] (''andr\u00f2''), making {{angle bracket|\u00f3}} unnecessary outside of dictionaries. Most of the time, the penultimate syllable is stressed. But if the stressed vowel is the final letter of the word, the accent is mandatory, otherwise it is virtually always omitted. Exceptions are typically either in dictionaries, where all or most stressed vowels are commonly marked. Accents can optionally be used to disambiguate words that differ only by stress, as for ''pr\u00ecncipi'' \"princes\" and ''princ\u00ecpi'' \"principles\", or ''\u00e0ncora'' \"anchor\" and ''anc\u00f3ra'' \"still''/''yet\". For monosyllabic words, the rule is different: when two orthographically identical monosyllabic words with different meanings exist, one is accented and the other is not (example: ''\u00e8'' \"is\", ''e'' \"and\").\n* The letter {{angle bracket|h}} distinguishes ''ho'', ''hai'', ''ha'', ''hanno'' (present indicative of ''avere'' \"to have\") from ''o'' (\"or\"), ''ai'' (\"to the\"), ''a'' (\"to\"), ''anno'' (\"year\"). In the spoken language, the letter is always silent. The {{angle bracket|h}} in ''ho'' additionally marks the contrasting open pronunciation of the {{angle bracket|o}}. The letter {{angle bracket|h}} is also used in combinations with other letters. No [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/h/}} exists in Italian. In nativized foreign words, the {{angle bracket|h}} is silent. For example, ''hotel'' and ''hovercraft'' are pronounced {{IPA|/o\u02c8t\u025bl/}} and {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0254verkraft/}} respectively. (Where {{angle bracket|h}} existed in Latin, it either disappeared or, in a few cases before a back vowel, changed to {{IPA|[\u0261]}}: ''traggo'' \"I pull\" \u2190 Lat. {{smallcaps|trah\u014d}}.)\n* The letters {{angle bracket|s}} and {{angle bracket|z}} can symbolize [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] or [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants. {{angle bracket|z}} symbolizes {{IPA|/dz/}} or {{IPA|/ts/}} depending on context, with few minimal pairs. For example: ''zanzara'' {{IPA|/dzan\u02c8dza\u02d0ra/}} \"mosquito\" and ''nazione'' {{IPA|/nat\u02c8tsjo\u02d0ne/}} \"nation\". {{angle bracket|s}} symbolizes {{IPA|/s/}} word-initially before a vowel, when clustered with a voiceless consonant ({{angle bracket|p, f, c, ch}}), and when doubled; it symbolizes {{IPA|/z/}} when between vowels and when clustered with voiced consonants. Intervocalic {{angle bracket|s}} varies regionally between {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, with {{IPA|/z/}} being more dominant in northern Italy and {{IPA|/s/}} in the south.\n* The letters {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} vary in pronunciation between [[plosives]] and [[affricates]] depending on following vowels. The letter {{angle bracket|c}} symbolizes {{IPA|/k/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|t\u0283}} as in ''chair'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. The letter {{angle bracket|g}} symbolizes {{IPA|/\u0261/}} when word-final and before the back vowels {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. It symbolizes {{IPAslink|d\u0292}} as in ''gem'' before the front vowels {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Other Romance languages and, to an extent, English have similar variations for {{angle bracket|c, g}}. Compare [[hard and soft C]], [[hard and soft G]]. (See also [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]].)\n* The [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|gh}} indicate ({{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}}) before {{angle bracket|i, e}}. The digraphs {{angle bracket|ci}} and {{angle bracket|gi}} indicate softness ({{IPA|/t\u0283/}} and {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}) before {{angle bracket|a, o, u}}. For example:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before back vowel (A, O, U)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Before front vowel (I, E)\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Plosive\n!

For example, it is silent in ''[[ciao]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283a\u02d0.o/}} and cielo {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u025b\u02d0.lo/}}, but it is pronounced in ''farmacia'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.a/}} and ''farmacie'' {{IPA|/\u02ccfar.ma\u02c8t\u0283i\u02d0.e/}}.{{sfn|Berloco|2018}}\n<!--\n* There are three other special [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] in Italian: [[gn (digraph)|{{angle bracket|gn}}]], {{angle bracket|gl}} and {{angle bracket|sc}}. The digraph {{angle bracket|gn}} represents {{IPAslink|\u0272}}. {{angle bracket|gl}} represents {{IPAslink|\u028e}} before {{angle bracket|i}}, and never at the beginning of a word, except in the [[personal pronoun]] and [[definite article]] ''gli''. An exception is the word ''glicerina'' (\"glycerin\"), which is pronounced with a hard {{angle bracket|g}}. (Compare with [[Spanish language|Spanish]] {{angle bracket|\u00f1}} and {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{angle bracket|nh}} and {{angle bracket|lh}}.) {{angle bracket|sc}} represents a fricative {{IPAslink|\u0283}} before {{angle bracket|e, i}}. Except in the speech of some Northern Italians, all of these are normally [[geminate]] between vowels.\n* In general, there is a clear one-to-one correspondence between letters or digraphs and phonemes, as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]; in standard varieties of Italian, there is little allophonic variation. The most notable exceptions are assimilation of /n/ in point of articulation before consonants, assimilatory voicing of /s/ to following voiced consonants, and vowel length (vowels are long in stressed open syllables, except at the end of words, and short elsewhere) \u2014 compare with the substantial number of [[allophone]]s of the English phoneme /t/. Spelling is mostly phonemic and usually difficult to mistake, given a clear pronunciation. Exceptions exist, especially in foreign borrowings. There are fewer cases of [[dyslexia]] than among speakers of languages such as English,<ref>E. Paulescu et al., Dyslexia \u2013 cultural diversity and biological unity, \"Science\", vol. 291, pp. 2165\u20132167.</ref> and the concept of a [[spelling bee]] is strange to Italians.\n\n=== Common variations ===\nSome variations in the usage of the writing system may be present in practical use. These are scorned by educated people and normal written language, but they are so common in certain limited contexts that knowledge of them may be useful.\n* Usage of ''x'' instead of ''per'' \"for\". This is common among teenagers and in [[Text messaging|SMS]] abbreviations. The multiplication operator is read \"per\" in Italian. For example, ''per te'' (\"for you\") is shortened to ''x te'' (compare with English ''4 u''). The ''per'' within words can also be replaced with ''x''. For example: ''perch\u00e9'' (\"why, because\") to ''xch\u00e9'' or ''xk\u00e9''; ''sapere'' (\"to know\") to ''saxe''). This usage is useful shorthand in quick notes or in SMS, but it is unacceptable in formal writing.\n* Usage of foreign letters such as {{angle bracket|k}}, {{angle bracket|j}} and {{angle bracket|y}}, especially in nicknames and SMS language: ''ke'' instead of ''che'', ''Giusy'' instead of ''Giuseppina''. This is mirrored in the usage of ''i'' in English names such as ''Staci'' instead of ''Stacey'' or in the usage of ''c'' in [[Northern Europe]] (''Jacob'' instead of ''Jakob''). The use of {{angle bracket|k}} instead of {{angle bracket|ch}} or {{angle bracket|c}} to represent a plosive sound is documented in some historical texts from before the standardization of the Italian language. The usage is no longer standard in Italian. The letter {{angle bracket|k}} has sometimes been used in satire to suggest a political figure is an authoritarian or even a \"pseudo-nazi\". For example, [[Francesco Cossiga]] was famously nicknamed ''Kossiga'' by rioting students during his tenure as minister of internal affairs. Compare the [[satiric misspelling#\"K\" replacing \"C\"|politicized spelling ''Amerika'']] in the USA. Although not a letter in the standard Italian alphabet, the letter {{angle bracket|j}} is found in many of the languages of southern Italy, including [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]. In modern texts written in any such language, the {{angle bracket|j}} is often replaced with {{angle bracket|i}}.\n* The following abbreviations are limited to electronic-communications media: ''nn'' for ''non'' \"not\"; ''cmq'' for ''comunque'' \"anyway, however\"; ''cm'' for ''come'' \"how, like, as\"; ''d'' for ''di'' \"of\"; ''(io/loro) sn'' for ''(io/loro) sono'' \"I am, they are\"; ''(io) dv'' for ''(io) devo'' \"I must, I have to\" or for ''dove'' \"where\"; ''(tu) 6'' for ''(tu) sei'' \"you are\"; ''dmn'' for ''domani'' \"tomorrow\".\n* Whenever non-[[ASCII]] characters are unavailable or unreliable (as in e-mail), accents may be replaced with adjacent apostrophes. For example: in ''perche<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' instead of ''perch\u00e9''. The practice was standard on manual typewriters that had no accents and is still common for uppercase accented letters. Uppercase {{angle bracket|[[\u00c8]]}} is rare and is absent from the [[Keyboard layout#Italian|Italian keyboard layout]]. It is often substituted with {{angle bracket|E<nowiki>'</nowiki>}}, even though there are [[:it:Aiuto:Manuale di stile#Scrivere \u00c8|several ways]] of producing the uppercase \u00c8 on a computer.\n\n== Sounds ==\n{{Main|Italian phonology}}\n{{IPA notice|lang=it}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\nItalian has seven [[vowel]] phonemes: {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/\u0254/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, represented by five letters: \"a, e, i, o, u\". The pairs {{IPA|/e/}}-{{IPA|/\u025b/}}, and {{IPA|/o/}}-{{IPA|/\u0254/}} are seldom distinguished in writing and often confused, even though most varieties of Italian employ both phonemes consistently. Compare, for example standard \"perch\u00e9\" {{IPA|[per\u02c8ke]}} (why, because) and \"senti\" {{IPA|[\u02c8s\u025bnti]}} (you hear), as pronounced by most central and southern speakers, with {{IPA|[per\u02c8k\u025b]}} and {{IPA|[\u02c8senti]}}, employed by most northern speakers. As a result, the usage is strongly indicative of a person's origin. The standard (Tuscan) usage of these vowels is listed in vocabularies, and employed outside Tuscany mainly by specialists, especially actors and a few (television) journalists.\nThese are truly different [[phonemes]], however: compare {{IPA|/\u02c8peska/}} (fishing) and {{IPA|/\u02c8p\u025bska/}} (peach), both spelled ''pesca'' ({{Audio|It-pesca.ogg|listen}}). Similarly {{IPA|/\u02c8botte/}} ('barrel') and {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u0254tte/}} ('beatings'), both spelled ''botte'', discriminate {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} ({{Audio|It-botte-mp.ogg|listen}}).\n\nIn general, vowel combinations usually pronounce each vowel separately. [[Diphthong]]s exist (e.g. ''uo'', ''iu'', ''ie'', ''ai''), but are limited to an unstressed ''u'' or ''i'' before or after a stressed vowel.\n\nThe unstressed ''u'' in a diphthong approximates the English semivowel ''w'', and the unstressed ''i'' approximates the semivowel ''y''. E.g.: ''buono'' {{IPA|[\u02c8bw\u0254\u02d0no]}}, ''ieri'' {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025b\u02d0ri]}}.\n\n[[Triphthong]]s exist in Italian as well, like \"contin''uia''mo\" (\"we continue\"). Three vowel combinations exist only in the form semiconsonant ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}), followed by a vowel, followed by a [[:wikt:desinence|desinence]] vowel (usually {{IPA|/i/}}), as in ''miei'', ''suoi'', or two semiconsonants followed by a vowel, as the group ''-uia-'' exemplified above, or ''-iuo-'' in the word ''aiuola''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Serianni | first=Luca | author2=Castelvecchi, Alberto |title=Italiano | publisher=Garzanti | year=1997 | page=15}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile diphthongs ===\nMany Latin words with a short ''e'' or ''o'' have Italian counterparts with a so-called mobile diphthong (''ie'' and ''uo'' respectively). The mobility, however, is of stress: when the vowel sound is stressed, it is pronounced and written as a diphthong, e.g. ''buono'' 'good'; when not stressed, it is pronounced and written as a single vowel, as in ''bont\u00e0'' 'goodness'.\n\nSo Latin ''focus'' gave rise to Italian ''fuoco'' (meaning both \"fire\" and \"optical focus\"): when unstressed, as in ''focale'' (\"focal\") the \"o\" remains alone. Latin ''pes'' (more precisely its accusative form ''pedem'') is the source of Italian ''piede'' (foot): but unstressed \"e\" was left unchanged in ''pedone'' (pedestrian) and ''pedale'' (pedal). From Latin ''jocus'' comes Italian ''giuoco'' (\"play\", \"game\"), though in this case ''gioco'' is more common: ''giocare'' means \"to play (a game)\". From Latin ''homo'' comes Italian ''uomo'' (man), but also ''umano'' (human) and ''ominide'' (hominid). From Latin ''ovum'' comes Italian ''uovo'' (egg) and ''ovaie'' (ovaries). (The same phenomenon occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''juego'' (play, game) and ''jugar'' (to play), ''nieve'' (snow) and ''nevar'' (to snow)). Stress-conditioned historical diphthongization can also produce alternating verb stems, as in stem-stressed ''siedo'' 'I sit' and suffix-stressed ''sediamo'' 'we sit'.\n\n=== Consonants ===\n{{See also|Syntactic doubling}}\n\nTwo symbols in a table cell denote the voiceless and voiced consonant, respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Consonants of Italian<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Rogers & d'Arcangeli|2004|p=117}}</ref>\n!\n!

More generally, nasals assimilate to the point of articulation of whatever consonant they precede. -->\n\nItalian has geminate, or double, consonants, which are distinguished by [[Consonant length|length]] and intensity. Length is distinctive for all consonants except for {{IPA|/\u0283/}}, {{IPA|/dz/}}, {{IPA|/ts/}}, {{IPA|/\u028e/}}, {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, which are always geminate when between vowels, and {{IPA|/z/}}, which is always single.\nGeminate plosives and affricates are realized as lengthened closures. Geminate fricatives, nasals, and {{IPA|/l/}} are realized as lengthened [[continuant]]s. There is only one vibrant phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} but the actual pronunciation depends on context and regional accent. Generally one can find a flap consonant {{IPA|[\u027e]}} in unstressed position whereas {{IPA|[r]}} is more common in stressed syllables, but there may be exceptions. Especially people from the Northern part of Italy ([[Parma]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[South Tyrol]]) may pronounce {{IPA|/r/}} as {{IPA|[\u0280]}}, {{IPA|[\u0281]}}, or {{IPA|[\u028b]}}.<ref>{{cite book |last= Canepari |first= Luciano |title= Il M\u00aaPI \u2013 Manuale di pronuncia italiana |edition= second |date=January 1999 |publisher= Zanichelli |location= Bologna |isbn= 978-88-08-24624-0}}</ref>\n\nOf special interest to the linguistic study of [[Regional Italian]] is the ''[[Tuscan gorgia|gorgia toscana]]'', or \"Tuscan Throat\", the weakening or [[lenition]] of [[:wiktionary:intervocalic|intervocalic]] {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, and {{IPA|/k/}} in the [[Tuscan language]].\n\nThe [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0292/}} is present as a phoneme only in loanwords: for example, ''garage'' {{IPA|[\u0261a\u02c8ra\u02d0\u0292]}}. Phonetic {{IPA|[\u0292]}} is common in Central and Southern Italy as an intervocalic allophone of {{IPA|/d\u0292/}}: ''gente'' {{IPA|[\u02c8d\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'people' but ''la gente'' {{IPA|[la\u02c8\u0292\u025bnte]}} 'the people', ''ragione'' {{IPA|[ra\u02c8\u0292o\u02d0ne]}} 'reason'.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Italian grammar}}\n{{See also|Italian verbs}}\n\nItalian grammar is typical of the grammar of [[Romance languages]] in general. [[Grammatical case|Cases]] exist for personal pronouns ([[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Oblique case|oblique]], [[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Dative case|dative]]), but not for nouns.\n\nThere are two basic classes of nouns in Italian, referred to as [[Grammatical gender|genders]], masculine and feminine. Gender may be [[natural gender|natural]] (''ragazzo'' 'boy', ''ragazza'' 'girl') or simply grammatical with no possible reference to biological gender (masculine ''costo'' 'cost', feminine ''costa'' 'coast'). Masculine nouns typically end in ''-o'' (''ragazzo'' 'boy'), with plural marked by ''-i'' (''ragazzi'' 'boys'), and feminine nouns typically end in ''-a'', with plural marked by ''-e'' (''ragazza'' 'girl', ''ragazze'' 'girls'). For a group composed of boys and girls, ''ragazzi'' is the plural, suggesting that ''-i'' is a general plural. A third category of nouns is [[Marker (linguistics)|unmarked]] for gender, ending in ''-e'' in the singular and ''-i'' in the plural: ''legge'' 'law, f. sg.', ''leggi'' 'laws, f. pl.'; ''fiume'' 'river, m. sg.', ''fiumi'' 'rivers, m. pl.', thus assignment of gender is arbitrary in terms of form, enough so that terms may be identical but of distinct genders: ''fine'' meaning 'aim', 'purpose' is masculine, while ''fine'' meaning 'end, ending' (e.g. of a movie) is feminine, and both are ''fini'' in the plural, a clear instance of ''-i'' as a non-gendered default plural marker. These nouns often, but not always, denote [[Animacy|inanimates]]. There are a number of nouns that have a masculine singular and a feminine plural, most commonly of the pattern m. sg. ''-o'', f. pl. ''-a'' (''miglio'' 'mile, m. sg.', ''miglia'' 'miles, f. pl.'; ''paio'' 'pair, m. sg., ''paia'' 'pairs, f. pl.'), and thus are sometimes considered neuter (these are usually derived from [[Grammatical gender|neuter]] Latin nouns). An instance of neuter gender also exists in pronouns of the third person singular.{{sfn|Simone|2010}}\n\nExamples:<ref name=\":6\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"Accademia della Crusca\"\n! href=\"Floris Italicae lingue libri novem\" |Definition\n!Gender\n! href=\"Napoleon\" |Singular Form\n! href=\"lingua franca\" |Plural Form\n|- href=\"bourgeoisie\"\n|Son\n| href=\"The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)\" |Masculine\n|Figlio\n|Figli\n|- href=\"Alessandro Manzoni\"\n| href=\"Arno River\" |House\n| href=\"Florence\" |Feminine\n|Casa\n| href=\"ciao\" |Case\n|- href=\"Venetian language\"\n|Love\n| href=\"panettone\" |Masculine\n| href=\"Lombard language\" |Amore\n|Amori\n|- href=\"Romance language\"\n| href=\"Vulgar Latin\" |Art\n| href=\"Tuscan language\" |Feminine\n| href=\"Florentine dialect\" |Arte\n| href=\"Italo-Dalmatian languages\" |Arti\n|}\nNouns, adjectives, and articles [[Inflection|inflect]] for gender and number (singular and plural).\n\nLike in English, common nouns are capitalized when occurring at the beginning of a sentence. Unlike English, nouns referring to languages (e.g. Italian), speakers of languages, or inhabitants of an area (e.g. Italians) are not capitalized.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three types of [[adjective]]s: descriptive, invariable and form-changing. Descriptive adjectives are the most common, and their endings change to match the number and gender of the noun they modify. Invariable adjectives are adjectives whose endings do not change. The form changing adjectives \"buono (good), bello (beautiful), grande (big), and santo (saint)\" change in form when placed before different types of nouns. Italian has three degrees for comparison of adjectives: positive, comparative, and superlative.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe order of words in the phrase is relatively free compared to most European languages.<ref name=\"Clivio\" /> The position of the verb in the phrase is highly mobile. Word order often has a lesser grammatical function in Italian than in [[English language|English]]. Adjectives are sometimes placed before their noun and sometimes after. Subject nouns generally come before the verb. Italian is a [[null-subject language]], so that nominative pronouns are usually absent, with subject indicated by verbal [[inflection]]s (e.g. ''amo'' 'I love', ''ama'' 's/he loves', ''amano'' 'they love'). Noun objects normally come after the verb, as do pronoun objects after imperative verbs, infinitives and gerunds, but otherwise pronoun objects come before the verb.\n\nThere are both indefinite and definite [[Article (grammar)|articles]] in Italian. There are four indefinite articles, selected by the gender of the noun they modify and by the phonological structure of the word that immediately follows the article. ''Uno'' is masculine singular, used before ''z'' ({{IPA|ts/}} or {{IPA|/dz/}}), ''s+consonant'', ''gn'' ({{IPA|/\u0272/}}), or ''ps'', while masculine singular ''un'' is used before a word beginning with any other sound. The noun ''zio'' 'uncle' selects masculine singular, thus ''uno zio'' 'an uncle' or ''uno zio anziano'' 'an old uncle,' but ''un mio zio'' 'an uncle of mine'. The feminine singular indefinite articles are ''una'', used before any consonant sound, and its abbreviated form, written ''un','' used before vowels: ''una camicia'' 'a shirt', ''una camicia bianca'' 'a white shirt', ''un'altra camicia'' 'a different shirt'. There are seven forms for definite articles, both singular and plural. In the singular: ''lo'', which corresponds to the uses of ''uno''; ''il'', which corresponds to the uses with consonant of ''un''; ''la,'' which corresponds to the uses of ''una''; ''l','' used for both masculine and feminine singular before vowels. In the plural: ''gli'' is the masculine plural of ''lo and l<nowiki>'</nowiki>''; ''i'' is the plural of ''il''; and ''le'' is the plural of feminine ''la'' and ''l''<nowiki/>'.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are numerous [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]] of [[preposition]]s with subsequent [[Article (grammar)|articles]]. There are numerous productive [[suffix]]es for [[Italian diminutive|diminutive]], [[Augmentative#Italian|augmentative]], pejorative, attenuating etc., which are also used to create [[neologism]]s.\n\nThere are 27 pronouns, grouped in [[clitic]] and tonic pronouns. Personal pronouns are separated into three groups: subject, object (which take the place of both direct and indirect objects), and reflexive. Second person subject pronouns have both a polite and a familiar form. These two different types of address are very important in Italian social distinctions. All object pronouns have two forms: stressed and unstressed (clitics). Unstressed object pronouns are much more frequently used, and come before the verb (''Lo vedo''. 'I see him.'). Stressed object pronouns come after the verb, and are used when emphasis is required, for contrast, or to avoid ambiguity (''Vedo lui, ma non lei''. 'I see him, but not her'). Aside from personal pronouns, Italian also has demonstrative, interrogative, possessive, and relative pronouns. There are two types of demonstrative pronouns: relatively near (this) and relatively far (that). Demonstratives in Italian are repeated before each noun, unlike in English.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThere are three regular sets of verbal [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], and various verbs are irregularly conjugated. Within each of these sets of conjugations, there are four simple (one-word) verbal conjugations by person/number in the [[indicative mood]] ([[present tense]]; [[past tense]] with [[imperfective aspect]], past tense with [[perfective aspect]], and [[future tense]]), two simple conjugations in the [[subjunctive mood]] (present tense and past tense), one simple conjugation in the [[conditional mood]], and one simple conjugation in the [[imperative mood]]. Corresponding to each of the simple conjugations, there is a compound conjugation involving a simple conjugation of \"to be\" or \"to have\" followed by a [[past participle]]. \"To have\" is used to form compound conjugation when the verb is transitive (\"Ha detto\", \"ha fatto\": he/she has said, he/she has made/done), while \"to be\" is used in the case of verbs of motion and some other intransitive verbs (\"\u00c8 andato\", \"\u00e8 stato\": he/she has gone, he/she has been). \"To be\" may be used with transitive verbs, but in such a case it makes the verb passive (\"\u00ca detto\", \"\u00e8 fatto\": it is said, it is made/done). This rule is not absolute, and some exceptions do exist.\n\n== Words ==\n===Conversation===\nNote: the plural form of verbs could also be used as an extremely formal (for example to [[Nobility|noble]] people in [[Monarchy|monarchies]]) singular form (see [[royal we]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It is the biggest technical institution of higher education in Russia, with close ties to local industry in the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]]. Its motto, ''Ingenium Creatio Labor'', means \"brilliance creates work\".\n\n== Overview ==\nUSTU has 20 faculties including: [[Metallurgical]], [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Building Materials]], [[Civil Engineering]], [[Physics]] and [[physics]] engineering, [[Radio]] Engineering, [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Fossil fuel power plant|Heat Power Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Economics]] and [[Management]], [[Military Science]], [[Physical education|Physical Training]], [[Humanities]], [[Continuing education]], and a [[Graduate school]].  USTU graduates 3000 engineers annually.\n\n== History ==\nUSTU was founded in 1920.  It was formerly known as '''Ural Polytechnic Institute''' (UPI).\n\nThe school has rapidly expanded due to the [[industrialization]] program of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Government, which created a high demand for [[engineering]] positions. The USTU was key in providing local industrial enterprises with technical and engineering staff.\n\nIn the 1940s, though suffering from a shortage of personnel due to [[World War II]], the USTU received a great stimulus for development as the military needed to increase production for new industrial goods from the plants in the Urals. Many industrial plants were moved to the Urals due to the partial occupation of Western Russia by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] military forces.\n\nAfter the war, the USTU has kept close ties with the military industry, mostly by preparing a large amount of engineers for military purposes.\n\nWith the growth of Soviet Economy, the USTU kept expanding. In 1991, however, due to the economical crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it suffered from acute underfunding by the Russian Government. It was not until the mid-1990s that the USTU began to find appreciable non-governmental sources of funding, mostly by means of establishing business ties with local industrial enterprises that survived or arose as result of the economical crisis.\n\nCurrently, the USTU is preparing to undergo integration with several other universities in Yekaterinburg in order to increase its chances for successful competition with other universities in Russia.\n\nIn April 2008 it was named after [[Boris Yeltsin]] - Yeltsin Ural State Technical University.\n\n02.04.2010 USTU united with USU ([[Ural State University|Ural State University named after A. M.

It is the biggest technical institution of higher education in Russia, with close ties to local industry in the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]]. Its motto, ''Ingenium Creatio Labor'', means \"brilliance creates work\".\n\n== Overview ==\nUSTU has 20 faculties including: [[Metallurgical]], [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Building Materials]], [[Civil Engineering]], [[Physics]] and [[physics]] engineering, [[Radio]] Engineering, [[Electrical Engineering]], [[Fossil fuel power plant|Heat Power Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Economics]] and [[Management]], [[Military Science]], [[Physical education|Physical Training]], [[Humanities]], [[Continuing education]], and a [[Graduate school]].  USTU graduates 3000 engineers annually.\n\n== History ==\nUSTU was founded in 1920.  It was formerly known as '''Ural Polytechnic Institute''' (UPI).\n\nThe school has rapidly expanded due to the [[industrialization]] program of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Government, which created a high demand for [[engineering]] positions. The USTU was key in providing local industrial enterprises with technical and engineering staff.\n\nIn the 1940s, though suffering from a shortage of personnel due to [[World War II]], the USTU received a great stimulus for development as the military needed to increase production for new industrial goods from the plants in the Urals. Many industrial plants were moved to the Urals due to the partial occupation of Western Russia by [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] military forces.\n\nAfter the war, the USTU has kept close ties with the military industry, mostly by preparing a large amount of engineers for military purposes.\n\nWith the growth of Soviet Economy, the USTU kept expanding. In 1991, however, due to the economical crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it suffered from acute underfunding by the Russian Government. It was not until the mid-1990s that the USTU began to find appreciable non-governmental sources of funding, mostly by means of establishing business ties with local industrial enterprises that survived or arose as result of the economical crisis.\n\nCurrently, the USTU is preparing to undergo integration with several other universities in Yekaterinburg in order to increase its chances for successful competition with other universities in Russia.\n\nIn April 2008 it was named after [[Boris Yeltsin]] - Yeltsin Ural State Technical University.\n\n02.04.2010 USTU united with USU ([[Ural State University|Ural State University named after A. M. Gorky]]) and were named [[Ural Federal University]].\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Arkady Mikhailovich Chernetsky]], Mayor of Yekaterinburg\n*[[Andrei Kozitsyn]], billionaire<ref name=\"Forbes Profile\">{{cite web|title=Andrei Kozitsyn|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/andrei-kozitsyn/|website=Forbes|accessdate=27 March 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Boris Yeltsin]], President of Russia (1991-1999)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ural State Law Academy]]\n* [[Ural State University]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Ural State Technical University}}\n*[http://www.USTU.ru Ural State Technical University Official Website]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Yekaterinburg]]\n[[Category:Universities in Sverdlovsk Oblast]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1920]]\n", "name_user": "Rakoon", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_State_Technical_University"}
