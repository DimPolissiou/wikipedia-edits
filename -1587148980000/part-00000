According to the 2011 census, the town has a population of 1,673 and is the administrative center of [[Gusinje Municipality]].\n\n==Name==\nTwo alternative etymologies have been proposed for the toponym ''Gusinje''. One links it to Slavic ''guska'' ([[goose]]), the other to an Illyrian word ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of the town, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/><ref name=\"Loma70\">{{harvnb|Loma|2013|p=70}}</ref> In archival records, it has been recorded variably as ''Gousino'' (\u0413\u043e\u0443\u0441\u0438\u043d\u043e), ''Gustigne'' (1614) in Venetian archives, ''Gusna'' (\u06af\u0648\u0633\u0646) and ''Gusinye'' in Ottoman Turkish.<ref name=\"Loma70\"/><ref name=\"Elsie151\"/>\n\n==Geography==\n{{main|Gusinje Municipality}}\nThe town is located in the Plav-Gusinje area, part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range at an elevation of ca. 1,014 m. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. Moreover, the surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and other communities came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's influence in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

[[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro about 10km south of Gusinje in the National Park \"Prokletije\".<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> Gusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center. The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. Gusinje is the seat of the municipality of the same name. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. The town's boundaries form ~3.73 km\u00b2 of the total 157 km\u00b2 of the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}} Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding.\n\n==History==\nIt is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the neighbouring Albanian tribe (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which was in rebellion against the Ottomans and was plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - around which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of all pathways from Kelmendi. Thus, modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. Moreover, the surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref> The fortress was also designed to stop the expansion of the [[Ku\u010di]] tribe in the Upper Lim valley.\n\nIn time despite initial Ottoman resistance, Kelmendi and Ku\u010di and other communities came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Their descendants although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam by the middle 18th century. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. The different mosques of Gusinje today represent the different brotherhoods that built them. For example, the Cekaj mosque (''\u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija''/''xhamia e Cekajve'') was built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi in 1687, while the New Mosque built in 1899 is known as ''Radon\u010di\u0107a'' after the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u010di. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]]. In terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. The Vezir's mosque, built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 in the town center is a symbol of the Pashalik's lead in the upper Lim valley. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\nAs the Ottoman Empire disintegrated in the long 19th century already in the [[Treaty of San Stefano]], Gusinje and Plav were awarded to the independent [[Principality of Montenegro]]. Gusinje was developing as a commercial town at the time, but still remained outside properly established rule of Ottoman law. Gun ownership was widespread and Ottoman rule was difficult to enforce.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=61}} The Albanians of Gusinje opposed the decisions of the treaty and sent telegrams of protest to the embassies of the [[Great Powers]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=44}} In the [[Congress of Berlin]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|its final treaty]] those decisions were finalized. The Albanians in the two regions reacted against the final decision in favor annexation and formed the [[League of Prizren]]. \n\nA noted figure of the League of Prizren was [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha Shabanagaj]], a landowner and military commander from Gusinje. In the ensuing [[Battle of Nov\u0161i\u0107e]] the League of Prizren led by Shabanagaj defeated the approaching Montenegrin forces led by [[Marko Miljanov]].{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=62}} More than 140 dead and wounded of the ~300 casualties of the League of Prizren in the battle were from Gusinje. Ismail Omeraga, commander of the Gusinje volunteers died in the battle. His head was carried back in [[Cetinje]]. {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=19}} Reports after the battle claim that the victors carried into the town 60 heads from their defeated foes. The annexation was effectively stopped and the Great Powers began another round of negotiations which eventually led to [[Ulcinj]]'s annexation by Montenegro as compensation. The battle became a point of reference in the [[Albanian National Awakening]] and set a precedent about the need of armed struggle to defend other areas.{{sfn|Gawrych|2006|p=74}} Although the battle took place near Nov\u0161i\u0107e which is ~4km to the north of Plav, in the Ottoman press of the time it became known as ''Gusinye hadisesi'' (Gusinye Incident) because of its crucial role in the struggle. \n\nIn 1893, Gusinje had 1,600 households, 5 mosques and 240 shops.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> The districts were part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] until 1913. In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Gusinje became a subject of dispute between newly independent Albania and Montenegro. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]] in the [[London Conference of 1912\u201313|London Peace Conference]] asked for the region of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]] as otherwise communication between the capital of [[Podgorica]] and the new eastern provinces of Montenegro would be blocked. As Kelmendi finally became part of Albania, Gusinje was given to Montenegro with the provision that the people of Kelmendi would have free passage to the town.{{sfn|Cornwall|1987|pp=6-12}} About 2000 Albanian refugees from Gusinje and Plav were reported in Shkodra in 1913 by the director of the Red Cross which was stationed in the city. The beginning of WWI in practice stopped the implementation of any agreement. In 1919, the decision was reaffirmed but the border was closed. In Albania, the closing of the border between [[Mal\u00ebsia]] and Gusinje has been seen as a main cause for the interwar impoverishment of areas like Kelmendi and [[Shala]], which were deprived from access to their traditional market town.{{sfn|Galaty|2013|p=56}}\n\nThe entry of the Montenegrin army in 1913 and the Yugoslav army after 1919 in Gusinje was accompanied by repressive policies against the local population. In 1919, Ro\u017eaje was one of the centres of the [[Plav rebellion]] (''Plavska pobuna'') that fought against the inclusion of [[Sandzak]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=56}} About 450 Muslim locals were killed in Gusinje and nearby Plav after the uprising was quelled.{{sfn|Morrison|2018|p=21}} These events remain a matter of dispute in modern Montenegrin politics. In 2013, the President of Montenegro [[Filip Vujanovi\u0107]] made the first direct acknowledgment of the events in a ceremony in [[Berane]] where he declared that ''the crimes performed in Plav and Gusinje are the dark side of the Montenegrin history''.{{sfn|Pacariz|2013|p=437}}\n\nGusinje became part of Albania in WWII by Fascist Italy and then Nazi Germany to win the support of the local population. After the war, the 1913 borders were reaffirmed. Gusinje's status as a distinct municipality was revoked in 1953. Along with other reasons it fueled immigration and impoverishment in the town and the municipality.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=17}} In 2014, Gusinje regained its municipal status.\n\n== Monuments ==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of historical mosques in Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Kelmendi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. There are also a number of mosques whose ruins only remain today. The mosque of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in 1746-47. Another ruined mosque is that built by the Gjylbegaj family (a branch of the [[Begolli family]]). It was built in 1833.{{sfn|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}\n\n==Demographics==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports that 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is almost entirely Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}}\n\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-2}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=3| Ethnic groups (2011 census)\n|-\n!width=\"100px\"|Ethnic group\n!width=\"80px\"|Number\n!width=\"80px\"|Percentage\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks in Montenegro|Bosniaks]] || 1,098 || 65.63%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 294 || 17.57%\n|-\n| [[Albanians in Montenegro|Albanians]] || 182 || 10.88%\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 46 || 2.75%\n|-\n| [[Serbs of Montenegro|Serbs]] || 28 || 1.67%\n|-\n| Other/undeclared || 25 || 1.49%\n|-\n| '''Total''' || '''1,673'''|| '''100%'''\n|}\n\n{{Col-2}}\n{{historical populations|align=non\n|1948 | 2,402\n|1953 | 2,555\n|1961 | 2,756\n|1971 | 2,695\n|1981 | 2,625\n|1991 | 2,472\n|2003 | 1,704\n|2011 | 1,673\n}}\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- ONLY ADD A PERSON TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA -->\n* [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje]], Ottoman governor \n* [[D\u017eenan Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin footballer\n* [[Fahrudin Radon\u010di\u0107]], Montenegrin businessman, founder of [[Dnevni Avaz]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Ramo Kolenovi\u0107]], kayaker\n* [[Dino Radon\u010di\u0107]], basketball player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Cornwall |first1=Mark |title=Between two wars.

It is a to-scale representation of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, and it is installed so that viewers may walk under the underwater mountain range.

{"title_page": "Pakistani rug", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2015}}\nA '''Pakistani rug''' ('''Pak Persian Rug''' or '''Pakistani carpet''') is a type of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally made in [[Pakistan]].\n\n== History ==\nThe art of weaving developed in the region comprising Pakistan at a time when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at Moenjodaro and Harappa - ancient cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley civilization]] - have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles.<ref name=\"indusvalleytextiles1\">Ancient Textiles of the Indus Valley Region, by Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, published 2004 (in Tana Bana: The woven soul of Pakistan by Koel Publications, Karachi), University of Wisconsin, Madison.

It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of [[List of Mughal emperors|the Mughal Dynasty]] in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, [[Babur]], extended his rule from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan to [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] and founded the [[Mughal Empire]]. Under the patronage of the Mughals, local craftsmen adopted [[Persian carpet|Persian]] techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] at that time (often called '''Lahore carpets''' today) made use of motifs and decorative styles found in [[Mughal architecture]].\n\n[[File:Photograph of Carpet Weavers in Karachi Jail - 1873.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Photograph of Carpet Weavers in Karachi Jail - 1873]]\nDuring the Mughal period, the carpets made on the [[South Asia]] became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets boasted distinctive designs and high knot densities. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]], were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet-weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.\n\nThe carpets woven in Lahore were the first to reach European markets, including [[England]], as far back as Seventeenth century. During the British colonial era, prison weaving was established in district and female jails in cities such as [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]]. Carpet-weaving outside of jails was revived after the [[Partition of India|independence]] when Pakistan's carpet-weaving industry flourished.<ref name=\"jailweaving\">Excerpts from the book, Oriental Rugs, by John Kimberly Mumford, published 1900, Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, New York. [http://www.oriental-rugs-history.com/india-rugs.html]</ref>\n\nAt present, hand-knotted carpets are made by [[Afghan refugees in Pakistan|Afghan refugees]] residing in Pakistan, making carpets and one of the country's leading export products. Hand-knotted rug manufacture is Pakistan's second-largest cottage and small industry. The craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of guls, medallions, paisleys [[(botehs)]], traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations.<ref>Stone, Peter F.

Excavations at Moenjodaro and Harappa - ancient cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley civilization]] - have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles.<ref name=\"indusvalleytextiles1\">Ancient Textiles of the Indus Valley Region, by Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, published 2004 (in Tana Bana: The woven soul of Pakistan by Koel Publications, Karachi), University of Wisconsin, Madison.

It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of [[List of Mughal emperors|the Mughal Dynasty]] in the early sixteenth century, when the last successor of Timur, [[Babur]], extended his rule from [[Kabul]], Afghanistan to [[Dhaka]], [[Bangladesh]] and founded the [[Mughal Empire]]. Under the patronage of the Mughals, local craftsmen adopted [[Persian carpet|Persian]] techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] at that time (often called '''Lahore carpets''' today) made use of motifs and decorative styles found in [[Mughal architecture]].\n\n[[File:Photograph of Carpet Weavers in Karachi Jail - 1873.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Photograph of Carpet Weavers in Karachi Jail - 1873]]\nDuring the Mughal period, the carpets made on the [[South Asia]] became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets boasted distinctive designs and high knot densities. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]], were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan's reign, Mughal carpet-weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase.\n\nThe carpets woven in Lahore were the first to reach European markets, including [[England]], as far back as Seventeenth century. During the British colonial era, prison weaving was established in district and female jails in cities such as [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]]. Carpet-weaving outside of jails was revived after the [[Partition of India|independence]] when Pakistan's carpet-weaving industry flourished.<ref name=\"jailweaving\">Excerpts from the book, Oriental Rugs, by John Kimberly Mumford, published 1900, Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, New York.

Hand-knotted rug manufacture is Pakistan's second-largest cottage and small industry. The craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of guls, medallions, paisleys [[(botehs)]], traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations.<ref>Stone, Peter F.
