In the 16th century, various European states funded expeditions to the interior of both North and South America, as well as to their respective west and east coasts, north to [[California]] and [[Labrador]] and south to [[Chile]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]]. In the 17th century, [[Russian Empire|Russian]] explorers conquered [[Siberia]] in search of sables, while the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] contributed greatly to the charting of [[Australia]]. The 18th century witnessed the first extensive explorations of the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and [[Oceania]] and the discovery of [[Alaska]], while the 19th was dominated by exploration of the [[polar region]]s and excursions into the heart of Africa. By the early 20th century, the poles themselves had been reached.\n\n==15th century==\n[[File:Vascodagama.JPG|thumb|[[Vasco da Gama]] lands at [[Calicut]], illustration for Os Lus\u00edadas, 1880 by Ernesto Casanova]]\n*1418 \u2013 [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] explorers [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]] and [[Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira]] discover [[Porto Santo Island]] in the [[Madeira Islands|Madeira archipelago]].<ref name=Diffie>{{cite book| last = Diffie| first = Bailey| title = Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415\u20131580| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| year = 1977| isbn = 0-8166-0782-6| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&lpg=1| pages = 465\u2013474}}</ref>\n*1419 \u2013 [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco|Gon\u00e7alves]] and Vaz discover the main island of [[Madeira Island|Madeira]].<ref name=Diffie/>\n*1431 \u2013 [[Diogo de Silves]] discovers the [[Azores]].<ref name=Diffie/>\n*1434 \u2013 [[Gil Eanes]] passes [[Cape Chaunar|Cabo de N\u00e3o]] and becomes the first to sail beyond [[Cape Bojador]] and return alive.<ref name=Morison1974>{{cite book| last = Morison| first = Samuel| title = The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages, 1492\u20131616| url = https://archive.org/details/europeandiscover00mori| url-access = registration| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1974| location = New York}}</ref>\n*1444 \u2013 [[Dinis Dias]] reaches the mouth of the [[Senegal River]].<ref name=Whitfield/>\n*1446 \u2013 The Portuguese reach the mainland peninsula of [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde]] and the [[Gambia River]].<ref name=Whitfield/>\n*1456 \u2013 [[Alvise Cadamosto]] and [[Diogo Gomes]] explore the [[Cape Verde Islands]], {{convert|560|km}} west of the Cape Verde peninsula.<ref name=Diffie/>\n*1460 \u2013 [[P\u00earo de Sintra]] reaches [[Sierra Leone]].<ref name=Diffie/>\n*1470 \u2013 [[Cape Palmas]] is passed.<ref name=Whitfield/>\n*1472 \u2013 [[Fern\u00e3o do P\u00f3]] discovers the island of [[Bioko]].<ref name=Ravenstein>{{cite book| last = Ravenstein| first = Ernest George| title = The voyages of Diogo C\u00e3o and Bartholomeu Dias, 1482\u201388| publisher = W.

In the 16th century, various European states funded expeditions to the interior of both North and South America, as well as to their respective west and east coasts, north to [[California]] and [[Labrador]] and south to [[Chile]] and [[Tierra del Fuego]]. In the 17th century, [[Russian Empire|Russian]] explorers conquered [[Siberia]] in search of sables, while the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] contributed greatly to the charting of [[Australia]]. The 18th century witnessed the first extensive explorations of the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]] and [[Oceania]] and the discovery of [[Alaska]], while the 19th was dominated by exploration of the [[polar region]]s and excursions into the heart of Africa.

Bernard, furious that the man has insulted the gentile Marion, hustles him out to the street and pushes him around. Furious that Bernard has jeopardised her theatre, Marion refuses all contact with him offstage. One night, pretending to be air raid wardens, two [[Gestapo]] men start searching the theatre and it is Bernard to whom Marion turns to in desperation for urgent help in concealing Lucas and his effects. When the Gestapo arrests Bernard's Resistance contact just before they have planned to meet in a church, he decides to devote his life to the cause and give up acting. As he is clearing out his little dressing room, Marion comes in to say goodbye and the two make love on the floor.\n\nAfter the war, Bernard returns to be male lead in a new play that the freed Lucas wrote while hiding. In it, the female lead played by Marion offers to share her life, but he claims he never really loved her.

(Spring/Summer 1932), \"Invaders from the Infinite\", ''[[Amazing Stories Quarterly]]'', pg 216.</ref> He followed up on this notion in a note to another story published five years later: <blockquote>The total capacity of the mind, even at present, is to all intents and purposes, infinite. Could the full equipment be hooked into a functioning unit, the resulting intelligence should be able to conquer a world without much difficulty.<ref>Campbell, John W. (August 1937), \"The Story Behind the Story\", ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' (note to the short story \"The Double Minds\").</ref></blockquote> In 1939, he wrote in an editorial in the magazine ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'', which he edited:<blockquote>Is it so strange a thing that this unknown mass [the human brain] should have some unguessed power by which to feel and see beyond, directly, meeting mind to mind in telepathy, sensing direct the truth of things by clairvoyance?<ref>Campbell, John W. [writing as \"Don A Stuart\"] (April 1939), \"Strange Worlds\", ''Unknown'', pg 162.</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nAlong with Charles Fort, Campbell believed that there were already many individuals with latent \"psi powers\" among us unwittingly and he took this belief a step further in considering development of such powers to be the \"next step\" in human evolution. Throughout his career, Campbell had sought grounds for a new \"scientific psychology\" and he was instrumental in formulating the brainchild of one of his more imaginative science fiction writers \u2014 the \"[[Dianetics]]\" of [[L. Ron Hubbard]].<ref>Nevala-Lee, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', ''[[passim]]''.</ref><ref>Westfahl, Gary (2005), ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy'', Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, pg 167.</ref> Campbell's enthusiasm for Dianetics \u2014 which later morphed into the [[Church of Scientology]] \u2014 was red hot in 1949 and 1950, but had considerably cooled by 1951 when he saw Hubbard for the last time.<ref>Nevala-Lee, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', pg 302.</ref>\n\n==History==\nWith Campbell's encouragement, or at his direction, \"psionic\" abilities began to appear frequently in magazine science fiction stories in the mid-1950s, providing characters with supernormal or supernatural abilities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Poul|title=Fantasy|date=1981|publisher=Tom Doherty Associates|location=|isbn=9780523485157|page=270|edition=1st}}</ref> The first example was [[Murray Leinster]]'s novella ''The Psionic Mousetrap'' published in early 1955.<ref>Leinster, Murray (March 1955), ''The Psionic Mousetrap'', ''[[Amazing Stories]]''.</ref><ref>Westfahl, ''[[Op. cit.]]''</ref> Examples of psychic abilities in fiction, whether attributed to supernatural agencies or otherwise, predated the \"psionics\" vogue.

They cite [[James Blish]]'s ''Jack of Eagles'' (1952), [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s ''[[More Than Human]]'' (1953), [[Wilson Tucker]]'s ''Wild Talent'' (1954) and [[Frank M. Robinson]]'s ''[[The Power (Robinson novel)|The Power]]'' (1956) as examples. [[Alfred Bester]]'s ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' (1953) is a pioneering example of a work depicting a society in which people with \"psi\" abilities are fully integrated. Since the \"psi-boom\" years coincided with the darkest and most paranoid period of the [[Cold War]], it is natural that many examples of the utility of telepathy in espionage (for example those of [[Randall Garrett]]) would be produced. In terms of literary continuity, the editors of ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' point out that: <blockquote>All the psi powers, of course, used to be in the repertoire of powerful magicians, and most are featured in occult romances.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', pg 972.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1956, Campbell began promoting a psionics device known as the [[Hieronymus machine]].

(Spring/Summer 1932), \"Invaders from the Infinite\", ''[[Amazing Stories Quarterly]]'', pg 216.</ref> He followed up on this notion in a note to another story published five years later: <blockquote>The total capacity of the mind, even at present, is to all intents and purposes, infinite. Could the full equipment be hooked into a functioning unit, the resulting intelligence should be able to conquer a world without much difficulty.<ref>Campbell, John W. (August 1937), \"The Story Behind the Story\", ''[[Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' (note to the short story \"The Double Minds\").</ref></blockquote> In 1939, he wrote in an editorial in the magazine ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'', which he edited:<blockquote>Is it so strange a thing that this unknown mass [the human brain] should have some unguessed power by which to feel and see beyond, directly, meeting mind to mind in telepathy, sensing direct the truth of things by clairvoyance?<ref>Campbell, John W. [writing as \"Don A Stuart\"] (April 1939), \"Strange Worlds\", ''Unknown'', pg 162.</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nAlong with Charles Fort, Campbell believed that there were already many individuals with latent \"psi powers\" among us unwittingly and he took this belief a step further in considering development of such powers to be the \"next step\" in human evolution. Throughout his career, Campbell had sought grounds for a new \"scientific psychology\" and he was instrumental in formulating the brainchild of one of his more imaginative science fiction writers \u2014 the \"[[Dianetics]]\" of [[L. Ron Hubbard]].<ref>Nevala-Lee, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', ''[[passim]]''.</ref><ref>Westfahl, Gary (2005), ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy'', Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, pg 167.</ref> Campbell's enthusiasm for Dianetics \u2014 which later morphed into the [[Church of Scientology]] \u2014 was red hot in 1949 and 1950, but had considerably cooled by 1951 when he saw Hubbard for the last time.<ref>Nevala-Lee, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', pg 302.</ref>\n\n==History==\nWith Campbell's encouragement, or at his direction, \"psionic\" abilities began to appear frequently in magazine science fiction stories in the mid-1950s, providing characters with supernormal or supernatural abilities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Poul|title=Fantasy|date=1981|publisher=Tom Doherty Associates|location=|isbn=9780523485157|page=270|edition=1st}}</ref> The first example was [[Murray Leinster]]'s novella ''The Psionic Mousetrap'' published in early 1955.<ref>Leinster, Murray (March 1955), ''The Psionic Mousetrap'', ''[[Amazing Stories]]''.</ref><ref>Westfahl, ''[[Op. cit.]]''</ref> Examples of psychic abilities in fiction, whether attributed to supernatural agencies or otherwise, predated the \"psionics\" vogue.

They cite [[James Blish]]'s ''Jack of Eagles'' (1952), [[Theodore Sturgeon]]'s ''[[More Than Human]]'' (1953), [[Wilson Tucker]]'s ''Wild Talent'' (1954) and [[Frank M. Robinson]]'s ''[[The Power (Robinson novel)|The Power]]'' (1956) as examples. [[Alfred Bester]]'s ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' (1953) is a pioneering example of a work depicting a society in which people with \"psi\" abilities are fully integrated. Since the \"psi-boom\" years coincided with the darkest and most paranoid period of the [[Cold War]], it is natural that many examples of the utility of telepathy in espionage (for example those of [[Randall Garrett]]) would be produced. In terms of literary continuity, the editors of ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' point out that: <blockquote>All the psi powers, of course, used to be in the repertoire of powerful magicians, and most are featured in occult romances.<ref>''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', pg 972.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1956, Campbell began promoting a psionics device known as the [[Hieronymus machine]].

Contrary to the American usage of the term, it is characterised by strongly [[bilateral symmetry]], with an [[Italianate]] or [[Palladian]]-derived pediment on the front formal elevation.\n\nThe architectural historian [[Marcus Binney]], writing in ''[[The Times]]'' in 2006, describes [[Poulton House]] in [[Poulton, Wiltshire]] (built in 1706, during the reign of Queen Anne)<ref>[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1034116 Poulton House]</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pevsner |first1=Nikolaus |authorlink1=Nikolaus Pevsner |last2=Cherry |first2=Bridget (revision) |year=1975 |origyear=1963 |title=Wiltshire |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |edition=2nd |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-0710-26-4 |page=336}}</ref> as \"...Queen Anne at its most delightful\".

In particular, [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States]] is a wholly different style, as is that in Australia, and normally includes no elements very typical of the actual architecture of Queen Anne's reign, the names having been devised for marketing purposes.\n\n==British 19th-century Queen Anne style==\n[[George Devey]] (1820\u20131886) and the better-known [[Richard Norman Shaw|Norman Shaw]] (1831\u20131912) popularized the Queen Anne style of British architecture of the [[industrial age]] in the 1870s. Norman Shaw published a book of architectural sketches as early as 1858, and his evocative pen-and-ink drawings began to appear in trade journals and artistic magazines in the 1870s. (American commercial builders quickly adopted the style.)\n\nShaw's eclectic designs often included [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] elements, and this \"Old English\" style also became popular in the United States, where it became known (inaccurately) as the Queen Anne style. Confusion between buildings constructed during the reign of Queen Anne and the \"Queen Anne\" style still persists, especially in England.\n\nIn the late 1850s, the name \"Queen Anne\" was in the air,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} following publication in 1852 of  [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s novel, ''[[The History of Henry Esmond|The History of Henry Esmond, Esq., A Colonel in the Service of Her Majesty Queen Anne]]''. One minor side-effect of Thackeray's novel and of Norman Shaw's freehand picturesque vernacular [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] survives to this day. When, in the early 1870s, Chinese-inspired Early Georgian furniture on [[cabriole leg]]s, featuring smooth expanses of walnut and chairs with flowing lines and slat backs, began to be looked for in out-of-the-way curio shops (Macquoid 1904), the style was mis-attributed to the reign of Queen Anne, and the \"Queen Anne\" misnomer has stuck to this day, in American as well as English furniture-style designations (see [[Queen Anne style furniture]]). Even the most stylish and up-to-date furnishings of the historical reign of Queen Anne, as inventories reveal, used a style that 21st-century connoisseurs would immediately identify as \"[[William and Mary style|William and Mary]]\".\n\nThe British Victorian version of the style empathises more closely with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] than does its American counterpart. A good example is [[Severalls Hospital]] in Colchester, Essex (1913\u20131997), now defunct.\n\nThe historic precedents of the Queen Anne style were broad:\n* fine brickwork, often in a warmer, softer finish than the Victorians characteristically used, varied with terracotta panels, or tile-hung upper stories, with crisply-painted white woodwork, or blond limestone detailing\n* [[oriel window]]s, often stacked one above another\n* corner towers\n* asymmetrical fronts and picturesque massing\n* Flemish [[mannerism|mannerist]] sunken panels of [[strapwork]]\n* deeply shadowed entrances\n* broad porches\n* overall, a domesticated free Renaissance style\n\n[[Image:County Hall (1898), Wood Street, Wakefield.jpg|thumb|right|[[County Hall, Wakefield]], designed by architects [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson|James Gibson]] and Samuel Russell in 1894]]\nWhen an open architectural competition took place in 1892 for a [[Seat of local government|county hall]] to be built in [[Wakefield]], in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the instructions to competitors noted that \"the style of architecture will be left to the competitors but the Queen Anne or Renaissance School of Architecture appears suited to an old town like Wakefield\".<ref>County Council Records, 11 January 1893; Papers ''Building of County Hall''</ref> The [[County Hall, Wakefield|executed design]], by architects [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson|James Gibson]] and Samuel Russell of London, combines a corner turret, grandly domed and with [[gargoyle]]s at the angles, freely combined with Flemish Renaissance stepped gables.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[Edwin Lutyens]] and others used an elegant version of the style, usually with red-brick walls contrasting with pale stone details.\n\n==Queen Anne Revival in other countries==\n{{Main|Queen Anne Revival architecture}}\n\n===American Queen Anne style===\n{{Main|Queen Anne style architecture in the United States}}\n[[File:Carson mansion.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carson Mansion]], located in [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[California]], is widely considered to be one of the highest executions of American Queen Anne style.]]\n\nIn the United States, the so-called \"Queen Anne style\" is loosely used of a wide range of picturesque buildings with \"free Renaissance\" (non-[[Gothic Revival architecture]]) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right. \"Queen Anne\", as an alternative both to the French-derived [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] and the less \"domestic\" [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], is broadly applied to architecture, furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910; some \"Queen Anne\" architectural elements, such as the wraparound front porch, continued to be found into the 1920s.\n\nThe gabled and domestically scaled \"Queen Anne\" style arrived in New York City with the new housing for the New York House and School of Industry [[Sidney V. Stratton]], architect, 1878). Distinctive features of American Queen Anne style (rooted in the English style) may include an [[asymmetrical]] [[facade|fa\u00e7ade]]; dominant front-facing [[gable]], often [[cantilever]]ed out beyond the plane of the wall below; overhanging [[eaves]]; round, square, or [[polygonal]] tower(s); shaped and [[Dutch gable]]s; a [[porch]] covering part or all of the front facade, including the primary entrance area; a second-story porch or balconies; [[pediment]]ed porches; differing wall textures, such as patterned wood shingles shaped into varying designs, including resembling fish scales, [[terra cotta]] tiles, [[relief]] panels, or wooden shingles over brickwork, etc.; [[dentils]]; classical columns; spindle work; [[Oriel window|oriel]] and bay windows; horizontal bands of leaded windows; monumental chimneys; painted [[balustrade]]s; and wooden or [[slate]] roofs. Front gardens often had wooden fences.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buffaloah.com/a/archsty/queen/index.html|title=Queen Anne Style|website=buffaloah.com}}</ref>\n\n===Australian Queen Anne style===\n[[File:The Australia (APA) Building, Melbourne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The [[APA Building, Melbourne|APA Building]] in Melbourne, circa approx 1900. It was Australia's tallest building from its completion in 1889 to 1912 and was demolished in 1980.]]\n{{Main|Federation architecture}}\nIn Australia, the Queen Anne style was absorbed into the [[Federation architecture|Federation style]], which was, broadly speaking, the Australian equivalent of the [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian style]], derived from the influence of [[Richard Norman Shaw]],<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.132</ref> an influential British architect of the late [[Victorian era]]. The Federation period went from 1890 to 1915 and included twelve styles, one of which was the [[Federation Queen Anne]]. This became the most popular style for houses built between 1890 and 1910.<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p.132</ref> The style often utilised Tudor-style woodwork and elaborate fretwork that replaced the Victorian taste for wrought iron. Verandahs were usually a feature, as were the image of the rising sun and Australian wildlife; plus circular windows, turrets and towers with conical or pyramid-shaped roofs.\n[[Image:FederationHomeSydney0005.jpg|thumb|right|'Vallambrosa', a Queen Anne Style house located at 19 [[Appian Way, Burwood, Sydney|Appian Way]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]]]]\n[[Image:Federation style mansion in domain street south yarra.jpg|thumb|Queen Anne styled mansion located in [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].]]\nThe first Queen Anne house in Australia was [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]] in the suburb of [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales]].<ref>The Federation House, Hugh Fraser (New Holland) 2002, p.24</ref> Caerleon was designed initially by a Sydney architect, [[Harry Kent (architect)|Harry Kent]], but was then substantially reworked in London by [[Maurice Adams]].<ref>Sydney Architecture, Graham Jahn (Watermark Press) 1997, p.62</ref> This led to some controversy over who deserved the credit. The house was built in 1885 and was the precursor for the Federation Queen Anne house that was to become so popular. The [[APA Building, Melbourne|APA Building]] in the [[Melbourne city centre]] was an example of the Queen Anne style being used for non-residential purposes, though at some stage the building may have been apartments. It was demolished in 1981 after the modernism boom in Melbourne took off\u2013factors that sealed its demolition included rapacious development, lax heritage attitudes in Australian cities, and the owner's own decision to argue for a demolition permit which was granted.\n\nCaerleon was followed soon after by West Maling, in the suburb of [[Penshurst, New South Wales]],<ref>[http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_04_2.cfm?itemid=1870222 Heritage branch | NSW Environment & Heritage]</ref> and Annesbury, in the suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales]], both built circa 1888. These houses, although built around the same time, had distinct styles, West Maling displaying a robust Tudor influence that was not present in Annesbury. The style soon became increasingly popular, appealing predominantly to reasonably well-off people with an \"Establishment\" leaning.<ref>The Federation House, p.22</ref>\n\nThe style as it developed in Australia was highly eclectic, blending Queen Anne elements with various Australian influences. Old English characteristics like ribbed chimneys and gabled roofs were combined with Australian aspects like encircling verandahs, designed to keep the sun out. One outstanding example of this eclectic approach is [[Urrbrae House]], in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Urrbrae, South Australia]], part of the Waite Institute. Another variation with connections to the Federation Queen Anne style was the [[Federation Bungalow]], featuring extended verandahs. This style generally incorporated familiar Queen Anne elements, but usually in simplified form.\n\nSome prominent examples are:<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, pp.132-135</ref>\n* [[West Maling]], corner of Penshurst Avenue and King Georges Road, [[Penshurst, New South Wales|Penshurst]], Sydney\n* Homes, [[Appian Way, Burwood|Appian Way]], [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]], Sydney\n* Homes, [[Haberfield, New South Wales]]\n* [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]], 15 Ginahgulla Road, [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]], Sydney (sold for $22 million in January 2008)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2711158|title=Caerleon - house, grounds (Full LEP listing - Description in Further Comments) {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref><ref>Sydney Morning Herald, January 25th 2008, page 3</ref>\n* [[Annesbury]], 78 Alt Street, [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], Sydney<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://federation-house.wikispaces.com/Amesbury,+Ashfield,+NSW|title=Wikispaces|website=federation-house.wikispaces.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n* [[Weld Club]], Barrack Street, Perth\n* [[ANZ Bank]], Queens Parade, Fitzroy North, Melbourne\n* [[Campion College]], Studley Park Road, Kew, Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adonline.id.au/buildings/dalswraith/|title=Dalswraith {{!}} Melbourne Buildings {{!}} Adam Dimech|website=www.adonline.id.au|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n* [[Redcourt Estate]], Armadale, Melbourne\n* [[Tay Creggan]], Hawthorn, Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://federation-house.wikispaces.com/Tay+Creggan,+Hawthorn|title=Wikispaces|website=federation-house.wikispaces.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:WestMalingSydney0004.jpg|West Maling, Penshurst NSW\nImage:'Amalfi' 2 Appian Way Burwood.jpg|'Amalfi', 2 Appian Way Burwood NSW\nImage:'Vallambrosa' 19 Appian Way Burwood NSW.jpg|'Vallambrosa' 19 Appian Way Burwood NSW\nImage:Burwood Appian Way 2.JPG|Burwood Appian Way\nImage:SLNSW 796381 The Manse Haberfield Federation style house.jpg|The Manse Haberfield Federation style house\nImage:(1)Caerleon-3.jpg|Caerleon, Bellevue Hill, Sydney NSW\nImage:Weld club2.jpg|Weld Club, Perth WA\nImage:Queens_Bess.jpg|Queen Bess Row in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]]\nImage:RedCourt-Exterior-01.jpg|Redcourt, Armadale, Victoria, Australia\nImage:Edzett Mansion Toorak.jpeg|Edzell Mansion, Toorak Victoria\nFile:1907 Postcard of Elmcroft in Smiths Falls.jpg|[[Elmcroft]], [[Smiths Falls, Ontario]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Queen Anne style furniture]]\n* [[Revivalism (architecture)]]\n* [[Architecture of England#Stuart architecture|Stuart architecture]]\n** [[Ramsbury Manor]]\n** [[Restoration style]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Mark Girouard|Girouard, Mark]], ''Sweetness and Light: The Queen Anne Movement, 1860\u20131900'', Yale University Press, 1984.

A good example is [[Severalls Hospital]] in Colchester, Essex (1913\u20131997), now defunct.\n\nThe historic precedents of the Queen Anne style were broad:\n* fine brickwork, often in a warmer, softer finish than the Victorians characteristically used, varied with terracotta panels, or tile-hung upper stories, with crisply-painted white woodwork, or blond limestone detailing\n* [[oriel window]]s, often stacked one above another\n* corner towers\n* asymmetrical fronts and picturesque massing\n* Flemish [[mannerism|mannerist]] sunken panels of [[strapwork]]\n* deeply shadowed entrances\n* broad porches\n* overall, a domesticated free Renaissance style\n\n[[Image:County Hall (1898), Wood Street, Wakefield.jpg|thumb|right|[[County Hall, Wakefield]], designed by architects [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson|James Gibson]] and Samuel Russell in 1894]]\nWhen an open architectural competition took place in 1892 for a [[Seat of local government|county hall]] to be built in [[Wakefield]], in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the instructions to competitors noted that \"the style of architecture will be left to the competitors but the Queen Anne or Renaissance School of Architecture appears suited to an old town like Wakefield\".<ref>County Council Records, 11 January 1893; Papers ''Building of County Hall''</ref> The [[County Hall, Wakefield|executed design]], by architects [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson|James Gibson]] and Samuel Russell of London, combines a corner turret, grandly domed and with [[gargoyle]]s at the angles, freely combined with Flemish Renaissance stepped gables.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[Edwin Lutyens]] and others used an elegant version of the style, usually with red-brick walls contrasting with pale stone details.\n\n==Queen Anne Revival in other countries==\n{{Main|Queen Anne Revival architecture}}\n\n===American Queen Anne style===\n{{Main|Queen Anne style architecture in the United States}}\n[[File:Carson mansion.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carson Mansion]], located in [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[California]], is widely considered to be one of the highest executions of American Queen Anne style.]]\n\nIn the United States, the so-called \"Queen Anne style\" is loosely used of a wide range of picturesque buildings with \"free Renaissance\" (non-[[Gothic Revival architecture]]) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right. \"Queen Anne\", as an alternative both to the French-derived [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] and the less \"domestic\" [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], is broadly applied to architecture, furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910; some \"Queen Anne\" architectural elements, such as the wraparound front porch, continued to be found into the 1920s.\n\nThe gabled and domestically scaled \"Queen Anne\" style arrived in New York City with the new housing for the New York House and School of Industry [[Sidney V. Stratton]], architect, 1878). Distinctive features of American Queen Anne style (rooted in the English style) may include an [[asymmetrical]] [[facade|fa\u00e7ade]]; dominant front-facing [[gable]], often [[cantilever]]ed out beyond the plane of the wall below; overhanging [[eaves]]; round, square, or [[polygonal]] tower(s); shaped and [[Dutch gable]]s; a [[porch]] covering part or all of the front facade, including the primary entrance area; a second-story porch or balconies; [[pediment]]ed porches; differing wall textures, such as patterned wood shingles shaped into varying designs, including resembling fish scales, [[terra cotta]] tiles, [[relief]] panels, or wooden shingles over brickwork, etc.; [[dentils]]; classical columns; spindle work; [[Oriel window|oriel]] and bay windows; horizontal bands of leaded windows; monumental chimneys; painted [[balustrade]]s; and wooden or [[slate]] roofs. Front gardens often had wooden fences.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buffaloah.com/a/archsty/queen/index.html|title=Queen Anne Style|website=buffaloah.com}}</ref>\n\n===Australian Queen Anne style===\n[[File:The Australia (APA) Building, Melbourne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The [[APA Building, Melbourne|APA Building]] in Melbourne, circa approx 1900.

The Federation period went from 1890 to 1915 and included twelve styles, one of which was the [[Federation Queen Anne]]. This became the most popular style for houses built between 1890 and 1910.<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p.132</ref> The style often utilised Tudor-style woodwork and elaborate fretwork that replaced the Victorian taste for wrought iron. Verandahs were usually a feature, as were the image of the rising sun and Australian wildlife; plus circular windows, turrets and towers with conical or pyramid-shaped roofs.\n[[Image:FederationHomeSydney0005.jpg|thumb|right|'Vallambrosa', a Queen Anne Style house located at 19 [[Appian Way, Burwood, Sydney|Appian Way]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]]]]\n[[Image:Federation style mansion in domain street south yarra.jpg|thumb|Queen Anne styled mansion located in [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].]]\nThe first Queen Anne house in Australia was [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]] in the suburb of [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales]].<ref>The Federation House, Hugh Fraser (New Holland) 2002, p.24</ref> Caerleon was designed initially by a Sydney architect, [[Harry Kent (architect)|Harry Kent]], but was then substantially reworked in London by [[Maurice Adams]].<ref>Sydney Architecture, Graham Jahn (Watermark Press) 1997, p.62</ref> This led to some controversy over who deserved the credit. The house was built in 1885 and was the precursor for the Federation Queen Anne house that was to become so popular. The [[APA Building, Melbourne|APA Building]] in the [[Melbourne city centre]] was an example of the Queen Anne style being used for non-residential purposes, though at some stage the building may have been apartments. It was demolished in 1981 after the modernism boom in Melbourne took off\u2013factors that sealed its demolition included rapacious development, lax heritage attitudes in Australian cities, and the owner's own decision to argue for a demolition permit which was granted.\n\nCaerleon was followed soon after by West Maling, in the suburb of [[Penshurst, New South Wales]],<ref>[http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_04_2.cfm?itemid=1870222 Heritage branch | NSW Environment & Heritage]</ref> and Annesbury, in the suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales]], both built circa 1888. These houses, although built around the same time, had distinct styles, West Maling displaying a robust Tudor influence that was not present in Annesbury. The style soon became increasingly popular, appealing predominantly to reasonably well-off people with an \"Establishment\" leaning.<ref>The Federation House, p.22</ref>\n\nThe style as it developed in Australia was highly eclectic, blending Queen Anne elements with various Australian influences. Old English characteristics like ribbed chimneys and gabled roofs were combined with Australian aspects like encircling verandahs, designed to keep the sun out. One outstanding example of this eclectic approach is [[Urrbrae House]], in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Urrbrae, South Australia]], part of the Waite Institute. Another variation with connections to the Federation Queen Anne style was the [[Federation Bungalow]], featuring extended verandahs. This style generally incorporated familiar Queen Anne elements, but usually in simplified form.\n\nSome prominent examples are:<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, pp.132-135</ref>\n* [[West Maling]], corner of Penshurst Avenue and King Georges Road, [[Penshurst, New South Wales|Penshurst]], Sydney\n* Homes, [[Appian Way, Burwood|Appian Way]], [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]], Sydney\n* Homes, [[Haberfield, New South Wales]]\n* [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]], 15 Ginahgulla Road, [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]], Sydney (sold for $22 million in January 2008)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2711158|title=Caerleon - house, grounds (Full LEP listing - Description in Further Comments) {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref><ref>Sydney Morning Herald, January 25th 2008, page 3</ref>\n* [[Annesbury]], 78 Alt Street, [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], Sydney<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://federation-house.wikispaces.com/Amesbury,+Ashfield,+NSW|title=Wikispaces|website=federation-house.wikispaces.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n* [[Weld Club]], Barrack Street, Perth\n* [[ANZ Bank]], Queens Parade, Fitzroy North, Melbourne\n* [[Campion College]], Studley Park Road, Kew, Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adonline.id.au/buildings/dalswraith/|title=Dalswraith {{!}} Melbourne Buildings {{!}} Adam Dimech|website=www.adonline.id.au|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n* [[Redcourt Estate]], Armadale, Melbourne\n* [[Tay Creggan]], Hawthorn, Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://federation-house.wikispaces.com/Tay+Creggan,+Hawthorn|title=Wikispaces|website=federation-house.wikispaces.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:WestMalingSydney0004.jpg|West Maling, Penshurst NSW\nImage:'Amalfi' 2 Appian Way Burwood.jpg|'Amalfi', 2 Appian Way Burwood NSW\nImage:'Vallambrosa' 19 Appian Way Burwood NSW.jpg|'Vallambrosa' 19 Appian Way Burwood NSW\nImage:Burwood Appian Way 2.JPG|Burwood Appian Way\nImage:SLNSW 796381 The Manse Haberfield Federation style house.jpg|The Manse Haberfield Federation style house\nImage:(1)Caerleon-3.jpg|Caerleon, Bellevue Hill, Sydney NSW\nImage:Weld club2.jpg|Weld Club, Perth WA\nImage:Queens_Bess.jpg|Queen Bess Row in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]]\nImage:RedCourt-Exterior-01.jpg|Redcourt, Armadale, Victoria, Australia\nImage:Edzett Mansion Toorak.jpeg|Edzell Mansion, Toorak Victoria\nFile:1907 Postcard of Elmcroft in Smiths Falls.jpg|[[Elmcroft]], [[Smiths Falls, Ontario]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Queen Anne style furniture]]\n* [[Ramsbury Manor]]\n* [[Revivalism (architecture)]]\n* [[Architecture of England#Stuart architecture|Stuart architecture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Mark Girouard|Girouard, Mark]], ''Sweetness and Light: The Queen Anne Movement, 1860\u20131900'', Yale University Press, 1984.

{"title_page": "Mobile phone signal", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{expert needed|date=May 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=February 2013}}\n}}\n[[Image:Mobile phone signal.png|right|thumb|A display of bars on a mobile phone screen]]\nA '''mobile phone signal''' (also known as '''reception''' and '''service''') is the [[signal strength]] (measured in [[dBm]]) received by a [[mobile phone]] from a [[cellular network]] (on the [[downlink]]). Depending on various factors, such as proximity to a [[cell site|tower]], any obstructions such as buildings or trees, etc. this signal strength will vary. Most mobile devices use a set of bars of increasing height to display the approximate strength of this received signal to the mobile phone user. Traditionally five bars are used. (see [[five by five]])\n\nGenerally, a strong mobile phone signal is more likely in an urban area, though these areas can also have some \"dead zones\", where no reception can be obtained. Cellular signals are designed to be resistant to [[Multipath interference|multipath]] reception, which is most likely to be caused by the blocking of a direct signal path by large buildings, such as [[high-rise]] towers. By contrast, many [[rural]] or sparsely inhabited areas lack any signal or have very weak [[fringe reception]]; many mobile phone providers are attempting to set up towers in those areas most likely to be occupied by users, such as along major [[highway]]s. Even some [[national park]]s and other popular [[tourism|tourist]] destinations away from urban areas now have cell phone reception, though location of [[radio tower]]s within these areas is normally prohibited or strictly regulated, and is often difficult to arrange.\n\nIn areas where signal reception would normally be strong, other factors can have an effect on reception or may cause complete failure (see [[RF interference]]). From inside a building with thick walls or of mostly [[sheet metal|metal]] construction (or with dense [[rebar]] in [[concrete]]), signal attenuation may prevent a mobile phone from being used. Underground areas, such as [[tunnel]]s and [[metro station|subway stations]], will lack reception unless they are wired for cell signals. There may also be gaps where the [[service contour]]s of the individual base stations (Cell towers) of the mobile provider (and/or its [[roaming]] partners) do not completely overlap.\n\nIn addition, the [[weather]] may affect the strength of a signal, due to the changes in [[radio propagation]] caused by [[cloud]]s (particularly tall and dense [[cumulonimbus|thunderclouds]] which cause [[signal reflection]]), [[precipitation]], and [[temperature inversion]]s. This phenomenon, which is also common in other [[VHF]] [[radio band]]s including [[FM broadcasting]], may also cause other anomalies, such as a person in [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] \"roaming\" on a [[Mexico|Mexican]] tower from just over [[U.S.-Mexico border|the border]] in [[Tijuana, Baja California|Tijuana]], or someone in [[Detroit]] \"roaming\" on a [[Canada|Canadian]] tower located [[line-of-sight propagation|within sight]] across the [[Detroit River]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]]. These events may cause the user to be billed for \"international\" usage despite being in their own country, though mobile phone companies can program their [[Telecommunications billing|billing]] systems to re-rate these as domestic usage when it occurs on a foreign cell site that is known to frequently cause such issues for their customers.\n\nThe volume of network traffic can also cause calls to be blocked or dropped due to a [[disaster]] or other [[mass call event]] which [[network congestion|overload]]s the number of available [[radio channel]]s in an area, or the number of [[telephone circuit]]s connecting to and from the general [[public switched telephone network]].\n\n== Dead zones ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\n\nAreas where [[mobile phone]]s cannot transmit to a nearby [[mobile Web|mobile site]], [[base station]], or [[repeater]] are known as '''dead zones'''.  In these areas, the mobile phone is said to be in a state of outage.  Dead zones are usually areas where mobile phone service is not available because the signal between the [[handset]] and mobile site [[antenna (radio)|antennas]] is blocked or severely [[attenuation|reduced]], usually by hilly [[terrain]], dense [[foliage]], or physical distance.\n\nA number of factors can create dead zones, which may exist even in locations in which a [[mobile network operator|wireless carrier]] offers coverage, due to limitations in [[cellular network]] architecture (the locations of antennas), limited network density, interference with other mobile sites, and topography.  Since cell phones rely on [[radio wave]]s, which travel through the air and are easily attenuated (particularly at higher frequencies), mobile phones may be unreliable at times.  Like other radio transmissions, mobile phone calls can be interrupted by large [[building]]s, terrain, trees, or other objects between the phone and the nearest base. Cellular network providers work continually to improve and upgrade their networks in order to minimize [[Mobile phone signal#Dropped calls|dropped calls]], access failures, and dead zones (which they call \"coverage holes\" or \"no-service areas\"). For [[mobile virtual network operator]]s, the network quality depends entirely on the host network for the particular handset in question. Some MVNOs use more than one host, which may even have different technologies (for example, different [[Tracfone]] handsets uses either [[code-division multiple access|CDMA]] and [[1xRTT]] on [[Verizon Wireless]], or [[GSM]] and [[UMTS]] on [[AT&T Mobility]]).\n\nDead zones can be filled-in with [[microcell]]s, while [[picocell]]s can handle even smaller areas without causing interference to the larger network.  Personal microcells, such as those for a [[home]], are called [[femtocell]]s, and generally have the [[broadcast range|range]] of a [[cordless phone]], but may not be usable for an MVNO phone.  A similar system can be set up to perform inmate call capture,<ref>https://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/docs/summits/Combating-Contraband-Cell-Phones-in-Prison-Handout-v4.pdf</ref> which prevents cellphones [[smuggling|smuggled]] into a [[prison]] from being used. These still complete calls to or from pre-authorized users such as prison staff, while not violating laws against [[Mobile phone jammer|jamming]]. These systems must be carefully designed so as to avoid capturing calls from outside the prison, which would in effect create a dead zone for any passersby outside.\n\nIn the event of a disaster causing temporary dead zones, a [[Mobile cell sites#Cell on wheels|cell on wheels]] may be brought in until the local telecom [[infrastructure]] can be restored.  These portable units are also used where large gatherings are expected, in order to handle the extra load.\n\n==Dropped calls==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nA '''dropped call''' is a common term used and expressed by [[wireless]] [[mobile phone]] [[telephone call|call]] subscribers when a call is abruptly cut-off (disconnected) during midconversation. This happens less often today than it would have in the early 1990s. The termination occurs unexpected and is influenced by a number of different reasons such as \"Dead Zones.\" In technical circles, it is called an '''abnormal release'''.\n\nOne reason for a call to be \"dropped\" is if the mobile phone subscriber travels outside the coverage area\u2014the [[cellular network]] radio tower(s).  After a telephone connection between two subscribers has been completed, it{{clarify|reason=no clear antecedent to 'it'|date=May 2018}}<!--What is 'it'? The connection? or one of the cell phones?? --> must remain within range of that subscribers<!--possessive?--> network provider or that connection will lost (dropped). Not all cellular telephone radio towers are owned by the same telephone company (though this is not true to all locations) <!--something is missing here--> be maintained across a different company's network (as calls cannot be re-routed over the traditional [[PSTN|phone network]] while in progress), also resulting in the termination of the call once a signal cannot be maintained between the phone and the original network.{{clarify|reason=that sentence needs to be taken out and shot|date=February 2017}}\n\nAnother common reason is when a phone is taken into an area where wireless communication is unavailable, interrupted, interfered with, or [[Mobile phone jammer|jammed]]. From the network's perspective, this is the same as the mobile moving out of the coverage area.\n\nOccasionally, calls are dropped upon [[handoff]] between cells within the same provider's network. This may be due to an imbalance of traffic between the two [[cell site]]s' areas of coverage. If the new cell site is at capacity, it cannot accept the additional traffic of the call trying to \"hand in.\" It may also be due to the network configuration not being set up properly, such that one cell site is not \"aware\" of the cell to which the phone is trying to handoff.  If the phone cannot find an alternative cell to which to move that can take over the call, the call is lost.\n\nCo-channel and [[adjacent-channel interference]] can also be responsible for dropped calls in a wireless network.  Neighbouring cells with the same frequencies interfere with each other, deteriorating the quality of service and producing dropped calls.  Transmission problems are also a common cause of dropped calls.  Another problem may be a faulty [[transceiver]] inside the base station.\n\nCalls can also be dropped if a mobile phone at the other end of the call loses [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power and stops transmitting abruptly.\n\n[[Sunspot]]s and [[solar flare]]s are rarely blamed for causing interference leading to dropped calls, as it would take a major [[geomagnetic storm]] to cause such a disruption (except for [[satellite phone]]s).\n\nExperiencing too many dropped calls is one of the most common customer complaints received by [[mobile network operator|wireless service providers]]. They have attempted to address the complaint in various ways, including expansion of their home network coverage, increased cell capacity, and offering refunds for individual dropped calls.\n\nVarious [[cellular repeater|signal booster]] systems are manufactured to reduce problems due to dropped calls and dead zones.  Many options, such as wireless units and antennas, are intended to aid in strengthening weak signals.\n\n==ASU==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nArbitrary Strength Unit ([[Mobile phone signal#ASU|ASU]]) is an [[integer]] value proportional to the received signal strength measured by the mobile phone.\n\nIt is possible to calculate the real signal strength measured in dBm (and thereby power in Watts) by a formula. However, there are different formulas for 2G, 3G and 4G networks.\n\nIn [[GSM]] networks, ASU maps to [[RSSI]] (received signal strength indicator, see TS 27.007<ref name=\"3GPP TS 27.007\">{{cite web|title=3GPP TS 27.007 version 8.5.0 Release 8|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/127000_127099/127007/08.05.00_60/ts_127007v080500p.pdf|website=etsi.org|publisher=ETSI|accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref> sub clause 8.5).\n:dBm = 2 \u00d7 ASU - 113,  ASU in the range of 0.31 and 99 (for not known or not detectable).\nIn [[UMTS]] networks, ASU maps to [[RSCP]] level (received signal code power, see TS 27.007<ref name=\"3GPP TS 27.007\" /> sub clause 8.69 and TS 25.133 sub clause 9.1.1.3).\n:dBm = ASU - 115,     ASU in the range of 0.90 and 255 (for not known or not detectable).\nIn [[LTE_(telecommunication)|LTE]] networks, ASU maps to [[RSRP]] (reference signal received power, see TS 36.133, sub-clause 9.1.4). The valid range of ASU is from 0 to 97. For the range 1 to 96, ASU maps to \n:(ASU - 143) < dBm \u2264 (ASU - 140).\nThe value of 0 maps to RSRP below -140 dBm and the value of 97 maps to RSRP above -44 dBm.\n\nOn Android devices however, the original GSM formula may prevail for UMTS.<ref name=\"lte-anbieter.inf0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lte-anbieter.info/technik/asu.php |title= ASU Wert - Signalst\u00e4rke messen und interpretieren |trans-title= ASU parameter - measure and interpret signal strength |language= German |format= |work= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}</ref> Tools like Network Signal Info<ref>{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.android.telnet |title=Network Signal Info - Android Apps on Google Play |format= |work= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}</ref> can directly show the signal strength (in dBm), as well as the underlying ASU.\n\nASU shouldn't be confused with \"Active Set Update\".

Some MVNOs use more than one host, which may even have different technologies (for example, different [[Tracfone]] handsets uses either [[code-division multiple access|CDMA]] and [[1xRTT]] on [[Verizon Wireless]], or [[GSM]] and [[UMTS]] on [[AT&T Mobility]]).\n\nDead zones can be filled-in with [[microcell]]s, while [[picocell]]s can handle even smaller areas without causing interference to the larger network.  Personal microcells, such as those for a [[home]], are called [[femtocell]]s, and generally have the [[broadcast range|range]] of a [[cordless phone]], but may not be usable for an MVNO phone.  A similar system can be set up to perform inmate call capture,<ref>https://transition.fcc.gov/pshs/docs/summits/Combating-Contraband-Cell-Phones-in-Prison-Handout-v4.pdf</ref> which prevents cellphones [[smuggling|smuggled]] into a [[prison]] from being used. These still complete calls to or from pre-authorized users such as prison staff, while not violating laws against [[Mobile phone jammer|jamming]]. These systems must be carefully designed so as to avoid capturing calls from outside the prison, which would in effect create a dead zone for any passersby outside.\n\nIn the event of a disaster causing temporary dead zones, a [[Mobile cell sites#Cell on wheels|cell on wheels]] may be brought in until the local telecom [[infrastructure]] can be restored.  These portable units are also used where large gatherings are expected, in order to handle the extra load.\n\n==Dropped calls==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nA '''dropped call''' is a common term used and expressed by [[wireless]] [[mobile phone]] [[telephone call|call]] subscribers when a call is abruptly cut-off (disconnected) during midconversation. This happens less often today than it would have in the early 1990s. The termination occurs unexpected and is influenced by a number of different reasons such as \"Dead Zones.\" In technical circles, it is called an '''abnormal release'''.\n\nOne reason for a call to be \"dropped\" is if the mobile phone subscriber travels outside the coverage area\u2014the [[cellular network]] radio tower(s).  After a telephone connection between two subscribers has been completed, it{{clarify|reason=no clear antecedent to 'it'|date=May 2018}}<!--What is 'it'? The connection? or one of the cell phones?? --> must remain within range of that subscribers<!--possessive?--> network provider or that connection will lost (dropped). Not all cellular telephone radio towers are owned by the same telephone company (though this is not true to all locations) <!--something is missing here--> be maintained across a different company's network (as calls cannot be re-routed over the traditional [[PSTN|phone network]] while in progress), also resulting in the termination of the call once a signal cannot be maintained between the phone and the original network.{{clarify|reason=that sentence needs to be taken out and shot|date=February 2017}}\n\nAnother common reason is when a phone is taken into an area where wireless communication is unavailable, interrupted, interfered with, or [[Mobile phone jammer|jammed]]. From the network's perspective, this is the same as the mobile moving out of the coverage area.\n\nOccasionally, calls are dropped upon [[handoff]] between cells within the same provider's network. This may be due to an imbalance of traffic between the two [[cell site]]s' areas of coverage. If the new cell site is at capacity, it cannot accept the additional traffic of the call trying to \"hand in.\" It may also be due to the network configuration not being set up properly, such that one cell site is not \"aware\" of the cell to which the phone is trying to handoff.  If the phone cannot find an alternative cell to which to move that can take over the call, the call is lost.\n\nCo-channel and [[adjacent-channel interference]] can also be responsible for dropped calls in a wireless network.  Neighbouring cells with the same frequencies interfere with each other, deteriorating the quality of service and producing dropped calls.  Transmission problems are also a common cause of dropped calls.  Another problem may be a faulty [[transceiver]] inside the base station.\n\nCalls can also be dropped if a mobile phone at the other end of the call loses [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power and stops transmitting abruptly.\n\n[[Sunspot]]s and [[solar flare]]s are rarely blamed for causing interference leading to dropped calls, as it would take a major [[geomagnetic storm]] to cause such a disruption (except for [[satellite phone]]s).\n\nExperiencing too many dropped calls is one of the most common customer complaints received by [[mobile network operator|wireless service providers]]. They have attempted to address the complaint in various ways, including expansion of their home network coverage, increased cell capacity, and offering refunds for individual dropped calls.\n\nVarious [[cellular repeater|signal booster]] systems are manufactured to reduce problems due to dropped calls and dead zones.  Many options, such as wireless units and antennas, are intended to aid in strengthening weak signals.\n\n==ASU==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nArbitrary Strength Unit ([[Mobile phone signal#ASU|ASU]]) is an [[integer]] value proportional to the received signal strength measured by the mobile phone.\n\nIt is possible to calculate the real signal strength measured in dBm (and thereby power in Watts) by a formula.

The valid range of ASU is from 0 to 97. For the range 1 to 96, ASU maps to \n:(ASU - 143) < dBm \u2264 (ASU - 140).\nThe value of 0 maps to RSRP below -140 dBm and the value of 97 maps to RSRP above -44 dBm.\n\nOn Android devices however, the original GSM formula may prevail for UMTS.<ref name=\"lte-anbieter.inf0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lte-anbieter.info/technik/asu.php |title= ASU Wert - Signalst\u00e4rke messen und interpretieren |trans-title= ASU parameter - measure and interpret signal strength |language= German |format= |work= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}</ref> Tools like Network Signal Info<ref>{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.android.telnet |title=Network Signal Info - Android Apps on Google Play |format= |work= |accessdate=2016-06-29}}</ref> can directly show the signal strength (in dBm), as well as the underlying ASU.\n\nASU shouldn't be confused with \"Active Set Update\".

The principal economic forces specific to Tobago are [[tourism]] and government spending. Conventional beach and water-sports tourism is largely in the southwest around the airport and the coastal strip. Meanwhile, [[ecotourism]] is growing in significance, much of it focused on the large area of protected forest in the centre and north of the main island and on [[Little Tobago]], a small island off the main island's northeast tip.\n\nThe southwestern tourist area around Crown Point, Store Bay, Buccoo Reef, and [[Pigeon Point, Tobago|Pigeon Point]] has large expanses of sand and is dominated by resort-type developments. Tobago has many idyllic beaches along its coastline, especially those at [[Castara]], Bloody Bay, and [[Englishman's Bay]]. Tobago is linked to the world through the [[Arthur Napoleon Raymond Robinson International Airport]] (formerly Crown Point Airport) and Scarborough harbour. Domestic flights connect Tobago with Trinidad, and international flights connect with the Caribbean and Europe. There is a daily fast ferry service between Port of Spain and Scarborough.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nTobago was thought by some to have been the island that inspired ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'',<ref>Rhead, Louis. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/08/12/102131943.pdf LETTER TO THE EDITOR: \"Tobago Robinson Crusoe's Island\"], ''The New York Times'', 5 August 1899.</ref><ref>[http://www.islandguide.biz/caribbean/tobago-robinson-crusoe.htm \"Robinson Crusoe and Tobago\"], ''Island Guide''</ref> but the book is probably based on some of the experiences of [[Alexander Selkirk]], who was marooned in the Pacific's [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]]. Adding to the confusion, Tobago was the filming location for the [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1959.\n\n===''Swiss Family Robinson''===\n{{also|Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)}}\nIn 1958, Tobago was chosen by the [[Walt Disney Company]] as the setting for a film based upon the [[Johann Wyss]] novel ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]''.  When producers saw the island for the first time, they \"fell instantly in love\".<ref name=\"TCM1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/203349%7C0/Swiss-Family-Robinson.html |last=Passafiume |first=Andrea |title=SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON (1960) |work=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate= 9 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Maltin|first=Leonard |year=1995 |title=The Disney Films : 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] |location=New York. |ref=harv |isbn=0-7868-8137-2 |page=176}}</ref> The script required animals, which were brought from all around the world, including eight dogs, two giant tortoises, 40 monkeys, two elephants, six ostriches, four zebras, 100 flamingos, six hyenas, two anacondas, and a tiger.<ref name=TCM1/>\n\nFilming locations include Richmond Bay (the Robinsons beach), Mount Irvine Bay (the Pirates beach), and the Craig Hall Waterfalls. The treehouse was constructed in a 200-foot tall saman in the Goldsborough Bay area. After filming, locals convinced Disney, who had intended to remove all evidence of filmmaking, to let the treehouse remain, sans interior furnishing. In 1960, the treehouse was listed for sale for $9,000, a fraction of its original cost, and became a popular attraction before the structure was destroyed by Hurricane Flora in 1963.<ref name=\"kkidney1\">{{cite web |url=http://miehana.blogspot.com/2010/03/some-really-really-big-roots.html  |title=Some Really, Really Big Roots |work=Kevin Kidney |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The tree still remains, however, and is located on the property of the Roberts Auto Service and Tyre Shop, located in Goldsborough, just off of Windward Road.

Trinidad, which is further south, has no significant coral because of low [[salinity]] and high silt content, the result of its position close to the mouth of [[Venezuela]]'s [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]]. [[Scuba diving]] on Tobago tends to be centred at [[Speyside, Trinidad and Tobago|Speyside]], almost diametrically across the island from the airport. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe island has some of the best diving sites in the Caribbean. There are three wrecks located around its shores, but the one usually considered the best is the ''Maverick Ferry'', which used to travel between Trinidad and Tobago. The ferry is {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=off}} long and has been sunk in {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} just off Rocky Point, Mt. Irvine. The top of the wreck is at {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The wreck has an abundance of marine life, including a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Epinephelus itajara|jewfish]], a member of the [[grouper]] family. The wreck was purposely sunk for divers, and so all the doors and windows were removed. The waters around the island are home to many species of tropical fish, [[Batoidea|rays]], sharks, and turtles.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/discover-tobago/2016/apr/15/tobagos-spectacular-dive-sites\n</ref>\n\n===Golf===\nTobago is home to two golf courses, both of which are open to visitors. The older of the two is Mount Irvine Hotel Golf Course, built in 1968. It was seen throughout the world after hosting the popular golf show \"Shell's Wonderful World of Golf\". The course is built amongst coconut palms and has a view of the Caribbean Sea from almost every hole. Formerly known as Tobago Plantations Golf Course, the recently renamed Magdalena Grand Hotel & Golf Club was opened in 2001 and has hosted the European Seniors Tour on three occasions. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n== Notable Tobagonians ==\n* [[Calypso Rose]], singer\n* [[Winston Duke]], actor\n* [[Renny Quow]], Olympic Sprinter\n* [[Kelly-Ann Baptiste ]] Olympic sprinter \n* [[Lalonde Gordon]], Olympic sprinter\n* [[Mighty Shadow]], singer\n* [[Keith Rowley]], politician\n* [[A.

Over the ensuing years, the Curonians ([[Duchy of Courland]]),  Dutch, English, French, Spanish and Swedish had caused Tobago to become a focal point in repeated attempts of colonisation, which led to the island having changed hands 33 times, the most in [[Caribbean]] history, before the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded it to the British in 1814. In 1662, the Dutch brothers [[Adrian Lampsins|Adrian]] and [[Cornelius Lampsins]] were granted the title of ''Barons of Tobago,'' and ruled until the English captured the island in 1666.

There is a daily fast ferry service between Port of Spain and Scarborough.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nTobago was thought by some to have been the island that inspired ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'',<ref>Rhead, Louis. [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/08/12/102131943.pdf LETTER TO THE EDITOR: \"Tobago Robinson Crusoe's Island\"], ''The New York Times'', 5 August 1899.</ref><ref>[http://www.islandguide.biz/caribbean/tobago-robinson-crusoe.htm \"Robinson Crusoe and Tobago\"], ''Island Guide''</ref> but the book is probably based on some of the experiences of [[Alexander Selkirk]], who was marooned in the Pacific's [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]]. Adding to the confusion, Tobago was the filming location for the [[Walt Disney]] movie ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' in 1959.\n\n===''Swiss Family Robinson''===\n{{also|Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)}}\nIn 1958, Tobago was chosen by the [[Walt Disney Company]] as the setting for a film based upon the [[Johann Wyss]] novel ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]''.  When producers saw the island for the first time, they \"fell instantly in love\".<ref name=\"TCM1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/203349%7C0/Swiss-Family-Robinson.html |last=Passafiume |first=Andrea |title=SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON (1960) |work=Turner Classic Movies |accessdate= 9 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Maltin|first=Leonard |year=1995 |title=The Disney Films : 3rd Edition |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] |location=New York. |ref=harv |isbn=0-7868-8137-2 |page=176}}</ref> The script required animals, which were brought from all around the world, including eight dogs, two giant tortoises, 40 monkeys, two elephants, six ostriches, four zebras, 100 flamingos, six hyenas, two anacondas, and a tiger.<ref name=TCM1/>\n\nFilming locations include Richmond Bay (the Robinsons beach), Mount Irvine Bay (the Pirates beach), and the Craig Hall Waterfalls. The treehouse was constructed in a 200-foot tall saman in the Goldsborough Bay area. After filming, locals convinced Disney, who had intended to remove all evidence of filmmaking, to let the treehouse remain, sans interior furnishing. In 1960, the treehouse was listed for sale for $9,000, a fraction of its original cost, and became a popular attraction before the structure was destroyed by Hurricane Flora in 1963.<ref name=\"kkidney1\">{{cite web |url=http://miehana.blogspot.com/2010/03/some-really-really-big-roots.html  |title=Some Really, Really Big Roots |work=Kevin Kidney |accessdate=6 January 2015}}</ref> The tree still remains, however, and is located on the property of the Roberts Auto Service and Tyre Shop, located in Goldsborough, just off of Windward Road. A local Tobago resident says, \"The tree has fallen into obscurity; only a few of the older people knew of its significance. As a matter of fact, not many people know of the film ''Swiss Family Robinson'', much less that it was filmed here in Tobago.\"<ref name=\"kkidney2\">{{cite web | url=http://miehana.blogspot.com/2010/10/swiss-family-tree-found.html |title=Swiss Family Tree Found |work=Kevin Kidney |accessdate=2015-01-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Diving ===\nTobago is also a popular diving location, since it is the southernmost of the Caribbean islands that have [[coral]] communities. Trinidad, which is further south, has no significant coral because of low [[salinity]] and high silt content, the result of its position close to the mouth of [[Venezuela]]'s [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]]. [[Scuba diving]] on Tobago tends to be centred at [[Speyside, Trinidad and Tobago|Speyside]], almost diametrically across the island from the airport. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe island has some of the best diving sites in the Caribbean. There are three wrecks located around its shores, but the one usually considered the best is the ''Maverick Ferry'', which used to travel between Trinidad and Tobago. The ferry is {{convert|350|ft|m|abbr=off}} long and has been sunk in {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off}} just off Rocky Point, Mt. Irvine. The top of the wreck is at {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The wreck has an abundance of marine life, including a {{convert|4|ft|m|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Epinephelus itajara|jewfish]], a member of the [[grouper]] family. The wreck was purposely sunk for divers, and so all the doors and windows were removed. The waters around the island are home to many species of tropical fish, [[Batoidea|rays]], sharks, and turtles.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/discover-tobago/2016/apr/15/tobagos-spectacular-dive-sites\n</ref>\n\n===Golf===\nTobago is home to two golf courses, both of which are open to visitors. The older of the two is Mount Irvine Hotel Golf Course, built in 1968. It was seen throughout the world after hosting the popular golf show \"Shell's Wonderful World of Golf\". The course is built amongst coconut palms and has a view of the Caribbean Sea from almost every hole. Formerly known as Tobago Plantations Golf Course, the recently renamed Magdalena Grand Hotel & Golf Club was opened in 2001 and has hosted the European Seniors Tour on three occasions. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n== Notable Tobagonians ==\n* [[Calypso Rose]], singer\n* [[Winston Duke]], actor\n* [[Renny Quow]], Olympic Sprinter\n* [[Kelly-Ann Baptiste ]] Olympic sprinter \n* [[Lalonde Gordon]], Olympic sprinter\n* [[Mighty Shadow]], singer\n* [[Keith Rowley]], politician\n* [[A.
