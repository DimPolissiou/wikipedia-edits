It was released in April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] as the lead [[Single (music)|single]] of his fifth studio album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded the song with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. A late addition to the album, it was included at the insistence of [[RCA Records|RCA]]'s Dennis Katz, who heard a demo and loved the track, believing it would make a great single. It replaced the [[Chuck Berry]] cover \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\" on the album.\n\n==Overview==\n\"Starman\" was written as a direct response to the head of RCA Dennis Katz's request for a single. Author Kevin Cann writes that the title may allude to [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1953 novel ''[[Starman Jones]]'' while Chris O'Leary attributes David Rome's 1965 short story ''There's a Starman in Ward 7''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=461}} The song was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Suffragette City]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Doggett writes that it's similar to his earlier hit \"[[Space Oddity]]\" in that it's a \"space-age novelty hit\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} The song begins on twelve-string acoustic guitar\u2014a \"subdominant\" chord followed by \"the major 7th of the root\" according to author [[Peter Doggett]]\u2014that is played across both channels. There are strums of a six-string electric guitar at certain points until the verse begins, then both guitars merge into one channel.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} The song features a [[String instrument|string]] arrangement from Ronson, which Pegg describes as being more similar to the style of Bowie's previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971) than the rest of ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=461}}\n\nThe lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]],{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} to an accurate prediction of the plot for the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}} Similar to fellow album track \n\"[[Moonage Daydream]]\", Bowie uses American slang, including \"boogie\", \"Hey, that's far out\", \"Don't tell your papa\", and \"Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll\", which, according to Pegg, \"vie with an intensely British sensibility to create a bizarre and beautiful hybrid.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=461}}\n\nAccording to Bowie himself, speaking to [[William S. Burroughs]] for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973:<ref name=\"Burroughs interview RS\">{{cite web |last1=Copetas |first1=Craig |title=Beat Godfather Meets Glitter Mainman: William Burroughs Interviews David Bowie |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-william-burroughs-interviews-david-bowie-92508/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=19 April 2020 |date=28 February 1974}}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|\"Ziggy is advised in a dream by the infinites to write the coming of a starman, so he writes \"Starman\", which is the first news of hope that the people have heard.

Ziggy has been talking about this amazing spaceman who will be coming down to save the earth. They arrive somewhere in [[Greenwich Village]]. They don\u2019t have a care in the world and are of no possible use to us. They just happened to stumble into our universe by black-hole jumping. Their whole life is traveling from universe to universe. In the stage show, one of them resembles [[Marlon Brando|Brando]], another one is a black New Yorker. I even have one called Queenie the Infinite Fox.\"}}\n\nThe chorus is loosely based on \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', alluding to the \"Starman\"'s extraterrestrial origins (over the rainbow) (the octave leap on (\"Star-''man''\") is identical to that of [[Judy Garland]]'s (\"some-''where''\") in \"Over the Rainbow\").{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} Doggett states that whereas \"Over the Rainbow\" \"used its cathartic rise to introduce a refrain that was emotionally, and melodically, expansive\", the leap in \"Starman\" \"was followed by a more uncertain melody, reflecting his character's innate lack of confidence.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} Other influences cited for the track are the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] songs \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\" (the \"boogie\" references and \"la la la\" chorus) and [[the Supremes]]' \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" (the [[morse code]]-esque guitar and piano breaks).{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=462}}\n\n==Release==\n\"Starman\" was released as the lead single of the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199) with \"[[Suffragette City]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> According to Cann, the single was released in the US on 20 May with a slightly different mix than the UK single: Bowie's spoken intro is edited out and \"to comply with the preferred duration among American radio stations,\" was shortened by ten seconds.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=249}} It subsequently appeared as the fourth track on the album, between \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", released on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> It was a late addition to the album, replacing a cover of American singer-songwriter [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} According to Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', \"Round and Round\" would have fit the concept of the album but it was excessive, as side two featured multiple Berry-style tracks.<ref name=\"Sheffield RS\">{{cite web |last1=Sheffield |first1=Rob |title=How David Bowie Became the 'Starman' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-became-the-starman-87301/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=18 April 2020 |date=6 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627215734/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-became-the-starman-87301/ |archive-date=27 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> From a commercial point of view, \"Starman\" was a milestone in Bowie's career, his first hit since 1969's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" three years before. ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] reported that \"many thought it was his first ''record'' since 'Space Oddity'\", and assumed that it was a sequel to the earlier single.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=8}}\n\nThe single initially sold steadily rather than spectacularly but earned many positive reviews. BBC broadcaster [[John Peel]], in his ''Disc & Music Echo'' column wrote: \"Now this is magnificent \u2013 quite superb. \"David Bowie is, with [[Kevin Ayers]], the most important, under-acknowledged innovator in contemporary popular music in Britain and if this record is overlooked it will be nothing less than stark tragedy.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=460\u2013461}} [[Chris Welch]] of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' predicted: \"[Bowie] is taking longer than most to become a superstar, but he should catch up with Rod and [[Marc Bolan|Marc]] soon.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=247}} On 15 June, Bowie and the Spiders from Mars performed \"Starman\" on the [[ITV Granada|Granada]] children's music programme ''[[Lift Off with Ayshea]]'', which was presented by [[Ayshea|Ayshea Brough]], whom Bowie had met as a performer in 1969. Joined by [[Nicky Graham]] on keyboards, according to Pegg, they performed against a \"backdrop of coloured stars\"; Woodmansey had at this point not \"peroxided\" his hair.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=461}} The performance was broadcast on 21 June in a \"post-school\" time slot, where it was witnessed by thousands of British children.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=256}} By 1 July, \"Starman\" rose to number 41 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], earning Bowie an invitation to perform on the BBC television programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=258}}\n\n===''Top of the Pops'' performance===\nOn 5 July 1972, Bowie, the Spiders and Graham appeared on ''Top of the Pops'' and performed \"Starman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=460}} The group played to a pre-recorded backing track, four takes of which were recorded on 29 June, and sang live as per Musicians Union rules.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=257}} Bowie appeared in a brightly-colored rainbow jumpsuit, \"shocking\" red hair and astronaut boots while the Spiders wore blue, pink, scarlet and gold velvet attire.<ref name=\"Sheffield RS\" />{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=258}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=460}} During the performance, Bowie was relaxed and confident and wrapped his arm around Ronson's shoulder, revealing his white-coloured fingernails and, in Cann's words, \"driving home the ambiguous glamour of the Ziggy persona.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=258}} He altered the line \"Some cat was laying down some rock 'n' roll\" to \"Some cat was laying down some get-it-on rock 'n' roll\" as a tribute to Marc Bolan.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=192}} Upon singing the line \"I had to phone someone so I picked on you ooh ooh\", Bowie pointed at the camera, engaging the audience directly, which one fan recalled, \"It was as if Bowie actually singled me out...a chosen one...it was almost a religious experience.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=126}}<ref name=\"Hepworth Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Hepworth |first1=David |title=How performing Starman on Top of the Pops sent Bowie into the stratosphere |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/15/david-bowie-starman-top-of-the-pops |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=19 April 2020 |date=15 January 2016}}</ref> Transmitted the following day,<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/art-rock/bowie-performs-starman-on-top-of-the-pops/ |website=Seven Ages of Rock |title=Bowie performs 'Starman' on 'Top of the Pops' |date=5 July 1972 |publisher=[[BBC]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321010546/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/art-rock/bowie-performs-starman-on-top-of-the-pops/ |archivedate=21 March 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> the three minute performance launched Bowie to stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=460}} David Hepworth of ''[[The Guardian]]'' calls the moment he points to the camera the exact moment in which he became a star.<ref name=\"Hepworth Guardian\" /> According to author David Buckley, \"Many fans date their conversion to all things Bowie to this ''Top of the Pops'' appearance\".{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} It embedded Ziggy Stardust in the nation's consciousness, helping push \"Starman\" to number 10 and the album, released the previous month, to number five.

It was released in April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] as the lead [[Single (music)|single]] of his fifth studio album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded the song with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. A late addition to the album, it was included at the insistence of [[RCA Records|RCA]]'s Dennis Katz, who heard a demo and loved the track, believing it would make a great single. It replaced the [[Chuck Berry]] cover \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\" on the album.\n\n==Overview==\n\"Starman\" was written as a direct response to the head of RCA Dennis Katz's request for a single. Author Kevin Cann writes that the title may allude to [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1953 novel ''[[Starman Jones]]'' while Chris O'Leary attributes David Rome's 1965 short story ''There's a Starman in Ward 7''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=461}} The song was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Suffragette City]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Doggett writes that it's similar to \"[[Space Oddity]]\" in that it's a \"space-age novelty hit\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} The song begins on twelve-string acoustic guitar\u2014a \"subdominant\" chord followed by \"the major 7th of the root\" according to author [[Peter Doggett]]\u2014that is played across both channels. There are strums of a six-string electric guitar at certain points until the verse begins, then both guitars merge into one channel.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} The song features a [[String instrument|string]] arrangement from Ronson, which Pegg describes as being more similar to the style of Bowie's previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971) than the rest of ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=461}}\n\nThe lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]],{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} to an accurate prediction of the plot for the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}} Similar to fellow album track \n\"[[Moonage Daydream]]\", Bowie uses American slang, including \"boogie\", \"Hey, that's far out\", \"Don't tell your papa\", and \"Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll\", which, according to Pegg, \"vie with an intensely British sensibility to create a bizarre and beautiful hybrid.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=461}}\n\nAccording to Bowie himself, speaking to [[William S. Burroughs]] for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973:<ref name=\"Burroughs interview RS\">{{cite web |last1=Copetas |first1=Craig |title=Beat Godfather Meets Glitter Mainman: William Burroughs Interviews David Bowie |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-william-burroughs-interviews-david-bowie-92508/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=19 April 2020 |date=28 February 1974}}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|\"Ziggy is advised in a dream by the infinites to write the coming of a starman, so he writes \"Starman\", which is the first news of hope that the people have heard.

Ziggy has been talking about this amazing spaceman who will be coming down to save the earth. They arrive somewhere in [[Greenwich Village]]. They don\u2019t have a care in the world and are of no possible use to us. They just happened to stumble into our universe by black-hole jumping. Their whole life is traveling from universe to universe. In the stage show, one of them resembles [[Marlon Brando|Brando]], another one is a black New Yorker. I even have one called Queenie the Infinite Fox.\"}}\n\nThe chorus is loosely based on \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', alluding to the \"Starman\"'s extraterrestrial origins (over the rainbow) (the octave leap on (\"Star-''man''\") is identical to that of [[Judy Garland]]'s (\"some-''where''\") in \"Over the Rainbow\").{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} Doggett states that whereas \"Over the Rainbow\" \"used its cathartic rise to introduce a refrain that was emotionally, and melodically, expansive\", the leap in \"Starman\" \"was followed by a more uncertain melody, reflecting his character's innate lack of confidence.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} Other influences cited for the track are the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] songs \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\" (the \"boogie\" references and \"la la la\" chorus) and [[the Supremes]]' \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" (the [[morse code]]-esque guitar and piano breaks).{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=462}}\n\n==Release==\n\"Starman\" was released as the lead single of the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199) with \"[[Suffragette City]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> According to Cann, the single was released in the US on 20 May with a slightly different mix than the UK single: Bowie's spoken intro is edited out and \"to comply with the preferred duration among American radio stations,\" was shortened by ten seconds.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=249}} It subsequently appeared as the fourth track on the album, between \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", released on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> It was a late addition to the album, replacing a cover of American singer-songwriter [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} According to Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', \"Round and Round\" would have fit the concept of the album but it was excessive, as side two featured multiple Berry-style tracks.<ref name=\"Sheffield RS\">{{cite web |last1=Sheffield |first1=Rob |title=How David Bowie Became the 'Starman' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-became-the-starman-87301/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=18 April 2020 |date=6 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627215734/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-became-the-starman-87301/ |archive-date=27 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> From a commercial point of view, \"Starman\" was a milestone in Bowie's career, his first hit since 1969's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" three years before. ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] reported that \"many thought it was his first ''record'' since 'Space Oddity'\", and assumed that it was a sequel to the earlier single.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=8}}\n\nThe single initially sold steadily rather than spectacularly but earned many positive reviews.

''Acromyrmex'' and ''Atta'' exhibit a high degree of [[polymorphism (biology)|biological polymorphism]], four castes being present in established colonies\u2014minims, minors, mediae, and majors.  Majors are also known as soldiers or dinergates.  ''Atta'' ants are more polymorphic than ''Acromyrmex'', meaning comparatively less difference occurs in size from the smallest to largest types of ''Acromymex''.\n\n[[Image:leaf cutter ants arp.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Leafcutter ant ''[[Atta cephalotes]]'']]\n* Minims are the smallest workers, and tend to the growing brood or care for the fungus gardens.  Head width is less than 1&nbsp;mm.\n* Minors are slightly larger than minima workers, and are present in large numbers in and around foraging columns. These ants are the first line of defense and continuously patrol the surrounding terrain and vigorously attack any enemies that threaten the foraging lines. Head width is around 1.8\u20132.2&nbsp;mm.\n* Mediae are the generalized foragers, which cut leaves and bring the leaf fragments back to the nest.\n* Majors, the largest worker ants, act as soldiers, defending the nest from intruders, although recent evidence indicates majors participate in other activities, such as clearing the main foraging trails of large debris and carrying bulky items back to the nest. The largest soldiers (''[[Atta laevigata]]'') may have  total body lengths up to 16&nbsp;mm and head widths of 7&nbsp;mm.\n\n== Ant-fungus mutualism ==\nTheir societies are based on an [[ant-fungus mutualism]], and different species of ants use different species of fungus, but all of the fungi the ants use are members of the family [[Lepiotaceae]].  The ants actively cultivate their fungus, feeding it with freshly cut plant material and keeping it free from [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]s.  This [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship is further augmented by another [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] partner, a bacterium that grows on the ants and secretes chemicals; essentially, the ants use portable [[antimicrobial]]s.  Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it.  The only two other groups of insects to use fungus-based agriculture are [[ambrosia beetles]] and [[termites]]. The fungus cultivated by the adults is used to feed the ant larvae, and the adult ants feed on leaf sap. The fungus needs the ants to stay alive, and the larvae need the fungus to stay alive, so the mutualism is obligatory.\n\nThe fungi used by the higher attine ants no longer produce spores. These ants fully domesticated their fungal partner 15 million years ago, a process that took 30 million years to complete.<ref>[http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/crop-domestication-balancing-act Crop Domestication Is a Balancing Act]</ref> Their fungi produce nutritious and swollen [[hypha]]l tips ([[gongylidia]]) that grow in bundles called staphylae, to specifically feed the ants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/science/for-leaf-cutter-ants-farm-life-isn-t-so-simple.html?pagewanted=all For Leaf-Cutter Ants, Farm Life Isn't So Simple]</ref>\n\n=== Waste management ===\n[[File:Atta colombica workers cutting whole plant.jpg|180px|thumb|Workers of ''Atta colombica'' at work]]\n[[File:Leafcutterant-osa.jpg|thumb|180px|Leafcutter ant in Costa Rica]]\nLeafcutter ants have very specific roles in taking care of the fungal garden and dumping the refuse. Waste management is a key role for each colony's longevity. The necrotrophic parasitic fungus ''[[Escovopsis]]'' threatens the ants' food source and thus is a constant danger to the ants. The waste transporters and waste-heap workers are the older, more dispensable leafcutter ants, ensuring the healthier and younger ants can work on the fungal garden. The ''[[Atta colombica]]'' species, unusually for the Attine tribe, have an external waste heap. Waste transporters take the waste, which consists of used substrate and discarded fungus, to the waste heap. Once dropped off at the refuse dump, the heap workers organise the waste and constantly shuffle it around to aid decomposition. A compelling observation of ''A. colombica'' was the dead ants placed around the perimeter of the waste heap.<ref>{{Citation |last=Hart |first=A. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Ratnieks |first2=F. L.

''Atta'' ants are more polymorphic than ''Acromyrmex'', meaning comparatively less difference occurs in size from the smallest to largest types of ''Acromymex''.\n\n[[Image:leaf cutter ants arp.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Leafcutter ant ''[[Atta cephalotes]]'']]\n* Minims are the smallest workers, and tend to the growing brood or care for the fungus gardens.  Head width is less than 1&nbsp;mm.\n* Minors are slightly larger than minima workers, and are present in large numbers in and around foraging columns. These ants are the first line of defense and continuously patrol the surrounding terrain and vigorously attack any enemies that threaten the foraging lines. Head width is around 1.8\u20132.2&nbsp;mm.\n* Mediae are the generalized foragers, which cut leaves and bring the leaf fragments back to the nest.\n* Majors, the largest worker ants, act as soldiers, defending the nest from intruders, although recent evidence indicates majors participate in other activities, such as clearing the main foraging trails of large debris and carrying bulky items back to the nest. The largest soldiers (''[[Atta laevigata]]'') may have  total body lengths up to 16&nbsp;mm and head widths of 7&nbsp;mm.\n\n== Ant-fungus mutualism ==\nTheir societies are based on an [[ant-fungus mutualism]], and different species of ants use different species of fungus, but all of the fungi the ants use are members of the family [[Lepiotaceae]].  The ants actively cultivate their fungus, feeding it with freshly cut plant material and keeping it free from [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[mold]]s.  This [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship is further augmented by another [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] partner, a bacterium that grows on the ants and secretes chemicals; essentially, the ants use portable [[antimicrobial]]s.  Leaf cutter ants are sensitive enough to adapt to the fungi's reaction to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it.  The only two other groups of insects to use fungus-based agriculture are [[ambrosia beetles]] and [[termites]]. The fungus cultivated by the adults is used to feed the ant larvae, and the adult ants feed on leaf sap. The fungus needs the ants to stay alive, and the larvae need the fungus to stay alive, so the mutualism is obligatory.\n\nThe fungi used by the higher attine ants no longer produce spores. These ants fully domesticated their fungal partner 15 million years ago, a process that took 30 million years to complete.<ref>[http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/crop-domestication-balancing-act Crop Domestication Is a Balancing Act]</ref> Their fungi produce nutritious and swollen [[hypha]]l tips ([[gongylidia]]) that grow in bundles called staphylae, to specifically feed the ants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/03/science/for-leaf-cutter-ants-farm-life-isn-t-so-simple.html?pagewanted=all For Leaf-Cutter Ants, Farm Life Isn't So Simple]</ref>\n\n=== Waste management ===\n[[File:Atta colombica workers cutting whole plant.jpg|180px|thumb|Workers of ''Atta colombica'' at work]]\n[[File:Leafcutterant-osa.jpg|thumb|180px|Leafcutter ant in Costa Rica]]\nLeafcutter ants have very specific roles in taking care of the fungal garden and dumping the refuse. Waste management is a key role for each colony's longevity. The necrotrophic parasitic fungus ''[[Escovopsis]]'' threatens the ants' food source and thus is a constant danger to the ants. The waste transporters and waste-heap workers are the older, more dispensable leafcutter ants, ensuring the healthier and younger ants can work on the fungal garden. The ''[[Atta colombica]]'' species, unusually for the Attine tribe, have an external waste heap. Waste transporters take the waste, which consists of used substrate and discarded fungus, to the waste heap. Once dropped off at the refuse dump, the heap workers organise the waste and constantly shuffle it around to aid decomposition. A compelling observation of ''A. colombica'' was the dead ants placed around the perimeter of the waste heap.<ref>{{Citation |last=Hart |first=A. G. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Ratnieks |first2=F. L.

This mutualistic micro-organism lives in the metapleural glands of the ant.<ref>{{Citation |last=Zhang |first=M. M. |last2=Poulsen |first2=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last3=Currie |first3=C.

Often, a minim will sit on a worker ant and ward off any attack.<ref>{{Citation |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516000857/https://www.lpzoo.org/articles/features/Leafcutter_Ants/index.html |work=Lincoln Park Zoo |title=Leafcutter Ants }}.</ref>\n\nAlso, the wrong type of fungus can grow during cultivation. ''Escovopsis'', a highly virulent fungus, has the potential to devastate an ant garden, as it is horizontally transmitted. ''Escovopsis'' was cultured, during colony foundation, in 6.6% of colonies.<ref>{{Citation |last=Currie |first=C. R. |last2=Mueller |first2=U.

The band was formed in 1993 by ex-[[Ceremonial Oath]] guitarist [[Oscar Dronjak]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early days (1993\u20131996) ===\nHammerFall was formed when rhythm guitarist [[Oscar Dronjak]] quit [[Ceremonial Oath]] and invited [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] (from [[Ceremonial Oath]] and [[In Flames]]) to join him as a drummer in a new musical project he had been contemplating for some time. Dronjak had already composed the song \"Steel Meets Steel,\" which was later included on HammerFall's debut album. Dronjak and Str\u00f6mblad were later joined by lead guitarist [[Niklas Sundin]], bassist [[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]], and vocalist [[Mikael Stanne]]. When Niklas Sundin and Johan Larsson left HammerFall the following year, [[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]] (then guitarist of [[In Flames]]) and Fredrik Larsson (bassist of the former Swedish [[death metal]] band [[Dispatched]]), replaced them.\n\n[[File:Masters of Rock 2007 - Hammerfall - Joacim Cans - 01.jpg|left|thumb|165px|Joacim Cans joined the band in 1996]]\nAll five members played in other bands at the time. Dronjak and Larsson played in ''Crystal Age''; Str\u00f6mblad and Ljungstr\u00f6m played in [[In Flames]] and Stanne sang for [[Dark Tranquillity]]. Both of these bands influenced Swedish [[melodic death metal]]. HammerFall was relegated to being a side project of them all for several years. Their concerts were limited mostly to a local music contest named ''Rockslaget''. The band had few songs of their own and played mostly covers from bands such as [[Pretty Maids]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Alice Cooper]].\n\nIn 1996, HammerFall reached the semi-finals of ''Rockslaget''. When Mikael Stanne could not perform with the band in the semi-finals, they found [[Joacim Cans]], who agreed to play with them for the night. The concert was a success although the judges disqualified HammerFall for the finals. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.\n\n===''Glory to the Brave'' and ''Legacy of Kings'' (1997\u20131999)===\nTo give more exposure to their work and try for a professional recording deal, a short live performance was recorded and sent to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] label, Vic Records.[http://www.vicrecords.com/] The musicians soon received a deal and spent the whole of the following year writing the album ''[[Glory to the Brave]]''. The album was initially released in the Netherlands and obtained positive feedback; it is also worthy of notice that the band's [[mascot]], the [[Paladin (character class)|paladin]] Hector, first appeared on the cover of this album.\n\nAs HammerFall grew in popularity, the time available for members of the band to dedicate to other projects became limited. Dronjak and Cans wanted to pursue the path of Hammerfall (Dronjak's Crystal Age had ceased to exist some time ago), but Str\u00f6mblad and Ljungstr\u00f6m were committed to In Flames and Larsson was committed to the [[thrash metal]] band ''None''. Thus, HammerFall's line-up soon underwent changes. [[Stefan Elmgren]] assumed the lead guitar and Patrik R\u00e4fling assumed the drums (they joined the band in the end of 1997 after the release of ''Glory to the Brave'' album) and Larsson decided to remain in the band until a suitable replacement for him was found. This happened in May 1997, when bassist [[Magnus Ros\u00e9n]] joined the band. Stefan Elmgren played some of the guitars on the ''Glory to the Brave'' album (such as the acoustic guitars on \"I Believe\") and Patrik R\u00e4fling actually played the drums on all songs in place of Jesper. However, at the time they were considered as guest performers, not members of the band.\n\n[[File:Jesper Stromblad, IN FLAMES, 2008.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Jesper Str\u00f6mblad left the band in 1997]]\nIn early 1997, German label [[Nuclear Blast]] approached HammerFall with a contract for a European release deal, which included four albums. The deal was accepted and the band proceeded to record their first two [[music video]]s &mdash; \"HammerFall\" and \"Glory to the Brave\". After the release of a promotional single, ''Glory to the Brave'' was released throughout Europe. The results were quite unexpected, even after the intense marketing campaign made by Nuclear Blast. The album reached position number 38 on the German Music Chart on the week of its release, something which had never before been achieved by a debut [[heavy metal music]] album.\n\nSiding with bands [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Jag Panzer]], [[Lake of Tears]] and [[Raven (band)|Raven]], several tours through the European continent ensued. The concert on [[Wacken Open Air]] was performed to a crowd of over ten thousand people.\n\nTowards the end of 1997, ''Glory to the Brave'' was released in Japan and the United States. Sales of the album reached one hundred thousand copies. HammerFall was also nominated for the Swedish [[Grammy]] award in the ''Best Hard Rock act'' category.\n\nIn February 1998 they did a small club tour (5 gigs) in Belgium and the Netherlands. Support was the Belgian band [[Double Diamond (band)|Double Diamond]], who later became [[Fireforce]]\n\nIn February 1998, the recording of ''[[Legacy of Kings]]'' began. This album was once more written by Joacim, Oscar, and Jesper, who despite having quit the band still took part in the process in order to keep the same general mood of their first release. The album was produced by [[Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m]] (from [[Dream Evil]]) and Oscar, with the help of Joacim. The band spent a total of one and a half months in the studio recording this album.\n\nHammerFall made some expressive concerts before the release of ''Legacy of Kings'', playing in festivals together with bands such as [[Alice Cooper]], [[Rammstein]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Dream Theater]], [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] and [[Stratovarius]].\n\nTheir first world tour took place in October 1998. During the shows in Sweden, Joacim Cans caught a serious throat infection which made it impossible for him to sing. Shortly afterwards, Magnus Ros\u00e9n was afflicted with the same disease, and after him the whole of HammerFall's support crew became sick. The members of the band played for as long as possible and then were forced to postpone or cancel a few dates. During their passage through South America, HammerFall took a short break to visit the [[Brazil]]ian beaches, but they soon resumed their tour.\n\nBy the end of that tour, drummer Patrik R\u00e4fling left the band, and [[Anders Johansson (drummer)|Anders Johansson]], a friend of Magnus Ros\u00e9n, joined as a touring musician. In the beginning of 1999 he was made a permanent member of the band. Anders had previously worked with guitarist [[Yngwie J. Malmsteen|Yngwie Malmsteen]] on [[Rising Force]] in the 80's and 90's and on a number of other projects; he is the brother of [[Jens Johansson]] from [[Stratovarius]]. He has been praised for his technical and polyrhythmical talent, in metal as well as other genres.{{Relevance inline|date=May 2014|reason=So what? Technical and polyrhythmical drumming aren't exactly what HammerFall is famous for. This belongs rather in his own article.}}\n\n===''Renegade'' and ''Crimson Thunder'' (2000\u20132003)===\nAfter a long series of concerts, the band returned to Sweden in order to spend time with their families and begin writing songs for their next album. HammerFall made arrangements for this album to be recorded by Michael Wagener,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelwagener.com/ |title=Michael Wagener.com |publisher=Michael Wagener.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> who had previously produced bands such as [[Accept (band)|Accept]], [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. The recording took eight weeks, and the album was entitled ''[[Renegade (HammerFall album)|Renegade]]''. The switch from producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m to Wagener was met with skepticism from the media in general. However, after the release, critics were mostly positive, even though there was a consensus that the band's sound was remarkably different. A music video by director Roger Johansson was created for the song \"Renegade\" and reached the top of the Swedish parade; the same soon happened with the album itself, which reached gold status with over forty thousand copies sold.\n[[File:Anders Johansson 4.jpg|thumb|Anders Johansson]]\nOscar stated on www.metalrules.com just prior to the release of 'Renegade' that they were going for a more \"commercial\" sound in order to attract a broader audience that otherwise would have been lost to them and that future albums wouldn't follow in this mold.\n\nThe band's second world tour began in January 2001. Concerts from this tour counted with a replica version of the album's cover on stage. It was set up as a [[castle]] in ruins from which the musicians entered the stage. In total, the tour included almost sixty shows.\n\nThe band then released a [[DVD]] entitled ''[[The Templar Renegade Crusades]]'', which included video footage from recording sessions, live concerts, tour backstages, and encounters with fans. The footage ranged from the recording sessions of ''Legacy of Kings'' to the gold album party which took place in November 2001.\n\nHammerFall then proceeded to record their fourth album &mdash; ''[[Crimson Thunder]]''. Arrangements were made for recording sessions to take place in both ''JM Studios'': from [[Charlie Bauerfeind]], in ''[[Wisseloord Studios]]'' &mdash; in the Netherlands, and studio ''Blind Guardian'' &mdash; in Germany, for the bass.\n\nBy the end of the recording sessions in 2002, a listening session for the press was held. Overall, the reactions were quite positive, and most seemed to perceive the album as a change for the better from ''Renegade''. A single for the song \"Hearts on Fire\" was released six weeks prior to the album's launch and remained for weeks on the number one spot on the parades of some European countries. The song also attracted a number of new fans to the band due to its [[refrain|chorus]]-driven melody and simple riffs coupled with fast guitar solos.\n\nThe shooting of the music video  \"Hearts on Fire\" by director Roger Johansson was scheduled for August of that year. The band's plans, however, had to be held back for a week due to an incident that occurred one night. While Joacim was drinking with his girlfriend in a rock club he had been frequenting for over a decade, he was attacked by an unidentified person who hit him in the head with a beer glass and hastily escaped. Joacim instantly lost consciousness and had to be taken to a hospital, in which he underwent [[plastic surgery]] and rested for a couple of days. As soon as it became medically possible, he joined the band to record the music video.\n\nIn order to promote the release of the band's album in North America, they toured with [[Dio (band)|Dio]] during November and December 2002. Subsequently, the manager of the band disappeared, taking the entirety of the tour's revenue with him. Despite this the tour was very successful, and proceeded to Europe. Changes were made to the band's stage setting, and many investments were made on [[fireworks]] and on the presence of the mascot Hector on stage. The scenery on the cover of the single ''Hearts on Fire'' was also reproduced and added to the performances. The tour progressed to Japan and then to South America. HammerFall was present on festivals in Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic, playing with bands such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Slayer]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[U.D.O.]] and [[Stratovarius]].\n\nHammerFall's tour was brought to a sudden end when Oscar Dronjak suffered a [[motorcycle]] accident, breaking his left arm and sustaining several minor injuries.\n\nThey were then left with no choice but to take a break. Stefan dedicated himself to getting a [[aviator|pilot]] license, Magnus and Anders continued working on their side projects and Joacim began work on his solo album and had his first child. Oscar simply focused on recovering. Together with a group of specialists, he was able to recover to his full capacities. He then joined Anders, Joacim, Stefan again, with bands [[Helloween]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] and [[Pretty Maids]], amongst others, and played in the celebration of the 20 years of the German rock club ''Rockfabrik''.\n\n===''Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken'' and ''Threshold'' (2005\u20132008)===\nThe live album and DVD ''One Crimson Night'' was released in February 2003. After two years of hiatus the band released ''[[Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken]]'', which was followed by a European and South American tour. A video for the song \"Bloodbound\" was made by director Roger Johansson.\n\nOn October 16 it was reported that HammerFall (along with the band [[Europe (band)|Europe]]) would be part of the Eurovision song contest.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6536 |title=Eurovision Song Contest - Dusseldorf 2011 &#124; News - Melodifestivalen going Heavy Metal? |publisher=Esctoday.com |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> This rumor was refuted by lead singer Joacim Cans only a couple weeks later.

The reason for his departure stated that he was unhappy in the band and wants to focus on other projects. On his own website (and therefore with his own official statement) it was announced that Magnus was tired of the simple bassplaying he was forced to play in HammerFall, and that he was unable to bring his own material to the band. He now wants to \"be more creative in his career\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magnusrosen.net/news/view.asp?id=50 |title=De beste bron van informatie over magnusrosen.

These are \"Last Man Standing\", \"Restless Soul\", and \"The Abyss\". They also rerecorded the Glory To The Brave track \"HammerFall\". \"[[Steel Meets Steel - Ten Years of Glory]]\" was released on 12 October 2007.\n\nOn April 2, 2008 [[Stefan Elmgren]] announced his decision to leave HammerFall in order to pursue a career as a commercial pilot.  His replacement is [[Pontus Norgren]] from [[The Poodles]]. On June 27, 2008, the band released the compilation album \"[[Masterpieces (HammerFall album)|Masterpieces]]\". The album has on it a collection of every song the band has covered, plus three new cover songs previously unreleased. This was [[Stefan Elmgren]]'s last release with the band.\n\n===''No Sacrifice, No Victory'' and ''Infected'' (2009\u20132012)===\n\nHammerFall's album ''[[No Sacrifice, No Victory]]'' was released in February 2009. This album features a cover song [[My Sharona]]. The Album peaked at No.&nbsp;38 on the Billboard heatseakers charts.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=hammerfall|chart=all}} No Sacrifice, No Victory - HammerFall (2009)]</ref>\nA music video for the song \"Any Means Necessary\" was released some time before the actual release of the album.  To kick off their new album, HammerFall toured all over the world with several support bands, such as fellow Swedish band [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]]. In the summer 2010 the band played a couple of high-profile festivals throughout Europe, including [[Sonisphere Festival]], [[High Voltage Festival]], [[Metalcamp]], [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and many more. The summer tour was named \"Any Festival Necessary\".\n\nHammerFall's 8th album was released on May 18, 2011 (Sweden), May 20 (Europe), and June 7 (North America),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hammerfall.net/releases/albums/infected/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519005628/http://www.hammerfall.net/releases/albums/infected/ |archivedate=2011-05-19 }}</ref> under the name ''[[Infected (Hammerfall album)|Infected]]''. After several months of recordings in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden and Nashville, TN, the new studio album was finally finished in February.

The DVD celebrated 15 years of the band's existence, and was titled \"Gates of Dalhalla\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/HammerFall/Gates_of_Dalhalla/352964|title=HammerFall - Gates of Dalhalla - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|author=|date=|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>\nIn 2013, HammerFall took a break and some time to spend with their families or side-works. Oscar wrote a book about HammerFall, ''Legenden om HammerFall'' (Swedish: \"The Legend of HammerFall),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hammerfall.net/news/legenden-om-hammerfall-is-coming-on-october-24/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231821/http://www.hammerfall.net/news/legenden-om-hammerfall-is-coming-on-october-24/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 }}</ref> that was released on 24 October and tells of the band's events during the past 16 years, but it still exists only in Swedish.\n\n===''(r)Evolution'', ''Built to Last'' and ''Dominion'' (2014\u2013present)===\nHammerFall once again reunited with producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m. The vocals were recorded by James Michael. For the mix, Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m spent 3 weeks in his own Studio.\n\n[[(r)Evolution]] was released on August 29, 2014, and stormed the charts worldwide, debuting on #1 in Sweden and on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart, as well as reaching Top 5 in several other countries. The subsequent tour, dubbed the World Wide (r)Evolution 2014-15, will see HammerFall return to Latin America together with Edguy and Gotthard, followed by a full European assasult in the beginning of 2015. The band was somewhat distraught when drummer Anders Johansson left shortly after the release of (r)Evolution, but David Wallin (Pain) was brought in as a temporary replacement to ensure that the show would go on. Around the same time, it was also decided that Fredrik would be on parental leave from September 2014 through March 2015. Former guitar player Stefan Elmgren stepped in and will handle the 4-string duties during that period, making this line-up a unique experience.

The band was formed in 1993 by ex-[[Ceremonial Oath]] guitarist [[Oscar Dronjak]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early days (1993\u20131996) ===\nHammerFall was formed when rhythm guitarist [[Oscar Dronjak]] quit [[Ceremonial Oath]] and invited [[Jesper Str\u00f6mblad]] (from [[Ceremonial Oath]] and [[In Flames]]) to join him as a drummer in a new musical project he had been contemplating for some time. Dronjak had already composed the song \"Steel Meets Steel,\" which was later included on HammerFall's debut album. Dronjak and Str\u00f6mblad were later joined by lead guitarist [[Niklas Sundin]], bassist [[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]], and vocalist [[Mikael Stanne]]. When Niklas Sundin and Johan Larsson left HammerFall the following year, [[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]] (then guitarist of [[In Flames]]) and Fredrik Larsson (bassist of the former Swedish [[death metal]] band [[Dispatched]]), replaced them.\n\n[[File:Masters of Rock 2007 - Hammerfall - Joacim Cans - 01.jpg|left|thumb|165px|Joacim Cans joined the band in 1996]]\nAll five members played in other bands at the time. Dronjak and Larsson played in ''Crystal Age''; Str\u00f6mblad and Ljungstr\u00f6m played in [[In Flames]] and Stanne sang for [[Dark Tranquillity]]. Both of these bands influenced Swedish [[melodic death metal]]. HammerFall was relegated to being a side project of them all for several years. Their concerts were limited mostly to a local music contest named ''Rockslaget''. The band had few songs of their own and played mostly covers from bands such as [[Pretty Maids]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Alice Cooper]].\n\nIn 1996, HammerFall reached the semi-finals of ''Rockslaget''. When Mikael Stanne could not perform with the band in the semi-finals, they found [[Joacim Cans]], who agreed to play with them for the night. The concert was a success although the judges disqualified HammerFall for the finals. By the end of that day, Joacim had already been made an official member of the band.\n\n===''Glory to the Brave'' and ''Legacy of Kings'' (1997\u20131999)===\nTo give more exposure to their work and try for a professional recording deal, a short live performance was recorded and sent to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] label, Vic Records.[http://www.vicrecords.com/] The musicians soon received a deal and spent the whole of the following year writing the album ''[[Glory to the Brave]]''. The album was initially released in the Netherlands and obtained positive feedback; it is also worthy of notice that the band's [[mascot]], the [[Paladin (character class)|paladin]] Hector, first appeared on the cover of this album.\n\nAs HammerFall grew in popularity, the time available for members of the band to dedicate to other projects became limited. Dronjak and Cans wanted to pursue the path of Hammerfall (Dronjak's Crystal Age had ceased to exist some time ago), but Str\u00f6mblad and Ljungstr\u00f6m were committed to In Flames and Larsson was committed to the [[thrash metal]] band ''None''. Thus, HammerFall's line-up soon underwent changes. [[Stefan Elmgren]] assumed the lead guitar and Patrik R\u00e4fling assumed the drums (they joined the band in the end of 1997 after the release of ''Glory to the Brave'' album) and Larsson decided to remain in the band until a suitable replacement for him was found. This happened in May 1997, when bassist [[Magnus Ros\u00e9n]] joined the band. Stefan Elmgren played some of the guitars on the ''Glory to the Brave'' album (such as the acoustic guitars on \"I Believe\") and Patrik R\u00e4fling actually played the drums on all songs in place of Jesper. However, at the time they were considered as guest performers, not members of the band.\n\n[[File:Jesper Stromblad, IN FLAMES, 2008.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Jesper Str\u00f6mblad left the band in 1997]]\nIn early 1997, German label [[Nuclear Blast]] approached HammerFall with a contract for a European release deal, which included four albums. The deal was accepted and the band proceeded to record their first two [[music video]]s &mdash; \"HammerFall\" and \"Glory to the Brave\". After the release of a promotional single, ''Glory to the Brave'' was released throughout Europe. The results were quite unexpected, even after the intense marketing campaign made by Nuclear Blast. The album reached position number 38 on the German Music Chart on the week of its release, something which had never before been achieved by a debut [[heavy metal music]] album.\n\nSiding with bands [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]], [[Jag Panzer]], [[Lake of Tears]] and [[Raven (band)|Raven]], several tours through the European continent ensued. The concert on [[Wacken Open Air]] was performed to a crowd of over ten thousand people.\n\nTowards the end of 1997, ''Glory to the Brave'' was released in Japan and the United States. Sales of the album reached one hundred thousand copies. HammerFall was also nominated for the Swedish [[Grammy]] award in the ''Best Hard Rock act'' category.\n\nIn February 1998 they did a small club tour (5 gigs) in Belgium and the Netherlands. Support was the Belgian band [[Double Diamond (band)|Double Diamond]], who later became [[Fireforce]]\n\nIn February 1998, the recording of ''[[Legacy of Kings]]'' began. This album was once more written by Joacim, Oscar, and Jesper, who despite having quit the band still took part in the process in order to keep the same general mood of their first release. The album was produced by [[Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m]] (from [[Dream Evil]]) and Oscar, with the help of Joacim. The band spent a total of one and a half months in the studio recording this album.\n\nHammerFall made some expressive concerts before the release of ''Legacy of Kings'', playing in festivals together with bands such as [[Alice Cooper]], [[Rammstein]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Dream Theater]], [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] and [[Stratovarius]].\n\nTheir first world tour took place in October 1998. During the shows in Sweden, Joacim Cans caught a serious throat infection which made it impossible for him to sing. Shortly afterwards, Magnus Ros\u00e9n was afflicted with the same disease, and after him the whole of HammerFall's support crew became sick. The members of the band played for as long as possible and then were forced to postpone or cancel a few dates. During their passage through South America, HammerFall took a short break to visit the [[Brazil]]ian beaches, but they soon resumed their tour.\n\nBy the end of that tour, drummer Patrik R\u00e4fling left the band, and [[Anders Johansson (drummer)|Anders Johansson]], a friend of Magnus Ros\u00e9n, joined as a touring musician. In the beginning of 1999 he was made a permanent member of the band. Anders had previously worked with guitarist [[Yngwie J. Malmsteen|Yngwie Malmsteen]] on [[Rising Force]] in the 80's and 90's and on a number of other projects; he is the brother of [[Jens Johansson]] from [[Stratovarius]]. He has been praised for his technical and polyrhythmical talent, in metal as well as other genres.{{Relevance inline|date=May 2014|reason=So what? Technical and polyrhythmical drumming aren't exactly what HammerFall is famous for. This belongs rather in his own article.}}\n\n===''Renegade'' and ''Crimson Thunder'' (2000\u20132003)===\nAfter a long series of concerts, the band returned to Sweden in order to spend time with their families and begin writing songs for their next album. HammerFall made arrangements for this album to be recorded by Michael Wagener,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelwagener.com/ |title=Michael Wagener.com |publisher=Michael Wagener.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> who had previously produced bands such as [[Accept (band)|Accept]], [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. The recording took eight weeks, and the album was entitled ''[[Renegade (HammerFall album)|Renegade]]''. The switch from producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m to Wagener was met with skepticism from the media in general. However, after the release, critics were mostly positive, even though there was a consensus that the band's sound was remarkably different. A music video by director Roger Johansson was created for the song \"Renegade\" and reached the top of the Swedish parade; the same soon happened with the album itself, which reached gold status with over forty thousand copies sold.\n[[File:Anders Johansson 4.jpg|thumb|Anders Johansson]]\nOscar stated on www.metalrules.com just prior to the release of 'Renegade' that they were going for a more \"commercial\" sound in order to attract a broader audience that otherwise would have been lost to them and that future albums wouldn't follow in this mold.\n\nThe band's second world tour began in January 2001. Concerts from this tour counted with a replica version of the album's cover on stage. It was set up as a [[castle]] in ruins from which the musicians entered the stage. In total, the tour included almost sixty shows.\n\nThe band then released a [[DVD]] entitled ''[[The Templar Renegade Crusades]]'', which included video footage from recording sessions, live concerts, tour backstages, and encounters with fans. The footage ranged from the recording sessions of ''Legacy of Kings'' to the gold album party which took place in November 2001.\n\nHammerFall then proceeded to record their fourth album &mdash; ''[[Crimson Thunder]]''. Arrangements were made for recording sessions to take place in both ''JM Studios'': from [[Charlie Bauerfeind]], in ''[[Wisseloord Studios]]'' &mdash; in the Netherlands, and studio ''Blind Guardian'' &mdash; in Germany, for the bass.\n\nBy the end of the recording sessions in 2002, a listening session for the press was held. Overall, the reactions were quite positive, and most seemed to perceive the album as a change for the better from ''Renegade''. A single for the song \"Hearts on Fire\" was released six weeks prior to the album's launch and remained for weeks on the number one spot on the parades of some European countries. The song also attracted a number of new fans to the band due to its [[refrain|chorus]]-driven melody and simple riffs coupled with fast guitar solos.\n\nThe shooting of the music video  \"Hearts on Fire\" by director Roger Johansson was scheduled for August of that year. The band's plans, however, had to be held back for a week due to an incident that occurred one night. While Joacim was drinking with his girlfriend in a rock club he had been frequenting for over a decade, he was attacked by an unidentified person who hit him in the head with a beer glass and hastily escaped. Joacim instantly lost consciousness and had to be taken to a hospital, in which he underwent [[plastic surgery]] and rested for a couple of days. As soon as it became medically possible, he joined the band to record the music video.\n\nIn order to promote the release of the band's album in North America, they toured with [[Dio (band)|Dio]] during November and December 2002. Subsequently, the manager of the band disappeared, taking the entirety of the tour's revenue with him. Despite this the tour was very successful, and proceeded to Europe. Changes were made to the band's stage setting, and many investments were made on [[fireworks]] and on the presence of the mascot Hector on stage. The scenery on the cover of the single ''Hearts on Fire'' was also reproduced and added to the performances. The tour progressed to Japan and then to South America. HammerFall was present on festivals in Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic, playing with bands such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Slayer]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[U.D.O.]] and [[Stratovarius]].\n\nHammerFall's tour was brought to a sudden end when Oscar Dronjak suffered a [[motorcycle]] accident, breaking his left arm and sustaining several minor injuries.\n\nThey were then left with no choice but to take a break. Stefan dedicated himself to getting a [[aviator|pilot]] license, Magnus and Anders continued working on their side projects and Joacim began work on his solo album and had his first child. Oscar simply focused on recovering. Together with a group of specialists, he was able to recover to his full capacities. He then joined Anders, Joacim, Stefan again, with bands [[Helloween]], [[Gamma Ray (band)|Gamma Ray]] and [[Pretty Maids]], amongst others, and played in the celebration of the 20 years of the German rock club ''Rockfabrik''.\n\n===''Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken'' and ''Threshold'' (2005\u20132008)===\nThe live album and DVD ''One Crimson Night'' was released in February 2003. After two years of hiatus the band released ''[[Chapter V: Unbent, Unbowed, Unbroken]]'', which was followed by a European and South American tour. A video for the song \"Bloodbound\" was made by director Roger Johansson.\n\nOn October 16 it was reported that HammerFall (along with the band [[Europe (band)|Europe]]) would be part of the Eurovision song contest.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/6536 |title=Eurovision Song Contest - Dusseldorf 2011 &#124; News - Melodifestivalen going Heavy Metal? |publisher=Esctoday.com |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref> This rumor was refuted by lead singer Joacim Cans only a couple weeks later.

The reason for his departure stated that he was unhappy in the band and wants to focus on other projects. On his own website (and therefore with his own official statement) it was announced that Magnus was tired of the simple bassplaying he was forced to play in HammerFall, and that he was unable to bring his own material to the band. He now wants to \"be more creative in his career\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magnusrosen.net/news/view.asp?id=50 |title=De beste bron van informatie over magnusrosen.

These are \"Last Man Standing\", \"Restless Soul\", and \"The Abyss\". They also rerecorded the Glory To The Brave track \"HammerFall\". \"[[Steel Meets Steel - Ten Years of Glory]]\" was released on 12 October 2007.\n\nOn April 2, 2008 [[Stefan Elmgren]] announced his decision to leave HammerFall in order to pursue a career as a commercial pilot.  His replacement is [[Pontus Norgren]] from [[The Poodles]]. On June 27, 2008, the band released the compilation album \"[[Masterpieces (HammerFall album)|Masterpieces]]\". The album has on it a collection of every song the band has covered, plus three new cover songs previously unreleased. This was [[Stefan Elmgren]]'s last release with the band.\n\n===''No Sacrifice, No Victory'' and ''Infected'' (2009\u20132012)===\n\nHammerFall's album ''[[No Sacrifice, No Victory]]'' was released in February 2009. This album features a cover song [[My Sharona]]. The Album peaked at No.&nbsp;38 on the Billboard heatseakers charts.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=hammerfall|chart=all}} No Sacrifice, No Victory - HammerFall (2009)]</ref>\nA music video for the song \"Any Means Necessary\" was released some time before the actual release of the album.  To kick off their new album, HammerFall toured all over the world with several support bands, such as fellow Swedish band [[Sabaton (band)|Sabaton]]. In the summer 2010 the band played a couple of high-profile festivals throughout Europe, including [[Sonisphere Festival]], [[High Voltage Festival]], [[Metalcamp]], [[Graspop Metal Meeting]] and many more. The summer tour was named \"Any Festival Necessary\".\n\nHammerFall's 8th album was released on May 18, 2011 (Sweden), May 20 (Europe), and June 7 (North America),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hammerfall.net/releases/albums/infected/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519005628/http://www.hammerfall.net/releases/albums/infected/ |archivedate=2011-05-19 }}</ref> under the name ''[[Infected (Hammerfall album)|Infected]]''. After several months of recordings in G\u00f6teborg, Sweden and Nashville, TN, the new studio album was finally finished in February. The European tour followed, under the name \"European Outbreak\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hammerfall.net/news/european-outbreak-2011/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203030327/http://www.hammerfall.net/news/european-outbreak-2011/ |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}</ref> ''Infected'' is also the first HammerFall album not to feature the mascot, the knight Hector, on the cover.\n\nIn 2012, Hammerfall recorded a live DVD while performing a show in Dalhalla, Sweden, that featured some former band members as well as other special guests. The DVD celebrated 15 years of the band's existence, and was titled \"Gates of Dalhalla\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/HammerFall/Gates_of_Dalhalla/352964|title=HammerFall - Gates of Dalhalla - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|author=|date=|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>\nIn 2013, HammerFall took a break and some time to spend with their families or side-works. Oscar wrote a book about HammerFall, ''Legenden om HammerFall'' (Swedish: \"The Legend of HammerFall),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hammerfall.net/news/legenden-om-hammerfall-is-coming-on-october-24/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202231821/http://www.hammerfall.net/news/legenden-om-hammerfall-is-coming-on-october-24/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 }}</ref> that was released on 24 October and tells of the band's events during the past 16 years, but it still exists only in Swedish.\n\n===''(r)Evolution'', ''Built to Last'' and ''Dominion'' (2014\u2013present)===\nHammerFall once again reunited with producer Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m. The vocals were recorded by James Michael. For the mix, Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m spent 3 weeks in his own Studio.\n\n[[(r)Evolution]] was released on August 29, 2014, and stormed the charts worldwide, debuting on #1 in Sweden and on the Billboard Heatseekers Chart, as well as reaching Top 5 in several other countries. The subsequent tour, dubbed the World Wide (r)Evolution 2014-15, will see HammerFall return to Latin America together with Edguy and Gotthard, followed by a full European assasult in the beginning of 2015. The band was somewhat distraught when drummer Anders Johansson left shortly after the release of (r)Evolution, but David Wallin (Pain) was brought in as a temporary replacement to ensure that the show would go on. Around the same time, it was also decided that Fredrik would be on parental leave from September 2014 through March 2015. Former guitar player Stefan Elmgren stepped in and will handle the 4-string duties during that period, making this line-up a unique experience. Currently, the band is in the midst of a wildly successful European tour, with 7 sold out shows already and more most likely coming.\n\nIn March 2016, the band announced that they had signed with Napalm Records. Their tenth studio album, ''[[Built to Last (Hammerfall album)|Built to Last]]'', was released on November 4, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/hammerfall-signs-with-napalm-records-new-album-due-in-november/|title=HAMMERFALL Signs With NAPALM RECORDS; New Album Due In November|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=March 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn December 16, 2016, David Wallin resigned from the band to focus on his family, and the same day the band introduced their new drummer Johan Koleberg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/hammerfall-parts-ways-with-drummer-david-wallin-announces-replacement/|title=HAMMERFALL Parts Ways With Drummer DAVID WALLIN, Announces Replacement|author=|date=16 December 2016|website=blabbermouth.net|accessdate=13 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn September 2, 2017, it was announced that David Wallin's family related issues had been resolved and that he was reinstated into the band.\n\nOn December 18, 2018, HammerFall announced their eleventh studio album ''[[Dominion (HammerFall album)|Dominion]]''.
