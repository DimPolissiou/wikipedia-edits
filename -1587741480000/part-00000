Hercules discovers these \"creatures\" are really the women of the village who have split with their chauvinistic men and aligned themselves with [[Hera]].\n\n==Plot==\nThree men are walking through the woods, they hear strange noises and catch glimpses of something moving in the undergrowth. Suddenly they are attacked by unseen creatures. Two men are killed, but one escapes and flees the woods.\n\n[[Hercules]] strolls into a village after returning from one of his adventures, and is greeted by [[Iolaus]]. It is established that Iolaus is getting married and that Hercules is the best man. The two men set off for [[Alcmene]]'s house. While walking through the woods, they reminisce that it has been a long time since they last saw each other. Iolaus tells Hercules about his bride-to-be, Ania. They stumble upon a little girl crying alone near an [[altar]]. She tells them that a monster killed her father while they were placing an offering to the goddess. Hercules tries to comfort the girl and asks if he can help, but the girl transforms into a monster. Hercules chops off its head, and thinking it is now dead, he and Iolaus begin walking away. They hear a noise and turn around to see that the monster is not dead, and has now grown two new heads in the place where the previous one was. The monster is a [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]. Hercules tells Iolaus to grab the torch from the altar, Hercules cuts off the heads and burns the Hydra, preventing it from growing new heads, thus killing it. After the Hydra is destroyed a [[peacock]] feather remains in its place, and Hercules tells Iolaus that [[Hera]] is responsible for the Hydra.\n\nHercules and Iolaus finally reach his mother's house. Iolaus invites them both for dinner, then leaves. While the four are enjoying dinner, Ania glimpses a man outside the window and Hercules goes to investigate. It is the [[Gargareans|Gargarean]] Pithus, the man who escaped the creatures at the beginning of the film. He explains to Hercules about his village being attacked by creatures and Hercules agrees to help. Iolaus persuades Hercules to let him go along for one last adventure before he is married, Hercules reluctantly relents and says that he can come along. The three men set off for the village. When they arrive Hercules asks where all the women are, Pithus tells him that they were stolen by the creatures in the forest. Hercules and Iolaus head off to find the beasts and rescue the village's women. In the forest they are ambushed by the beasts, managing to stave off the attack for a time until Iolaus discovers that the beasts are really women. He chases after one but is fatally injured in the fight, and dies in Hercules' arms. Hercules is then surrounded by several of the 'beasts'. Two of them approach him with spears. One of the 'creatures' cries out and says \"No Stop!\", and then raises her mask. It happens to be a woman, who then says \"The queen will want to kill him\". Hercules is in utter shock to discover the true nature of the 'beasts'.\n\nHercules is then seen being taken captive by the women, bound in chains and gagged with a black leather strap. He is surrounded by the \"Amazon Women Warriors\" and led through the village full of women. An older woman offers to buy Hercules and several taunt him along the way to see the queen. When he arrives Hippolyta tells him that she knows he is here to defeat them. Hercules tells her she is wrong. Using a magic candle, Hippolyta turns Hercules into a baby telling him she will show him what he is really like. As Hercules reverts to infant form we are shown [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s to Hercules's youth and times when he has been told by people how to behave toward women. Later he returns to adult state, realizing that Hippolyta is right and that his attitude toward women is wrong, he tells her that he can change. She says that he cannot change and that all men are the same. Hippolyta goes to consult with Hera, she tells Hippolyta to lead an attack on the village.\n\nHercules escapes from the Amazons and warns the men of the village of the forthcoming attack. He prepares them for when the women arrive. The women ride into the village and order the men to remove their clothes, telling them they are here for only one thing. The men tell the women to sit and talk with them for a while. Pithus's wife enters her home, and her son Franco asks if she really is his mother. He tells her he often dreams about her but she has no face, she removes her mask and shows her face to Franco. Hercules stands up to Hippolyta, who says she's not afraid of Hercules. He kisses her, she tells him she's not afraid and kisses him back. The two make love. The following day the women are still with the men. The Amazons return to their city and both men and women reminisce about the night before. Hera tells Hippolyta that Hercules has tricked her and orders her to attack the village again, this time killing all the men and boys. Hippolyta refuses but Hera [[Spiritual possession|possesses]] her. Hera, now in control of Hippolyta's actions, orders the women to attack the village.\n\nHercules stops Hippolyta and realizes that she is possessed by Hera. She rides off and Hercules goes after her. As they fight Hercules tries to get through to Hippolyta, telling her that she is stronger than Hera. Hercules bests her and is about to deal the fatal blow, but cannot because it is Hippolyta's body and not really Hera. Hercules leaves and Hera follows him, goading him. He tells Hera that if he or Hippolyta have to die then he will give up his life for her, saying he couldn't live his life without her. Upon hearing this Hera runs Hippolyta's body over the edge of a waterfall, killing her.\n\nHercules returns to the City of Amazons and retrieves the candle Hippolyta used to send him back to his childhood. [[Zeus]] appears and tells him the candle doesn't work in the way Hercules wants it to. Hercules replies that Zeus could make it work that way. Zeus tells Hercules that if he did that he would be in big trouble with Hera, but Hercules persuades him anyway. Zeus blows out the candle and Hercules is taken back to the night of the dinner. Ania sees Pithus outside the window and Hercules goes to tell him that the village doesn't need the help of Hercules. He explains that all the men need to do is treat the women with respect and things will sort themselves out. Pithus returns to the village and when the women come the men sort out the problems that have been occurring. Alcmene asks Hercules if there is a woman out there who will make him happy like Ania did for Iolaus, Hercules replies that he is sure there is.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Kevin Sorbo]] as [[Hercules]]\n*[[Anthony Quinn]] as [[Zeus]]\n*[[Roma Downey]] as [[Hippolyta]] \n*[[Michael Hurst]] as [[Iolaus]]\n*Lloyd Scott as Pithus\n*[[Lucy Lawless]] as Lysia\n*Christopher Brougham as Lethan\n*[[Jennifer Ludlam]] as [[Alcmene]]\n*[[Rose McIver]] as Girl ([[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]])\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=0110015}}\n*{{tv.com episode|hercules-the-legendary-journeys/hercules-and-the-amazon-women-110629|Hercules and the Amazon Women}}\n\n{{xenaverse}}\n{{Bill L.

Hercules discovers these \"creatures\" are really the women of the village who have split with their chauvinistic men and aligned themselves with [[Hera]].\n\n==Plot==\nThree men are walking through the woods, they hear strange noises and catch glimpses of something moving in the undergrowth. Suddenly they are attacked by unseen creatures. Two men are killed, but one escapes and flees the woods.\n\n[[Hercules]] strolls into a village after returning from one of his adventures, and is greeted by [[Iolaus]]. It is established that Iolaus is getting married and that Hercules is the best man. The two men set off for [[Alcmene]]'s house. While walking through the woods, they reminisce that it has been a long time since they last saw each other. Iolaus tells Hercules about his bride-to-be, Ania. They stumble upon a little girl crying alone near an [[altar]]. She tells them that a monster killed her father while they were placing an offering to the goddess. Hercules tries to comfort the girl and asks if he can help, but the girl transforms into a monster. Hercules chops off its head, and thinking it is now dead, he and Iolaus begin walking away. They hear a noise and turn around to see that the monster is not dead, and has now grown two new heads in the place where the previous one was. The monster is a [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]. Hercules tells Iolaus to grab the torch from the altar, Hercules cuts off the heads and burns the Hydra, preventing it from growing new heads, thus killing it. After the Hydra is destroyed a [[peacock]] feather remains in its place, and Hercules tells Iolaus that [[Hera]] is responsible for the Hydra.\n\nHercules and Iolaus finally reach his mother's house. Iolaus invites them both for dinner, then leaves. While the four are enjoying dinner, Ania glimpses a man outside the window and Hercules goes to investigate. It is the [[Gargareans|Gargarean]] Pithus, the man who escaped the creatures at the beginning of the film. He explains to Hercules about his village being attacked by creatures and Hercules agrees to help. Iolaus persuades Hercules to let him go along for one last adventure before he is married, Hercules reluctantly relents and says that he can come along. The three men set off for the village. When they arrive Hercules asks where all the women are, Pithus tells him that they were stolen by the creatures in the forest. Hercules and Iolaus head off to find the beasts and rescue the village's women. In the forest they are ambushed by the beasts, managing to stave off the attack for a time until Iolaus discovers that the beasts are really women. He chases after one but is fatally injured in the fight, and dies in Hercules' arms. Hercules is then surrounded by several of the 'beasts'. Two of them approach him with spears. One of the 'creatures' cries out and says \"No Stop!\", and then raises her mask. It happens to be a woman, who then says \"The queen will want to kill him\". Hercules is in utter shock to discover the true nature of the 'beasts'.\n\nHercules is then seen being taken captive by the women, bound in chains and gagged with a black leather strap. He is surrounded by the \"Amazon Women Warriors\" and led through the village full of women. An older woman offers to buy Hercules and several taunt him along the way to see the queen. When he arrives Hippolyta tells him that she knows he is here to defeat them. Hercules tells her she is wrong. Using a magic candle, Hippolyta turns Hercules into a baby telling him she will show him what he is really like. As Hercules reverts to infant form we are shown [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s to Hercules's youth and times when he has been told by people how to behave toward women. Later he returns to adult state, realizing that Hippolyta is right and that his attitude toward women is wrong, he tells her that he can change. She says that he cannot change and that all men are the same. Hippolyta goes to consult with Hera, she tells Hippolyta to lead an attack on the village.\n\nHercules escapes from the Amazons and warns the men of the village of the forthcoming attack. He prepares them for when the women arrive. The women ride into the village and order the men to remove their clothes, telling them they are here for only one thing. The men tell the women to sit and talk with them for a while. Pithus's wife enters her home, and her son Franco asks if she really is his mother. He tells her he often dreams about her but she has no face, she removes her mask and shows her face to Franco. Hercules stands up to Hippolyta, who says she's not afraid of Hercules. He kisses her, she tells him she's not afraid and kisses him back. The two make love. The following day the women are still with the men. The Amazons return to their city and both men and women reminisce about the night before. Hera tells Hippolyta that Hercules has tricked her and orders her to attack the village again, this time killing all the men and boys. Hippolyta refuses but Hera [[Spiritual possession|possesses]] her. Hera, now in control of Hippolyta's actions, orders the women to attack the village.\n\nHercules stops Hippolyta and realizes that she is possessed by Hera. She rides off and Hercules goes after her. As they fight Hercules tries to get through to Hippolyta, telling her that she is stronger than Hera. Hercules bests her and is about to deal the fatal blow, but cannot because it is Hippolyta's body and not really Hera. Hercules leaves and Hera follows him, goading him. He tells Hera that if he or Hippolyta have to die then he will give up his life for her, saying he couldn't live his life without her. Upon hearing this Hera runs Hippolyta's body over the edge of a waterfall, killing her.\n\nHercules returns to the City of Amazons and retrieves the candle Hippolyta used to send him back to his childhood. [[Zeus]] appears and tells him the candle doesn't work in the way Hercules wants it to. Hercules replies that Zeus could make it work that way. Zeus tells Hercules that if he did that he would be in big trouble with Hera, but Hercules persuades him anyway. Zeus blows out the candle and Hercules is taken back to the night of the dinner. Ania sees Pithus outside the window and Hercules goes to tell him that the village doesn't need the help of Hercules. He explains that all the men need to do is treat the women with respect and things will sort themselves out. Pithus returns to the village and when the women come the men sort out the problems that have been occurring.

This episode first aired in the [[United States]] on Sunday, August 5, 2007.\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nJemaine has his eye on a woman that works at the bakery.  He wants Bret to go in the shop with him but Bret is reluctant because he doesn't like [[croissant]]s.  Eventually Jemaine convinces him to be his '[[Wingman (social)|wingman]]'.  While speaking to the woman and her colleague, Jemaine tries speaking a bit of [[French language|French]] and they launch into a 1960s French style music video singing ''\"Foux Du Fafa\"''.\n\nLater, on a double date at a nightclub, Jemaine is having trouble getting Lisa, the woman he liked at the croissant shop, interested in him.  He convinces Bret to swap partners, but has no better luck with Felicia.  Meanwhile Bret is uncomfortable with Lisa's aggressive advances.\n\nAt a band meeting Jemaine tells Murray about their new 'girlfriends'.  At first a concerned Murray tells them that he thinks bands shouldn't have girlfriends, citing [[Wham!]] as an example of a successful band that followed that principle.  But then he interrogates the guys for the juicy details.  He then tells them that he has some good news.  He has met A.J. Jones, supposedly the brother of [[Quincy Jones]], who has sold him a high-end stereo system for $50.\n\nBack at the apartment, Bret finds a message from Lisa on the answerphone.  At first he is reluctant to go out with her again, but Jemaine and Eugene convince him to go.  Eugene suggests that he show less skin.\n\nMurray meets with A.J. to pick up the stereo.  The very dodgy-looking A.J. is clearly no relation to Quincy Jones, but Murray is oblivious to the clues.  Murray asks A.J. if he can arrange a meeting with Quincy to play him a demo of the band.  After hearing the track A.J. offers to use his contacts to get some CDs made and Murray eagerly accepts the offer.\n\nOn another double date, Lisa aggressively comes onto Bret once again while Jemaine tries awkwardly to make headway with a clearly uninterested Felicia.  When Bret tries to leave, Lisa goes with him and invites herself up to the apartment.  Lisa demands sex, but Bret refuses.  Another music video begins, and Bret sings ''\"A Kiss Is Not A Contract\"''.\n\nThe next morning Jemaine queries Bret as to how he managed to get Lisa wanting sex from him.  Bret tells him that all he did was say he didn't want it.  Meanwhile Murray has received the new CDs from A.J. and sets up a street stall to sell them.  The only person who buys one however is an excited Mel.\n\nBret and Jemaine visit Dave for some advice.  Bret wants to know how to deal with Lisa.  Dave tells him it is his duty to give in to her demands.\n\nOn their next date, Lisa tells Bret that she is a [[Delta Force]] [[sniper]] and that she is being deployed to Iraq the next day.  She successfully convinces him that the least he can do is sleep with her on her last night before going to war.  The sex that results leaves Bret feeling violated.  Elsewhere Jemaine tries out Bret's technique on Felicia, telling her that he doesn't want to have sex.  However it backfires when she agrees that she doesn't want to sleep with him either.\n\nMurray reports to the band on his disappointing sales.  When they examine the boxes of CDs, they discover that A.J. has cheated them: all but one are filled with sawdust.  Later Bret and Jemaine see Lisa back working at the bakery.  When Bret questions her, she dumps him.  There is some good news however.  Murray has found a way to recoup some of the money they lost on the CD deal.  He sells them to Dave, who plans to delete the music tracks and resell them as blank CDs.\n\n==Songs==\nThe following songs are featured in this episode:\n\n=== \"Foux Du Fafa\" ===\n\n\"Foux Du Fafa\"<ref name=\"subpopalbum\">[http://www.subpop.com/releases/flight_of_the_conchords/full_lengths/flight_of_the_conchords Flight Of The Conchords album] [[Sub Pop]] website</ref> (a.k.a.

It provides education in the fields of [[Engineering]], [[Management]], [[Pharmacy]], [[Architecture]], [[Health Science]]. The society also runs many schools. STES was founded by Prof. M. N. Navale in 1993 in response to the increasing education criteria in rapidly growing industry after the Open business strategy policy of Indian government.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Real estate office.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Estate Office of Vadgaon Bk Campus]]\nSTES was set up in August 1993 by Prof. M. N. Navale. It began with the formation of Sou. Venutai Chavan Polytechnic Institute in the field of Engineering, offering 3-year full-time Diploma courses in [[Engineering]], recognized by the Government of [[Maharashtra]] and approved by the All India Council for Technical Education ([[AICTE]]), [[New Delhi]]. From then on, STES has been continually expanding. \n  \nIn 1994-95, the Post Graduation MBA course of [[Pune University]] was started with just 90 students. And today, there are 3000 students taking benefit of this course in various institutes under STES.  \n  \nIn 1996-97, the [[Engineering]] College was established by STES, offering 4-year full-time Degree courses in the fields of Mechanical, Production, Chemical, Civil, Information Technology, Computer Engineering and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering. The college is affiliated to the [[Pune University]]. In the same year, a 3-year full-time Masters in Computer Applications (MCA) course was started. 60 students are currently admitted to this course. \n  \nIn 1998-1999, the Sinhgad Institute of Management started the 2-year full-time Masters in Personnel Management (MPM) and 2-year full-time Masters in Computer Management (MCM) courses, and at present, the intake is 60 and 120 students respectively. \n  \nIn 2000-2001, the Smt. Kashibai Navale College of Engineering was started for girls. It conducts Degree courses in the fields of Information Technology, Computer Engineering, and Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering.
