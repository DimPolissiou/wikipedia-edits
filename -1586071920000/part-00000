He also had a music room with silver and gold albums awarded from all over the world on the walls.\n\n==Bands==\nBy the age of 19 (1965), Tucker had embarked on a career in pop music, playing around pubs and clubs in a band called Wainwright's Gentlemen and was later joined by vocalist [[Brian Connolly]] playing a mixture of R&B, Motown, and early psychedelic sounds. The band split in 1968. There are a number of recordings in existence including a cover of The Coasters/The Hollies hit \"Ain't That Just Like Me\", which was officially released in February 2011 on a compilation CD \"Rare Mod, Volume 3\" on the Acid Jazz label (AJXCD 238). The track features Tucker on drums and, according to band bassist Jan Frewer, is thought to have been recorded in 1965.\n\nHe was a founding member of the band Sweetshop in January 1968 along with [[Steve Priest]], Brian Connolly, and Frank Torpey (born 30 April 1947, Kilburn, North West London), who was later replaced by Mick Stewart, who was himself succeeded by [[Andy Scott (guitarist)|Andy Scott]]. \"Sweetshop\" was shortened to \"The Sweet\" in 1968.\n\n==Drumming style==\nAs a boy, his first interest was drawing art. By fourteen he had changed his interest to the drums, influenced by [[Sandy Nelson]], [[Buddy Rich]], and [[Gene Krupa]]. Tucker's father offered him a drum kit but only if he would take drumming seriously. Hubert Tucker encouraged his son, even getting him his first gig, sitting in for [[Brian Bennett]] of legendary British beat group [[the Shadows]] at a local workingman's club. \"He did well,\" says Tucker's wife, Janet, \"If he had known who he was replacing, he would have been so scared!\"\n\nA self-taught drummer, Tucker excelled, and by age eighteen he was playing in the band Wainwright's Gentlemen. When Tucker was fired in January 1968 for being \"too flamboyant\", singer Brian Connolly said \"I am leaving as well.\" The two looked for new band-mates, and the band Sweetshop was soon formed.\n\nAccording to Steve Priest's 1994 autobiography, ''Are You Ready, Steve?'', Tucker offered his feedback while recording \"[[The Six Teens (song)|The Six Teens]],\" and songwriter/producer [[Mike Chapman]] said, \"We don't f**king need you anyway, Mick!\" Tucker ended the argument by saying, \"If you don't need us, why don't you just put that tape player on 'record' and erase the whole track?\" He was serious when it came to making music, and he stood up for his band's integrity when necessary.<ref name=\"readperiodicals.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.readperiodicals.com/201210/2744547761.html |title=MICK TUCKER - It's entirely appropriate that Sweet's drummer played the theme to the film The Man With the Golden... - Modern Drummer : MD |website=Readperiodicals.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Ames |first=Denise |url=http://tolucantimes.info/one-on-one/one-on-one-with-sweets-steve-priest/ |title=One-on-One with Sweet\u2019s Steve Priest |website=Tolucantimes.info |date=2014-06-05 |accessdate=2016-01-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160224104440/http://tolucantimes.info/one-on-one/one-on-one-with-sweets-steve-priest/ |archivedate=24 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nTucker was a  talented drummer with a range of complex rhythms who could have helped any band considerably.

The twirl of his sticks were as much a trademark as the drum kit itself. Tucker used a five piece Ludwig while on tour in [[Belgium]]. After the tour ended, he added the set to the existing Ludwig four piece set he already had. He then re-wrapped them all in chrome. The Ludwig set contained:\n* 2 \u2013 14\u2033\u00d722\u201d bass drums\n* 1 \u2013 Speed king 201 bass drum pedals\n* 1 \u2013 12\u2033x8\u2033 tom-tom \n* 1 \u2013 set of two 13\u2033x9\u2033 tom\u2013toms \n* 1 \u2013 set of Two 16\u2033x16\u2033 floor toms\n* 1 \u2013 14\u2033 Supraphonic snare drum \n* His cymbal stands were the Ludwig Hercules stands (that were specially manufactured for Tucker by Ludwig).\n\nCymbals [[Paiste]] (Formula 602):\n* 1 \u2013 Dark hi-hat (14\")\n* 1 \u2013 Mellow Ride (20\")\n* 1 \u2013 set of 2 Dark Crash (18\", 20\") \n* 1 \u2013 Short Crash (18\")\n\nThe [[drum stick]]s he used from the early 80\u2032s were the [[Pro-Mark|Promark]] American Hickory 419.

He began and ended his drum solos with his rendition of [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s theme from the 1955 film ''[[The Man With the Golden Arm]]''.\n\nTucker also used two projection screens that were above his drum riser. One screen played a video of him playing the drums, and simultaneously the other video showed him playing [[Timbales|timpani]]. He  would trade off solos with these videos, then come out front and play the timpani along with a fast Christmas-style recording. Just before the band would come back, he would play the Bernstein melody on [[tubular bells]] and timpani. Tucker tried to make sure his solos appealed to all of the audience. Tucker understood that a great performance consisted of great playing technique and presentation in equal doses.<ref name=\"readperiodicals.com\"/>\n\nTucker said of his band Sweet, \"At gigs, Andy would mince onstage swinging a handbag and call himself Andre.
